It's the big, new, ancient thing \u2014 thousands of years old, but recently super popular again, thanks to digital trendsetters such as Pinterest and Facebook.\n\nHold on. Deep breath. Not. Going. To. Heave. I can do this.\n\nOil pulling has been all over my Facebook wall for months now: promises of everything from whiter teeth to help with allergies to relief of chronic pain. I read somewhere it could treat cancer and AIDS. I was in open-minded awe \u2014 until I read claims that it could improve digestive issues.\n\nBecause it's currently causing me new ones.\n\nIn fact, if you have a sensitive stomach, now is where I tell you to run. Run far away from the rest of this harrowing tale. Chances are, you'd never try oil pulling to begin with, anyway.\n\nMaybe I need to last the full length of time, rise mind over nausea and gargle this oil for the recommended 20 minutes.\n\nWhen my husband said he'd be working late one night, I realized I had my window; if he ever caught me doing something like this, I'd never be kissed again. Even more, I'd never stand a chance of succeeding in his presence.\n\nYou see, my husband and I both have overactive gag reflexes, to the degree that it's a contributing factor to why we never plan on having more children. You try changing a molten diaper while being simultaneously trapped in an uncontrollable duet of dry-heaving \"huuuu-hhhs,\" each one setting up the next like diaphragm dominoes. Just the memory is pushing me closer to sharing my coconut spit with the keyboard.\n\nSpeaking of, the longer you keep this oil in your mouth, the more liquid your mouth produces and the harder it is to keep it in. My cheeks are inflated like a squirrel. Every minute is worse than the last.\n\nMust. Distract. Self.\n\nI'm committed. I've made it this long: 11 minutes. Eleven long, slobbery minutes. I'm not giving up now.\n\nI've played a game like this before, but it was a dare and I was 9, playing with the older neighbor kids.\n\nThis time, though, I was a sober, educated adult, during my rare free time after my kid goes to bed, by my own free will, and based solely on a Facebook forward that I totally didn't research first. Nope. Just decided to jump right in. Just marched right on downstairs during my window of opportunity \u2014 because you don't want to miss a chance like this, no sir \u2014 and scooped a spoonful of thick, white coconut glop into my mouth.\n\nAnd then instantly spat it out onto the counter and stared at it in confusion.\n\nI pushed it into the sink and rallied. I scooped another half-spoonful. Hesitated before closing my lips around it, and then shoved it right in.\n\nPlop. My reflexes betrayed me again, as my tongue refused to participate in this game.\n\nNo, mouth, we're doing this. This time, I filled only a tiny, wee portion of the teaspoon and took it like a shot of cheap tequila. Almost swallowed, which ignited the gag reflexes again. I tried to take a deep breath, but my nose was partially clogged. My lips parted and my slimy punishment tried to break free again. Stay! I squeaked a congested breath through my nostrils and began immediately distracting myself.\n\nI decided to put on a face mask.\n\nKnow what you can't do while gargling a mouthful of fat wad? Lean your face over the sink and wash your face. The motion swished the slop around in my mouth, and my lips engaged in tug-of-war with my will to to keep them shut.\n\nNow I could barely breathe. I grabbed a Kleenix to blow my nose, but you know what else is tricky without the ability to mouth-breathe? Blowing your nose properly.\n\nTo the Interwebs, the great distractor.\n\nAfter the damage is already more than halfway done, now seems like the perfect time to do some research on this tactic.\n\nI immediately find my go-to local source for all things Ayurveda: John Douillard's LifeSpa.\n\nThe theory behind oil pulling: The oils pull toxins from the skin by attracting other oils, including those within the fatty layers of our skin that hold fat-soluble toxins. The spa cites studies that suggest that \"oil acting as a pulling agent for toxins is well documented\" and reports it's \"very plausible\" that the oils might be detoxifying.\n\nThe spa also recommends \"herbalizing\" the oil with turmeric. Oops, forgot that.\n\nAnother website: Best done in the morning on an empty stomach. One to two teaspoons full? It's bedtime, and I had a massive dinner. And I had maybe only a quarter of a teaspoon, with generous exaggeration.\n\nAfter all this, I've done it all wrong.\n\nEighteen minutes and I'm sitting here with a mouth of lukewarm, fatty spit and am unlikely going to reap any of the benefits from it.\n\nThen I stumble upon an article by Discovery.com.\n\nIt says there are only a few medical studies of oil pulling and none particularly convincing of a consistent benefit for \"any particular condition.\" The verdict: Oil pulling probably doesn't do anything.\n\nJohn Douillard's LifeSpa hammers it home for me: \" ... more studies need to be done on the oil pulling technique ...\"\n\nNineteen minutes. And it's on my desk in a sad pile of failure.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Aimee Heckel at 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/aimeemay.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_26215572/oil-pulling-all-rage-facebook-ayurvedic-practitioners", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26215572:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-27T21:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "I'm sitting here trying not to gag on a mouth completely full of coconut oil diluted with saliva.
