David Vitter, for the Louisiana governor\u2019s post.\n\nSo? I\u2019d like it fine \u2013 and Democrats would probably do better \u2013 if all their candidates were military vets who were pro-life and pro-gun.\n\n\u2022 An Oct. 9 Reuters-Ipsos poll found that \u201cMore than half (58 percent) of Americans don\u2019t identify with what America has become. Almost as many (53 percent) feel like a \u2018stranger in their own country.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnyone wondering why \u201coutsider\u201d candidates are leading \u201cestablishment\u201d hopefuls for the Republican nomination can find the beginnings of an answer here.\n\nAnd a Nov. 22 Fox/Opinion Dynamics poll of registered voters shows Americans now rank \u201cterrorism\u201d ahead of \u201cthe economy\u201d as their principal concern, while awarding President Obama a 40 percent approval rating, near his historic low of 38 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, 66 percent think \u201cwe are at war with radical Islam\u201d and 63 percent think the war is \u201cgoing badly.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t fault their perceptivity. After all, their president said Nov. 16 that he wasn\u2019t interested in \u201cpursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning (such a war).\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why, as a Pew Research survey just noted, the number of Americans saying they trust their government to do what is right \u201cjust about always\u201d or \u201cmost of the time\u201d tops out at a whopping 19 percent.\n\nWho knew it was that high?\n\n\u2022 Finally, a demonstrator at the weekly protest outside Portland\u2019s Planned Parenthood facility has been charged with violating a law that forbids disturbing people receiving medical treatment.\n\nOddly, demands by other states that abortion facilities meet the same medical requirements that all other clinics must obey have been met with fierce resistance from abortion supporters.\n\nPerhaps agencies such as Portland\u2019s are only medical facilities when there are vocal protesters outside?\n\nEven stranger, though, is that we live in a society where shouting outside such a facility can be illegal, but ending the lives of innocent babies inside it is not.\n\nM.D. Harmon, a retired journalist and military officer, is a freelance writer and speaker.
