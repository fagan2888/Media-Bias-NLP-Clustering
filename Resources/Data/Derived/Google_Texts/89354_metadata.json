Justices are also considering if tips should be part of that calculation.\n\nMore than a dozen lawsuits claim the policies made available by employers such as fast-food restaurants are of such low quality that they are basically worthless.\n\nLast year Carson City District Judge James Wilson ruled the regulations were invalid, but his decision was put on hold pending appeal to the state\u2019s highest court.\n\nArguments on Monday focused on the word \u201cprovide.\u201d Does it mean an employer simply has to \u201coffer\u201d insurance to pay the lower minimum wage, as asserted by the restaurant industry? Or does a worker have to actually accept enrollment for coverage before the employer qualifies to pay the lower hourly rate?\n\nRick Roskelley, arguing on behalf of several employers including Briad Restaurant Group, Wendy\u2019s and Cedar Enterprises, said the word means to \u201cmake available.\u201d\n\n\u201cProvide does not in and of itself require an inherent act of acceptance,\u201d Roskelley said, saying the term means \u201cto make available.\u201d\n\nBut Bradley Schrager, representing low-wage workers, countered that just offering insurance defeats the intent of the law, which was to encourage employers to provide insurance for workers.\n\nHe described his clients as \u201cthe poorest workers amongst us\u201d who are \u201cgiving up a dollar\u201d in pay each hour.\n\n\u201cWe say the bargain is fairly straightforward. If you take the dollar, I get the insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe labor commissioner\u2019s regulations, he said, create a \u201cwindfall\u201d for the employer.\n\nOn the issue of tips, Schrager argued they should not be included because they do not come from an employer but a customer.\n\n\u201cNo one is arguing tips are not income to the employee,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they are not is income from the employer.\u201d\n\nSenior Deputy District Attorney Scott Davis said regulations imposed by the labor commissioner set gross taxable income as reported to the IRS, which includes tips, as the index for determining the 10 percent cap an employee can be required to pay toward premiums.\n\nJustices took the arguments under consideration and will rule at a later date.\n\nContact Sandra Chereb at schereb@reviewjournal.com or 775-461-3821.
