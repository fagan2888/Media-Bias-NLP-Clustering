Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” discounts that most Trump supporters and tea party members have it pretty good, Bill Maher said on Friday night’s “Real Time.”

“Someone must remind white Americans that even though other people are winning small victories and making slight gains, you’re not losing. You’re still way, way ahead,” Maher said. He went on to cite the statistic that prior to the recession in 2007, white Americans had four times the wealth of African Americans and Latinos. “But since the recession, that’s gone up! Now they have six times as much! So, if anyone should be bitching about wanting their country back, it ain’t you!”

Maher went on to quote a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences which said the death rate for non-college white Americans aged 45-54 is on the rise. “Middle-aged American whites are dropping like flies,” Maher said before Jay Leno pretended to collapse next to him to audience laughter. But what is killing the old guard? Drugs, alcohol, suicide and “possibly trying to fit into skinny jeans” the report finds (excluding that last bit).
