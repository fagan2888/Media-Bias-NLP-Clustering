HCA continues to expand into urgent care, closing a deal in Nevada that broadens the company's Las Vegas operations.HCA, Nashville, announced Monday it acquired 14 urgent-care centers from Urgent Care Extra and six centers under development. The deal increases the number of HCA's centers to 65, including two dozen in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, according to an announcement.Urgent care is attracting investment from hospital operators as a way to hold down the cost of care and increase access. Some have done so through joint ventures.The newly acquired urgent-care centers will join HCA's four-hospital Sunrise Health System, which also includes four surgery centers, the company said in a news release announcing the deal.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.“This acquisition adds a strong network of leading urgent-care centers to our Las Vegas network and complements our presence in the market,” Sam Hazen, HCA's chief operating officer, said in the release. “Additionally, the acquisition builds on HCA's strategy to improve patient access to our healthcare system in the markets we serve.”HCA reported lower net income in third-quarter earnings released last week, as labor costs climbed with rising patient volume. The company also reported an increase in the number of uninsured, notably in states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
