Jerry Brown must sign the legislation, which has already passed the state Assembly. His spokesman said last week that the governor generally does not comment on pending legislation.\n\nOnly Hawaii has adopted the higher age limit statewide, although dozens of cities, including New York and San Francisco, have passed their own laws.\n\nNew Regulations on E-Cigarettes\n\nThe package of anti-tobacco bills would also restrict electronic cigarettes, which are increasingly popular and not regulated by the federal government.\n\nThe higher age limit won approval despite intense lobbying from tobacco interests and fierce opposition from many Republicans, who said the state should butt out of people\u2019s personal health decisions, even if they are harmful.\n\nThe six bills, which passed both houses, represented California\u2019s most substantial anti-tobacco effort in nearly two decades, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\n\u201cWith California having such a huge population, it\u2019s going to be very impactful nationwide,\u201d said Cathy Callaway, associate director of state and local campaigns for the society.\n\nAdvocates noted that the vast majority of smokers start before they are 18, according to data from the U.S. surgeon general. Making it illegal for 18-year-old high school students to buy tobacco for their underage friends will make it more difficult for teens to get the products, they said.\n\nOpponents said 18-year-olds are trusted to make important decisions such as how to vote or whether to join the military. In response, Democrats changed the bill to allow members of the military to continue buying cigarettes at 18.\n\n\u201cYou can commit a felony when you\u2019re 18 years old and for the rest of your life, be in prison,\u201d Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes said. \u201cAnd yet you can\u2019t buy a pack of cigarettes.\u201d\n\nAnother bill would classify e-cigarettes, or \u201cvaping\u201d devices, as tobacco products subject to the same restrictions on who can purchase them and where they can be used.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has proposed regulations for e-cigarettes, but none has taken effect.\n\nAnti-tobacco groups fear that vaporizers are enticing to young people and may encourage them to eventually take up smoking. Others say the devices are a less harmful, tar-free alternative to cigarettes. They have not been extensively studied, and there is no scientific consensus on their risks.\n\nExpansion of Smoke-Free Areas\n\nThe bills would also expand smoke-free areas to include bars, workplace break rooms, small businesses, warehouses and hotel lobbies and meeting rooms. Smoking bans would apply at more schools, including charter schools, and counties would be able to raise their own cigarette taxes beyond the state\u2019s levy of $0.87 per pack.\n\nThe Senate vote came just over a week after San Francisco officials opted to raise the tobacco buying age to 21, making it the largest city to do so after New York. Nationwide, more than 120 municipalities have raised the smoking age, according to Tobacco 21, a group that advocates the policy shift nationally.\n\nHawaii was first to adopt the higher age limit statewide. New Jersey\u2019s Legislature voted to raise the smoking age from 19 to 21, but the bill died when Republican Gov. Chris Christie decided not to act on it before a January deadline.\n\nAnti-smoking groups are collecting signatures for a November ballot initiative that would raise the cigarette tax to $2 a pack and direct the money to health care, tobacco-use prevention, research and law enforcement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New regulations would affect e-cigarettes and expand smoke-free areas -- all if signed by Gov.
