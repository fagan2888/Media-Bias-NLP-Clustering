ANKENY, Iowa — A candidate for US Senate was killed when the plane he was piloting crashed in eastern Iowa Monday night.

The plane took off from the Des Moines metro.

Dr. Douglas Butzier, of Dubuque, was killed when his single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed Monday night while approaching the Dubuque Regional Airport in Dubuque, KWWL confirmed.

The FAA says the plane went down a mile north of the runway at about 11 p.m. The plane took off from the Ankeny Regional Airport an hour earlier.

Officers told the FAA that the 59-year-old was the only person in the plane.

Butzier, a doctor at Mercy Medical Center in Dubuque, was the Libertarian candidate for US Senate running against Rep. Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst. His website states he was running because of his concern for the national debt and opposition to Obamacare.

Braley and Ernst both issued statements saying they are “saddened” by the news and offered their condolences to Butzier’s family.

The NTSB is investigating the crash.
