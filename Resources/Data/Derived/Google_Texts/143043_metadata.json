Lawmakers are heading out of town for a week-long recess, and they\u2019ll return to Washington on Nov. 30. The procedural move comes after McConnell squelched speculation that Republican leadership might drop a repeal of Planned Parenthood from the repeal package. He told reporters he was \u201cconfident\u201d that the legislation would include defunding the organization, despite pushback from moderate Republicans. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) suggested that leadership will push forward on the ObamaCare repeal bill despite concerns over the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re feeling hopefully optimistic that our members are going to be there to give us the 51 votes necessary to get ObamaCare repeal and Planned Parenthood on the president\u2019s desk,\u201d he told reporters. In August, Senate Democrats defeated an effort to revoke taxpayer funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion business by filibustering the bill and preventing a vote on it. Republicans were unable to secure the 60 voted needed to invoke cloture and stop debate on the bill, allowing an up or down vote. Republicans could only get 53 votes to shut off debate. SIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately Then, in September, Senate Democrats voted to defeat a government funding bill that would de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business after it was caught in a series of 10 videos selling aborted babies and their body parts. The Senate voted 52 to 47 against ending debate. Now, the Senate will vote on a reconciliation bill the House passed at the end of October that will use the reconciliation process to de-fund the abortion company caught selling the body parts of aborted babies. There had been question about whether the Planned Parenthood de-funding provisions could be included in the bill, but the Senate parliamentarian has indicated they can remain.\n\nSens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), have balked at defunding Planned Parenthood. Their opposition to the bill is not surprising given their longstanding support for abortion and previous votes to back abortion funding.\n\nBut three other Republicans \u2014 who are strenuously pro-life \u2014 may vote against the bill as well because they don\u2019t think it goes far enough in repealing Obamacare. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) have all indicated they are potential no votes because they want the reconciliation bill to repeal Obamacare in its entirety rather than repealing portions of it.\n\nIf pro-life advocates want the Senate to pass a bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood and put it on pro-abortion President Barack Obama\u2019s desk \u2014 forcing him to decide whether he will stand with unborn children or stand with Planned Parenthood and its sales of aborted babies and their body parts \u2014 they need to call these six Republicans now and urge a vote for the reconciliation bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood:\n\nSusan Collins:\n\n(202) 224-2523 Contact: www.collins.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/email\n\nTed Cruz:\n\n(202) 224-5922 Contact: www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=email_senator\n\nMark Kirk:\n\n(202) 224-2854 Contact: www.kirk.senate.gov/?p=contact\n\nMike Lee:\n\n(202) 224-5444 Contact: www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact\n\nLisa Murkowski:\n\n(202) 224-6665 Contact: www.murkowski.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Contact\n\nMarco Rubio:\n\n(202) 224-3041 Contact: www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact\n\nThe bill would block, for one year, most federal payments to Planned Parenthood. At least 89% of federal funding of Planned Parenthood would be blocked by this bill. The bill would repeal a number of major components of the Obamacare health law, including two of the major provisions that will lead to rationing of lifesaving care \u2014 the \u201cIndependent Payment Advisory Board\u201d and the \u201cexcess benefits tax.\u201d\n\nDozens of leading pro-life groups have already indicated their support for the bill, including the National Right to Life Committee. In a letter to members of Congress that NRLC provided to LifeNews.com, the group indicated it strongly supports the bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cNRLC strongly supports the language in the bill that would block, for one year, most federal payments to affiliates of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). It would close the largest pipeline for federal funding of Planned Parenthood, Medicaid, and apply as well to the CHIP and the Title V and Title XX block grant programs, thus covering roughly 89% of all federal funds to Planned Parenthood. The amounts denied to Planned Parenthood in effect are reallocated to community health centers,\u201d the pro-life group explained.\n\n\u201cOver one-third of all abortions in the U.S. are performed at PPFA-affiliated facilities. Longstanding objections to the massive federal funding of PPFA have been reinforced by recent widely publicized undercover videos, which illuminate the callous brutality that occurs daily in these abortion mills,\u201d NRLC added.\n\nThe reconciliation bill also repeals portions of Obamacare,including its rationing components. With regard to the rationing aspects of Obamacare, NRLC strongly supports a repeal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, NRLC has always opposed the Obamacare law and advocated its repeal. With respect to H.R. 3762, we particularly endorse the components that would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) and the \u201cexcess benefits tax\u201d (\u201cCadillac Tax\u201d), both dangerous mechanisms that would ultimately contribute to the rationing of lifesaving care,\u201d the right to life group said.\n\nLeading pro-life groups that also support the reconciliation bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood include Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life, Family Research Council, March for Life, Concerned Women for America, Students for Life, Priests for Life, Operation Rescue, and American Life League, among others.\n\nWhile the reconciliation process would result in getting a bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood to pro-abortion President Barack Obama\u2019s desk, Obama has already promised repeatedly to veto any bill that revokes taxpayer funding for the abortion company. The Senate does not have enough votes to overcome such a veto, leading some pro-life groups to point out that there is little hope of de-funding Planned Parenthood until the election of a pro-life president next year.\n\n\u201cThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of the Senate amendment to H.J.Res. 61, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2016, and for other purposes, which contains highly objectionable provisions that advance a narrow ideological agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said before the vote. Eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood would \u201climit access\u201d to healthcare for women, men, families and \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affect low-income people, the OMB said.\n\nA new Congressional report finds that de-funding the Planned Parenthood abortion business \u2014 even for one year \u2014 would save \u201cseveral thousand\u201d unborn babies from the nightmare of abortion. The report also finds de-funding Planned Parenthood would save the federal government $235 million.\n\nThe expose\u2019 videos catching Planned Parenthood officials selling the body parts of aborted babies have shocked the nation. Here is a list of all eleven:\n\nIn the first video : Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d\n\n: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d In the second video: Planned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.

Congress Must Investigate Planned Parenthood for Selling Aborted Baby Parts\n\nThe full, unedited videos have confirmed that revelations that some aborted baby remains sold by Planned Parenthood go to biotech companies for the purpose of creating \u201chumanized\u201d mice. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood has been exposed as having sold body parts from aborted babies for as much as 15 years.\n\nThe federal law that technically prohibits the sale of aborted babies and their body parts was written by a pro-abortion Congressman decades ago and essentially spells out a process by which sellers of aborted baby body parts can meet certain criteria that allows the sales to be legal. That\u2019s why a Colorado congressman has introduced legislation to totally ban the sales of aborted baby body parts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Republicans Fast-Track Bill to De-Fund Planned Parenthood for Vote After Thanksgiving", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell made good on his promise to set up a vote soon on a bill that would de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business in", "title": "Senate Republicans Fast-Track Bill to De-Fund Planned Parenthood for Vote After Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/11/19/senate-republicans-fast-track-bill-to-de-fund-planned-parenthood-for-vote-after-thanksgiving/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/defundplannedparenthood21.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "senate republicans fast-track bill to de-fund planned parenthood for vote after thanksgiving", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In August, Senate Democrats defeated an effort to revoke taxpayer funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion business by filibustering the bill and preventing a vote on it.\nIt would close the largest pipeline for federal funding of Planned Parenthood, Medicaid, and apply as well to the CHIP and the Title V and Title XX block grant programs, thus covering roughly 89% of all federal funds to Planned Parenthood.\nCongress Must Investigate Planned Parenthood for Selling Aborted Baby PartsThe full, unedited videos have confirmed that revelations that some aborted baby remains sold by Planned Parenthood go to biotech companies for the purpose of creating \u201chumanized\u201d mice.\nThe procedural move comes after McConnell squelched speculation that Republican leadership might drop a repeal of Planned Parenthood from the repeal package.\nThe amounts denied to Planned Parenthood in effect are reallocated to community health centers,\u201d the pro-life group explained."}
