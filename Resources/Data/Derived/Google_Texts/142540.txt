Some residents in southern Connecticut say they were awoken by their homes shaking, and the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed a minor earthquake.

The Geological Survey said a 2.7-magnitude quake was recorded in Deep River shortly after 3:00 am on Thursday. No injuries or damage have been reported.

State police said they received several calls from people who said their homes shook briefly Thursday morning.

Small earthquakes aren't uncommon in Connecticut and the rest of the New England. According to the USGS, the region experiences "moderately damaging earthquakes" every few decades, and smaller earthquakes about two times a year.

The USGS provides seismic hazard maps for areas across the country. The maps show probability levels for earthquake ground motion, which informs building codes and insurance risk assessments. Connecticut's latest map shows a slightly greater hazard toward New York City.

Last December, a 2.1-magnitude quake was recorded in Groton in southeastern Connecticut.

The most recent quake in New England to cause some moderate damage was in 1940, when a 5.6-magnitude quake shook central New Hampshire.
