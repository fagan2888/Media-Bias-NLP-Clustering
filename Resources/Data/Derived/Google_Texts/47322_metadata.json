Filing for bankruptcy temporarily freezes all litigation and allows for some types of lawsuits to be discharged, though exceptions are made when the suit involves certain kinds of fraud.\n\nA spokesman for Relativity declined to comment Monday.\n\nProducers for \u201c8 Minutes,\u201d which aired earlier this year before being canceled amid widespread criticism, allegedly offered the women a way out of the sex trade and a shot at a better life. The purpose of the show was to help \u201cwomen in the life,\u201d referring to women involved in sex work, and \u201cto provide the necessary support if the women would like to leave,\u201d court papers say.\n\nBut after filming interviews with the women, Relativity never delivered on the help it promised, according to the suit. The complaint also claims Relativity assured the women their faces would be concealed during the nationally broadcast series and then failed to do so.\n\nThe women, identified only as Jane Doe I, Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III, were sought out based on ads they placed on escort websites, court papers show.\n\nJane Doe I says she was paid $250 for her appearance on the show but told that the \u201creal\u201d value would be the resources provided following her appearance. Lawyers for Jane Doe I say she was told that the network and Relativity \u201cwill do what it takes to get you and your family back on their feet.\u201d But the assistance never materialized, her lawyers say, leaving her \u201ceconomically and emotionally devastated.\u201d\n\nJane Doe II was recruited for the show at a substance abuse rehabilitation program and was similarly assured an escape from sex work, according to the complaint. But the young woman never received the help she expected despite the producers proclaiming, wrongly, that Jane Doe II and her daughter were \u201csafe in a new location\u201d and \u201ccurrently receiving services\u201d at the end of the episode.\n\nLawyers for Jane Doe III say she was \u201cbombarded by phone calls\u201d from family, friends and acquaintances after being featured on \u201c8 Minutes.\u201d Because the episode did not conceal her identity, she \u201chas suffered incessant humiliation and embarrassment which continues to this day,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nAccording to court papers, the women are now seeking more than $1 million in damages for \u201cwillful and malicious injuries.\u201d The complaint filed Sunday names both Relativity and Long Pond Media LLC, an affiliate headed by Tom Forman.\n\nRelativity filed for chapter 11 protection in July, plagued by a string of box-office flops and a heavy debt load. A bankruptcy judge last week approved a sale of the company\u2019s TV studio to senior lenders. The deal is expected to close by Oct. 20.\n\nA group of investors led by founder and Chief Executive Ryan Kavanaugh are set retake control of what remains of Relativity under a plan that call for company to reorganize around its film and other divisions by early next year.\n\nWrite to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Three women who allege they were repeatedly promised \u201clife-changing\u201d experiences by Relativity Media LLC as part of a short-lived reality show say the bankrupt Hollywood studio\u2019s empty pockets should not let it off the hook for its empty promises.", "title": "Sex Workers Say \u2018Life-Changing\u2019 Relativity Show Never Delivered", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2015/10/12/sex-workers-say-life-changing-relativity-show-never-delivered/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Sex Workers Say \u2018Life-Changing\u2019 Relativity Show Never Delivered", "description": "Three women who allege they were repeatedly promised \u201clife-changing\u201d experiences by Relativity Media LLC as part of a short-lived reality show say the bankrupt Hollywood studio\u2019s empty pockets should not let it off the hook for its empty promises.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Tom Corrigan", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Bankruptcy Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.summary": "Three women who allege they were repeatedly promised \u201clife-changing\u201d experiences by Relativity Media LLC as part of a short-lived reality show say the bankrupt Hollywood studio\u2019s empty pockets should not let it off the hook for its empty promises.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-10-12T19:47:40-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2015/10/12/sex-workers-say-life-changing-relativity-show-never-delivered/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-BANKB-21417", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Three women who allege they were repeatedly promised \u201clife-changing\u201d experiences by Relativity Media LLC as part of a short-lived reality show say the bankrupt Hollywood studio\u2019s empty pockets should not let it off the hook for its empty promises.", "title": "Sex Workers Say \u2018Life-Changing\u2019 Relativity Show Never Delivered", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2015/10/12/sex-workers-say-life-changing-relativity-show-never-delivered/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.id": "BL-BANKB-21417", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-16T16:21:34-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaaa\"", "article_summary": "But after filming interviews with the women, Relativity never delivered on the help it promised, according to the suit.\nRelativity filed for chapter 11 protection in July, plagued by a string of box-office flops and a heavy debt load.\nThe women, identified only as Jane Doe I, Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III, were sought out based on ads they placed on escort websites, court papers show.\nJane Doe I says she was paid $250 for her appearance on the show but told that the \u201creal\u201d value would be the resources provided following her appearance.\nThe complaint also claims Relativity assured the women their faces would be concealed during the nationally broadcast series and then failed to do so."}
