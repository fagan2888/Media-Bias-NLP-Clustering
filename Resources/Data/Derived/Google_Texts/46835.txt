#Rockies moves. Cuddy to 60 day DL Chris Martin optioned. Wilton Lopez up. — Patrick Saunders (@psaundersdp) June 21, 2014

The Rockies really did select the contract of right-handed reliever Wilton Lopez Saturday, and he will be back in their bullpen against the Brewers.

The 30-year-old Lopez, he of the incredible rising sinkerball, is on the Rockies’ 25-man (and 40-man) roster for the second time this season. He was on the opening-day roster but was designated for assignment after appearing in just four games, allowing eight runs in 6 1/3 innings. That’s an ERA of 11.37, for those of you calculating at home.

Why bring up Lopez?

“I lot of it has to do with where we are at right now with our pitching staff,” manager Walt Weiss said. “We have been pretty taxed and we feel like we needed another guy who could give us multiple innings out there. That’s why we brought ‘Lopey’ back. He’s a durable guy who can give us innings.”

The Rockies have a number of young starters filling holes in their reeling rotation, and Weiss said the Rockies want to protect them.

In 20 games for Triple-A Colorado Springs, Lopez was 0-2 with a 4.54 ERA.

The other moves by the Rockies Saturday: The team placed Michael Cuddyer (broken left shoulder) on the 60-day disabled, freeing up a spot on the 40-man roster for Lopez. The club also optioned right-handed reliever Chris Martin and outfielder-first baseman Kyle Parker to Triple-A. Those moves freed up spaced on the 25-man roster for Lopez and lefty Christian Friedrich, who starts Saturday’s game against the Brewers.
