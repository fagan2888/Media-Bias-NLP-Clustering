While overall sales of beer are down in the United States, sales of craft beers continue to rise.\n\nLast year, retail craft beer sales reached $22.3 billion, accounting for one in five dollars spent on beer, according to a new report from the Colorado-based trade group Brewers Association. By comparison, the overall U.S. beer market shrank 0.2 percent last year.\n\nRelated: The 25 Best Beer Towns in America (and Their Best Beers)\n\nThe number of smaller, independent brewers has grown also, representing 12 percent of the beer industry. Thanks to industry deregulation and growing demand among millennials who are guzzling everything from IPAs to chocolate stouts, craft beer sales have seen double-digit growth for eight of the past 10 years.\n\nThere are now a record 4,269 breweries in the United States, with a net 552 new breweries opening last year. The South is seeing particularly strong growth in craft beer, with Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Texas each seeing more than 20 new breweries open for business.\n\nBreweries and brewpubs accounted for nearly 122,000 new jobs last year, an increase of more than 6,000 from 2014. \u201cSmall and independent brewers are a beacon for beer and our economy,\u201d Brewers Association Chief Economist Bart Watson said in a statement.\n\nThe booming industry has drawn attention from both investors and larger beer manufacturers, leading to a wave of mergers and acquisitions. That trend has caused a backlash among smaller brewers who fear the heavyweights will squeeze them out of distribution. But for consumers the situation looks pretty good, with more interesting, high-quality beer available than ever before.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Flannel shirts and beards aren\u2019t the only hipster trends taking hold in mainstream Ame", "title": "Craft Beer Is Booming: Here\u2019s How Much We\u2019re Spending on All Those IPAs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Craft-Beer-Booming-Here-s-How-Much-We-re-Spending-All-Those-IPAs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Craft_Beer_Brewing_Pint_Flickr_heyitsgarrett.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Craft-Beer-Booming-Here-s-How-Much-We-re-Spending-All-Those-IPAs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Craft_Beer_Brewing_Pint_Flickr_heyitsgarrett.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Flannel shirts and beards aren\u2019t the only hipster trends taking hold in mainstream Ame", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While overall sales of beer are down in the United States, sales of craft beers continue to rise.\nLast year, retail craft beer sales reached $22.3 billion, accounting for one in five dollars spent on beer, according to a new report from the Colorado-based trade group Brewers Association.\nThat trend has caused a backlash among smaller brewers who fear the heavyweights will squeeze them out of distribution.\nThanks to industry deregulation and growing demand among millennials who are guzzling everything from IPAs to chocolate stouts, craft beer sales have seen double-digit growth for eight of the past 10 years.\nRelated: The 25 Best Beer Towns in America (and Their Best Beers)The number of smaller, independent brewers has grown also, representing 12 percent of the beer industry."}
