STOCKHOLM--Swedish security company Securitas AB (SECU-B.SK) Thursday reported a bigger-than-expected rise in fourth quarter net profit but said it may not reach its sales target growth for security solutions and technology by the end of 2015 as previously projected, partly due to a health care reform in the U.S.

Net profit at the world's second biggest security company after G4S rose to 634.4 million Swedish kronor ($76.7 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from 493.9 million kronor in the same period 2013. Analysts polled by financial information provider SIX expected a net profit of 567.25 million kronor for the quarter.

Securitas, which provides security services like guarding and technology solutions, has set out to increase sales of security solutions and technology to a run rate of 18% by the end of 2015, up from 6% in 2012 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014.

However, it said the outcome of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. coupled with increased growth of guarding contracts means the target is now "likely out of reach."

The company added that it is compliant with the Affordable Care Act and does not expect any negative impact on its results as it has fully mitigated the cost.

Sales in the quarter rose to 18.9 billion kronor, up from 16.73 billion kronor in the year-earlier period. Operating profit increased to 943.7 million kronor, from 791 million kronor a year ago.

The company said security solutions and technology sales amounted to 6.5 billion kronor in 2014 and grew with 28% compared to 2013 and that it expects this business area to deliver sales in at least the same range in 2015.

Organic sales growth was 5% in the quarter, up from 1% a year ago, and the improvement was reflected in all business segments, the company said.
