Earlier in the case, his lawyers argued that Tactical Firearms shouldn\u2019t be profiled in a reality show, stating that the show\u2019s filming \u201crisks disrupting the [company\u2019s] current retail operations,\u201d which employ about 30 people, according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.\n\nTactical Firearms had been approached by U.S. division of British production giant ITV Studios about being in a show, promising to pay Mr. Alcede \u201c$1,500 per episode plus ten percent (10%) of ITV\u2019s gross receipts from the show,\u201d according to court papers. ITV Studios America\u2014the producer of TLC\u2019s \u201cFour Weddings\u201c reality show and Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cRocky Mountain Bounty Hunters\u201d\u2014hadn\u2019t found a cable operator to carry the show at the time that Tactical Firearms\u2019 lawyers asked the court for permission to participate.\n\nIn his two-page decision, Judge Jeff Bohm ultimately sided with Mr. Coe Wilson and declined to allow the store to be filmed, though he didn\u2019t explain why. (Bankruptcy geeks: The request was filed as a \u201cmotion for use of property outside ordinary course of business.\u201d)\n\nTo get the business out of bankruptcy, Mr. Coe Wilson is proposing to spend $1.5 million on the company\u2019s operations and refinance the company\u2019s loan with Icon Bank of Texas NA.\n\nMr. Alcede, who owns 70% of the business, faced a deadline to repay loans of about $1.4 million and couldn\u2019t negotiate a refinancing deal with bank executives. Putting the store into bankruptcy on June 27 bought him a little extra time.\n\nUnder the reorganization plan, Mr. Alcede would no longer be involved with the business, according to court papers. His lawyer did not return a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nAs for President Obama\u2019s role in all this, Mr. Alcede\u2019s political statements came after several Republican lawmakers had accused the Obama administration of trying to cut off industries it doesn\u2019t like\u2014think tobacco sellers, short-term lenders and gun ranges\u2014 from the U.S. banking system.\n\nIcon Bank officials deny that their moves have anything to do with that effort, which has been called Operation Choke Point.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
