John Kasich promoted Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion while in South Dakota as part of a six-state Balanced Budget Amendment trip Tuesday.\n\nAfter talking with state legislators about the importance of restraining federal spending, Kasich, a Republican, was asked why he expanded Medicaid under Obamacare in 2013. The Obamacare Medicaid expansion is funded with billions in new federal spending.\n\n\u201cWell, the first thing is that the money that we in Ohio send to Washington is not somebody\u2019s money down there, it\u2019s our money,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cJohn Roberts and the Supreme Court said that states could decide whether they wanted to expand Medicaid. Why have we done that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, the first three years it\u2019s 100 percent that we get from the federal government. Right now we don\u2019t have to even do a match,\u201d Kasich said of the Obamacare funding he had seconds earlier described as entirely Ohio money, moments after giving a speech about unsustainable federal spending.\n\nAs signed into law by President Obama, Obamacare required states to expand Medicaid to working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependent children. Kasich criticized the Obamacare expansion while running for governor in 2010, warning it would \u201cstick states with large and unsustainable costs.\u201d\n\nThe left-leaning Urban Institute has projected Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion will cost federal taxpayers more than $50 billion through 2022.\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional for Congress to force states to expand Medicaid by threatening to cut off all Medicaid funding. The only role Chief Justice John Roberts played in the Obamacare expansion was voting to let states opt out, and writing the Court\u2019s decision in the case.\n\nSouth Dakota is one of 23 states that haven\u2019t implemented the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. As part of a trip paid for by nonprofit Balanced Budget Forever, Kasich is visiting four of the other holdouts \u2014 Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Utah \u2014 this week.\n\nDuring his Pierre, S.D., stop Tuesday, Kasich suggested refusing to expand Medicaid under Obamacare violates God\u2019s will and is costing lives.\n\n\u201cNow, one of the interesting things about this is that people say, \u2018That position is liberal.\u2019 Well, I\u2019ve been in the Republican Party for a long time, and a big chunk of the Republican Party is people of faith,\u201d Kasich said.\n\n\u201cNow, if you ever read Matthew 25,\u201d Kasich continued, \u201cI think, \u2018I wanna feed the hungry and clothe the naked,\u2019 and I have to tell you \u2014 I read a horrible story in The Wall Street Journal on the weekend about people, one man in particular freezing to death over in Montana. And they\u2019ve turned down about half a billion dollars of help, I\u2019m told. That disturbs me.\u201d\n\nThis is a variation on one of Kasich\u2019s regular Obamacare talking points. The governor\u2019s press secretary didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an opponent of Obamacare,\u201d Kasich assured South Dakota legislators after promoting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion as necessary for drug addicts, the mentally ill and the working poor. Kasich\u2019s own Department of Medicaid has estimated \u201cabout half\u201d of Ohioans eligible under the Obamacare expansion are employed.\n\n\u201cYou can do better with less money if you\u2019re smart and innovative, which is what my people have done in Ohio,\u201d Kasich told South Dakota legislators. In 2013 after Kasich unilaterally expanded Medicaid, he turned to the quasi-legislative Ohio Controlling Board to appropriate $2.5 billion in Obamacare money that will be exhausted by this July, if not sooner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
