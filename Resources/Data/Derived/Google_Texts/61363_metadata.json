Wall Street saw the bill\u2019s passage as so crucial that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon personally called members of the House yesterday to urge them to vote in favor of the bill, which funds most of the government through the end of the fiscal year.\n\nSo reports the Washington Post, which cites \u201ca person familiar with\u201d Dimon\u2019s effort. The bill could provide a big boon to Dimon\u2019s bank; a provision quietly inserted into the legislation without any prior debate repeals the Dodd-Frank banking reform\u2019s laws \u201cswap pushout\u201d rule, which bans banks from using taxpayer funds to trade highly risky financial instruments known as swaps.\n\nCongressman Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican, inserted the provision into the bill, but he didn\u2019t actually write it. Yoder left that job to Citigroup, another firm that has long agitated for repeal of the swap rule.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leader of the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing, blasted Yoder\u2019s policy rider, exhorting House Democrats to vote against the bill because of its inclusion. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi joined Warren in opposition to the bill, declaring Thursday that she was \u201cenormously disappointed\u201d that the Obama White House has signaled its support for the spending bill, despite reservations about the swap rule repeal. But 57 members of the House Democratic caucus joined a majority of the Republican conference in voting for the bill last night, paving the path for its passage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamie Dimon personally called House members to urge support for cromnibus", "title": "Government by Wall Street: JPMorgan CEO whipped votes for last night\u2019s spending bill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jamie Dimon personally called House members to urge support for cromnibus", "title": "Government by Wall Street: JPMorgan CEO whipped votes for last night\u2019s spending bill", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/12/government_by_wall_street_jpmorgan_ceo_whipped_votes_for_spending_bill/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/jamie_dimon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jamie Dimon personally called House members to urge support for cromnibus", "title": "Government by Wall Street: JPMorgan CEO whipped votes for last night\u2019s spending bill", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/jamie_dimon.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Banks, Barack Obama, Citigroup, cromnibus, Dodd-Frank, Elizabeth Warren, financial regulation, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase, Kevin Yoder, spending bill, swaps, U.S. House of Representatives, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf95\"", "article_summary": "But 57 members of the House Democratic caucus joined a majority of the Republican conference in voting for the bill last night, paving the path for its passage.\nCongressman Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican, inserted the provision into the bill, but he didn\u2019t actually write it.\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi joined Warren in opposition to the bill, declaring Thursday that she was \u201cenormously disappointed\u201d that the Obama White House has signaled its support for the spending bill, despite reservations about the swap rule repeal.\nTopics: Banks, Barack Obama, Citigroup, cromnibus, Dodd-Frank, Elizabeth Warren, financial regulation, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase, Kevin Yoder, spending bill, swaps, U.S. House of Representatives, Wall Street, Business News, Politics NewsThe House\u2019s narrow passage of a massive spending bill that included a provision gutting a key financial regulatory reform is being cast as a major win for the financial industry.\nYoder left that job to Citigroup, another firm that has long agitated for repeal of the swap rule."}
