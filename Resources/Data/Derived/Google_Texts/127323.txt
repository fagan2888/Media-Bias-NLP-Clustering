Wes Welker refuses to get embroiled in the great rub-out controversy that has become part of the hype leading up to the Super Bowl.

On Friday, the Broncos’ receiver repeatedly declined to stir the waters when asked questions about his controversial hit on New England cornerback Aqib Talib in last Sunday’s AFC championship game. The hit, though legal, rubbed Seattle Seahawks cornerback Walter Thurmond the wrong way.

Asked if he had anything to say to Thurmond, Welker said: “Not at all, not at all. I just look forward to the game in New York. I’m just really looking forward to going out there and playing hard and competing — and [winning] the game.”

On Wednesday, Thurmond told reporters: “It was really uncalled for. The receiver (Welker) ran right into the guy. I don’t know the extent of the injury Talib had, but I thought we were supposed to protect football players in this league now. I guess not. I guess that only goes one way.”

The NFL, however, cleared Welker of any wrongdoing for his hit in Denver’s 26-16 win over the Patriots.

“It was a legal hit,” NFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino said on the NFL Network on Wednesday night.

On Monday morning, Patriots coach Bill Belichick called Welker’s hit “one of the worst plays” he’d seen. Talib suffered a knee injury on the play and didn’t return to the game. He is not expected to need surgery.

Welker ran a play across the middle that is commonly called a “rub” or “pick” when he collided with Talib, but Thurmond said that what Welker did was against the rules because he never lifted his head.

“Welker had his head down, like he was coming down the whole time,” he told reporters. “That should be a flag, and he should be getting fined. There’s a whole bunch of things that should happen in that situation, but I don’t run the NFL.”
