She not only fights criticism of the pharmaceutical industry on multiple fronts, but also promotes healthcare reforms that reflect the industry\u2019s interests.\n\nOne current fight involves Gilead\u2019s $1,000-a-pill Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which lawmakers, insurance companies and pharmacy benefit management companies say could bankrupt families and the healthcare system.\n\nEven though Gilead isn\u2019t a PhRMA client, the lobby group has come to its defense, saying Sovaldi might sound pricey but in the long run it actually saves money.\n\nWhile Sovaldi may cost $84,000 or more for an individual patient\u2019s 12-week treatment, Reilly argues it will save money by decreasing the need for liver transplants for patients whose organs fail.\n\n\u201cBut while the attention right now is very much focused on this drug\u2026 [it] is a new twist on a story that\u2019s been going on for a while,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nReilly pushes back against congressional leaders who are challenging the rising cost of specialty drugs and want the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate down the price of treatments like Sovaldi in Medicare Part D plans.\n\nReilly warns the fight isn\u2019t just about one Hepatitis C drug but future drugs that could save the healthcare system billions of dollars by reducing costs such as chronic care and hospital bills.\n\nReilly also says if drugmakers aren\u2019t able to recoup their research and development dollars for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, new drugs won\u2019t come to the market.\n\n\u201cWith regards to Alzheimer\u2019s, since 1998, companies have made just over 100 attempts to develop a medicine to treat this disease, while only three medicines have been approved,\u201d said Reilly. \u201cFor every one success, there have been about 34 failures. We need a vibrant research ecosystem to absorb the inevitable failures and continue to move research forward.\u201d\n\nShe also notes if an Alzheimer\u2019s drug that could delay the onset of the disease were to come to market today, it would save Medicare and Medicaid $100 billion annually by 2030.\n\nReilly grew up in Laurel, Md., and initially thought about becoming an agent with the FBI because her dad was one during the height of the Cold War. However, she was turned down because of her eyesight, which she has since had corrected through Lasik surgery.\n\nShe studied law at the University of Nebraska and worked for the state\u2019s attorney general and a county attorney\u2019s office in her senior year. She decided to move back east to become a prosecutor and ended up landing several jobs on Capitol Hill.\n\nShe was a counsel on the House Energy and Commerce Committee before taking a position as a policy director at PhRMA, where she worked her way up over the next 13 years.\n\n\u201cMy ultimate goal is being a good role model for my children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile it is often stressful managing my current job and being a good mom, it is important for my children to understand that hard work pays off.\u201d\n\nReilly said that, while she is dedicated to her job, she leaves her work behind when she leaves the office so she can focus on her family, and she feels fortunate that PhRMA lets her maintain that work-life balance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever gotten an email from [PhRMA CEO John Castellani] after 5 p.m. He really respects the boundaries of home life, which is nice. And if you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, he\u2019s kind of hands off.\u201d\n\nAs with other healthcare-related enterprises, PhRMA is very focused on how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being implemented and how it can leverage the law to the benefit of its members.\n\n\u201cWe supported the passage of the Affordable Care Act, but as it\u2019s been implemented, we\u2019ve had some concerns with regards to patient access to therapies,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many instances where certain types of medication are all placed on the highest tier formulary for a given plan. It makes them difficult for patients to access.\u201d\n\nReilly\u2019s comments echo PhRMA\u2019s recent turf war against America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the main insurance company lobby group.\n\nWhile AHIP has continually attacked the rising cost of prescription drugs, PhRMA says the real problem is how much co-pay insurance companies are asking of consumers.\n\n\u201cThe discussion of prescription drug costs has ramped up at a time when prescription drug cost growth is at historic lows,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also need to recognize that inadequate insurance coverage is a key barrier to affordability for patients.\u201d\n\nReilly said that, while insurance companies on average require patients to pay 4 percent of their hospital bills, they are often asked to pay 40 percent or more for certain drugs, such as antiretrovirals to treat HIV.\n\nTo fix this, she said, HHS could implement rules under the ACA requiring insurers to pay for a larger share of drug costs and reduce the burden on consumers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying a silver plan, and you\u2019re expecting the plan is going to pay 70 percent of the cost of it, well [insurance companies] shouldn\u2019t be able to treat drugs at a very low percentage relative to other healthcare services,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nShe also said health exchanges need to implement an out-of-pocket calculator that was promised in the ACA so consumers could determine how much their chronic drug coverage will cost based on their plan.\n\nReilly said the Food and Drug Administration needs to change the way it approves new drugs.\n\n\u201cAs a first step, FDA should apply fully the existing broad regulatory flexibility granted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and also enhance its ability to make decisions regarding therapeutic benefit based on real-world evidence as a supplement or potentially as a replacement for randomized controlled trials,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nBut Reilly is skeptical that Congress will be able to move any sort of legislation that deals with updating the ACA in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cMy assumption is, given the politics of the situation, we\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "For Lori Reilly, vice president for policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the
