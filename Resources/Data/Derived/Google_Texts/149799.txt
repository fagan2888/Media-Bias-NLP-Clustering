Deputies with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office were called to the scene of what was believed to be another sinkhole in Queen Creek Sunday evening.

It turned out "to simply be a washout from irrigation," MCSO spokesman Chris Hegstrom tweeted.

Hegstrom first tweeted about the reported new sinkhole at about 7 p.m., saying it is roughly 500 feet from the sinkhole that swallowed a man a little more than two weeks ago.

It took crews from several agencies several hours to recover the man's body.

Hegstrom said MCSO does not believe there are any injuries connected with the second sinkhole, which is near Power and Ocotillo roads. The area is described as farmland.

After checking out the site, Hegstrom tweeted a clarification shortly after 8:30 p.m., and said only a field road was affected.
