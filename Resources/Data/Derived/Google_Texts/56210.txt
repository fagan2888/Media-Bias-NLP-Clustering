Brookings, SD

A fire department in eastern South Dakota has gone high-tech with a new custom-built drone.



The Brookings Fire Department will use the remote-controlled F450 quadcopter to survey structure fires, wildfires, hazmat situations and gas leaks. Fire Chief Darrell Hartmann says the drone can even be used to search areas in missing person cases or to locate vehicles that have gone underwater.



The Brookings Register reports the drone was built free of charge by an Elkton man who works as a quality control technician at 3M in Brookings. He outfitted the quadcopter frame with long-life batteries, a memory card and a GoPro video camera.



Hartmann says the department will begin using the drone in emergency situations this spring after more firefighters have been trained in how to operate it.
