It\u2019s also the first time the Obama administration \u2014 or any administration \u2014 has set a target on value-based payments.\n\nInstead of simply paying doctors for services, CMS now encourages public and private sector healthcare providers to base their payments on quality measures, such as patient outcome and access to care.\n\nThe most common of these models are known as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), in which groups of doctors, hospitals and specialists voluntarily coordinate care.\n\nThe administration has also been pushing a \u201cbundled payments\u201d method, in which hospitals receive a lump sum for a service, like a knee operation, and then divide up the payments to other providers involved.\n\nThe result, Conway said, are doctors who offer extended office hours, quicker follow-ups and a greater focus on avoiding hospitalization.\n\nConway attributed the success of the program to \u201ctools provided by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d which offered new incentives for providers moving away from the much-maligned fee-for-service model.\n\n\u201cPeople have really seen the light that the health system is changing,\u201d Conway told reporters. \u201cAt the end of the day, people know this is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nStill, there are growing pains, particularly for doctors and hospitals accustomed to the current \u201cfee-for-service\u201d system.\n\n\u201cHospitals being asked to step up,\u201d Peggy O\u2019Kane, president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, recently told The Hill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like turning healthcare systems upside down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make change on this scale without unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nThe administration is now eying its next goal \u2014 tying 50 percent of payments by 2018.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cWe even, internally, questioned whether we could reach the goal or not,\" a Medicare official said.", "description": "\u201cWe even, internally, questioned whether we could reach the goal or not,\" a Medicare official said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cWe even, internally, questioned whether we could reach the goal or not,\" a Medicare official said.", "title": "Obama administration beats goal on Medicare payment reform", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/271673-obama-administration-beats-goal-in-shifting-medicare-payments", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/doctor_022113getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-03T15:43:33-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-03T15:43-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/271673-obama-administration-beats-goal-in-shifting-medicare-payments", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-03T15:12-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-03T15:12:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-03T15:43:33-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/271673-obama-administration-beats-goal-in-shifting-medicare-payments", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cWe even, internally, questioned whether we could reach the goal or not,\" a Medicare official said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama administration beats goal on Medicare payment reform"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama administration beats goal on Medicare payment reform"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration reached an important landmark in its ambitious push to reform Medicare payments by tying doctor fees to quality rather than quantity.\nThe 30 percent commitment, which was laid out last year, marks the most dramatic shift in Medicare payments in the program\u2019s 50-year history.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t make change on this scale without unintended consequences.\u201dThe administration is now eying its next goal \u2014 tying 50 percent of payments by 2018.\nIt\u2019s also the first time the Obama administration \u2014 or any administration \u2014 has set a target on value-based payments.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced Thursday it reached its goal of tying 30 percent of Medicare payments to value, instead of volume, with 10 months left in 2016."}
