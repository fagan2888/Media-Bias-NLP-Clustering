The entire bill was a compromise\u2014how far that compromise went though is hotly contested\u2014but its success was dependent on everyone playing their role. To call the rollout mismanaged is charitable, and now it seems that certain hospitals that offer premium care are going to exclude insurance providers from the health care exchanges, even if previously those insurers were accepted.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center and \u201c[o]ther premier city hospitals\u201d are the latest hospitals to not accept the new plans. The hospitals claim their reticence to embrace these new plans is, essentially, that they are only accepting insurance plans where, according to a spokeswoman, there are \u201cstrong records in resolving and enrollment payment issues.\u201d However many hospitals, including Sloan-Kettering, are still negotiating with insurers so this news may merely be a part of that negotiation.\n\nIn the early days of Obamacare\u2014before the bill was even final\u2014hospital associations were early allies of the law, the agreement facilitated by Vice President Joe Biden. However, despite cuts on the hospitals\u2019 end to Medicare and Medicaid payments, once the bill passed both hospitals and the prescription drug companies were seen as the big \u201cwinners\u201d in healthcare reform. Thus it remains unclear as to why hospitals are so publicly bailing out now.\n\nHowever, with the rising trend in Ambulatory Surgical Centers and Urgent Care facilities and the ever-expanding amount of medical procedures they can perform the point may be moot. In an essay for Forbes, Dr. Robert Pearl speculates that the world of medicine may be evolving beyond large centralized hospitals with a vast staff of doctors, specialists, and services. It\u2019s not a reduction of medical options per se, but is more decentralization. Of course, such a radical shift would bring about its own problems.\n\nUPDATE: Sloan-Kettering reached out to your correspondent via Twitter, taking exception to the idea that they were \u201copting out\u201d of Obamacare. They have said that, \u201cas of today\u201d they are in the networks for two plans on the New York Small Business Exchange and in the networks for two plans on the Individual Marketplace. So while not technically \u201copting out\u201d of the program, they seem to be severely limiting the center\u2019s networks. Twitter exchange posted below:\n\n@JoshuaMPatton We are not opting out. We expect to be in network with one or more plans. \u2014 Sloan-Kettering (@sloan_kettering) November 22, 2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "One thing that is universal about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is that it was no one\u2019s first choice....", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Sloan-Kettering, Other Elite Hospitals Rejecting Obamacare Health Exchange Plans", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/health-care/sloan-kettering-other-elite-hospitals-rejecting-obamacare-health-exchange-plans", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ov-file-archive/piece/5/5/705305.0.SLoanKettering.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One thing that is universal about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is that it was no one\u2019s first choice....", "title": "Sloan-Kettering, Other Elite Hospitals Rejecting Obamacare Health Exchange Plans"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-21T22:38:49+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2013-11-21T22:38:49+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 840207}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc10\"", "article_summary": "According to The Associated Press, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center and \u201c[o]ther premier city hospitals\u201d are the latest hospitals to not accept the new plans.\nUPDATE: Sloan-Kettering reached out to your correspondent via Twitter, taking exception to the idea that they were \u201copting out\u201d of Obamacare.\nOne thing that is universal about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is that it was no one\u2019s first choice.\nThey have said that, \u201cas of today\u201d they are in the networks for two plans on the New York Small Business Exchange and in the networks for two plans on the Individual Marketplace.\nThe entire bill was a compromise\u2014how far that compromise went though is hotly contested\u2014but its success was dependent on everyone playing their role."}
