A driver who hit a homeless man who was lying in the middle of an alleyway will not be ticketed because police say the man who was hit caused the accident.

The victim was taken to the hospital with serious injuries but is expected to survive, according to police.

The driver left the scene after hitting the man. Police say they located the person and it appears he did not realize he hit someone.

The driver did not show signs of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to police.

The accident happened just before 11 p.m. Saturday on the 1200 block of N. Academy Boulevard in Colorado Springs.

The homeless man had been sleeping behind a business for about an hour before he was hit. Police say he was asked to leave, but refused. They determined he caused the accident by lying in the middle of the alleyway.
