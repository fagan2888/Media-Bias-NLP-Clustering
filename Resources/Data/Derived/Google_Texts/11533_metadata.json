That would be the kinds of media you\u2019d purposefully expose them to.\u201d\n\nLinebarger and her colleagues analyzed a national survey of more than 1,150 families with children ages 2 to 8, weighing such factors as family demographics, diverse parenting styles, and consumption of media. As expected, the researchers found an association between television noise and brain functioning, an effect most pronounced among children living in poverty or born to parents with lower education.\n\nYet the deleterious effect of television background noise on children\u2019s cognitive development held across socioeconomic demographics, as parents from poorer environs sometimes compensated with greater attention. Despite other disadvantages, some parents successfully shielded their children from the harms of television background noise. \u201cChildren whose parents create a home environment that is loving and nurturing and where rules and expectations are the same from one time to another are better able to control their behavior, display more empathy, and do better academically,\u201d Linebarger said.\n\nYet unlike other experts on childhood development, the researchers stopped short of recommending that parents \u201ckill your television.\u201d Educational television designed for children\u2019s cognitive development led to positive effects, suggesting that parents need only to supervise children\u2019s television time, with greater discretion in making choices.\n\n\u201cSit down to watch a particular show and when it\u2019s done, turn it off,\u201d Linebarger advises parents.\n\nStill, the National Academy of Pediatrics remains critical of most television, dismissing educational content for children younger than two \u2014 which may seem like trying to hold back the tide.\n\nAnd according to Common Sense Media, most young children subsist on a media diet heavy on television, with educational content thrown into a Kardashian medley of reality and soaps, sports, and \u2014 for some families \u2014 24/7 news channels. Of educational content consumed by children, 61 percent catch programming from television, particularly those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Another 38 percent just as frequently consume educational content via mobile platforms, including cellphones and iPads, with 34 percent using computers.\n\nBelow, Linebarger discusses the study in a YouTube video.\n\nSource: Linebarger DL, Barr R, Lapierre MA, Piotrowski JT.
