The ministry will pick a manufacturer through an electronic action on April 15.\n\nThe Ministry commissioned the medals in November, two months after the start of Russia\u2019s Syrian air campaign that saw warplanes carry out hundreds of combat sorties against \u201cterrorist\u201d targets inside the country. Putin and other Kremlin officials contend the targets were ISIS forces, but Western officials argue they were aimed at Syrian rebels fighting President Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nA mock-up of the medal itself shows three fighter jets and a missile ship passing around an outline of Syria. The back of the piece is reportedly inscribed with the words: \u201cTo a participant in the military operation in Syria.\u201d\n\nAs with its military operations inside and along the border with Ukraine, the Kremlin has never released exact figures for the number of troops it deployed inside Syria.\n\nRelated: US Says Momentum Has Shifted in the War Against ISIS\n\nPutin announced earlier this month that Russia was withdrawing most of its armed forces from Syria, but emphasized a small contingent would remain to offer assistance to the country\u2019s army.\n\nHe also said Russia\u2019s footprint in the war-torn country could be expanded rapidly, if necessary. Indeed, the country retains two major military bases in the country, a naval site near the port of Tartus and an airfield near the town of Latakia.\n\nThis weekend the Defense Ministry said Russian planes flew over 40 sorties in 24 hours around the city of Palmyra to help the Syrian army retake the city from ISIS, a development that\u2019s been given the thumbs-up by the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cWe certainly welcome word of any loss of territory on the part of ISIL, and the ejection of -- of ISIL from parts of Syria we think are a good thing,\u201d press secretary Peter Cook said Tuesday during a press briefing, using the other common acronym for the terror group.\n\nRelated: Why Vladimir Putin Knows Exactly Where U.S. Special Forces Are in Syria\n\nHe said that since fragile ceasefire between the regime and its opponents took effect late last month it is \u201cclear that they have focused more of their military attention on ISIL. We think that is a good thing. We encouraged that from the start.\u201d\n\nCook added that Russia\u2019s role in Syria today \u201cis more constructive than it\u2019s been\u201d though it\u2019s unclear if Washington and Moscow \u2013 whose relationship has come under intense strain because of the Kremlin\u2019s actions \u2013 will be teaming up any time soon.\n\n\u201cIf the Russians continue to focus their efforts on ISIL we think that would be a good thing. But at this point, we're not at a position to cooperate with Russia in that effort,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian forces have provided a significant boost for the Syrian army in recent months, but military analysts have been unable to answer a basic question: How many troops has the Kremlin sent to the country?", "title": "How Many Russian Troops Are In Syria?
