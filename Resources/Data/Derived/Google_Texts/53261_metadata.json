All of us will be hurt,\u201d Pipes said.\n\nThe problems with the 340B program don\u2019t just end there, Pipes said.\n\nPeople in hospitals and pharmacies, Pipes added, have abused the program to help themselves financially.\n\n\u201cNow with Obamacare many of these abuses are going to get worse,\u201d Pipes told Tennessee Watchdog.\n\nAccording to 340B\u2019s original intent, drug companies had to offer drugs at discounted prices to hospitals that generally serve patients without health insurance.\n\nBut there was very little oversight, and the program continued to expand beyond its original parameters, Pipes said.\n\nFederal officials, for instance, added pharmacies to the program in 1996. In 2010, federal officials expanded the program by allowing hospitals to contract with an unlimited number of outside pharmacies.\n\n\u201cHospitals are now treating people who don\u2019t fit the uninsured and low-income category,\u201d Pipes said, adding she doesn\u2019t want the program to end.\n\nInstead, she wants Congress to reform the program.\n\n\u201cHospitals are purchasing the drugs at these 20-50 percent discounted prices and then they are charging patients the full price, so hospitals are making a profit. It\u2019s not helping the people it was designed to help,\u201d Pipes said.\n\nA U.S. Government Accountability Office audit released in 2011 backs up Pipes\u2019 concerns, noting the program has major problems.\n\nPipes wrote in Forbes last month the program has expanded so much that one in three hospitals nationwide and thousands of pharmacies now participate.\n\nAs a result, hospitals are making hundreds of millions of dollars annually in profits, she added.\n\nEven former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius is on record as saying the program has gone beyond its bounds.\n\nA 2013 New York Times article on 340B\u2019s problems cited Memphis\u2019 West Clinic as an example of a place where this problem exists.\n\nNo one at the West Clinic immediately returned Tennessee Watchdog\u2019s requests for comment Thursday.\n\nOfficials with the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the program under the federal Health and Human Resources, also didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nLindsay Boyd, director of policy at the Nashville-based think tank Beacon Center of Tennessee, wrote in the Daily Caller earlier this year that nearly 1,000 pharmacies in the state benefit from the 340B program.\n\nMany people in the hospital and pharmaceutical industries say the extra revenue they make from 340B makes up for low reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid, Pipes said.\n\nThe New York Times even quoted an official at one Georgia hospital saying it couldn\u2019t afford a cancer outpatient center without the money.\n\nPipes expects hospital lobbyists to put up a fight over the issue in Congress next year.\n\nThe less revenue pharmaceutical companies get as a result of 340B, the fewer risks they will take manufacturing new drugs, Pipes said.\n\n\u201cOnly about five drugs out of 5,000 actually make it to human trial and one of the five makes it to market,\u201d Pipes said.\n\n\u201cIt costs about $1 million from the start of an idea to putting a drug through all of the different phases. There are few that make it. If they don\u2019t make a change to this it\u2019s going to destroy the incentive for the pharmaceutical companies and biologics companies to continue to do research and development.\u201d\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
