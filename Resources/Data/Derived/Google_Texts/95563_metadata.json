It's just that I think you should have the freedom to do it.\"Wilson reportedly works from an apartment near the University of Texas at Austin with a group of self-described anti-establishment techies.Meanwhile, anticipating a potential legal battle with the government over publication of the 3-D-printing gun file, he said the book advance could come in handy.\"At least now if I'm in prison I'll have something to do,\" he joked to Forbes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cody wilson,3-D,gun,book", "pubdate": "2014-01-22T14:30:34", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Cody Wilson, who created the first fully 3D-printable gun last spring, has landed a quarter-million-dollar book deal with Simon & Schuster.", "title": "Creator of 3-D Printable Gun Lands Book Deal", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/cody-wilson-3-D-gun-book/2014/01/22/id/548430/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=d727817d-a871-4946-8ec5-c83420158896&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/cody-wilson-3-D-gun-book/2014/01/22/id/548430/", "title": "Creator of 3-D Printable Gun Lands Book Deal", "description": "Cody Wilson, who created the first fully 3D-printable gun last spring, has landed a quarter-million-dollar book deal with Simon & Schuster.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1390401034, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "cody wilson,3-D,gun,book", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-01-22T14:30:34"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/cody-wilson-3-D-gun-book/2014/01/22/id/548430/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Cody Wilson, who created the first fully 3D-printable gun last spring, has landed a quarter-million-dollar book deal with Simon & Schuster."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ff0\"", "article_summary": "\"We need an anonymous cash online,\" Wilson told the Journal, \"It's not that I want you to buy drugs.\na touchstone for the young, disaffected radical toward his own political and social development, that kind of thing.\n\"At least now if I'm in prison I'll have something to do,\" he joked to Forbes.\n\"Wilson, whose blueprints were downloaded 100,000 times in two days after he initially published them online, said his proposal drew mixed responses from publishers.\nIt's just that I think you should have the freedom to do it."}
