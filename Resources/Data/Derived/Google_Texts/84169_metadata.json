One mistake and your well-meaning company can have a very expensive problem on its hands.\n\nAs of July this year, the government made it quite clear that Employer Payment Plans are subject to penalties of up to $100 per employee per day. That\u2019s up to $36,500 a year per employee.\n\nFortunately, ensuring compliance with the federal government\u2019s Affordable Care Act is a relatively simple and straightforward process \u2014 as long as your small business stays informed and responds accordingly.\n\nHere are some facts in response to the underlying question we receive so often from small businesses: \u201cIs our health insurance reimbursement plan still OK?\u201d\n\nNot IRS Compliant\n\nEmployer Payment Plans \u2014 If you reimburse employees directly or pay for their premiums directly, your small business is not compliant\n\nStandalone Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) with two or more participants\n\nIRS Compliant\n\nTaxable bonuses or stipends for your employees\n\nStandalone Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) with only one participant\n\nSection 105 Healthcare Reimbursement Plans (HRPs)\n\nFacts About Healthcare Reimbursement Plans (HRPs)\n\nNearly 3 million U.S. small businesses do not offer traditional group health insurance. They are recognizing the financial benefits \u2014 to both employers and employees \u2014 and recruitment boost provided by Healthcare Reimbursement Plans (HRPs), which reside under IRS Tax Code 105. While traditional group health insurance works for some companies, HRPs are a key tool for many small businesses because:\n\nAn HRP is a group health plan set up by the employer, but it\u2019s not insurance coverage. Employees purchase their own plans and are reimbursed for eligible expenses.\n\nAn HRP is completely funded by the employer.\n\nReimbursements are tax-deductible.\n\nPayroll taxes (FICA/FUTA) are reduced.\n\nEmployees can use HRP funds on preventive care and personal health insurance expenses.\n\nYes, setting up an HRP for your small business initially requires a modest upfront time commitment, as the list of compliance requirements \u2014 including regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2014 is lengthy. Online software services designed for small businesses can make this process much easier, though.\n\nIn the long run, HRPs help employers conserve significant administrative hours on a monthly basis. Also, both the business and the employees save money, as HRPs are distributed tax-deductible and received tax-free.\n\nSmall businesses with fewer than 50 employees aren\u2019t required to provide health insurance support, but many view it as an important responsibility \u2014 one that high-quality professionals expect and appreciate in 2015.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned that your Healthcare Reimbursement Plan is still OK, determine whether it is IRS compliant.
