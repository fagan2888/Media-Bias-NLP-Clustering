You\u2019re exercising and out in the sun.\u201d\n\nStand-up paddleboarding has exploded in popularity the past few years. A sort of combination between surfing and kayaking, it has become a hit on oceans, lakes and rivers across the U.S. and beyond.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Outdoor Foundation recreation report, stand-up paddleboarding was the most popular outdoor activity for first-time participants, garnering 56 percent of the newbies among all outdoor activities last year.\n\nThe appeal is simple: It\u2019s relatively easy, available to a range of ages and can be done just about anywhere there\u2019s a body of water.\n\n\u201cI think the reason it\u2019s blowing up so much is there\u2019s no limitations,\u201d said RJ Murray, co-owner of Three Brothers Boards in Daytona Beach. \u201cAs long as you have a body of water, it doesn\u2019t matter where you are. People who lived away from the ocean and wanted to be in that environment never really had that option before paddleboarding.\u201d\n\nStand-up paddleboarding is not new. The ancient Hawaiians were believed to use it as transportation between islands and for fishing, while fishermen from Asia to South America have used forms of stand-up paddleboarding while working their catch.\n\nThe recent rise in popularity started with surfers and carried on with tourists in beach towns who then took the idea back to where they live.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard people wanted to do yoga classes on paddleboards, I was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u2019 \u201d said Murray, who started Three Brothers with his brother Justin in 2009. (A third brother, Jason, died earlier that year.) \u201cPeople are getting really creative with it. I can\u2019t imagine where it will be four years from now.\u201d\n\nThe equipment certainly has changed.\n\nBoards now are specifically designed for standup paddling, averaging 10 to 12 feet in length and contoured for easy balancing.\n\nSet up with a board that\u2019s the right size and calm water conditions, most first-timers only need about 10 minutes to feel comfortable and start paddling away. It gets a bit more difficult when there are waves or a current, but remains accessible to people from 7 to 77, according to Murray.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/hffit24.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb228\"", "article_summary": "The ancient Hawaiians were believed to use it as transportation between islands and for fishing, while fishermen from Asia to South America have used forms of stand-up paddleboarding while working their catch.\nAccording to a 2013 Outdoor Foundation recreation report, stand-up paddleboarding was the most popular outdoor activity for first-time participants, garnering 56 percent of the newbies among all outdoor activities last year.\nBoards now are specifically designed for standup paddling, averaging 10 to 12 feet in length and contoured for easy balancing.\nYou\u2019re exercising and out in the sun.\u201dStand-up paddleboarding has exploded in popularity the past few years.\nThe appeal is simple: It\u2019s relatively easy, available to a range of ages and can be done just about anywhere there\u2019s a body of water."}
