Co. of Jiangsu, China, since at least March 2013, according to emails detailed in a criminal complaint. They were seized by the FBI under a federal search warrant obtained in February.\n\nThe Chinese company has not been criminally charged. It could not immediately be reached for comment when the charges were announced Friday morning in Pittsburgh, which was late Friday night in China.\n\nThe Chinese company makes glass for automotive and other specialty purposes. An email from the company asked Rukavina if he had signed \u201cany type of confidential agreement and/or non-competitive agreement with PPG.\u201d\n\nRukavina responded by writing: \u201cWhen you join and when you leave PPG you are forced to sign these documents. (If) you followed these documents as written you could never work again.\u201d\n\nRukavina went on to write that he was \u201cforced out\u201d of his $170,000-a-year job and that had he not agreed to leave PPG, he would have received only $18,000 in severance pay instead of $100,000.\n\n\u201cIf PPG owns my brain for life then they should pay me 2 million per year to keep it!!\u201d he added.\n\nBryan Iams, PPG\u2019s vice president of corporate and government affairs, said the company is cooperating with authorities but declined to comment on the investigation itself.\n\n\u201cThe proprietary research and development work done by our scientists brings great value to our customers, and ultimately impacts our position in the competitive marketplace,\u201d Iams said.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Hickton echoed that, saying combatting intellectual property theft has been a priority under President Barack Obama and that the investigation was continuing.\n\n\u201cThe reason intellectual property theft is so offensive is because \u2026 it provides for our competitiveness and production and new frontiers in technology and ultimately provides jobs and opportunity,\u201d Hickton said. \u201cWe are not going to stand idly by and let it be stolen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, PPG learned of the thefts when one of its vendors was contacted by the Chinese company in February. In the course of those emails, a J.T.M.G. official told the vendor that the vendor was \u201cwell recommended by our friend in (the) US.\u201d That \u201cfriend\u201d was identified as Rukavina, who emailed the vendor identifying himself as \u201cTom Rukavina, Sr. Research Associate, PPG Industries\u201d despite being retired for nearly three years, the complaint said.\n\nPPG\u2019s chief technology officer told the FBI the various information Rukavina shared with the Chinese company would be worth \u201chundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d The plastic window product in question, OPTICOR, began development in 2004 \u201cand was the industry\u2019s first new transparent plastic in more than 50 years,\u201d PPG told the FBI.\n\nRukavina was arrested Thursday and appeared Friday before a federal magistrate in Pittsburgh, who scheduled a hearing Monday to determine whether he\u2019ll remain in custody.\n\nRukavina and his attorney declined to comment after the court appearance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A retired PPG employee apparently resentful at his departure three years ago stole trade secrets worth hundreds of millions of dollars for plastic windows used on aircraft and high-speed trains and shared some of the information with a Chinese company, the FBI said.", "Author": "JOE MANDAK", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/8/feds-ex-ppg-employee-stole-trade-secrets-for-chine/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A retired PPG employee apparently resentful at his departure three years ago stole trade secrets worth hundreds of millions of dollars for plastic windows used on aircraft and high-speed trains and shared some of the information with a Chinese company, the FBI said.", "title": "Feds: Ex-PPG employee stole trade secrets for Chinese firm"}, "twitter": {"title": "Feds: Ex-PPG employee stole trade secrets for Chinese firm", "description": "A retired PPG employee apparently resentful at his departure three years ago stole trade secrets worth hundreds of millions of dollars for plastic windows used on aircraft and high-speed trains and sh", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf00\"", "article_summary": "The Chinese company makes glass for automotive and other specialty purposes.\nThe Chinese company has not been criminally charged.\nThomas Rukavina, 62, of Plum, retired from PPG in July 2012 and had been in contact with J.T.M.G.\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - A retired PPG employee apparently resentful at his departure three years ago stole trade secrets worth hundreds of millions of dollars for plastic windows used on aircraft and high-speed trains and shared some of the information with a Chinese company, the FBI said.\n\u201cWe are not going to stand idly by and let it be stolen.\u201dAccording to the complaint, PPG learned of the thefts when one of its vendors was contacted by the Chinese company in February."}
