Hackers infiltrated the Brazilian federal police’s Twitter account on Saturday and posted a tweet about a bomb threat at the Mineirao Stadium hosting the Brazil-Chile World Cup game.

“The bomb threat at Mineirao was confirmed, the evacuation of the venue is not ruled out,” read the fake message that was later removed, Agence France-Presse reported.

The hacked message was posted about an hour before kickoff Saturday.

“The (Twitter) account of the Federal Police was hacked,” the agency said in a statement. “The information about a bomb scare at Mineirao Stadium on Saturday afternoon during the Brazil-Chile game was false.”

Brazil’s government websites and those related to the World Cup have been targeted by hackers in recent weeks, but nobody immediately took credit for this incident, the Associated Press said.
