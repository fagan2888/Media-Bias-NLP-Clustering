Still, as more for-profit and private-equity-backed addiction treatment centers enter the market, many longstanding providers are reluctant to welcome the profit-making newcomers.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of hand-wringing about it,\u201d Charles Ingoglia, senior vice president of the National Council for Behavioral Health, tells Behavioral Healthcare. \u201cWe need to be reassured that these aren\u2019t real estate deals, that there is commitment to access and science-based services.\u201d\n\nFor-profit and not-for-profit centers alike agree that the quality of the treatment remains the critical factor. Rather than setting a goal based on the number of intakes, leaders say, they want to aim for more high-quality care.\n\n\u201cThat means we have to be open to new models of service delivery and to recognize that in the marketplace of dealing with substance use disorder (SUD), there has to be room for a diversity of approaches and methodologies,\u201d says Herb Paine, a not-for-profit consultant in Phoenix.\n\nNo generalizations\n\nThere is bristling among SUD providers at the idea of positioning the specialty as a profit-making source for investors who are largely focused on financial payoff. According to Paine, however, that generalization might be a bit short-sighted because not all for-profits are measuring success by their investors\u2019 financial returns. Many in the SUD treatment business are using surplus to subsidize care for low-income patients in the form of scholarships. And he says centers that honestly want to provide good care shouldn\u2019t be immediately discounted specifically because of their business model.\n\nPricing can be a more serious sticking point. A community with higher-cost and lower-cost centers provides choice but can also separate patients by payment source, according to Paine. He says for those who can afford the private setting through robust insurance coverage or out-of-pocket financial resources, the for-profits are there to offer a broader range of therapeutic strategies \u201cwith environments that are cosmetically more attractive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs big as this industry is becoming, the reality is that the for-profits are well positioned to cater to the high-end patient,\u201d Paine says. \u201cSo you have a bifurcated system of treatment.\u201d\n\nThe question yet to be answered is how the for-profits will act in the future should their profits decrease, he says. Treatment services might be cut rather than amenities or marketing campaigns. As the industry continues to grow, centers of all types need long-term sustainability plans to survive, regardless of their size, scope or profit status.\n\nDick Dillon, CEO of Innovaision in St. Louis, says the bigger question is in not profit per se but how an organization uses the money it earns. A for-profit center can use its dollars to deliver better clinical care, just as a not-for-profit can use its incoming funds to enhance the business side of the organization.\n\n\u201cEven as a non-profit, you need to make some money over and above what it takes to deliver the service because you need to repair buildings and invest in new technologies, for example,\u201d Dillon says. \u201cIf you think about the EHR systems that agencies have to buy or develop these days, the money they need to do that can be substantial. So if you\u2019re not \u2018making any money\u2019 at the end of the day, you\u2019ll probably be in trouble.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, every center must be cognizant of whether it has enough capital to deliver the quality and the type of services they promise to deliver, Dillon says.\n\n\u201cSome for-profits have a primary goal of making money for other people,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there are also non-profits who are not doing a great job with the money they\u2019ve been given.\u201d\n\nThe crux of the argument is where the trade-off comes in. To attract investors, an organization must offer a return on investment. To satisfy commercial insurers, an organization must offer effective treatment. To earn a government contract, an organization must follow prescribed rules of governance and reporting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act, regardless,\u201d Dillon says.\n\nFuture of not-for-profits\n\nPaine says the not-for-profits will have a difficult future in the new era of healthcare expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the stand-alone, single program just ain\u2019t gonna make it,\u201d Paine says. \u201cTo be sustainable in the new healthcare market requires the non-profits to focus on the imperative to integrate with primary care. To be sustainable means you\u2019ve got to be able to demonstrate outcomes and that means you have to have metrics and the capability in technology to produce those metrics.\u201d Traditional non-profits don\u2019t typically have those tools at the ready, he says, and that\u2019s why so many smaller centers are being acquired by larger ones. In some cases, two centers might merge for economies of scale\u2014whether it\u2019s simply a good opportunity or to save one of them from closing its doors.\n\nThe more obvious reason why the single, not-for-profit is at risk is because the business model relies on public-sector funding, which historically fails to cover the true cost of delivering services, also which needs to be supplemented by hard-earned charitable contributions. When it comes to long-term SUD care, the public sector funding is even more difficult to secure.\n\nPaine anticipates fewer, but larger, not-for-profit centers. They aren\u2019t going to fade away, but they might have a harder time competing, he says.\n\nFuture of for-profits\n\nWith the expansion of healthcare coverage and increasing requirements from commercial insurers, for-profits might have certain advantages.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb35\"", "article_summary": "Still, as more for-profit and private-equity-backed addiction treatment centers enter the market, many longstanding providers are reluctant to welcome the profit-making newcomers.\nWhen it comes to long-term SUD care, the public sector funding is even more difficult to secure.\nMany in the SUD treatment business are using surplus to subsidize care for low-income patients in the form of scholarships.\nPaine anticipates fewer, but larger, not-for-profit centers.\nFuture of not-for-profitsPaine says the not-for-profits will have a difficult future in the new era of healthcare expansion under the Affordable Care Act."}
