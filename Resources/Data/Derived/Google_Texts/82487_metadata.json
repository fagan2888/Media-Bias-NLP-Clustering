A state team has already responded to 20 methamphetamine manufacturing operations this year \u2013 as many as it dealt with in all of 2013. Now their efforts have gotten a boost: A two-year, $905,000 federal grant will pay for four state agents who will focus exclusively on identifying and investigating complaints of suspected methamphetamine manufacturing.\n\nSecuring the competitive Justice Department funding is a big win for the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency. And nobody wants methamphetamine, an addictive drug that can cause aggression, delusions and brain damage, to gain a foothold here.\n\nAdditional Images Members of the state\u2019s Clandestine Drug Laboratory Enforcement Team seize evidence in Owls Head in 2013.

Instead, Maine has passed up opportunities to cut off methamphetamine makers at the source and to fund care for those addicted to the drug. The scope of substance abuse will only grow unless the state plans and funds a multi-pronged strategy to fight it.\n\nAccording to a 2013 state report, most methamphetamine produced in Maine comes from small-scale operations that can make small amounts in a short time by mixing ingredients in soda bottles or other plastic containers.\n\nThe key ingredient \u2013 pseudoephedrine \u2013 is familiar to law-abiding Americans, too, as an effective, over-the-counter drug for colds and allergies. So laws on pseudoephedrine have to keep it away from methamphetamine makers while still allowing access to the legitimately ill.\n\nThe first limits on the sale of pseudoephedrine involved putting it behind the counter, requiring ID for purchase and setting restrictions on the amount to be sold to any one customer. But none of those ideas worked in hard-hit Oregon.\n\nThen in 2006, that state put in place the nation\u2019s most restrictive law: one that allows pseudoephedrine to be sold by prescription only. The number of methamphetamine operations reported in the state has plummeted and remained low. The prescription-only law has also been effective in Mississippi, the federal Government Accountability Office concluded in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, prescription-only laws have failed in Maine and 22 other states. (Maine\u2019s bill to make pseudoephedrine a prescription drug died in committee in 2011.)\n\nThe measures Maine implemented instead \u2013 higher penalties for possession of specific quantities of pseudoephedrine and an electronic system to track individual compliance with purchase limits \u2013 aren\u2019t as effective as the prescription mandate, according to the 2013 GAO report.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Maine doesn\u2019t have many resources for residents who become addicted to methamphetamine \u2013 or any other drug. State funding for substance abuse programs has been cut back, and access to inpatient and outpatient treatment has become difficult. And we\u2019ve also lost out by repeatedly turning down federal Affordable Care Act funds to expand MaineCare, which would have included drug treatment.\n\nSubstance abuse is a vicious circle, and Maine can\u2019t stop it just by arresting people who make and sell drugs. The state also has to cut off the supply chain for drug producers and provide support to the people caught in the trap of addiction. We know more than ever what works and what doesn\u2019t \u2013 now we must provide the funding to put that knowledge to work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state has missed opportunities to cut off the supply chain and support those who get addicted.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The state has missed opportunities to cut off the supply chain and support those who get addicted.", "title": "Our View: Maine playing catch-up in anti-meth efforts - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/516665_merrill_meth_21.jpg", "height": 568}, "updated_time": "2014-10-10T19:55:14-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/10/our-view-maine-playing-catch-up-in-anti-meth-efforts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state has missed opportunities to cut off the supply chain and support those who get addicted.", "title": "Our View: Maine playing catch-up in anti-meth efforts - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/516665_merrill_meth_21.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Editorials", "published_time": "2014-10-10T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-10T19:55:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff19\"", "article_summary": "Securing the competitive Justice Department funding is a big win for the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency.\nMaine has already responded to as many methamphetamine operations this year \u2013 20 \u2013 as it did in all of 2013.\n(Maine\u2019s bill to make pseudoephedrine a prescription drug died in committee in 2011.)\nThe number of methamphetamine operations reported in the state has plummeted and remained low.\nSubstance abuse is a vicious circle, and Maine can\u2019t stop it just by arresting people who make and sell drugs."}
