David Vitter's Super PAC now can claim its first donor of over $100,000, and now has $1.79 million to boost his 2015 gubernatorial campaign, according to its latest financial filing with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nOn June 26, the Fund for Louisiana's Future picked up a $50,000 donation from the American Chemistry Council, bringing the group's total donations to $150,000. The council advocates for the chemical industry in Congress and elsewhere.\n\nIn May, New Orleans federal judge Martin Feldman ruled that, based on a 2010 Supreme Court ruling, Louisiana can't enforce its limit of $100,000 donations for advocacy groups. The High Court ruled that spending money on advocacy is an exercise of free speech, which cannot be regulated. Less than two months later, the American Chemistry Council broke the $100,000 donation threshold for the Vitter Super PAC.\n\nVitter was a key negotiator of a new chemical safety bill that remains stalled in the Senate. The bill is opposed by some environmental groups, but the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who had a long record promoting strong environmental laws, negotiated the legislation with Vitter and said it made significant improvements in chemical regulation.\n\nVitter's Senate campaign also donated $100,000 to his Super PAC during the last three-month reporting period, which ended June 30.\n\nOverall, the Fund for Louisiana's Future took in $623,968 in the three months through June 30, on top of $157,500 received in the first three months of 2014. That's brought the group's cash on hand to a robust $1,796,733.\n\nAmong the biggest donors for 2014, were $100,000 each from Tracy Krohn, CEO of W&T Offshore Inc. of Houston; and Daniel Heard, a retired investor from Houston. Since its creation in 2013, the Fund for Louisiana's Future has received five donations of $100,000 or more. Galliano Marine Services of Cut Off and GMAA LLC of New Orleans gave $100,000 in 2013.\n\nOther top donors during 2014 included Hilcorp Energy Co. of Houston, $45,000; 4K Marine LLC of Morgan City, $40,000 and Texas Petroleum Investments Co. of Houston, $30,000.
