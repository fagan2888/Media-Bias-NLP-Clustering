And therapies for rare diseases are among the most expensive on the market, with many enzyme replacement therapies used to treat rare genetic diseases fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Therefore, if legislators determine that these prices are exorbitant relative to the benefit they offer, then biopharma companies targeting these indications could be negatively affected as well.\n\nNow what: The regulatory and political risk healthcare companies face shouldn't be ignored by investors, but no one knows whether increased scrutiny will lead to legislation or what the real world impact of those policies may be. For that reason, investors may want to hesitate before drawing any short term conclusions regarding their portfolio.\n\nLet's not forget that investors who sold healthcare stocks because of worries related to the Affordable Care Act missed out on significant upside over the past five years. A better investing strategy than reacting to the latest press release out of Washington may be to focus on the long term demand growth tied to a larger, longer-living, and increasingly insured America.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "15:57", "date": "2015-09-28T19:57:00Z", "description": "Biopharma stocks continue to sell off on concern that political scrutiny will lead to less profitable medicine.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Todd Campbell", "promo": "Biopharma stocks continue to sell off on concern that political scrutiny will lead to less profitable medicine.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Biopharma stocks continue to sell off on concern that political scrutiny will lead to less profitable medicine.", "title": "Why Biotech Stocks Fell Sharply Today --  The Motley Fool"}, "tags": "Yahoo News", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Biopharma stocks continue to sell off on concern that political scrutiny will lead to less profitable medicine.", "title": "Why Biotech Stocks Fell Sharply Today --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/28/why-biotech-stocks-fell-sharply-today.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F180455%2Ftake-long-view.png&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Why Biotech Stocks Fell Sharply Today", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "5dfda1c0-6613-11e5-a7a9-0050569d4be0", "pitch": 2518, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2015 09 28", "tickers": "VRX", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Uproar following this article led to Presidential-hopeful Hillary Clinton outlining a plan, described here, to rein in sky-high drug prices.\nLet's not forget that investors who sold healthcare stocks because of worries related to the Affordable Care Act missed out on significant upside over the past five years.\nSo what: The news is the latest example of increasing political scrutiny following a recent New York Times article criticizing the practice of buying existing, neglected drugs and rebranding them with significant price increases.\nIf price-lowering legislation eventually gets the go-ahead, then it could weigh down the industry's profitability and result in biotech investors revising downward their sales and EPS forecasts.\nFor that reason, investors may want to hesitate before drawing any short term conclusions regarding their portfolio."}
