A new bond program, OMT, was announced one year ago and has no pre-set limits. Unlike SMP, the new plan is widely seen as a roaring success, sharply reducing bond yields without having to be used.\n\nBut the findings of a new ECB paper suggest the old SMP program wasn\u2019t so bad after all, and delivered more bang for the buck in terms of bond yields than asset purchase programs created by the Federal Reserve.\n\nA pair of ECB economists estimate for every 1 billion euros of \u201crepeated interventions\u201d in bond markets, the five-year government bond yield fell from a low of 0.01-0.02 percentage point (for Italy) to as much as 0.21 percentage point for Greece. Ireland, Spain and Portugal were somewhere in the middle.\n\n\u201cThese estimates\u2026are considerably larger than what is found in the literature for purchases of U.S. Treasuries during 2008-09 within the Federal Reserve\u2019s Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) program,\u201d authors Fabian Eser and Bernd Schwaab wrote. \u201cThis is intuitive given the differences in market sizes, liquidity, and default risk premia.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, there were \u201clarge and economically significant announcement effects,\u201d in May 2010 (when the ECB unveiled SMP) and August 2011 (when it was reactivated and expanded to include Italian and Spanish bonds), according to the paper.\n\nThe authors estimate that about three-quarters of the initial effect on bond yields lasted into the longer term.\n\nThe paper notes some caveats, especially when comparing ECB bond buying with asset purchases of the Fed and other central banks.\n\nThe ECB bought debt of stressed countries whose bond markets had grown illiquid, a contrast to the U.S. and U.K. bond markets. And bond markets in southern Europe and Ireland are by and large much smaller than in the U.S.\n\nIn the case of large asset purchases and quantitative easing by other central banks, the signaling effects of bond purchases are largely related to monetary policy.\n\n\u201cBond purchases under the SMP also send a signal,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cFirst, purchases may be interpreted to mean that the Eurosystem regards country yields as higher than justified based on country fundamentals,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAnother implication: \u201cPurchases may also be understood as a signal that the Eurosystem is willing to consider and implement non-conventional approaches to combat the crisis,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAll in all, a pretty favorable look-back at the SMP.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The ECB's now-defunct SMP bond plan has been widely dismissed by euro crisis observers as unsuccessful, but the findings of a new ECB paper suggest the old SMP program wasn't so bad after all.", "title": "ECB\u2019s Maligned SMP Bond Plan More Effective Than Fed Purchases, Paper Says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/10/ecbs-maligned-smp-bond-plan-more-effective-than-fed-purchases-paper-says/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/DE-AV024_eurozo_G_20130814165143.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "ECB\u2019s Maligned SMP Bond Plan More Effective Than Fed Purchases, Paper Says", "description": "The ECB's now-defunct SMP bond plan has been widely dismissed by euro crisis observers as unsuccessful, but the findings of a new ECB paper suggest the old SMP program wasn't so bad after all.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Brian Blackstone", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "The ECB's now-defunct SMP bond plan has been widely dismissed by euro crisis observers as unsuccessful, but the findings of a new ECB paper suggest the old SMP program wasn't so bad after all.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-10T16:30:44-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/10/ecbs-maligned-smp-bond-plan-more-effective-than-fed-purchases-paper-says/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-20319", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The ECB's now-defunct SMP bond plan has been widely dismissed by euro crisis observers as unsuccessful, but the findings of a new ECB paper suggest the old SMP program wasn't so bad after all.", "title": "ECB\u2019s Maligned SMP Bond Plan More Effective Than Fed Purchases, Paper Says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/10/ecbs-maligned-smp-bond-plan-more-effective-than-fed-purchases-paper-says/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/DE-AV024_eurozo_G_20130814165143.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-20319", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-10T16:30:44-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16e1\"", "article_summary": "The paper notes some caveats, especially when comparing ECB bond buying with asset purchases of the Fed and other central banks.\nThe ECB bought debt of stressed countries whose bond markets had grown illiquid, a contrast to the U.S. and U.K. bond markets.\nIn the case of large asset purchases and quantitative easing by other central banks, the signaling effects of bond purchases are largely related to monetary policy.\nUnlike SMP, the new plan is widely seen as a roaring success, sharply reducing bond yields without having to be used.\nA new bond program, OMT, was announced one year ago and has no pre-set limits."}
