Zuma Press\n\nChina\u2019s wildlife is vanishing at an alarming clip, a new report has found.\n\nThe Middle Kingdom\u2019s population of terrestrial vertebrates \u2013 including mammals, amphibians, birds, reptiles \u2013 has fallen by nearly one half over the past four decades, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nThat gloomy stat is in keeping with trends around the globe, which saw the number of vertebrates drop by 52% between 1970 and 2010, WWF said.\n\nAmong the animals in the Middle Kingdom tracked by the nonprofit\u2019s report, there were clear winners and losers. Reptiles and amphibians took the biggest hit during the 1970-2010 period, with their numbers dropping by a staggering 97%, in part because of the frenzied hunt for traditional Chinese medicine supplies and encroachment on their habits, the authors said. Likewise, numbers of forest mammals\u2014such as musk deer and snub-nosed monkeys\u2014fell by 78%.\n\nBirds, by contrast, fared better and in some cases actually thrived after years of harrowing losses under Mao Zedong, whose late-1950s \u201cfour pests\u201d campaign pushed China\u2019s sparrow population to the brink. The WWF found that the bird population staged an overall comeback since 1970, growing by 43% in part due to the expansion of nature reserves.\n\nThe report also found that China\u2019s demands on the environment have more than doubled since the 1970s, as the country\u2019s living standards have risen. China now requires an average of 2.2 global hectares of land per person to maintain its standard of living, the report found. (In the U.S., the number is around 7.) The figure represents the amount of terrain needed for crops, urbanization, logging, forest to absorb carbon dioxide emissions and more.\n\nIn 1980, less than one-fifth of China\u2019s population was living in cities and towns; by 2012, that figure had grown to more than one half, the WWF said.\n\nStill, one bright spot emerged in the study. In China, the rise in hectares of land per person needed to maintain living standards has been \u201crelatively small\u201d compared to the per-capita wealth in China\u2019s provinces, the report said. \u201cThis may be related to China\u2019s deep-rooted tradition of frugality,\u201d the authors wrote. As well, they found that the per-capita figure in Beijing and Shanghai has actually dropped, thanks to improved energy efficiency.\n\nThe report comes as Chinese state media have in recent weeks celebrated the news that some of the country\u2019s endangered animals, such as the Przewalski gazelle and a group of gibbons, have made small comebacks. The nation\u2019s most f\u00eated species, the giant panda, has also seen its ranks again swell by nearly 17% to around 2,000 within the past decade, according to the country\u2019s most recent survey.\n\nWhile some have criticized China for playing megafauna favorites in its love for pandas at the expense of other wildlife, recent research has found that the nation\u2019s bamboo-eater obsession has helped shield other species that also benefit from panda habitat conservation efforts.\n\n\u2013Te-Ping Chen.
