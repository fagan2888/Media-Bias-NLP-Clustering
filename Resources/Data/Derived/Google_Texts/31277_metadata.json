The question on the table was whether Carson should run for president.\n\n\n\nBill Millis, a real-estate developer, flew in from central North Carolina with a fellow property executive, David Couch. Jeffrey Reeter, a financial adviser, came from Houston. Terry Giles, a longtime Carson friend and political adviser, was there, as was Armstrong Williams, a conservative radio host who is also a longtime friend, and Dean Parker, a technology entrepreneur.\n\nAt least one megachurch pastor, whose identity the Carson campaign has declined to reveal, was there too.\n\n\u201cWe grilled him pretty good,\u201d said Reeter, who now runs a pro-Carson Super Pac, in an interview in a car traveling to last month\u2019s Republican debate in California. \u201cBecause I needed to know where his heart was, where his faith was.\n\n\u201cWe came away from that time in Florida just blown away by his heart. And I think \u2026 talking about somebody else\u2019s faith is \u2026 you have to be careful. But what you\u2019re looking for, in my opinion, in this situation, is the heart, and sincerity.\n\n\u201cDr Carson is truly sincere in his faith.\u201d\n\nA dazzling two-month surge in the presidential race by Carson \u2013 who is lapping most of his Republican rivals in favorability, familiarity rating and fundraising \u2013 has campaign insiders feeling that the presidential nomination is within reach.\n\nAnd the Carson team senses a major, untapped opportunity. While the candidate can be vague or fluttery on the debate stage, the campaign has noted that in smaller settings, the master surgeon plies a bedside manner that is forceful and assured.\n\nIt appears to us that the evangelicals have not realized the magnitude of his faith, or the sincerity of his faith Jeffrey Reeter\n\nCarson\u2019s bedside manner is particularly effective, they have observed, at connecting with voters in search of a leader who shares their Christian values. Many of those voters, in turn, remain uncommitted, four months from the Iowa caucuses and 401 days until the election.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt appears to us that the evangelicals have not realized the magnitude of his faith, or the sincerity of his faith, and how strong a believer he is, his evangelical faith,\u201d said Reeter, whose group is called For Our Children\u2019s Future.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic that they will discover that and understand that. It\u2019s not something that he will pound the gavel about or take the pulpit about.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s campaign staff, however, still sense a major challenge at hand. Speaking independently, multiple members of the Carson team said the candidate will need to improve his performance in debates, and to avoid controversies like the one set off by his statement last month that a Muslim should not be president.\n\n\u201cBen is a brilliant man, absolutely brilliant,\u201d said Harold Doley, an ambassador in the Ronald Reagan administration and a Carson friend of 20 years. \u201cBut he is not accustomed to thinking and speaking in sound bites. And that\u2019s really to his disadvantage. He\u2019s doing a lot better in that regard, but that takes a lot of practice.\u201d\n\nThe campaign insiders feel pressure to unveil major policy proposals, such as a novel budget plan they expect to roll out later this month. They acknowledge a need to build out their national organization and to persuade influential Republican officials \u2013 none of whom have yet come out on behalf of Carson \u2013 to pledge support.\n\nIn the meantime, Carson is leaving some donors \u201cin awe\u201d.\n\nOn Monday night, Millis co-hosted a fundraiser at a private residence in Charlotte, North Carolina, for more than 230 people.\n\n\n\n\u201cA number of those people knew of Dr Carson pretty well,\u201d Millis said. \u201cOthers came because somebody twisted their arm and said, \u2018Come hear this man speak.\u2019 When they came in, I\u2019m sure many of them didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n\n\u201cBut as they left, two-and-a-half hours later, they were just in awe. I mean, they could not believe that there could be anyone like Dr Carson running for the highest office in this land. I wish I could have taped the comments that these people said.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen evangelicals and social conservatives realize who Carson is, his campaign believes, alternative candidates such as Texas senator Ted Cruz, Florida senator Marco Rubio and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee could fall away, with Carson emerging as the 2016 standard-bearer for values voters.\n\nCapturing the evangelical vote could be especially valuable to Carson in the form of a win in Iowa, the first state to vote, where more than a third of caucus participants identify as social conservatives. The last two Republicans to win the Iowa caucuses, former senator Rick Santorum and Huckabee, did so thanks in part to the strength of their support among evangelicals.\n\nRussell Moore, president of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, said Carson\u2019s name had come up repeatedly, among others, in conversations with evangelical leaders about the 2016 candidates.\n\n\u201cI often hear his name among evangelicals as they\u2019re considering candidates, for a number of reasons,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThere\u2019s a good bit of affection for Ben Carson in terms of contrast with Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cCarson has the sort of quiet gravity that evangelicals will often speak of as \u2018meekness\u2019, in terms of the definition that Jesus gives as meekness.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s positions on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage track broadly with most social conservatives, although Carson has had to answer questions about past statements supporting abortion in cases of \u201csevere medical problems\u201d.\n\nCarson\u2019s appeal with evangelicals could be limited in other ways. His church, the Seventh-Day Adventist, is dismissed by some mainstream Christians for its relatively recent emergence, in the 19th century, and its unorthodox views, including observation of the sabbath on Saturday instead of Sunday.\n\nBut there has been no indication so far that such reservations would overcome the spark of recognition that many Christian supporters have had in encountering Carson in settings sufficiently intimate to allow room for his personal story, and personal spiritual testimony.\n\nRobert J Brown, a top Carson adviser who served as Richard Nixon\u2019s chief adviser on race relations, said the candidate\u2019s dramatic biography \u2013 the son of a single mother who leapt racial barriers and left poverty behind to become a historically distinguished pediatric neurosurgeon \u2013 offered a key to his spirituality.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a man who, time and time again, had the nerve and the compassion, and the spiritual guidance, to open up children\u2019s brains,\u201d Brown said. \u201cStuff that years ago was unthinkable. And make it happen.\n\n\u201cThat not only takes a lot of nerve, but you\u2019ve got to be a person who really is communing with the higher power, and making sure that your hands are steady and that your brain is right, and that your life is right.\u201d\n\nCarson is not relying on values voters alone for success \u2013 his support at this stage is much wider. On Wednesday, the Carson campaign announced it had raised more than $20m in the last three months, compared with $12m for the erstwhile establishment pick, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\n\nIn terms of net favorability among GOP voters, Carson is nearly 20 points ahead of his closest rival, Rubio, charting a crushing plus-58 by Gallup\u2019s measurement. The surge of support for Carson has been strong enough to push him into second place in national polling averages, behind frontrunner Trump, whose lead Carson has been steadily shaving.\n\n\u2018The evangelical gatekeepers are less important politically\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carson speaks in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

And so they were handed to the Republican party by evangelical leaders. Whereas now, the party knows how to access them directly, so the evangelical gatekeeper leaders are less important politically.\n\n\u201cI just think all that adds up to a more diffuse effect.\u201d\n\nTimothy Hagle, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, said it would be a mistake to characterize the state as up for grabs for any candidate who manages to win evangelicals alone.\n\nIn particular, Hagle said, it could be difficult to distinguish between the evangelical vote and the anti-establishment vote.\n\n\u201cCarson seems to benefit from maybe the folks that like that you\u2019re going to get some straight talk, that you\u2019re not so polished, no political double-speak or however you would characterize it,\u201d said Hagle.\n\n\u201cThe question will be for him whether he can learn quickly enough to avoid missteps of various sorts, and a good example of that is what\u2019s been happening with his comments about whether a Muslim could be president.\n\nHe\u2019s actually educated a population that I don\u2019t think is very familiar with all the tenets of the Muslim faith David Couch\n\n\u201cHis point, when he clarified it, made a certain amount of sense. But the way it was phrased initially of course opened him up to immediate criticism.\u201d\n\nThe biggest controversy of Carson\u2019s candidacy so far sprang up after a 20 September interview on NBC in which he said: \u201cI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.\u201d\n\nThe candidate later said he was only talking about Muslims who did not reject Sharia law and other precepts he considered anti-constitutional.\n\n\u201cI would have problems with somebody who embraced all the doctrines associated with Islam,\u201d he told CNN last week.\n\nCouch, the CEO of a real-estate development, management and contruction company, said he had accepted Carson\u2019s clarification.\n\n\u201cI loved what he had to say, when he was given the opportunity to expand on his ideas,\u201d said Couch. \u201cHe\u2019s actually educated a population that I don\u2019t think is very familiar with all the tenets of the Muslim faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nRobert Brown and others expressed confidence that the force of Carson\u2019s Christian faith, and the gist of his meaning, would pierce through his occasional missteps of delivery.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a man who\u2019s been through all of the rigors of life that people say that they could never handle, that most people could never handle,\u201d said Brown. \u201cAnd here he is standing tall. Standing tall.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Despite missteps over Muslims and quiet debates, the retired neurosurgeon is running high in the polls.
