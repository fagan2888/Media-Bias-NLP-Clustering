Scratch that, TWO things different about him these days, and they are both attached to his shoulders.\n\nThe Colorado man who lost both his arms 40 years ago in an electrical accident is now the first double shoulder-level amputee to be fitted both fully and wirelessly with two Modular Prosthetic Limbs (MPLs) at once, as part of a test trial conducted by the Revolutionizing Prosthetics Program at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, according to Engadget.com.\n\nBaugh, who underwent intense training and worked with a virtual system to prepare his body and mind for the fitting, received his arms this summer and used them to demonstrate simple tasks such as holding and lifting a cup.\n\n\u201cThe speed with which he learned motions and the number of motions he was able to control in such a short period of time was far beyond expectation,\u201d researcher Courtney Moran told Engadget.com. \u201cWhat really was amazing, and was another major milestone with MPL control, was his ability to control a combination of motions across both arms at the same time. This was a first for simultaneous bimanual control.\u201d\n\nBaugh can control the arms using his thoughts and intuition. Both provide him with 30 degrees of motion and are equipped with the full three degrees of freedom, which are joints that allow Baugh to bend and rotate the MPLs.\n\n\u201cMaybe for once, I\u2019ll be able to put change in a pop machine and get the pop out of it,\u201d Baugh said in the video. \u201cSimple things like that that most people never think of.\u201d\n\nThe arms are only available to Baugh right now in the laboratory, though the program is working to make a set of arms for him to take home in the near future.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "double, amputee, becomes, first, patient, receive, two, bionic, arms, once", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Leslie Baugh is the first shoulder-level double amputee to receive two modular prosthetic limbs at once.", "title": "Double Amputee Receives First-Ever Pair Of Bionic Arms [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/double-amputee-becomes-first-patient-receive-two-bionic-arms-once-314804", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/18/double-amputee.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Leslie Baugh is the first shoulder-level double amputee to receive two modular prosthetic limbs at once.", "title": "Double Amputee Receives First-Ever Pair Of Bionic Arms [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/double-amputee-becomes-first-patient-receive-two-bionic-arms-once-314804", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/18/double-amputee.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/18/double-amputee.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-18T11:45:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T11:45:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Leslie Baugh is the first shoulder-level double amputee to receive two modular prosthetic limbs at once."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb35b\"", "article_summary": "Scratch that, TWO things different about him these days, and they are both attached to his shoulders.\nThis was a first for simultaneous bimanual control.\u201dBaugh can control the arms using his thoughts and intuition.\n\u201cWhat really was amazing, and was another major milestone with MPL control, was his ability to control a combination of motions across both arms at the same time.\n\u201cMaybe for once, I\u2019ll be able to put change in a pop machine and get the pop out of it,\u201d Baugh said in the video.\n\u201cSimple things like that that most people never think of.\u201dThe arms are only available to Baugh right now in the laboratory, though the program is working to make a set of arms for him to take home in the near future."}
