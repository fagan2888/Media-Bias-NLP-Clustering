Arunachalam Muruganantham, a native of Tamil Nadu, India, asked his wife why she didn\u2019t use a sanitary napkin after he saw her carrying a dirty rag to the bathroom. His wife responded by saying, if she did, her family would not have enough money to buy milk.\n\nMuruganantham realized his wife wasn\u2019t exaggerating after he went to the store himself. He found that one sanitary napkin was sold for the equivalent of 67 cents and that this was 40 times the actual cost of the raw material. So, Muruganantham decided to take matters into his own hands and build a machine that would produce sanitary napkins for women all over India.\n\n\u201cYoung girls stop going to school after puberty because they don't have access to reliable sanitary pads. They use dangerously unhealthy substances like sand, ash and even hay during their menses, leading to numerous diseases. By providing them these pads, we can educate, employ and empower scores of women across the country,\u201d Muruganantham told The New Indian Express.\n\nThe unit he created is a grinder-type machine that breaks down cellulose fluid into a soft cotton-looking material. It is then converted into rectangular squares using another machine. The pads are wrapped into a non-woven cloth and then disinfected. The entire unit is capable of making 120 sanitary pads per hour.\n\nThis past April, TIME magazine recognized Muruganantham as one of the 100 most influential people in the world \u2014 he shares the spotlight with people like Narendra Modi, Arvind Kejriwal, and Arundhati Roy.\n\nSo far, Muruganantham has made over 1,300 sanitary napkin machines in 11 countries, along with India, and employs over 12,500 women. \"When I first got a mail from TIME magazine, I thought it was spam. You know, I keep getting these mails that say I have won ten million dollars, and then when I click on them, they ask for my credit card number,\u201d he said. \u201cLater, when I showed the mail to one of my colleagues, he shook my hand and congratulated me. That is when I realised that it was for real.\u201d\n\nHowever, Muruganantham\u2019s success was not something that happened overnight. He felt criticism and could see the looks people in his family were giving him. The prototype-testing with the blood-filled goat bladder in his pants did not sit well with others. \u201cI was left all alone in life, but I wasn't disheartened even for a minute,\u201d he said. His wife even filed for divorce.\n\nHe worked five long years on this project and was eventually rewarded. Muruganantham collaborated with a textile owner in Coimbatore, and he was then entered into the National Innovation Award Competition held at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. He won the award out of 943 entries. The people who mocked him eventually apologized, and his wife came back.\n\n\u201cOnly 12 percent of the women in the country use sanitary napkins today. Using my machines and an all-women business model, I want the technology to reach all women in India,\u201d he said\n\nTake a look at one of Muruganantham's many talks below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "arunachalam muruganantham, sanitary napkin, pad, period", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After seeing so many women suffer from the use of unsanitary pads, a man from India decided to build a machine that would lower the cost and increase the production of sanitary napkins.", "title": "Meet The Man Who Got His Period, And Influenced Billions [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-who-got-his-period-develops-low-cost-sanitary-napkins-voted-time-influential-person-287804", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/man-develop-pad-machine.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After seeing so many women suffer from the use of unsanitary pads, a man from India decided to build a machine that would lower the cost and increase the production of sanitary napkins.", "title": "Meet The Man Who Got His Period, And Influenced Billions [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-who-got-his-period-develops-low-cost-sanitary-napkins-voted-time-influential-person-287804", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/man-develop-pad-machine.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/man-develop-pad-machine.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-11T16:37:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T16:39:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After seeing so many women suffer from the use of unsanitary pads, a man from India decided to build a machine that would lower the cost and increase the production of sanitary napkins."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c79\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYoung girls stop going to school after puberty because they don't have access to reliable sanitary pads.\nHe found that one sanitary napkin was sold for the equivalent of 67 cents and that this was 40 times the actual cost of the raw material.\nThe entire unit is capable of making 120 sanitary pads per hour.\nMuruganantham realized his wife wasn\u2019t exaggerating after he went to the store himself.\nSo far, Muruganantham has made over 1,300 sanitary napkin machines in 11 countries, along with India, and employs over 12,500 women."}
