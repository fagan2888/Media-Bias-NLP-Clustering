A 49-year-old man allegedly confronted the son of his girlfriend at his Arapahoe County apartment Friday night, pulled out a gun and shot the younger man.

Samuel Knox, 37, was taken to a local hospital, treated for a gunshot wound to the leg and released Saturday morning, said Capt. Larry Etheridge of the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Department.

The shooter, Rodney Lewis, was arrested and taken to the Denver Police Department. Lewis faces five charges: criminal attempt murder in the first degree, first degree assault, felony menacing, reckless endangerment and possesion of a weapon by a previous offender.

According to the sheriff’s office, Lewis knocked on the younger man’s door in an apartment complex at 2172 S. Trenton Way at 10:58 p.m. Friday.

The two men began arguing. It’s unclear at this point what the subject of the argument was. The victim’s mother was not present at the time.

The alleged assailant pulled out a handgun, pointed it at his girlfriend’s son and threatened to kill him. He then fired two shots. One of the bullets struck the younger man in the leg.

Lewis, who fled the apartment, was caught at 12:45 p.m. Friday in Denver. He was carrying a gun, according to authorities.
