(Photo: AP)\n\nMy husband and I were traveling with our mentally and physically challenged child at 6 a.m on Aug. 9. While going through security at the Des Moines airport, TSA felt the need to pat her down and do an extra search because of an expired and temporary ID.\n\nReason or common sense is beyond the agents\u2019 or their management\u2019s understanding at this airport. Neither Boston nor Chicago felt the need to do this special search.\n\nThey also took the child ahead and began to explain the procedure without waiting for me or my husband. They were totally out of touch with the mentally challenged, as the child had no idea what was happening.\n\nTSA needs to be diligent when it comes to threats, but this was no threat; this was just agents and management that had zero common sense.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1TtaMNu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mentally, physically challenged child is subjected to additional searches at D.M. airport", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Mentally, physically challenged child is subjected to additional searches at D.M. airport", "title": "Des Moines TSA not sensitive to special needs", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/08/13/tsa-search-disabeled-child-oliver/31591665/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mentally, physically challenged child is subjected to additional searches at D.M. airport", "title": "Des Moines TSA not sensitive to special needs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee98c57c22933a67586e23d1795274a03c74dac7/c=402-0-1999-1597&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/532e6720754d9a00bc2deb4d9a8aa8971f5666d4/c=601-0-1799-1597/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3303b1ac57f687d1458cd9f98a0e47a525fc0c6d/c=402-0-1999-1597/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e35fd86d7013c5ce9556fc41ff7202d02e821b0/c=136-0-2265-1597/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c64c562525e8ef054192b776112e2201ad981d5/c=0-124-2400-1474&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-12T23:14:15.840000-05:00", "shorthed": "TSA not sensitive to special needs", "articleid": 31591665, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24b9fd2588f131a3ac6a181c6622996e3e48005d/c=0-124-2400-1474/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d161026c40557afeaae9f390c7cd6fecc35c8839/c=751-0-1649-1597/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318436230Z.1_20150812225153_000_GP4B4K87A.4-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "data", "title": "Des Moines TSA not sensitive to special needs", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Jennifer Oliver and Sean Stuart, Hingham, Mass."}}, "article_summary": "TSA needs to be diligent when it comes to threats, but this was no threat; this was just agents and management that had zero common sense.\nWhile going through security at the Des Moines airport, TSA felt the need to pat her down and do an extra search because of an expired and temporary ID.\n(Photo: AP)My husband and I were traveling with our mentally and physically challenged child at 6 a.m on Aug. 9.\nThey were totally out of touch with the mentally challenged, as the child had no idea what was happening.\nNeither Boston nor Chicago felt the need to do this special search."}
