They did this by attaching \u201ca wearable sensing system\u201d \u2013 a collar outfitted with a hermetically sealed tri-axial accelerometer and four gigabytes of built-in memory \u2013 to each of their subjects.\n\nSign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nThe researchers tracked 17 specific actions and activities, including barking, drinking, eating, running, sniffing and walking, as well as peeing and pooping (to use the unscientific terminology).\n\nBy mapping behavioral benchmarks for healthy, happy dogs, the researchers hope to develop a way to use a dog\u2019s health and behavior as an \u201cearly warning system\u201d that its owner may be ill, bored or otherwise struggling.\n\n\u201cA dog\u2019s physical and emotional dependence on their owner means that their well-being likely reflects that of their owner,\u201d explains Nils Hammerla, a behavior imaging expert on the research team. \u201cAny changes \u2013 such as the dog being walked less often, perhaps not being fed regularly, or simply demonstrating \u2018unhappy\u2019 behavior \u2013 could be an early indicator for families that an older relative needs help.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s ultimate goal is to develop technology that can help older people live independently for longer without intruding on their privacy. \u201cThis is just the first step,\u201d says lead researcher Cas Ladha, \u201cbut the idea behind this research is that it would allow us to discreetly support people without the need for cameras.\u201d\n\nMaybe you never imagined that your dog could become a high-tech health barometer, but the more I think about it, the more I like the idea. I don\u2019t think I want anyone else \u2013 even if they are my relatives \u2013 watching a cam that captures me shuffling around the house in my boxer shorts.\n\nTruth be told, the only person I will ever allow to see that is my dog.\n\nPhoto: tanakawho via Wikimedia\n\nGet discounts on health and wellness products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Researchers at Newcastle University in England are onto something big: Your dog may know lots more about how you\u2019re feeling \u2013 and about how you\u2019re doing generally \u2013 that anyone has heretofore believed.
