It honored them,\u201d Kooiman said on Fox & Friends Saturday morning. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t seem fair, especially\u2014and we\u2019re going to talk a little bit later in the show too about some things that are continuing to be funded. And President Obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture out of his own pocket, yet it\u2019s the Republican National Committee who\u2019s paying for this.\u201d\n\nIn the fake story, Obama presses furloughed workers to kill time learning about Islam:\n\n\u201cThe Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect. We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So during this shutdown, now is a great time to learn about the faith of Islam. I encourage all of you to celebrate the Muslim community, the \u2018Sunnah\u2019 and the magic of the \u2018Quran\u2019. All of this can be found at the newly re-opened International Museum of Muslim Cultures.\u201d\n\nKooiman addressed the issue on Twitter:\n\nWatch the full clip below, via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[h/t HuffPost]\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Report strikes again.
