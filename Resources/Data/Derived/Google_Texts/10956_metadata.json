In Sheepshead Bay, there are 13,803 residents without health insurance, according to the report. The Brooklyn neighborhoods with the greatest number of uninsured are Bushwick (22 percent) and Sunset Park (16.3 percent). Citywide, the comptroller\u2019s report found that 962,805 people, 11.4 percent of residents, are without health insurance.\n\n\u201cClose to one million New York City residents lack even the most basic health coverage,\u201d Stringer said in a press release. \u201cTo ensure the long-term economic future of our City we need to make sure our residents are healthy and well. We want to get the word out: with the Affordable Care Act in place, getting health insurance is easier and more affordable than ever.\u201d\n\nThe comptroller\u2019s report was timed to coincide with the beginning of the Affordable Care Act open enrollment period, which runs from November 1, through December 15 for coverage to begin on January 1, 2016. Enrollment will remain open through January 31, 2015 for coverage to begin March 1, 2016.\n\nWhile the amount of uninsured New Yorker\u2019s still hovers above 10 percent, the number has fallen steadily since the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was signed into law in 2010.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen real progress in reducing the number of City residents who are covered, but we must continue to reinforce that being uninsured can have real economic and health consequences for you and your family,\u201d Stringer said.\n\nNew Yorker\u2019s can find out how to apply for health insurance through the state\u2019s online marketplace. The Brooklyn Public Library also provides free healthcare navigator services at several branches. The Kings Highway Library, located at 2115 Ocean Avenue, hosts a health insurance navigator on Mondays, from 10am \u2013 6pm, Tuesdays, 12pm \u2013 7pm, Wednesdays, 10am \u2013 6pm, and the first Saturdays of ever month, from 10am \u2013 3pm.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Sheepshead Bites", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2015/11/10-percent-of-sheepshead-bay-residents-dont-have-health-insurance-comptroller-finds/", "article_author_name": "Alex Ellefson", "image": "http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mm_emmons_aerial_2_Leon-Lipkovich-702x527.jpg", "site_id": "c8314919a70945b36bd4e81ed4b03d73", "article_published_time": "2015-11-10T17:07:46+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T22:02:17+00:00", "keywords": "health insurance, nyc comptroller scott stringer, obamacare, patient protection and affordable care act, comptroller health insurance, health, news", "wp_version": "7.6.1.7"}, "description": "On in ten Sheepshead Bay residents do not have health insurance, according to figures released Monday by Comptroller Scott Stringer.", "og": {"site_name": "Sheepshead Bites", "description": "On in ten Sheepshead Bay residents do not have health insurance, according to figures released Monday by Comptroller Scott Stringer.", "title": "10 Percent Of Sheepshead Bay Residents Lack Health Insurance, Comptroller Finds - Sheepshead Bay News Site", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mm_emmons_aerial_2_Leon-Lipkovich-e1447174753229.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2015-11-10T13:07:51-04:00", "url": "http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2015/11/10-percent-of-sheepshead-bay-residents-dont-have-health-insurance-comptroller-finds/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 1071163781}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sb_logo_new.png", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "patient protection and affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-11-10T12:07:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T13:07:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In Sheepshead Bay, there are 13,803 residents without health insurance, according to the report.\n\u201cClose to one million New York City residents lack even the most basic health coverage,\u201d Stringer said in a press release.\nCitywide, the comptroller\u2019s report found that 962,805 people, 11.4 percent of residents, are without health insurance.\nNew Yorker\u2019s can find out how to apply for health insurance through the state\u2019s online marketplace.\nOne in ten residents living in Community District 15, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Gerritsen, Manhattan Beach, and parts of Gravesend, do not have health insurance, according to figures released Monday by Comptroller Scott Stringer."}
