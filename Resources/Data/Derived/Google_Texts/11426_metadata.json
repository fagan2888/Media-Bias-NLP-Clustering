It is the 47th county to do so, leaving just 11 without policies that offer robust non-emergency care. Contra Costa Cares, approved as a one-year pilot program that will initially serve up to 3,000 people, will provide residents with a \u201cmedical home\u201d at a community health center, complete with benefits that include regular checkups, immunizations, mental health services and a nurse advice line.\n\n\u201cIt will mean better health care access for all, improved public health, lower cost to our health care system, and it\u2019s just the right thing to do for people, especially undocumented adults who are not covered under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d county supervisor John Gioia told KQED.\n\nUndocumented adults are not permitted to apply for federally-subsidized insurance or purchase their own coverage via the state health exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. That means they are often left with emergency care as their only option for affordable care. Their citizen children are eligible for coverage under their Affordable Care Act, but kids who share their parents\u2019 undocumented status are not.\n\nBut several Californian counties are already covering all children. In June, Governor Jerry Brown and the state legislature arrived at a deal that will begin funding public coverage for low-income undocumented children starting next spring. Advocacy group Health Access estimates that there are still 1 million uninsured undocumented immigrants in California.\n\n(H/t NPR)", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "County officials say that offering preventative services to adult undocumented immigrants will lower costs and improve overall public health.", "description": "County officials say that offering preventative services to adult undocumented immigrants will lower costs and improve overall public health.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "Kenrya Rankin Naasel", "og": {"site_name": "Colorlines", "description": "County officials say that offering preventative services to adult undocumented immigrants will lower costs and improve overall public health.", "title": "California is Rapidly Extending Public Health Care to Undocumented Immigrants", "url": "https://www.colorlines.com/articles/california-rapidly-extending-public-health-care-undocumented-immigrants", "image": "https://www.colorlines.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_lead_normal/public/images/2015/09/Contra%20Costa%20California%20health%20care%20undocumented%20immigrants%209-25-15.jpg?itok=Memzoxu6", "updated_time": "2015-09-30T14:11:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "County officials say that offering preventative services to adult undocumented immigrants will lower costs and improve overall public health.", "creator": "@colorlines", "url": "https://www.colorlines.com/articles/california-rapidly-extending-public-health-care-undocumented-immigrants", "image": "https://www.colorlines.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_lead_normal/public/images/2015/09/Contra%20Costa%20California%20health%20care%20undocumented%20immigrants%209-25-15.jpg?itok=Memzoxu6", "title": "California is Rapidly Extending Public Health Care to Undocumented Immigrants", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dcterms.identifier": "https://www.colorlines.com/articles/california-rapidly-extending-public-health-care-undocumented-immigrants", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-25T12:46-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/colorlines", "tag": "Undocumented Immigrants", "published_time": "2015-09-25T12:46:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-30T14:11:08-04:00"}, "news_keywords": "#Health4All, California, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Contra Costa County, Undocumented Immigrants", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dcterms.title": "California is Rapidly Extending Public Health Care to Undocumented Immigrants"}, "article_summary": "Earlier this week, Contra Costa County\u2014which is just east of San Francisco\u2014voted to provide public primary health care services to adult undocumented immigrants.\n\u201cIt will mean better health care access for all, improved public health, lower cost to our health care system, and it\u2019s just the right thing to do for people, especially undocumented adults who are not covered under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d county supervisor John Gioia told KQED.\nThat means they are often left with emergency care as their only option for affordable care.\nUndocumented adults are not permitted to apply for federally-subsidized insurance or purchase their own coverage via the state health exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act.\nTheir citizen children are eligible for coverage under their Affordable Care Act, but kids who share their parents\u2019 undocumented status are not."}
