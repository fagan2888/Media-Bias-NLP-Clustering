Al-Shabaab has attacked a shopping center in the past. It claimed responsibility for the 2103 attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, which killed 62 and injured over 120.\n\nThe video prompted Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to specifically warn about the danger of shopping there, and to call on Congress to finally pass a bill to fund his Department, which will run out of money on February 27.\n\nRelated: Tom Ridge Says U.S> Terror Risk Now Higher than After 9/11\n\n\u201cI would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America Today, they\u2019ve got to be particularly careful,\u201d Johnson said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThere will be enhanced security that will be apparent to people who go there but public vigilance, public awareness, and public caution about situations like this is particularly important. It\u2019s the environment we\u2019re in, frankly.\u201d\n\nDHS, which oversees border security, air and marine transport security, the Federal Emergency Management Administration myriad other functions, is operating on a short-term funding bill that expires at the end of the week. It was not fully funded, because Republicans, at the end of 2014, decided that they wanted to use the leverage that comes with the threat of defunding the important agency to pressure President Obama to undo several executive orders that ease the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe House passed a DHS funding bill that has language attached barring the executive branch from using any money to fund the executive actions taken by the president. However, Democrats in the Senate have blocked a vote on the measure in that chamber. President Obama has also promised to veto a bill defunding his actions should it reach his desk.\n\nRelated: ISIS Turns to Chemical Weapons as It Loses Ground\n\nAsked by CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger what would happen is DHS funding is not renewed by the end of the week, Johnson said, \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that we\u2019re even having this conversation about Congress\u2019s inability to fund Homeland Security in these challenging times. But if by the end of the week Congress has not funded the Department of Homeland Security, we will have to furlough some 30,000 workers, mostly at headquarters. People on the front line \u2013 aviation security, maritime security \u2013 will be forced to come to work without a paycheck and so for the working men and women of my dept. is very significant vey serious and congress needs to appreciate that.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he said, DHS\u2019s grant-making process, which funds programs in law enforcement agencies of all sizes across the country \u201cgrinds to a halt.\u201d The Federal Emergency Management Administration, he said, in the midst of a very harsh winter, \u201cwill have to furlough something like 80 percent of its permanent appropriated workforce.\u201d\n\nThe battle over DHS funding was complicated last week by a federal judge in Brownsville, Texas, who issued a ruling declaring the president\u2019s executive orders illegal, and issued an injunction barring the government from enforcing them.\n\nJohnson characterized the president\u2019s actions as simply admitting the reality of an existing situation and trying to make the best of it. Among other things, the plan would allow several million undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes and who have led productive lives in the U.S. for years, to apply for a work permit, bringing them into the open and, among other things, collecting taxes from them.\n\nRelated: We\u2019ve Just Told ISIS Exactly What We\u2019re Going to Do\n\nThese are people, he said, who \u201cwill not be deported in any administration, Republican or Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe administration, he said, would challenge the ruling. \u201cThis is what appellate courts are for,\u201d Johnson said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cWe will be seeking an emergency stay, probably tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will appeal and we will seek a stay so that we can go back to implementation of our efforts to build accountability in the non-documented community.\u201d\n\nProminent Republicans appeared on several programs Sunday to call for a clean DHS funding bill, even offering the court case as a way to justify dropping the immigration riders.\n\nRelated: U.S. Marines on the Ground in Iraq as ISIS Burns 45 Alive\n\n\u201cI am willing and ready to pass a DHS funding bill and let this play out in court,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently announced that he would seek the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. \u201cThe worst possible outcome for this nation is to defund the Department of Homeland Security, given the multiple threats we face to our Homeland and I will not be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thought the House of Representatives, whose Republican members are strongly against the President\u2019s moves on immigration, would go along, he said, \u201cI hope my House colleagues will understand that our best bet is to challenge this in court. That if we don\u2019t fund the Department of Homeland Security we\u2019ll get blamed as a party.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who is watching the world as it is, I have never seen more terrorist organizations with more safe havens, with more money with more capability to strike the Homeland than I do today, and that\u2019s a direct result of a failed foreign policy by President Obama and the worst thing to do is to add gasoline to the fire by having the Republican Party defund the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nOn CNN, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, the founding director of DHS, restated a position he took in an interview with The Fiscal Times last week, in which he also called for a clean funding bill.\n\nRelated: Kurds Are Close to Retaking Mosul from ISIS\n\n\u201cFund it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an inside the beltway game.\u201d\n\nWhile he condemned the president\u2019 executive actions, Ridge continued, \u201cHaving said that, I don\u2019t think this country has faced the breadth and depth of these foreign policy challenges \u2013 Al Qaeda, Al Shabaab, ISIL \u2013 the gravest we\u2019ve ever seen. So, to be talking about immigration and using a funding mechanism to really undermine the department\u2026these are great patriots all, they go to work every day trying to make sure America is safer and more secure.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cI want my Republicans to give the secretary a clean funding bill and use the legislative process to engage America around the desperate need \u2013 social, humanitarian, and economic \u2013 for robust immigration reform.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A video released by the Al-Qaeda affiliated terror group Al-Shabaab on Sunday called f", "title": "Terror Group\u2019s Threat to Mall of America Sharpens DHS Funding Debate", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/22/Terror-Group-s-Threat-Mall-America-Sharpens-DHS-Funding-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Westgate%20Mall%20terror.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/22/Terror-Group-s-Threat-Mall-America-Sharpens-DHS-Funding-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Westgate%20Mall%20terror.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A video released by the Al-Qaeda affiliated terror group Al-Shabaab on Sunday called f", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93f8\"", "article_summary": "The House passed a DHS funding bill that has language attached barring the executive branch from using any money to fund the executive actions taken by the president.\nThat if we don\u2019t fund the Department of Homeland Security we\u2019ll get blamed as a party.\nA video released by the Al-Qaeda affiliated terror group Al-Shabaab on Sunday called for attacks on American shopping malls, specifically mentioning the Mall of America in Minneapolis.\nIt claimed responsibility for the 2103 attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, which killed 62 and injured over 120.\nTom Ridge, the founding director of DHS, restated a position he took in an interview with The Fiscal Times last week, in which he also called for a clean funding bill."}
