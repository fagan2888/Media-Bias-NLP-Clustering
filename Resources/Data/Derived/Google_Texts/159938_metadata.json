A lot of it has to do with OMG THAT\u2019S LIKE $300k PER JOB. It\u2019s being sold as an excessive investment for dubious return.\n\nHere\u2019s something to consider: the state of New York is not paying a subsidy to SolarCity. Under its contract, SolarCity will create approximately 3,600 brand-new high-paying jobs in Buffalo alone. In order to do that, the state is buying the equipment that SolarCity will use to manufacture its products, and building the factory facility. The state will own it all.\n\nWhile it\u2019s well within the populist fashion of the times to decry public-private partnerships such as these \u2013 especially given examples where the private beneficiaries fail to uphold their end of the job-creation bargain with impunity \u2013 the simple fact is that municipalities compete with each other for this type of project, and Buffalo needs to be able to compete.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about 3,600 jobs. It\u2019s about the economic activity that each one of those well-paying jobs generates.\n\nLet\u2019s backtrack for a second and talk about supply-side/trickle-down theory versus demand-side/trickle-up; I believe in the latter and not the former. 30+ years ago the country started a grand experiment, simply put that lowering the tax burden on the very wealthy would result in them amassing more wealth, and that this would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the economy-at-large and create great wealth for everyone. It was what George H.W. Bush in 1980 called \u201cVoodoo Economics\u201d. Yet the country has stuck with this notion that easing the tax and regulatory burden on the rich would bring about great things for the middle and working classes. It simply didn\u2019t happen. In fact, the working poor stayed that way, and the middle classes have borne the brunt of this experiment in terms of less pay for more work.\n\nThink of it this way \u2013 we heard a great deal in the last few Presidential elections about the vaunted \u201cjob creators\u201d \u2013 these magical John Galts who have amassed great success and wealth and who demand less regulation and more tax relief (and none of this \u201cObamacare\u201d nonsense) in order to \u2026 well, it gets a bit fuzzy at this point.\n\nIt gets fuzzy because lax regulations have simply led to poor oversight and environmental catastrophes like the chemical spill in West Virginia last year. Arguably, the public cost in money and suffering that resulted from that disaster far exceeded the cost properly to inspect and enforce health and safety regulations in the first place.\n\nBut with respect to the ultra-wealthy \u201cjob creators\u201d in this country \u2013 let\u2019s say I have a fortune of $150 million. With that sort of money, my opportunity to participate in the economy is limitless. Many of the people with this sort of money pay a fraction of a percent of their income to the authorities as compared to the nut you and I pay, because the tax code is designed by these people to help these people. Let\u2019s say, instead, that I actually earn a paycheck rather than amass a fortune through inheritance or investment, and that I make $4 million per year. Technically, I\u2019m supposed to pay 35% or so of that money to the IRS, but through creative accounting and other loopholes, we can whittle that down substantially. But even if, hypothetically, I paid the full 35% nut to the feds, I\u2019m still bringing home $2.6 million. What does that mean, in terms of the trickle-down theory? That I won\u2019t get a Maybach and instead opt for an S600? That I\u2019ll have to cut back on my NetJets account? Seriously, what is it about $2.6 million versus, say $3.4 million that will adversely affect my ability to spend? Whether you earn $2.6 or $3.4 million, you\u2019re making all the money in the world and you can buy anything you need, and everything you want.\n\nBy contrast, if you put an extra few thousand dollars in the pocket of someone who\u2019s working class or middle class, you just added a new appliance, or a better car, or a nicer vacation. By giving tax relief to the middle class, you can suddenly give average people more freedom to participate in the economy, and they\u2019ll spend it \u2013 everyone benefits. We could simplify the tax code tomorrow and the economy would skyrocket. OK, everyone earning over $500,000 pays 35% straight up, regardless of income source \u2013 paycheck or capital gains. Anyone making $200 \u2013 500k pays 25% straight-up. Anyone making $100k \u2013 200k pays 17%. 50k \u2013 100k, you pay 10%, and if you earn less than 50k you pay zero. Add a VAT and you\u2019ve just funded universal health care.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThe state\u2019s investment of $350 million from the Buffalo Billion and $400 million in conditional loans (payable if SolarCity does not meet milestones and goals as set forth in the agreement), will result in a massive trickle-up boost to the local economy. You will have 3,600 households suddenly better able to afford to participate in the local economy, buying goods and services throughout the region. And let\u2019s not forget that SolarCity has contracted to invest $5 billion in this project over the first 10 years, we\u2019re not looking at some sort of idiotic handout.\n\nAlthough 3,600 jobs will be here in WNY, there will be 5,000 SolarCity jobs created throughout upstate New York.\n\nNow, witness what some are now trying to peddle. Namely, local embarrassment Carl Paladino. Here\u2019s an excerpt from an anti-Cuomo, pro-Astorino email he sent Thursday:\n\nAside from the misspellings and factual inaccuracies (read: lies), Paladino claims that Texas doesn\u2019t subsidize or incentivize businesses moving to Texas. Well, not every business wants to locate in an overheated place that doesn\u2019t spend money on infrastructure or education. But the idea that Texas doesn\u2019t do economic incentives is simply a lie. It takes a few simple clicks of the Google machine to find the Texas website where its incentives and subsidies are set forth. Now, Paladino would have you think that Musk went to Texas simply because it\u2019s an overheated, be-rednecked Galt\u2019s Gulch, right? Wrong.\n\nIn Texas, Musk said the outpouring of support from local residents and government officials \u2014 who are supporting the project with at least $15.3 million in state funding \u2014 was significant: \u201cWe want to be in a place where we\u2019re truly wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the way, Elon Musk \u2013 the guy in charge of SolarCity \u2013 recently located his SpacePort in Texas, but located his Tesla battery plant in Nevada. Part of the reason? Nevada\u2019s business climate is more liberal than Texas\u2018. Also, Nevada and Texas competed against each other to land the Gigafactory, and Nevada\u2019s package of $1.25 billion in tax breaks and incentives beat whatever Texas\u2019 proposal was.\n\nThe deal with SolarCity is different. The state (via SUNY) will own the factory and equipment, and SolarCity will be allowed to use it \u2013 for free \u2013 for 10 years. This will create 3,500 local high-tech jobs; 21st century jobs. Again \u2013 SolarCity will be investing $5 billion of its own money. If they don\u2019t live up to their promises, SolarCity will be up to $412 million in debt to the state. SolarCity maintains a big chunk of the risk, and isn\u2019t getting a direct cash subsidy.\n\nOver 3,500 new, high-paying local jobs and all the economic activity that each one of those jobs generates is huge for this region. This is a big risk and a big expense, but you don\u2019t undo 50 years of decline through recklessness or fear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lot has been written in the past week or so about the SolarCity project in South Buffalo.
