Both states have primaries so late in the process that the race has almost always been settled by the time we get around to voting, so for us primaries tend to be sort of an opportunity to register our opinion after the fact. I\u2019ve voted in primaries from 1988 (for Jesse) through 2008 (for Obama), but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever cast a primary vote that still mattered by the time my state went to the polls.\n\nMainly, though, my problem with primaries is that elections tend to get silly, and counter-productive, when the difference between candidates isn\u2019t as stark. This is something that we can see most clearly in presidential primary debates.\n\nI like presidential debates for the national race \u2014 debates between the nominees of the two parties. They often go off the rails with dumb questions, evasive answers, and media spin that focuses on irrelevant verbal tics or mannerisms \u2014 all the many things that can make a debate less than edifying and useful. But the basic idea of those debates is good: Two candidates with opposing ideas square off to defend their opposing views about policy, programs and priorities.\n\nIn primary debates, though, you wind up with two \u2014 or many more \u2014 candidates who can\u2019t really square off because they mostly agree about policy, programs and priorities. And when the opposing candidates aren\u2019t really opposed on those substantial matters, the debate \u2014 and the rest of the campaign \u2014 shifts its focus to less substantial matters. The debate and the campaign become an illustration of Freud\u2019s idea of the narcissism of small differences. The process requires mountains, so it makes mountains out of molehills.\n\nAnd that\u2019s actually the best-case scenario. What tends to happen more often is that, in the absence of major differences on policy, programs or priorities, a primary shifts its focus to purity.\n\nThe overcrowded Republican primary campaign for 2016 is a good illustration of what I mean by that. Much of that campaign has nominally focused on the matter of immigration. That focus is strange when you consider that nearly all* of the 17 candidates seeking the Republican nomination agreed on this subject. There has been some disagreement on the priority of the issue, but with regard to the substance of what they believed the policy and law ought to be, the candidates are basically unanimous. (In my view, they are unanimously wrong, repugnantly so, but that\u2019s a separate complaint.)\n\nIt would have been useful and constructive \u2014 for Republican primary voters and for our democracy in general \u2014 if the campaign could have acknowledged that unanimity and, therefore, moved on either to other topics on which there might be more substantial disagreements and distinctions between the candidates, or else shifted focus to the question of where this issue ought to rank among the priorities of the next president.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened. That almost never happens in primary elections. What happens, instead, is that given the field\u2019s unanimity on the substance of policy, the debate and the campaign becomes about their respective purity \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with regard to this agreed-upon orthodoxy. And this focus on purity is almost always meaningless, pointless, and insubstantial.\n\nPurity disputes are where primary candidates get into heated back-and-forths over votes cast or speeches given many years ago. Those past votes and words are cast in the worst possible light by opponents, the political context and particularities of the time in which they occurred are disregarded, and a bunch of candidates who unanimously agree about immigration angrily pretend that their opponents don\u2019t really agree 100-percent, because seven years ago they once said something vaguely qualified or cast a vote for a half-measure that wasn\u2019t 100-percent pure according to the now-current standard of purity on the issue.\n\nPurity disputes, thus, are largely play-acting and pretense. As a result, we\u2019ve now witnessed more than six months of Republican campaign \u201cdebate\u201d nominally focused on immigration, but actually focused on accusations and counter-accusations aimed at portraying opponents as failing to maintain a perfect score of adherence to what they\u2019ve all actually agreed is the only acceptable approach and goal for immigration policy. They\u2019re not debating different views. They\u2019re arguing over who is the purest representative of a single view.\n\nThat dynamic encourages candidates to push the agreed-upon orthodoxy in an ever-more extreme direction. Once it\u2019s established that everyone agrees, the purity debate starts in an attempt to show that opponents\u2019 don\u2019t really agree 100-percent. And as that purity argument heats up \u2014 with everyone angrily demanding that their 100-percent purity be recognized, the next step is for candidates to try to start differentiating themselves by declaring 110-percent or 120-percent agreement. I\u2019ll see your mass-deportation and raise you a coast-to-coast Great Wall of Trump, etc.**\n\nFnyeh. This is not useful for Republican primary voters and it\u2019s unhealthy for democracy as a whole. Among other things, this tendency for primary campaigns to devolve into purity disputes also makes compromise and negotiation more difficult for anyone in either party to pursue or achieve. Support anything that carries a whiff of anything less than total victory with unconditional surrender and you\u2019re providing fodder for a future primary attack against your 100-percent purity.\n\nOn the Democratic side, well, let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve muted a lot of people\u2019s Twitter accounts until after the convention. I\u2019m still following lots of people who support Hillary Clinton and lots of people who support Bernie Sanders, but the ones who fiercely pursued purity disputes have gotten muted (or unfollowed) because life\u2019s too short for that.\n\nMy other complaint about primary elections has to do with the nature of the game itself. In theory, primary campaigns are a democratic process (sometimes more, sometimes less democratic) in which candidates strive to win the support of delegates. And it takes a lot of delegates to win the nomination \u2014 something like 4,800 on the Democratic side in 2016. Iowa and New Hampshire are fairly sparsely populated, and thus supply a total of only 84 delegates between them. Here in Pennsylvania, we have more than 200 delegates, but our votes have never counted as much as the votes of those in Iowa and New Hampshire. Why?\n\nWell, because the early primaries provide candidates with \u201cmomentum.\u201d What does that mean, exactly? Well, mumble mumble mumble. This \u201cmomentum\u201d shapes and defines the primary race every four years, so it must mean something, right? But why should it and how does it?\n\nMomentum, I think \u2014 Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 refers mainly to two things. And the significance of Iowa and New Hampshire, despite the measly number of actual votes at stake in those races, shows that those two things matter more in primaries than our votes matter. Momentum means a media narrative and it means a corresponding influx of money. And neither one really has much to do with reflecting the interests or choices of voters.\n\nIf the primaries were really a democratic contest for voters, then the votes of the people in Maryland (118 delegates) would count at least as much as the votes of the people in Iowa and New Hampshire (84 delegates combined). But they never do, and that stinks. The whole thing strikes me as a bunch of people looking at a 6-2 first-quarter basketball score and declaring one team the pre-emptive winner.\n\nThat\u2019s absurd even before you realize that half the time the team they declare the winner is the one with only 2 points, because they scored the last basket and therefore have \u201cmomentum.\u201d\n\nAgain, fnyeh. I dislike primary season.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n* The exception, I think, is Jeb(!) Bush, who still seems to advocate some path to citizenship along the lines of the comprehensive immigration reform that many Republicans publicly favored as recently as his brother\u2019s administration and that the 2012 post-election GOP \u201cpost-mortem\u201d endorsed as an approach that might broaden the party\u2019s appeal.\n\nAlas for Jeb, the Republican base of primary voters hates this idea, and so he\u2019s barely spoken up to distinguish himself from the field by asserting and defending his substantial distinctive on the issue.\n\nPlus, and more importantly, it turns out that Jeb Bush is Very Bad at running for president \u2014 so Very Bad at it that he seems to have convinced GOP voters that he\u2019d be just as bad at actually being president. I don\u2019t know that even a preternaturally skilled campaigner could, at this point in history, overcome and redeem the last name Bush, but poor Jeb seems utterly incapable of doing so.\n\n** The effect of purity disputes in primary races is something like watching a bunch of used-car salesmen arguing over who\u2019s best at haggling with customers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the best price,\u201d one says, \u201cbecause I\u2019ll start by asking for $1 million for that \u201993 Honda Civic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah? Well I\u2019ll get an even better price for that Civic because my starting ask will be $10 million.\u201d\n\nThe fact that these increasingly absurd prices will make it nearly impossible for any of these people to ever sell any cars does nothing to deter their insistence that citing ever-higher standards of purity corresponds to their being ever-tougher negotiators. And it doesn\u2019t help that horse-race election \u201cjournalism\u201d plays along with that pretense.\n\nEric Cantor and Mike Castle are out of office today because they sold too many cars \u2014 proof to GOP primary voters that neither of them understood how to drive a proper bargain.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "slacktivist", "description": "Primary campaigns, and particularly primary debates, tend to get bogged down in purity disputes.
