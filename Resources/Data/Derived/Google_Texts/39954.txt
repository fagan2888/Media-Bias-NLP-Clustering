On “The O’Reilly Factor” Thursday night, host Bill O’Reilly had some advice for the Republican candidates — in particular, front-runners Donald Trump and Ben Carson, each of whom he believes should aspire to be more like the other.

Trump, he said, is too enamored of unnecessary publicity and seeks out petty squabbles in order to call attention further attention to himself. “Rolling Stone magazine?” O’Reilly asked, in reference to the article in which Trump disparaged Carly Fiorina’s appearance. “Was the Moscow Times not available? Why would you allow them access?”

Ben Carson has the opposite problem. Even when he does engage the other candidates — as he did yesterday over the sincerity of their religious convictions — he employs “sound bites with no bite,” as when he compared “Obamacare to slavery,” a provocative claim to which he hasn’t returned for fear of being “demonized as a religious extremist by a largely dishonest national press.”

Carson needs to hone the message that “traditional values provide far more success than politically correct madness — which does indeed enslave,” O’Reilly said, that final clause hanging in the air like an object lesson in overheated political rhetoric.
