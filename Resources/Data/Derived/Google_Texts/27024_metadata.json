The mood was grim.\n\nThe prime contractor, CGI Federal, had long before concluded that the administration was blindly enamored of an unrealistic goal: creating a cutting-edge website that would use the latest technologies to dazzle consumers with its many features. Knowing how long it would take to complete and test the software, the company\u2019s officials and other vendors believed that it was impossible to open a fully functioning exchange on Oct. 1.\n\nGovernment officials, on the other hand, insisted that Oct. 1 was not negotiable. And they were fed up with what they saw as CGI\u2019s pattern of excuses for missed deadlines. Michelle Snyder, the agency\u2019s chief operating officer, was telling colleagues outright, \u201cIf we could fire them, we would.\u201d\n\nInterviews with current and former Obama administration officials and specialists involved in the project, as well as a review of hundreds of pages of government and contractor documents, offer new details into how tensions between the government and its contractors, questionable decisions and weak leadership within the Medicare agency turned the rollout of the president\u2019s signature program into a major humiliation.\n\nThe online exchange was crippled, people involved with building it said in recent interviews, because of a huge gap between the administration\u2019s grand hopes and the practicalities of building a website that could function on opening day.\n\nVital components were never secured, including sufficient access to a data center to prevent the website from crashing. A backup system that could go live if it did crash was not created, a weakness the administration has never disclosed. And the architecture of the system that interacts with the data center where information is stored is so poorly configured that it must be redesigned, a process that experts said typically takes months. An initial assessment identified more than 600 hardware and software defects \u2014 \u201cthe longest list anybody had ever seen,\u201d one person involved with the project said.\n\nWhen the realization of impending disaster finally hit government officials at the Aug. 27 meeting \u2014 just 34 days before the site went live \u2014 they threw out nearly 30 requirements, including the Spanish-language version of the site and a payment system for insurers to receive government subsidies for the policies they sold.\n\nEven then, the system failed a test of only 500 simulated users in late September. Panicked, agency officials sent out an urgent order to almost double the system\u2019s data capacity, technicians involved in the project have now confirmed. But the site was still down more than half the time in mid-October.\n\nThe acrimony between the Medicare agency and CGI had built steadily over the preceding months, the new interviews show. By late summer, teams of agency officials had parked themselves in CGI Federal\u2019s headquarters in Herndon, Va., demanding on-the-spot reviews and demonstrations of new code that was never tested. Agency officials complained that CGI missed crucial deadlines and that it could not control other contractors, although the company said it had no power to do so.\n\nCGI and other contractors complained of endlessly shifting requirements and a government decision-making process so cumbersome that it took weeks to resolve elementary questions, such as determining whether users should be required to provide Social Security numbers. Some CGI software engineers ultimately walked out, saying it was impossible to produce good work under such conditions.\n\n\u201cCut corners, make date,\u201d said one specialist, who like most of the people interviewed for this article would not allow his name to be used because the Obama administration has requested that all government officials and contractors involved keep their work confidential.\n\nAnother sore point was the Medicare agency\u2019s decision to use database software, from a company called MarkLogic, that managed the data differently from systems by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Oracle. CGI officials argued that it would slow work because it was too unfamiliar. Government officials disagreed, and its configuration remains a serious problem.\n\nThanks to a huge effort to fix the most obvious weaknesses and the appointment at last of a single contractor, QSSI, to oversee the work, the website now crashes much less frequently, officials said. That is a major improvement from a month ago, when it was up only 42 percent of the time and 10-hour failures were common. Yet an enormous amount of work remains to be done, all sides agree.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the Medicare agency said officials held hundreds of meetings in the month before the start-up and tried their best to manage a highly complex project in a short time. \u201cThere were issues in meeting deliverables in a timely fashion,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe expected there would be issues. However, we did not anticipate the degree of the problems in the system.\u201d\n\nOne computer expert with intimate knowledge of the project said, \u201cLiterally everyone involved was at fault.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare agency was not everyone\u2019s first choice to run the $630 million project. White House officials at first debated whether to name an outsider, such as Jon Kingsdale, who set up the landmark Massachusetts health insurance program, or even to create a new agency.\n\nBoth those ideas fell through, and over the past three years five different lower-level managers held posts overseeing the development of HealthCare.gov, none of whom had the kind of authority to reach across the administration to ensure the project stayed on schedule.\n\nAs a result, the president\u2019s signature initiative was effectively left under the day-to-day management of Henry Chao, a 19-year veteran of the Medicare agency with little clout and little formal background in computer science.\n\nMr. Chao had to consult with senior department officials and the White House, and was unable to make many decisions on his own. \u201cNothing was decided without a conversation there,\u201d said one agency official involved in the project, referring to the constant White House demands for oversight. On behalf of Mr. Chao, the Medicare agency declined to comment.\n\nSixteen companies were prequalified to bid on the project, according to administration officials. CGI was picked as the prime contractor over three other bidders: IBM, QSSI and Computer Sciences Corporation. But the Medicare agency reserved the role of general contractor, or system integrator, for itself, even though it lacked the necessary in-house software engineering resources to handle such a task.\n\nA pattern of ever-shifting requirements persisted throughout the project, including the administration\u2019s decision late last year to try to redesign the site\u2019s appearance and content to make it more informative to consumers, according to many specialists involved. The administration also decided to reconfigure it as a national site, instead of one where each state had its own front page, after many states decided not to open their own exchanges.\n\nIDEO, a consulting firm based in Palo Alto, Calif., that had done some early design prototypes, was enlisted to help revamp the site\u2019s front end. The team at IDEO ended up as frustrated with the Medicare agency as other vendors.\n\n\u201cIt was monstrous, a monstrous impact,\u201d said one specialist about the amount of code that had to be rewritten because of the redesign and other similar changes. Administration officials strongly dispute that, saying the impact was minimal.\n\nWithin the Medicare agency itself, conflicts raged over priorities and revenues for the project. In July, for instance, officials argued over how many CGI employees should be devoted to the particular system that would handle payments to insurers.\n\n\u201cWe are one week out from production deployment, and we are being told already that it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Jeffrey Grant, a Medicare agency official, wrote in an email to colleagues. \u201cWe believe our entire build is in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nEventually, Medicare agency officials began to suspect that staff members at CGI were intentionally trying to hide flaws in the system, to cover up for their inability to meet production deadlines. They ordered CGI technicians to drive from their offices near Dulles International Airport in Virginia to the agency headquarters near Baltimore to review their code with government supervisors.\n\nThe Medicare agency was also growing frustrated with tension among contractors, noting that initial tests of parts of the system were being delayed because of \u201ccoordination issues\u201d between CGI and QSSI, which won another part of the job after losing the lead contractor role.\n\nMr. Chao seemed to colleagues to be at his wit\u2019s end. One evening last summer, he called Wallace Fung, who retired in 2008 as the Medicare agency\u2019s chief technology officer. Mr. Fung said in an interview that he told Mr. Chao to greatly simplify the site\u2019s functions. \u201cHenry, this is not going to work. You cannot build this kind of system overnight,\u201d Mr. Fung said he told him.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Mr. Chao answered, according to Mr. Fung. \u201cBut I cannot talk them out of it.\u201d\n\nIn the last week of September, the disastrous results of the project\u2019s inept management and execution were becoming fully apparent. The agency pressed CGI to explain why a performance test showed that the site could not handle more than 500 simultaneous users. The response once again exhibited the blame-shifting that had plagued the project for months.\n\n\u201cWe have not identified any inefficient and defective code,\u201d a CGI executive responded in an email to federal project managers, pointing again to database technology that the Medicare agency had ordered it to use as the culprit, at least in part.\n\nDespite the behind-the-scenes crisis, the president expressed confidence about the exchange just days before its debut.\n\n\u201cThis is real simple,\u201d Mr. Obama said, during a speech in Maryland on Sept. 26. \u201cIt\u2019s a website where you can compare and purchase affordable health insurance plans side by side the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak, same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131122214137, "twitter": {"description": "Interviews and documents offer new details into how the rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature program turned into a major humiliation.", "title": "Tension and Flaws Before Health Website Crash", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/tension-and-woes-before-health-website-crash.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/23/us/EXCHANGE-2/EXCHANGE-2-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "Tension and Flaws Before Health Website Crash", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 22, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Computers and the Internet,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Chao  Henry,Obama  Barack,HealthCare.gov,CGI Group Inc,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Ideo LLC,Quality Software Services Inc", "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "PT": "Article", "author": "ERIC LIPTON;IAN AUSTEN;SHARON LaFRANIERE", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/23/us/EXCHANGE-2/EXCHANGE-2-thumbLarge.jpg", "per": "Chao, Henry;Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ERIC LIPTON, IAN AUSTEN and SHARON LaFRANIERE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "U.S. / Politics", "lp": "Interviews and documents offer new details into how the rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature program turned into a major humiliation.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/23/us/EXCHANGE-2/EXCHANGE-2-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Interviews and documents offer new details into how the rollout of President Obama's signature program turned into a major humiliation.", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "us", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "November 22, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "org": "HealthCare.gov;CGI Group Inc;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;Ideo LLC;Quality Software Services Inc", "thumbnail_height": 75, "ticker": "Oracle Corporation|ORCL|NYSE;Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC|NYSE;International Business Machines Corporation|IBM|NYSE;CGI Group Inc|GIB|NYSE;Amazon.com Inc|AMZN|NASDAQ;Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|NASDAQ", "slug": "23exchange", "utime": 20131208040010, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/tension-and-woes-before-health-website-crash.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/23/us/EXCHANGE-2/EXCHANGE-2-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Interviews and documents offer new details into how the rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature program turned into a major humiliation.", "title": "Tension and Flaws Before Health Website Crash"}, "pdate": 20131122, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Computers and the Internet;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000002568095, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "IuUqI0l6ZuP6ovNTQV28Xw", "hdl": "Tension and Flaws Before Health Website Crash", "SCG": "politics", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb378\"", "article_summary": "The acrimony between the Medicare agency and CGI had built steadily over the preceding months, the new interviews show.\nThe team at IDEO ended up as frustrated with the Medicare agency as other vendors.\nAdministration officials strongly dispute that, saying the impact was minimal.\nA backup system that could go live if it did crash was not created, a weakness the administration has never disclosed.\nPanicked, agency officials sent out an urgent order to almost double the system\u2019s data capacity, technicians involved in the project have now confirmed."}
