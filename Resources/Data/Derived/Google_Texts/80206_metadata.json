Even after watching him for seven years, I can\u2019t decide who the primary victim of his deceit is, him or us.\n\nIs it even possible for this guy to extricate himself from campaign mode? Is there ever a time when he\u2019s not puffing his product? His incessant salesmanship would be bad enough if he truly had a stellar record.\n\nIf we give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is just self-deceived, then the culprits are probably his blinding ideology and his narcissism.\n\nHis ideology compels him to believe that his policies are working even when they\u2019re not, because even objective evidence demonstrating otherwise doesn\u2019t seem to register with him. And narcissism surely accounts for his navel-gazing tunnel vision that fools him into believing he\u2019s a bipartisan conciliator.\n\nFor him to hold himself out as a uniter and effusively praise himself for his economic and foreign policy record is surreal.\n\nFor years, we have heard his bipartisan rhetoric in one breath and, in the next, his threat that it will be his way or the highway. What honest and self-aware person could say he is ready to work with Republicans while blasting them as paid partisan hacks and threatening to veto anything they send to him that doesn\u2019t fully embrace his own imperial demands?\n\nIt\u2019s far easier for me to understand his dogmatism than to get my mind around his holding himself out as a uniter in the midst of it. It\u2019s either the highest form of sophisticated deceit (involving the lowest form of cynicism) or an alarming case of his residing in an impenetrable bubble where he hears only himself and those who agree with him.\n\nIf we don\u2019t give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he really knows his record doesn\u2019t square with his claims, I think we can still attribute his other-directed deceit to a combination of his ideology and his narcissism. He is so convinced that his primary goal of fundamentally changing the United States is imperative that he\u2019s willing to lie through his teeth to further that goal. And in his case, his narcissism insulates him from feeling any guilt at all about it.\n\nRegardless of whether Obama is lying to himself, to us or both \u2014 and it\u2019s probably a great deal of both \u2014 his report card does not correspond to the objective facts, in a frightening number of ways.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few examples in this short space.\n\nHe briefly mentioned Obamacare \u2014 to brag about more people being covered by insurance. What he didn\u2019t tell us is that most of these gains were caused by an expansion of Medicaid, which historically delivers lower-quality care and reduced access to it \u2014 defeating the ostensible purposes of Obamacare. More importantly, most of Obamacare\u2019s nominal coverage expansion has been nullified by reductions in coverage for people with employer-based insurance.\n\nHe shamelessly took credit for an energy boom and lowering gas prices. These have occurred not because of his policies but in spite of them. Increases in production are because of more drilling on private and state land, not federal land. Energy produced from private-sector fracking \u2014 a practice he opposes \u2014 is also responsible for much of the increased productivity and lower prices.\n\nObama beamed about reducing the deficit, but as The Heritage Foundation reports, this is about the only time he\u2019ll be able to make that claim. That\u2019s because most of his prior deficits were horrendous and annual deficits over the next decade are projected to average almost $1 trillion. More disturbing, however, is that entitlements consume about half of our tax revenues and are projected to swallow 100 percent of revenues within 15 years. Yet Obama steadfastly obstructs entitlement reform.\n\nObama takes credit for a growing economy, but if the economy is finally growing \u2014 and the evidence is mixed \u2014 it\u2019s been a long time coming. His vaunted middle-class policies are not helping the middle class, which has suffered under his presidency. He has presided over the slowest recovery in 50 years. Plus, workers at the lower end of the pay scale have seen their average weekly hours dropping significantly \u2014 as opposed to higher-paid workers. Though he cites decreasing unemployment, he omits that most of the job gains are among part-time workers and that the unemployment numbers are further misleading because they ignore the enormous number of people who have quit the workforce altogether. The labor participation rate is at its lowest point in decades, and only a quarter of this can be attributed to a change in demographics.\n\nAmong his numerous misstatements on foreign policy, Obama would have us believe that Islamic jihad and al-Qaida are not significant enough problems even to warrant a mention. We have \u201cturned the page.\u201d How can a president be so out of touch as to take this position when the Islamist terrorist threat is expanding and becoming deadlier?\n\nBy one metric, though, Obama has been the most successful president in our history: He is well on his way to fundamentally transforming this nation \u2014 for the worse.\n\nDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author and attorney.
