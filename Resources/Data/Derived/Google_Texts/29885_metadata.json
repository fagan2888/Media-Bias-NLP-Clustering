That\u2019s $900 we are spending monthly to keep people homeless.\u201d Schneider said before the Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee.\n\n\u201cThat is a shocking figure, when we consider that for that amount we could be housing people.\u201d Schneider said.\n\nThis year, there was a shortage of housing for 190,000 households below 150% of the area median income this year. It has grown by 70,000 houses in the past 10 years, and the state uses a lottery system to determine who will be able to live in low-income housing.\n\n\u201cI work in Baltimore City,\u201d said Schneider, \u201cwhere the Section Eight housing waiting list was open for 9 days at end of October. 74,000 households applied to go into a lottery for 25,000 slots.\u201d\n\nOut of those 74,000 households, only one-tenth will get housing aid. Currently, Baltimore County\u2019s waitlist is nine-years, Schneider said those applying now would \u201cmaybe\u201d receive assistance at the end of that period.\n\nCurrently Howard, Montgomery, Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot counties\u2019 low-income housing waitlists are closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad for business when business employees cannot afford to live,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nBaltimore County\u2019s lowest wage workers need \u201c3 full time jobs to afford housing at fair market rent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHomelessness is very expensive,\u201d Schneider said, pointing out that individuals on the streets also create emergency room, jail and shelter costs.\n\nHomelessness raises health costs\n\nChauna Brocht, a social worker of nine years and leader of the Convalescent Care Program, also testified about her most medically vulnerable clients who have become homeless after medical emergencies.\n\n\u201cWe know that homelessness exacerbates health conditions..it creates a cycle of emergency department use and poor health outcomes.\u201d Brocht said.\n\nBoston Healthcare for the Homeless program found that for 119 street-individuals, there were 18,000 ER visits and over 900 hospitalizations in five-years. It was found that homeless individuals average a cost of $28,000 a year for hospital visits, versus the average $6,000 a year for an individual who manages to receive housing.\n\nHe wishes to copy states like Minnesota and Massachusetts.\n\nMinnesota invested $100 million in capital funding in the creation of affordable housing, which not only saved money but also created jobs. And Massachusetts created a program called Home and Healthy for Good, funded through their state budget, which was created \u201cas a result of mounting evidence from around the country that Housing First strategies result in tremendous cost savings to cities and states.\u201d\n\nThe subcommittee listened as Schneider recounted watching Baltimore City\u2019s Department of Public Works clear out a homeless encampment the day before. From across the street, he watched as blankets and provisions were tossed away, individuals coming back to find nothing left.\n\n\u201cThat was terrible,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s a result of an inadequate supply of affordable housing.\u201d\n\nRebeccaAnnLessner@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Maryland\u2019s homeless situation becomes \u201cespecially dire,\u201d the creation of affordable housing for the homeless would be cheaper than the cost of shelter efforts, Director Adam Schneider of Health Care for the Homeless told a Senate budget subcommittee Friday.", "original-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2015/02/08/housing-would-be-cheaper-cure-for-homelessness-legislators-are-told/", "og": {"site_name": "MarylandReporter.com", "description": "As Maryland\u2019s homeless situation becomes \u201cespecially dire,\u201d the creation of affordable housing for the homeless would be cheaper than the cost of shelter efforts, Director Adam Schneider of Health Care for the Homeless told a Senate budget subcommittee Friday.", "title": "Housing would be cheaper cure for homelessness, legislators are told", "url": "http://marylandreporter.com/2015/02/08/housing-would-be-cheaper-cure-for-homelessness-legislators-are-told/", "image": "http://marylandreporter.com/files/2015/02/Homeless-cropped.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mdreporter", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://marylandreporter.com/2015/02/08/housing-would-be-cheaper-cure-for-homelessness-legislators-are-told/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Budget, General Assembly, News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0a4\"", "article_summary": "Boston Healthcare for the Homeless program found that for 119 street-individuals, there were 18,000 ER visits and over 900 hospitalizations in five-years.\n\u201cThat is a shocking figure, when we consider that for that amount we could be housing people.\u201d Schneider said.\nThis year, there was a shortage of housing for 190,000 households below 150% of the area median income this year.\nThat\u2019s $900 we are spending monthly to keep people homeless.\u201d Schneider said before the Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee.\n74,000 households applied to go into a lottery for 25,000 slots.\u201dOut of those 74,000 households, only one-tenth will get housing aid."}
