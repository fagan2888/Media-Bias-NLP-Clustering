Newly hired Colorado State football coach Mike Bobo added Bryan Applewhite, a former Northern Colorado fullback, to the Rams’ staff.

Applewhite coached the past five seasons at Louisiana- Monroe, where he served as the Warhawks’ running backs coach and recruiting coordinator.

He began his coaching career at his alma mater and also coached running backs for six seasons at Wyoming.

In a CSU news release Saturday, Bobo said Applewhite’s coaching responsibilities for the Rams will be determined at a later date.

“We are fortunate to be able to bring Bryan Applewhite and his family to Colorado State,” Bobo said. “He is familiar with this area and the conference, and he is a great recruiter. I am really excited about what he brings to our staff.”

Applewhite played on Northern Colorado teams that won back-to-back NCAA Division II national championships in the 1990s.
