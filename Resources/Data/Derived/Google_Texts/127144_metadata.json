It affects about 6.7 percent of American adults, although this number may be higher considering, a 2009 meta-analysis found it could only be accurately identified in half of the cases where the patient actually had depression. If you\u2019re wondering what happens with all the other patients, one article published in BMJ Case Reports and written by the same author of the 2009 analysis, describes a 54-year-old woman whose depression ended up being a brain tumor.\n\nFor five of the six months she was believed to have depression, the woman was taking the antidepressant fluoxetine and the anti-anxiety med bromazepam. She stopped because they weren\u2019t helping her. Yet, her symptoms suggested depression; she exhibited apathy, difficulty making decisions and taking action, trouble falling asleep at night, and lack of energy \u2014 her most prominent symptom.\n\nTo further emphasize the idea she might have depression, researchers also reported she had expressed thoughts of suicide but \u201dtalked about them with a kind of detachment.\u201d She had no sense of guilt and no family history of mental illness, but she had recently experienced stress \u2014 she also said she was irritable and ineffective at her job. However, she had not lost any weight, despite it being a common symptom of depression.\n\nAfter months of treatment, the woman underwent a neurological examination to determine if her nervous system was functioning properly, and found nothing out of the ordinary. It wasn\u2019t until she took CT and MRI scans that she discovered she had a meningiomatosis \u2014 or multiple meningiomas, tumors that grow from the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord \u2014 with a giant meningioma in her left frontal lobe.\n\nThe frontal lobe plays an important role, as it helps you think, plan, and make decisions. Research has found those who relapse into depression normally activate their frontal lobe.\n\nThe woman underwent surgery to remove the meningothelial meningioma, which the doctors labeled as a World Health Organization grade 1 tumor \u2014 meaning it\u2019s slow-growing, nonmalignant, and associated with long-term survival. Depression symptoms stopped one month after surgery, and a two-year follow-up found it hadn\u2019t returned.\n\nThe researchers wrote that although this woman\u2019s depression was due to a brain tumor, \"it seems unrealistic to prescribe brain imaging in every patient with a depressive syndrome\" since these types of cases are incredibly rare. They do, however, recommend brain imaging on patients over 50 who experience depressive symptoms, especially if they\u2019re diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nSource: Dautricourt S, Marzloff V, Dollfus S.
