Montpellier recorded its first win of the season with a 2-1 victory over Lorient, while last year\u2019s runner-up Monaco was held 3-3 at Guingamp.\n\nNice was looking for a third successive win and Koziello got it off to the perfect start when he volleyed home Ricardo Pereira\u2019s cross from the left.\n\nSaint-Etienne was struggling to get a foothold in the game but leveled when Fabien Lemoine\u2019s 25-meter effort smacked against the crossbar and Perrin tapped in the rebound.\n\nBen Arfa restored Nice\u2019s advantage six minutes from halftime when he was left unmarked on the left side of the area to control Jeremy Pied\u2019s cross - which home defender Florentin Pogba inadvertently headed on - with a deft touch and smash a brilliant finish into the far side of the net.\n\nThe France winger\u2019s second was even more impressive as, in first-half stoppages, Ben Arfa beat five of his opponents before drilling across into the bottom left corner.\n\nBen Arfa had a part in Nice\u2019s fourth too as he led a counterattack and Valere Germain raced forward before setting up Seri who burst clear to send a deflected effort past Stephane Ruffier in the 53rd.\n\nNice went down to 10 men nine minutes later when Mendy was harshly sent off after reacting poorly to a Lemoine tackle. The Saint-Etienne midfielder went back down clutching his face although Mendy had appeared to push his shoulder.\n\nThe visitors had another man sent off when Le Marchand was also controversially dismissed for bringing down Lemoine. Bahebeck fired the resulting penalty woefully over the crossbar.\n\nMarseille\u2019s players were booed off the pitch at halftime and at the end of the team\u2019s third defeat of the season. Part of Stade Velodrome was closed after crowd trouble in Marseille\u2019s previous home match against Lyon.\n\nAngers is one of four teams on 15 points, five below PSG.\n\nIt went ahead in the 38th minute after Remy Cabella fouled Arnold Bouka Moutou and Thomas Mangani fired the penalty down the middle.\n\nMarseille forced two good saves from visiting goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle immediately after the break, but Angers doubled its advantage in the 70th when Romain Thomas headed in Billy Ketkeophomphone\u2019s free kick.\n\nMichy Batshuayi pulled one back for Marseille from the penalty spot 11 minutes from time after Fode Dore was harshly adjudged to have brought down Lucas Ocampos.\n\nMonaco is ninth after its stuttering start to the season went on.\n\nIt took the lead three times but was pegged back on each occasion by Guingamp, including a last-minute equalizer by Nicolas Benezet - his second goal of the match.\n\nMontpellier had lost six of its seven matches, drawing the other one, but it got off to the perfect start when Ramy Bensebaini netted a looping header in the seventh minute after Lorient failed to properly clear a corner.\n\nRafidine Abdullah leveled with a stunning strike into the top right corner three minutes into the second half, but Jonas Martin fired Montpellier back in front in the 57th.\n\nAbdullah was sent off in stoppage time for a high tackle on Jonas Martin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saint-Etienne missed the chance to close the gap on French league leader Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday as it fell to a surprise 4-1 defeat at home to a Nice side which ended the match with nine men.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Saint-Etienne missed the chance to close the gap on French league leader Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday as it fell to a surprise 4-1 defeat at home to a Nice side which ended the match with nine men.", "title": "Saint-Etienne hammered 4-1 at home by 9-man Nice in Ligue 1", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/27/marseille-loses-2-1-to-newly-promoted-angers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/8bceb22e7678352b830f6a7067000d05.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/27/8bceb22e7678352b830f6a7067000d05.jpg", "description": "Saint-Etienne missed the chance to close the gap on French league leader Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday as it fell to a surprise 4-1 defeat at home to a Nice side which ended the match with nine men.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Saint-Etienne hammered 4-1 at home by 9-man Nice in Ligue 1"}, "Author": "DANIELLA MATAR", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18b7\"", "article_summary": "Hatem Ben Arfa scored two stunning goals for Nice after Saint-Etienne defender Loic Perrin had cancelled out Vincent Koziello\u2019s fifth-minute opener.\nJean-Christophe Bahebeck missed a late penalty for Saint-Etienne, which remained four points behind PSG after the three-time defending champion\u2019s victory at Nantes on Saturday.\nThe Saint-Etienne midfielder went back down clutching his face although Mendy had appeared to push his shoulder.\nMonaco is ninth after its stuttering start to the season went on.\nNice went down to 10 men nine minutes later when Mendy was harshly sent off after reacting poorly to a Lemoine tackle."}
