The people you need to be talking to are the parents who are making the decisions.\u201d\n\nIn the video released late last week, Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, arrived on Sesame Street to comfort Elmo as the muppet nervously waited to get a vaccination.\n\n\u201cWhy does Elmo need a vaccination anyway?\u201d the young monster asked.\n\nMurthy told Elmo getting vaccinated is just like carrying an umbrella when it rains or wearing a helmet while riding a tricycle. He explained vaccines provide the body with information to help make antibodies that fight germs.\n\nOrient scoffed at Murthy\u2019s comparison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of do you have an umbrella in the rain, it\u2019s a question of whether vaccines have more risks than benefits,\u201d she told WND.\n\nDr. Lee Hieb, past president of the AAPS, agreed the surgeon general made a bad analogy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no downside to wearing a helmet,\u201d said Hieb, author of \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no allergic reaction or risk of death or infirmity from putting an umbrella up unless it pokes you in the eye. I mean, those things don\u2019t have side effects. I think that\u2019s absolutely criminal for the surgeon general to say.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service, any vaccine can cause mild fever, shivering, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, or pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site. Some people develop allergic reactions after vaccination that include an itchy rash or, in rare cases, breathing difficulty and physical collapse. However, the NHS claims most vaccine side effects are \u201cmild and short-lived.\u201d\n\nThe National Vaccine Information Center, on the other hand, warns consumers that some vaccines may cause such complications as brain inflammation, chronic arthritis, chronic nervous system dysfunction, shock, seizures, and even death. The website lists several symptoms that may be caused by vaccines if they occur in the first few hours, days, or weeks after vaccination. These include paralysis of any body part, severe diarrhea, chronic ear or respiratory problems, excessive bruising or bleeding, social withdrawal, head banging, changes in sleep patterns, hours of inconsolable crying, and memory loss, among others.\n\nSee what\u2019s needed to get ready for Obamacare, in \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll medical procedures have both risks and benefits,\u201d Orient emphasized. \u201cSome vaccines are very important, some are less important. All of them have potential side effects, and in every case, it\u2019s the right of the patient or the person who\u2019s making decisions for the patient to weigh the risks and the benefits, and not just blindly follow a rigid schedule that\u2019s set up by an unaccountable government bureaucracy that is heavily influenced by vested special interests.\u201d\n\nHieb agrees that a person\u2019s decision on whether to vaccinate needs to include a careful cost-benefit analysis.\n\n\u201cWhen parents see a benefit from a vaccine, like for smallpox and polio \u2013 there\u2019s no question they didn\u2019t want their children to get those things,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cThey were willing to accept the moderate risk of having a vaccine to get rid of the significant risk of the diseases. Just like people choose value in their other purchases, sometimes they realize there\u2019s not value in a vaccine and there\u2019s more risk than they\u2019re willing to assume.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the video, a nurse showed up onscreen to give Elmo his shot, and Murthy suggested that Elmo turn around and sing a song so he wouldn\u2019t feel any pain. Elmo did this and didn\u2019t even notice when the nurse stuck the needle in his arm.\n\nUpon learning that the shot was all over, Elmo remarked, \u201cThat was so easy. Why doesn\u2019t everybody get a vaccination?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question, Elmo,\u201d Murthy replied as he turned to the camera and stroked his chin, seemingly speaking directly to vaccine skeptics. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d\n\nHieb was revolted by the Obama administration\u2019s one-sided presentation of the vaccine issue.\n\n\u201cHere they are, going to Sesame Street and propagandizing children and their mothers, too, who are watching the show with them, that vaccines make people well, and we should all get vaccinated and be good little soldiers in the war against disease,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cBasically, that\u2019s the principle.\u201d\n\nOf course, Murthy is not the first person to try and spread the Obama administration\u2019s message to kids on Sesame Street. Michelle Obama has appeared on the show many times to promote her \u201cLet\u2019s Move!\u201d campaign by teaching the characters about healthy eating and exercise.\n\nOrient believes it\u2019s unnecessary to explain to kids how vaccines work in the first place. She said all medical professionals need to do is make the experience as pleasant as possible for nervous children.\n\n\u201cWhy do you need to talk to kids about vaccines?\u201d Orient asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you need a video for kids about going to the doctor to get a shot.\u201d\n\nShe believes the surgeon general was simply capitalizing on January\u2019s Disneyland measles outbreak, which, coincidentally, was declared over last week.\n\n\u201cOf course, they will take advantage of any crisis,\u201d Orient said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "By Paul Bremmer The surgeon general of the United States recently showed up on Sesame Street to try to convince kids to get vaccinated, and his spiel was pitched \u201cat the appropriate intellectual level,\u201d according to one prominent medical doctor. \u201cIt just puts the argument down on a juvenile plane and insults people\u2019s intelligence,\u201d said [\u2026]", "title": "Experts: Surgeon general \u2018propagandizing\u2019 children", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/04/experts-surgeon-general-propagandizing-children/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2013/02/130218vaccination.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b30\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Lee Hieb, past president of the AAPS, agreed the surgeon general made a bad analogy.\n\u201cWhy does Elmo need a vaccination anyway?\u201d the young monster asked.\nShe said all medical professionals need to do is make the experience as pleasant as possible for nervous children.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you need a video for kids about going to the doctor to get a shot.\u201dShe believes the surgeon general was simply capitalizing on January\u2019s Disneyland measles outbreak, which, coincidentally, was declared over last week.\nBy Paul BremmerThe surgeon general of the United States recently showed up on Sesame Street to try to convince kids to get vaccinated, and his spiel was pitched \u201cat the appropriate intellectual level,\u201d according to one prominent medical doctor."}
