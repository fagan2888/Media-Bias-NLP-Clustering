Our Miss U.S.A. 2014 state representatives landed early last week and have spent their time attending the litany of public events and fulfilling media requests that come with being a contestant. I’ve spent their layover arbitrarily ranking them.

It’s been a long week but finally last night the first blood has been spilt on the runway as our contestants sashayed their way down the runways for Miss U.S.A. 2014 preliminaries.

Favored by Vegas 9-1, Miss Alabama USA Jesica Ahlberg showed why she’s smart money.

Miss Arkansas USA Helen Wisner is the most ripped first grade teacher in the country.

Miss California USA and friend of Israel Cassandra Kunze was confident as she posed for the judges.

Vegas’ second favorite by 14-1 Miss Massachusetts USA Caroline Lunny was sultry as she shuffled on stage.

Despite being a black belt in taekwondo, Nevada’s Nia Sanchez missed her mark in the swimsuit march.

Miss Ohio USA Madison Gesiotto’s awkward walk on stage showed she has more in common with Mitt Romney than just agreeing on the impact of Obamacare.

Miss Pennsylvania USA Valerie Gatto also fumbled her last step in the evening gown parade.

That was unlike Miss Texas USA Lauren Guzman’s calm and collected demeanor. The Texas State Guard teaches you how to march.

Miss Wisconsin USA Bishara Dorre looked like she stepped right off the Bradley Center floor and onto the runway.

The standouts from the prelims:

Miss Florida USA Brittany Oldehof barely missed my top 21. She made me look foolish when she rolled through the swimsuit portion with her pageant walk.

Brittany was dynamic, both in a two-piece and in that nifty tassel dress.



Miss Illinois USA Lexi Atkins also performed exceptional, using her improv skills to woo the judges.

After the evening, the contestant in pole position for Saturday’s contest is Miss Utah USA Angelia Layton.

She earned first position with her attitude and allure.

Expect her to go as far as her heels can take her.
