Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio. To do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year to keep them in prison. I would rather get them their medication so they can lead a decent life.\n\nIn reacting to Kasich\u2019s comments, Sebelius said that there is something \u201cso morally wrong\u201d with not expanding medicaid because workers with lower income cannot afford it.\n\n\u201cIf you think about lifting people up, providing healthcare so they don\u2019t go bankrupt if they get sick, they can have access to mental healthcare, which John Kasich talked about or primary healthcare or make sure they can take care of their kids and their family and they become productive workers. I think there\u2019s something so morally wrong with leaving that program on the table and saying to the lowest income workers of your state, \u2018Because of my politics, we\u2019re not expanding your healthcare.'\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kathleen Sebelius: 'Morally Wrong' to Not Expand Medicaid", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius: 'Morally Wrong' to Not Expand Medicaid", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius: 'Morally Wrong' to Not Expand Medicaid - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 673, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/kathleen.jpg", "height": 505}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/08/kathleen-sebelius-morally-wrong-to-not-expand-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kathleen Sebelius: 'Morally Wrong' to Not Expand Medicaid", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/kathleen.jpg", "title": "Kathleen Sebelius: 'Morally Wrong' to Not Expand Medicaid - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Governor John Kasich, Kathleen Sebelius, Medicaid expansion, MSNBC,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,kathleen sebelius", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "MSNBC", "published_time": "2015-08-08T19:10:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdea\"", "article_summary": "In reacting to Kasich\u2019s comments, Sebelius said that there is something \u201cso morally wrong\u201d with not expanding medicaid because workers with lower income cannot afford it.\nI think there\u2019s something so morally wrong with leaving that program on the table and saying to the lowest income workers of your state, \u2018Because of my politics, we\u2019re not expanding your healthcare.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday\u2019s \u201cUp with Steve Kornacki\u201d on MSNBC, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius reacted to GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich\u2019s comments from the debate on Medicaid where he said:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERYou should know that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.\nSecondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio.\nI would rather get them their medication so they can lead a decent life."}
