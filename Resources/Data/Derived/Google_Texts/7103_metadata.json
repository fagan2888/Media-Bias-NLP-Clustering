Even though he was not born in this country, his popularity at the time caused the 61st Amendment, which states that \u2026\" said Sandra Bullock\u2019s character.\n\n\"I don\u2019t wanna know,\" Stallone said.\n\nIf Arnold ever is given the green light to run for office, it probably won\u2019t be because of a 61st Amendment.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that the change will be because the Supreme Court is finally asked to take a good hard look at Article II, Section I of the Constitution. This is where the U.S. gets its guidance for who can be president and who can\u2019t.\n\nThose requirements are that a candidate must be at least 35 years old, that he or she lives within the country for at least 14 years and that they\u2019re a \"natural born citizen.\"\n\nDuring the 2008 election cycle, both John McCain and Barack Obama were scrutinized under the clause. Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while McCain was actually born in the Panama Canal Zone. (Video via Iowa Public Television)\n\nThat zone was recognized as a territory of the U.S. at the time of his birth, which is also when McCain\u2019s father served in the military. So the technicality was OK\u2019d after a brief court challenge.\n\nArnold doesn\u2019t really have a similar excuse. He was born in Austria in 1947 and didn\u2019t immigrate to the U.S. until he was in his 20s. He is a citizen, though. And he\u2019s been here for far more than 14 years \u2014 he was even elected to be the Governator of California. (Video via Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library)\n\nBut what if things did change \u2014 somehow?\n\n\"Would you run if they\u2019d change that law?\" asks Jay Leno.\n\n\"Oh, without any doubt \u2014 there\u2019s no two ways about that,\" says Schwarzenegger.\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Schwarzenegger's presidential hopes are well documented, but how likely is it that he'd actually be allowed to run for the top spot?", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Schwarzenegger's presidential hopes are well documented, but how likely is it that he'd actually be allowed to run for the top spot?", "title": "President Schwarzenegger?
