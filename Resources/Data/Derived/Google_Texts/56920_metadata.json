Both the state and federal laws aim to increase the number of people with health insurance coverage through a variety of mechanisms: expanding public insurance programs such as Medicaid, requiring employers to insure workers, mandating that individuals obtain coverage, regulating insurance plans and establishing health insurance exchanges.\n\nSome of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions have already come into effect, including the requirement for private insurance plans to cover beneficiaries\u2019 children up to age 26. Other key provisions will not be implemented until 2016, however. As a result, it is difficult to predict law\u2019s impacts on the public\u2019s health and financial well-being. In the meantime, studying the effects of Massachusetts\u2019 health care reform law may provide insight into the future of U.S. health care.\n\nA number of studies have already examined the effects of the Massachusetts health law. A 2011 study from the City University of New York found no evidence suggesting that the law had decreased health care-related bankruptcies. Research published the same year in New England Journal of Medicine examined emergency facility under the law, but found mixed results.\n\nA 2014 study published in Annals of Internal Medicine, \u201cChanges in Mortality After Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law\u201d looks at the Massachusetts law\u2019s effects on death rates among state residents. The researchers \u2014 Benjamin D. Summers and Katherine Baicker of the Harvard School of Public Health and Sharon K. Long of the Urban Institute \u2014 matched counties in Massachusetts to similar counties in states without health care reform laws. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they compared changes in death rates among county residents ages 20 to 64 in the years before and after the implementation of the Massachusetts law.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings include:\n\nCompared to counties in other states, Massachusetts counties experienced a 2.9% decrease in mortality following the implementation of the health care reform bill. This corresponds to 8.2 fewer annual deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nMassachusetts counties with low household incomes and those with high proportions of uninsured residents in the pre-reform period experienced the greatest reductions in mortality rates.\n\nWhen the researchers focused on deaths caused by conditions amendable to health care such as cancer, infections and heart disease, the reduction in mortality rate associated with the Massachusetts law was 4.9%.\n\nProviding health insurance coverage for approximately 830 adults can prevent 1 death per year according to the authors\u2019 analysis.\n\nThe researchers caution readers that the results may not be generalizable to the rest of the United States, stating that \u201cit is critical to note the many dimensions in which Massachusetts differs from the rest of the nation, including lower mortality, higher income and baseline insurance coverage rates, fewer minorities, and the most per capita physicians in the country.\u201d\n\nRelated research: A 2011 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, \u201cMassachusetts\u2019 Health Care Reform and Emergency Department Utilization,\u201d looks at emergency department utilization in Massachusetts following its health care reform law.\n\nKeywords: Obamacare, health care exchanges, insurance mandate, universal care, consumer affairs, poverty\n\n\n\nWriter: Justin Feldman |\n\nCitation: Summers, Benjamin D.; Long, Sharon, K.; Baicker, Katherine. \u201cChanges in Mortality After Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law.\u201d Annals of Internal Medicine, May 2014, Vol. 160, No. 9, 585-593. doi: 10.7326/M13-2275.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "consumer affairs, poverty, news", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Journalist's Resource", "description": "2014 study published in Annals of Internal Medicine on the effects of the Massachusetts health care reform law, including a 2.9% decrease in mortality following its implementation.", "title": "Changes in mortality after Massachusetts health care reform law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Massachusetts-health-center-Dominic-Chavez-New-York-Times1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T09:22:37+00:00", "url": "http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/health-care/mortality-changes-massachusetts-health-care-reform", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Massachusetts-health-center-Dominic-Chavez-New-York-Times1.jpg", "description": "2014 study published in Annals of Internal Medicine on the effects of the Massachusetts health care reform law, including a 2.9% decrease in mortality following its implementation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Changes in mortality after Massachusetts health care reform law - Journalist's Resource"}, "fb": {"admins": "YOUR FB USER ID (OR USERNAME) HERE", "app_id": "APP ID HERE"}, "keywords": "proffesional wordpress theme, flexible wordpress theme, wordpress all in one theme, premium wordpress theme", "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "poverty", "published_time": "2014-06-19T09:32:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T09:22:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8f1\"", "article_summary": "In the meantime, studying the effects of Massachusetts\u2019 health care reform law may provide insight into the future of U.S. health care.\n\u201cChanges in Mortality After Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law.\u201d Annals of Internal Medicine, May 2014, Vol.\nA 2014 study published in Annals of Internal Medicine, \u201cChanges in Mortality After Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law\u201d looks at the Massachusetts law\u2019s effects on death rates among state residents.\nA number of studies have already examined the effects of the Massachusetts health law.\nThe study\u2019s findings include:Compared to counties in other states, Massachusetts counties experienced a 2.9% decrease in mortality following the implementation of the health care reform bill."}
