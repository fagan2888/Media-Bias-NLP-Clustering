In an unprecedented move, the ABA approved it.\n\nEven though online law schools have existed since the 1990s, their reach was very limited and the ABA refused to recognize them.

Still, there is one striking benefit for many who choose the hybrid option.\n\n\"Students don't have to quit their jobs or uproot their families. That is where the savings come from.\" said Duhl. \"We have doctors, police officers, nurses, social workers and professors\u2014people who have very good jobs but they want to go to law school.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "A wave of accredited law schools may start offering online classes after an unprecedented move by the American Bar Association.", "author": "Stephanie Landsman", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "More accredited law schools may offer online classes after an unprecedented move by the ABA.", "title": "Digital cracks the final frontier: Law school", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/02/digital-cracks-the-final-frontier-law-school.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/24/102531176-485207563.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More accredited law schools may offer online classes after an unprecedented move by the ABA.", "title": "Digital cracks the final frontier: Law school", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/02/digital-cracks-the-final-frontier-law-school.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/24/102531176-485207563.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@stephlandsman", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "NetNet, NetNet, Education Services, Technology, Law, Apple Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-04-05T12:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "NetNet", "modified_time": "2015-04-05T12:01:06-0400", "tag": "Apple Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102528663, "news_keywords": "American Bar Association, Online Degrees, Law School, Student Debt"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f43\"", "article_summary": "Law schools will never be the same thanks to a Minnesota law school which went up against the American Bar Association and won.\nEven though online law schools have existed since the 1990s, their reach was very limited and the ABA refused to recognize them.\n\"We have doctors, police officers, nurses, social workers and professors\u2014people who have very good jobs but they want to go to law school.\"\n\"With the decline of lawyers and law students, we were looking for new avenues to attract students.\"\nThe William Mitchell College of Law applied to the ABA for permission to design a hybrid online program to students."}
