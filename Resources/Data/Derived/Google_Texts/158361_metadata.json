YouTube\n\nA 14-pound baby born in Utah this past May will likely be the biggest baby born this year, according to reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of been watching and waiting to see if there is a baby who is bigger, because he might be the biggest of the year,\" said Sarah Brandon, the baby\u2019s mother.\n\nJoel Brandon, Jr. , affectionately called \u201cJ.J.\u201d by his family, was born at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, Utah on May 9. An ultrasound prior to his birth estimated that he\u2019d be a big newborn at about 11 pounds, but both his parents and his doctors were surprised when baby J.J. came out weighing 14 pounds.\n\n\u201cWhen they stuck him on the scale he was 14 pounds even,\u201d Sarah told ABC News. \u201cThe doctor said it was the biggest baby he had ever delivered.\u201d\n\nSarah has type 1 diabetes, a condition that Dr. Robert Barbieri suggests may have contributed to baby J.J.\u2019s size at birth.\n\n\u201cAn interesting effect of insulin, if it\u2019s not taken in a sufficient amount, the glucose remains high, and the baby\u2019s glucose starts to rise,\u201d said Barbieri. \u201cIt\u2019s like giving the baby fertilizer and it grows very large.\u201d\n\nOnly about one in every 1,000 babies weigh 11 pounds. The chances of having a 14-pound baby are extremely rare, at about one in 100,000, because doctors usually induce labor when babies reach a certain size.\n\nBaby J.J. spent a little over a week in the neonatal intensive care unit after being born. He initially suffered respiratory problems, but is now happy and healthy, spending time with his three-year-old twin sisters at home.\n\n\"This big bubba melts my heart,\" the happy mom said of her baby. \"I love him more than I ever imagined I could love a sweet baby boy. He is my squishy cuddle bug.\"\n\nUnfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.\n\nBreaking News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "14-pound baby, biggest baby, diabetes, pregnancy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Baby J.J. was born at a record-breaking 14 pounds, a weight that some doctors attribute to his mother's type 1 diabetes.", "title": "14-Pound Utah Baby Likely Biggest Born In US For 2013 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/14-pound-utah-baby-likely-biggest-born-us-2013-moms-type-1-diabetes-may-have-acted-baby-fertilizer", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/02/14-pound-baby.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Baby J.J. was born at a record-breaking 14 pounds, a weight that some doctors attribute to his mother's type 1 diabetes.", "title": "14-Pound Utah Baby Likely Biggest Born In US For 2013 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/14-pound-utah-baby-likely-biggest-born-us-2013-moms-type-1-diabetes-may-have-acted-baby-fertilizer", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/02/14-pound-baby.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/02/14-pound-baby.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-02T11:56:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-02T11:56:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Baby J.J. was born at a record-breaking 14 pounds, a weight that some doctors attribute to his mother's type 1 diabetes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87fa\"", "article_summary": "YouTubeA 14-pound baby born in Utah this past May will likely be the biggest baby born this year, according to reports.\nBaby JJ was born at 14 pounds, a weight that some doctors attribute to his mother's type 1 diabetes.\n\u201cWhen they stuck him on the scale he was 14 pounds even,\u201d Sarah told ABC News.\nBaby J.J. spent a little over a week in the neonatal intensive care unit after being born.\n\u201cThe doctor said it was the biggest baby he had ever delivered.\u201dSarah has type 1 diabetes, a condition that Dr. Robert Barbieri suggests may have contributed to baby J.J.\u2019s size at birth."}
