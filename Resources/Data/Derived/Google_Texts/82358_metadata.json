He says in most situations, a policy with a somewhat high deductible would meet his needs. \u201cIf I\u2019m someplace far from home and I have to use emergency room service, I can work out a $5,000 bill with a hospital,\u201d he says. But emergency surgery or a lengthy recuperative hospital stay \u201ccould break me.\u201d\n\nWhile owner-operators covered by their spouses\u2019 employer plans may see little change other than in premium rates or specifications on what is covered, like so many others shopping on the exchanges, Spoon hadn\u2019t gotten far in enrolling by mid-October, but his thoughts reflect the case for so many uninsured people. It\u2019s also part of the dynamic that mandatory insurance is designed to combat. If everyone has insurance, the thinking goes, and doctors and hospitals get paid for all services, care costs may eventually become more standardized and fall. In the near term, getting the millions currently uninsured into the exchanges and enrolled is proving a daunting task.\n\nAttempts by Overdrive to access the federal exchange \u2013 the primary application point for residents of the 34 states that have no state-run exchange \u2013 between the first and third weeks of October never got past creating a user account. Spoon went further, getting stuck in the identity-verification stage of the tax-credit/subsidy application, the first step of the application process on the federal exchange and necessary to begin shopping for specific policies.\n\nCreating an account for Spoon on the healthcare.gov website took four or five days, said Lowdermilk, who also plans to apply individually for coverage for herself and a son. \u201cWe have been trying to get a quote on the insurance since the first day and still haven\u2019t been able to get one,\u201d she said October 15.\n\nPODCASTING THE ACA | Healthy Trucking Association of America Director of Insurance Tom Smith told Overdrive Oct. 31 that, from what he\u2019s hearing, the federal government should have the healthcare.gov website and overall exchange architecture in more usable form within two to four weeks. You can hear more of our talk with Smith and Marc Ballard, who has worked closely with the HTAA on their efforts around the Affordable Care Act, in the special feature podcast below.\n\nFred Adams of the HSA for America insurance brokerage says one of the federal system\u2019s primary problems is a lack of connection between the online application system and the insurers. Furthermore, the identity verification process has seen more than its fair share of glitches.\n\nIf you\u2019re a current policyholder and your plan was purchased on the individual market prior to March 2010, your current policy will be good through its 2014 renewal date if not cancelled by the insurer, but ultimately you will have to move to an ACA-qualified plan. To forestall some of the associated headaches, Adams recommends talking with your insurer about potentially moving your anniversary date to December of this year to avoid a potential gap in coverage when the grandfathered policy runs out next year.\n\nHolly McCombs, wife of Maryland-based owner-operator David McCombs, is looking at such a situation. They pay $1,053 monthly for a plan they\u2019ve had since the mid-1980s, covering them and two children. A comparable plan on the state-run exchange \u201cwould run about $400 more than we are paying already,\u201d Holly McCombs says. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep what I have, but I hear rumors the insurance companies will jack up grandfathered-plan rates big-time. They won\u2019t be getting new healthy people in those plans.\u201d\n\nShe works as an independent contractor herself, with Campbell Insurance Services in Olney, Md. Since her husband leased on with a new company two years ago \u2013 hauling cars on an open trailer \u2013 he\u2019s done much better financially. \u201cTwo years ago, we would\u2019ve qualified for subsidies\u201d to reduce premiums with an exchange purchase, she says \u2013 not today.\n\nFortunately, at least, shopping plans may well be easier in Maryland, one of the 16 state-run exchanges (in addition to the District of Columbia). These saw much more progress through October than the federal exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Owner-operators weigh penalties vs. costs of private insurance or Obamacare exchange policies.
