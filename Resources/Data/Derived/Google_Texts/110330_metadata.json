At least since last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, and probably longer than that, it\u2019s been clear that something like this was bound to happen.\n\nRecall Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion in the Obergefell case holding that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. In that lengthy document Kennedy devoted a single paragraph to the rights of religious believers who disagree.\n\nSuch people, he said, \u201cmay continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.\u201d But what of that? The Constitution \u201cdoes not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex,\u201d he insisted.\n\nKennedy\u2019s words echo the secularist line that believers can believe whatever they want, but values grounded in religious faith must be overridden if they conflict with the utilitarian calculus underlying secularist policy goals.\n\nThe most infamous instance is probably the \u201cmandate\u201d attached by administrative fiat to the Affordable Care Act and requiring church-related institutions and groups to include coverage for contraception\u0097including abortifacient drugs\u0097in employee health plans. A Supreme Court ruling on the merits of a compromise is expected before the court adjourns in late June.\n\nMore recently, the same-sex marriage ruling a year ago touched off efforts to enact state-level religious freedom laws exempting people with moral objections from having to facilitate these unions. Some 20 states have adopted such measures.\n\nBut the gay rights movement and its secular supporters fiercely oppose such laws. In vetoing one In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe called it \u201can attempt to stigmatize.\u201d To which Bishop Paul Loverde of Arlington and Bishop Francis DiLorenzo of Richmond, who supported the legislation, angrily retorted, \u201cWe do not \u2018stigmatize,\u2019 we serve.\u201d They cited the Church\u2019s extensive educational and social services as evidence.\n\nThe latest addition to this battleground concerns transgender rights. North Carolina has come under sustained attack by culture warriors of the left for having adopted a law that would require transgender individuals to use public bathrooms and showers designated for persons of their biological sex. This was in response to the enactment by the city of Charlotte of an ordinance taking the opposite tack on this less than burning but notably tasteless question.\n\nWhile there are real issues for discussion in some of these lifestyle controversies, in times past many would have been settled by moral consensus and good manners. Now, by contrast, they become matters for legislation and litigation.\n\nTwenty years ago historian Gertrude Himmelfarb published a collection of essays reflecting on the cultural revolution of the 1960s. The book was titled One Nation, Two Cultures, and its conclusion was that the United States had become a country starkly divided between two conflicting world views\u0097one based on traditional values, the other embodying an ethic of relativistic individualism.\n\n\u201cSociety is polarized in significant ways,\u201d Himmelfarb wrote, \u201cand those who deny or minimize this polarization are obscuring the reality.\u201d But not to worry, she added. In the end, \u201clet us be content with the knowledge that the two cultures are living together with some degree of tension but without civil strife or anarchy.\u201d\n\nThat coexistence was fairly cold comfort even then. And if Himmelfarb were writing now, one wonders, would she still find grounds for being even this upbeat about America\u2019s polarized cultural condition?", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Politics Russell Shaw", "description": "As culture wars escalate, so do legislation and litigation Coexistence becomes increasingly difficult as polarization over morals and rights becomes polarized to the the breaking point Russell Shaw"}, "article_summary": "Recall Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion in the Obergefell case holding that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.\nSuch people, he said, \u201cmay continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.\u201d But what of that?\nThe Constitution \u201cdoes not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex,\u201d he insisted.\nAt least since last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, and probably longer than that, it\u2019s been clear that something like this was bound to happen.\nIn that lengthy document Kennedy devoted a single paragraph to the rights of religious believers who disagree."}
