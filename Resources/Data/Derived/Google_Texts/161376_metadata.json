Leaders from both sides say the hate has been manipulated for political gain.\n\nHealing rifts between Christian and Muslim communities has been a theme throughout Francis' first visit to the continent, which has also taken him to Kenya and Uganda.\n\nHowever, nowhere is his call for peace and reconciliation more pressing than in Central African Republic, where thousands have died and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in clashes that have split the country along religious lines.\n\nUNPRECEDENTED SECURITY\n\n\"Together, we must say no to hatred, to revenge and to violence, particularly that violence which is perpetrated in the name of a religion or of God himself. God is peace, 'salam,'\" the pope said, using the Arabic word for peace.\n\nUnprecedented security measures have been laid on for the pontiff's two-day visit to the former French colony, which took place amid a surge in violence.\n\nTit-for-tat killings in and around the tiny PK5 enclave have claimed at least 100 lives since late September, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nImam Naibi has called PK5 \"an open-air prison\", but on Monday he struck a optimistic tone.\n\n\"The relationship between our Christian brothers and sisters and ourselves is so deep that no manoeuvre seeking to undermine it will succeed,\" he told the pope.\n\n\"The Christians and Muslims of this country are obliged to live together and love each other.\"\n\nBoth the Christian majority and the minority Muslims have welcomed the pope's visit, hoping he can spur renewed dialogue and help restore peace. Thousands of PK5's Muslims lined the road into the enclave to get a glimpse of the pontiff.\n\nCentral African Republic's United Nations peacekeeping mission brought in additional forces and has deployed over 3,000 soldiers in an attempt to secure the city during the pope's visit. The government is also contributing around 500 police and gendarmes. French troops based in Bangui are also on alert.\n\nPope Francis ends his Africa tour with a Mass for tens of thousands of Catholics at the country's national stadium before returning to Rome.\n\n(Editing by Tom Heneghan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BANGUI (Reuters) - Pope Francis ventured into one of the world's most dangerous neighb", "title": "Pope ends Africa trip with mosque visit in besieged enclave", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/29/Pope-end-Africa-trip-mosque-visit-besieged-enclave", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-africa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/29/Pope-end-Africa-trip-mosque-visit-besieged-enclave", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-africa_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BANGUI (Reuters) - Pope Francis ventured into one of the world's most dangerous neighb", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Pope Francis ends his Africa tour with a Mass for tens of thousands of Catholics at the country's national stadium before returning to Rome.\nCentral African Republic descended into chaos in early 2013 when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the majority Christian country, sparking reprisals from Christian militias.\nGod is peace, 'salam,'\" the pope said, using the Arabic word for peace.\nThousands of PK5's Muslims lined the road into the enclave to get a glimpse of the pontiff.\nBoth the Christian majority and the minority Muslims have welcomed the pope's visit, hoping he can spur renewed dialogue and help restore peace."}
