Kelli Ward compared her GOP primary race against U.S. Sen. John McCain to a \u201cDavid and Goliath\u201d situation.\n\nMcCain, a five-term senator who ran for U.S. president in 2008, has greater name recognition, Ward admitted, and will likely always have more available cash to spend on campaigning. McCain reported having about $5 million on hand at the end of 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBut she told a handful of supporters in Casa Grande on Monday that the Biblical David, the underdog, still came out the victor.\n\nWard proudly presents herself as an outsider ready to shake up the \u201cWashington Establishment.\u201d The physician from Lake Havasu City said the country has reached a turning point where both Republicans and Democrats are fed up with \u201ccareer politicians\u201d they\u2019re voting to represent them.\n\n\u201cPolitically, the landscape is such that people are ready for a change,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the direction that the country is going in and they don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in Washington, D.C..\u201d\n\nHer political views fall in line with a conservative ideology: shrinking government influence, protecting constitutional rights and cutting taxes.\n\nDuring her campaign stop at the Big House Cafe on Fourth Street, she told local supporters that McCain is no longer the conservative he claims to be and it\u2019s time for a \u201cbold, fresh, fearless\u201d voice to replace him.\n\nRay Jorgensen, a Casa Grande resident, attended Monday\u2019s event and agreed that McCain has been in office for too long. He added that he\u2019s tired of the present politicians who haven\u2019t done much productive in the last four years.\n\nIn an interview with the Casa Grande Dispatch, Ward said the most common issue Arizonans voice to her on the campaign trail is securing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cWe need to have some kind of physical infrastructure,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a fence, whether it\u2019s a wall. Something has to be there as a barrier.\u201d\n\nShe supports increasing the number of \u201cboots on the ground\u201d at the border as well as eliminating government funding to sanctuary cities that shelter illegal immigrants.\n\nBefore being elected to the state Senate in 2013, Ward worked full-time as a physician in primary and emergency care. She said she\u2019s witnessed a business model in medicine that is slowly failing and has worsened since the Affordable Care Act was implemented.\n\n\u201cOur emergency departments are overwhelmed and they\u2019re overcrowded,\u201d Ward said. \u201cAnd many of the people who come don\u2019t come for emergency conditions.\u201d\n\nShe blamed the country\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, the health care program for low-income individuals, as part of the reason why hospitals are becoming overwhelmed and unsustainable.\n\nHer vision for America\u2019s health care involves repealing the Affordable Care Act and introducing what she\u2019s termed the Patients Power Plan, which would establish health savings accounts for each citizen.\n\nHealth savings accounts were created in 2003 and allow individuals to place tax-advantaged money in an account to pay for future health expenses. Ward said this type of economic model would increase competition among insurers and lower health care costs.\n\nIn an email response, a campaign spokeswoman for McCain stated the senator has led the charge against the Affordable Care Act since day one and has continued trying to replace the country\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d heath care system.\n\n\u201cJohn McCain has an unmatched record of service and sacrifice to Arizona and our nation,\u201d the spokeswoman stated. \u201cWhether it\u2019s stopping President Obama\u2019s attempt to retire the A-10 fleet or securing tens of millions to help secure the border, John McCain has proven he\u2019ll always fight for what\u2019s right for the people of Arizona.\u201d\n\nAs a state legislator, Ward said she wasn\u2019t afraid of challenging the status quo. She pointed out how she was the only senator to not vote for establishing the Arizona Department of Child Safety in 2014 \u2014 a decision she said in hindsight has proven to be right.\n\nADCS has made unflattering headlines since its creation regarding case backlogs and staff turnovers, she said.\n\n\u201cI hate to say \u2018I told you so\u2019 on something so important as our children and family welfare in this state,\u201d Ward said.\n\nIt is Ward\u2019s integrity that Peggy Weathers, a Casa Grande resident, admires most about the political candidate. She said McCain no longer represents her conservative views, and she is ready for a change.\n\nThe preservation of constitutional rights is what Weathers appreciates about Ward\u2019s campaign platform and thinks she has a good chance of defeating McCain in the primary election on Aug. 30.\n\nThree other Republicans besides McCain are declared candidates along with two Democrats.\n\nWard further demonstrated her support of Second Amendment rights by posting a giveaway contest of a limited edition AR-15 rifle on her campaign website.\n\n\u201cWhat better way than to enhance (gun rights) and showcase it than by giving away a beautiful AR-15,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd manufactured in her campaign colors too, Ward added.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "area_news", "og": {"site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "description": "CASA GRANDE \u2014 Former state Sen.
