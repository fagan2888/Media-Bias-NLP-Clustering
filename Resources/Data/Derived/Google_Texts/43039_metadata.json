Some claimed these organizations were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.\n\nFive years later, the law\u2019s effectiveness in this regard has been a demonstrable failure, as some now question whether those same institutions have simply become \u201ctoo big to regulate.\u201d\n\nLed by Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, the House Financial Services Committee yesterday held a hearing yesterday on the status of U.S. financial markets five years after Dodd-Frank. Hensarling\u2019s opening statement took a strong stance on the matter \u2014 Dodd-Frank has seemingly been a catalyst, not an inhibitor, of financial instability.\n\nWhat is undebatable is the fact that since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the big banks are now bigger; the small banks are now fewer. In other words, even more banking assets are now concentrated in the so-called \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 firms. Pray tell, how does this improve financial stability?\n\nHensarling expressed similar sentiments during a June 9 conversation with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Mary Kissel, characterizing the act as an \u201cavalanche of regulation\u201d similar to Obamacare and oppressive regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency. He points to this regulatory burden as one of the reasons the biggest banks have been able to grow disproportionately large, while smaller institutions struggle with enormous compliance burdens.\n\nIn May, the Mercatus Center\u2019s Margaret Pierce published a critique laying out the law\u2019s principal problem \u2013 its failure to recognize that regulators, not just markets, can also fail:\n\nThis macroprudential approach places too much confidence in the regulators to always get things right, and it inhibits market mechanisms from responding organically to problems as they arise. The last crisis taught us that regulators do not always get things right, and markets absorbed in regulatory compliance are very poor at disciplining themselves. The result is a less stable financial system.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, the committee heard testimony from, among others, Pierce\u2019s Mercatus Center colleague Todd Zywicki and Mark Calabria of the Cato Institute. Zywicki explained how the bill has resulted in higher prices and limited consumer choice through its inherent disregard for consumer interests. Among its specific effects has been a marked decrease in the percentage of banks offering free checking accounts, as exhibited by the graphic below.\n\nCalabria noted that key ingredients of the financial crisis were exceptionally loose monetary policy and supply rigidities in U.S. property markets, things that Dodd-Frank simply did nothing to address. \u201cIt is not enough to just \u2018do something\u2019 \u2013 we must do the correct things,\u201d Calabria said.\n\nWhether the Dodd-Frank Act is reformed, replaced or phased out, it will be crucial for the future of the U.S economy to address its significant flaws. Overregulating the financial markets has proven through extensive failures to have been nothing but disastrous.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "commercial freedom,lending", "og": {"image": "http://redesign.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/R-Street-Logo1.png", "title": "The Dodd-Frankenstein monster | R Street"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb05\"", "article_summary": "Overregulating the financial markets has proven through extensive failures to have been nothing but disastrous.\nWhat is undebatable is the fact that since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the big banks are now bigger; the small banks are now fewer.\nCalabria noted that key ingredients of the financial crisis were exceptionally loose monetary policy and supply rigidities in U.S. property markets, things that Dodd-Frank simply did nothing to address.\nHaving established new government agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, one of Dodd-Frank\u2019s initial purposes was to monitor the performance of big banks deemed vital to the performance of the U.S. economy.\nHensarling\u2019s opening statement took a strong stance on the matter \u2014 Dodd-Frank has seemingly been a catalyst, not an inhibitor, of financial instability."}
