Roy said Thursday each player was questionable with injuries.\n\nCamp structure. Roy and his staff designed a camp to get good looks at all 67 participating players, comprising four teams \u2014 Burgundy, Blue, Black and Grey \u2014 in two sessions over more than four hours.\n\nIn each session, two teams do drills on the south rink at Family Sports Center before scrimmaging on their regular practice rink in three 15-minute periods.\n\nBlue beat Burgundy 4-3 in a shootout in the opening scrimmage. Landeskog had the opening goal for Burgundy, against goalie Semyon Varlamov, but Varlamov stopped all three shots in the shootout to beat the Reto Berra-backed Burgundy.\n\nO\u2019Reilly scored in the shootout on Berra, who went on to stop Matt Duchene and Zach Redmond. Landeskog, Joey Hishon and Alex Tanguay couldn\u2019t get pucks past Varlamov.\n\nThe Black beat the Grey 4-1 in the second scrimmage. Roy said Friday\u2019s winners will face each other Saturday in a championship-type setting, while Friday\u2019s losers play in the other game.\n\nBleackley impresses coach. Duchene centered O\u2019Reilly and 18-year-old Conner Bleackley in Friday\u2019s first scrimmage. Bleackley got lit up in the neutral zone by defenseman Gabriel Beaupre, but Roy said he was impressed with the 2014 first-round draft pick.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs John Mitchell, Jamie McGinn out with injuries", "title": "Avs John Mitchell, Jamie McGinn out with injuries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/19/avs-john-mitchell-jamie-mcginn-out-with-injuries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919_113528_jamie-mcginn.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919_113528_jamie-mcginn.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-19T23:38:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:54:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Avalanche center John Mitchell (head) and winger Jamie McGinn (back) did not participate in the on-ice activities during Friday\u2019s opening day of training camp, but coach Patrick Roy said both are day to day.\nBlue beat Burgundy 4-3 in a shootout in the opening scrimmage.\nRoy said Friday\u2019s winners will face each other Saturday in a championship-type setting, while Friday\u2019s losers play in the other game.\nLandeskog had the opening goal for Burgundy, against goalie Semyon Varlamov, but Varlamov stopped all three shots in the shootout to beat the Reto Berra-backed Burgundy.\nMitchell participated in a captain\u2019s practice Wednesday but is suffering from migraines, unrelated to the concussion that kept him out of the playoffs in April, Roy said."}
