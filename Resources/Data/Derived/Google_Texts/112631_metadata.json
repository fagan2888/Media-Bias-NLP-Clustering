It wasn\u2019t one of their high-profile choices \u2013 whether or not to shut down the government, whether or not to sabotage American foreign policy, etc. \u2013 but it nevertheless mattered quite a bit.\n\nIn practical terms, GOP leaders had to pick their accountant. Doug Elmendorf\u2019s term as head of the Congressional Budget Office was nearly over, and Republicans were under pressure to reappoint him to another term. The recommendations made sense \u2013 Elmendorf developed a reputation as a respected, impartial economist, who was pretty effective in telling lawmakers \u2013 and by extension, all of us \u2013 how much stuff costs.\n\nAs we talked about late last year, the argument from mainstream conservatives was that Elmendorf could extend meaningful credibility to GOP proposals through favorable scores \u2013 if Elmendorf said Republicans\u2019 numbers add up, everyone would know GOP lawmakers were taking their responsibilities seriously.\n\nSoon after, right on cue, Republicans showed Elmendorf the door, and introduced Keith Hall, a \u201c Republican stalwart ,\u201d as the new CBO chief. The strategy wasn\u2019t subtle: GOP leaders wanted a Congressional Budget Office that would tell conservatives what they wanted to hear. Elmendorf wouldn\u2019t, so he had to go.\n\nIn an amusing twist, it turns out that Hall isn\u2019t the reliable ally Republicans expected him to be.\n\nThe new Republican-appointed director of the Congressional Budget Office delivered some bad news \u2026 to the party\u2019s \u201cReaganomics\u201d devotees: Tax cuts don\u2019t pay for themselves through turbocharged economic growth. Keith Hall, who served as an economic adviser to former President George W. Bush, made the pronouncement at his first news conference after the CBO reduced its 2015 budget deficit forecast by $60 billion.\n\nHall spoke to reporters recently, shortly before lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill, and he threw cold water at one of the Republican Party\u2019s top economic principles. \u201cNo, the evidence is that tax cuts do not pay for themselves,\u201d Hall told reporters. \u201cAnd our models that we\u2019re doing, our macroeconomic effects, show that.\u201d\n\nFor far-right lawmakers, the comments added insult to injury. Congressional Republicans were already seething after the CBO reported in June that if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, 19 million Americans would lose access to health care benefits and the deficit would grow by a third of a trillion dollars over the next decade.\n\nGOP lawmakers expected the budget office to release figures that reinforced party talking points, not issue a report that made the party look even worse.\n\nIn other words, congressional Republicans went out of their way to ignore the advice of experts and choose a CBO chief who would tell far-right lawmakers how correct they are \u2013 and they ended up with a new head of the CBO who\u2019s irritating Republicans with pesky facts and evidence.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "GOP leaders tried to choose a Congressional Budget Office chief who'd tell them exactly what they wanted to hear.
