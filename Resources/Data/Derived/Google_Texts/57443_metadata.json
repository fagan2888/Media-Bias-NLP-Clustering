(Should we) put people in the hands of folks whose core competencies are Medicaid?\u201d\n\nDiscussions between Health Care Policy and Financing and Connect for Health Colorado will be watched by the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe governor is interested in making sure that there is an appropriate level of collaboration \u2026 and that we get the right people talking about this,\u201d said David Padrino, Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\n\nExchange staff estimate that Medicaid customers made 40 percent to 45 percent of calls to the customer service center, for which the forecast 2014-15 budget has climbed from just less than the $15 million approved by the board to about $21 million.\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid expansion has cost us significantly more than we thought,\u201d said board member Dr. Mike Fallon. \u201cWe need paying customers to become financially stable. The customers of Connect for Health are paying to support Medicaid. We don\u2019t have the money to do this. Our $26 million dollar (annual operating) budget is now laughable.\u201d\n\nHealth Care Policy and Financing executive director Sue Birch said the data the exchange offered on costs attributable to Medicaid enrollees was \u201cprimitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t think is being heard is that Medicaid will pay its fair share once it gets that (better) data,\u201d said Birch, who is also a non-voting member of the exchange board.\n\nShe said the exchange and her office should work together more closely to resolve issues and contract with a single technology vendor. Currently, each organization contracts separately with its own vendor.\n\nDrews and others said exchange workers don\u2019t have full access to information in the Medicaid system, the Colorado Benefits-Management System, which makes it difficult for the exchange to help households caught between the two systems.\n\nThe board voted Monday to seek proposals for an independent end-to-end review of the technology systems, while moving ahead with obvious tech fixes and deciding the larger issue of the exchange\u2019s involvement in Medicaid.\n\nOnly 54 percent of 2015 enrollees received financial assistance. The other 46 percent didn\u2019t have to navigate the eligibility system.\n\nOne proposed technology fix is that customers who are clearly not Medicaid-eligible be able to bypass the shared eligibility system. Cost estimates range from $2 million to $7 million.\n\nAnother option is an even more integrated system with Medicaid, which Fallon said he opposed.\n\n\u201cWe become a small cog in a huge machine we have no control over,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cI encourage the board to do minimum interoperability with Medicaid.\u201d\n\nOf the total 224,171 applications for financial assistance submitted through the Shared Eligibility System during the recent three-month open-enrollment period, 76,783 applications originated from Connect for Health Colorado, the exchange reported. An estimated 78 percent of marketplace customers who went through the Shared Eligibility System received a \u201creal-time\u201d (in roughly an hour) eligibility determination. About 52,000 were denied Medicaid and were sent to the marketplace eligible for financial subsidies toward their private insurance plans.\n\nBirch said board members were overlooking the \u201cextraordinary successes\u201d of the exchange-Medicaid partnership to date.\n\n\u201cOur reason for existing is to help people who need insurance,\u201d Birch said.\n\nBroker John Luhman said during public comment that he disagreed with the exchange estimates of enrollees still shut out of coverage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me there are 700 people left out there. I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Luhman said. \u201cI have 38 households hung up.\u201d\n\nLuhman is one of 1,300 brokers working with the exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of my customers going though this ungodly process over and over,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a system of technology that\u2019s horrible. It stinks.\u201d\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance exchange officials clash over Medicaid role", "title": "Colorado health insurance exchange officials clash over Medicaid role", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/09/colorado-health-insurance-exchange-officials-clash-over-medicaid-role/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141103_082136_Connect-for-Health-Colorado-Screengrab-6.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141103_082136_Connect-for-Health-Colorado-Screengrab-6.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T16:42:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T00:38:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c16\"", "article_summary": "The online Shared Eligibility System \u2014 the interface between the state marketplace and Medicaid \u2014 has caused most of the intractable problems, exchange officials say.\nMedicaid patients enrolling through the state health insurance exchange are taking too much of its resources, exchange board members said Monday, but state officials propose an even tighter partnership.\n(Should we) put people in the hands of folks whose core competencies are Medicaid?\u201dDiscussions between Health Care Policy and Financing and Connect for Health Colorado will be watched by the governor\u2019s office.\nBut system and user errors have created problems for thousands of Colorado customers seeking financial assistance under the Affordable Care Act.\nOne proposed technology fix is that customers who are clearly not Medicaid-eligible be able to bypass the shared eligibility system."}
