On Monday alone, protesters staged an event inside and outside of Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s office [in photo] to press for Medicaid expansion while sponsors of a medical marijuana bill received the endorsement of the Medical Association of Georgia.\n\nMedical news appears to be at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s 2014 Legislative session. On Monday alone, protesters staged an event outside of Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s office to press for Medicaid expansion while sponsors of a medical marijuana bill received the endorsement of the Medical Association of Georgia.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the medical marijuana bill, which will drop Tuesday.\n\nThere are two pieces of legislation getting bi-partisan support, but as Claire Simms reports for GPB\u2019s On The Story, inside the Capitol, lawmakers are all over the map on the idea.\n\n\u201cI know there has been a lot of attention paid to the issue,\u201d House Speaker David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican, told GPB. \u201cI\u2019ve said that it\u2019s an issue that we really sort of need to take the politics out of.\u201d\n\nSenator Josh McKoon, a Columbus Republican, filed a bill to set up a medical marijuana study committee. He told GPB he wants to know about the science behind the push for using marijuana as part of medical treatments.\n\nNo Pot Shops In Georgia\n\n\u201cWhat medical research has been done?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd frankly, you know, the 20 other states that have some kind of law on the books regarding the subject, what has their experience been like?\u201d\n\nThe committee his bill aims to establish would make policy recommendations next session.\n\nBut this session, Republican Representative Allen Peake of Macon is sponsoring a bill to legalize medical use for Georgians suffering with seizure disorders. He plans to officially file the bill Tuesday.\n\nPeake cautions if the bill passes \u2013 something he likens to a miracle at this point \u2013 Georgians \u201cwon\u2019t see pot shops on every corner.\u201d He says access to cannabis oil \u2013 not actual marijuana \u2013 would be tightly controlled through the network of Georgia\u2019s medical research centers, including Georgia Regents University in Augusta. There would be no licensed growers in Georgia. And the bill would place a premium on research as a way of verifying that marijuana has medicinal powers.\n\nHouse speaker Ralston says while he doesn\u2019t support Peake\u2019s bill outright, he does think the issue is worthy of discussion.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Doctors Back Medical Marijuana Bill\n\nPeake called the news Monday of support from the Medical Association of Georgia a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d He said he heard a lot of misgivings from conservative colleagues because they didn\u2019t know where the medical community stood on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tightly restricted, well-regulated, managed by doctors, limited in scope to just a cannabidiol oil that\u2019s applied orally,\u201d Peake said in an interview. \u201cAnd so I think that will give comfort to my colleagues and the people of Georgia that this is not going to allow six-year-olds to be smoking a joint on the street corner.\u201d\n\nAccompanying Peake Monday at the Capitol was Dr. James Smith, a Gwinnett County physician. He\u2019s part of MAG\u2019s leadership, and unfortunately, someone who has had a first-hand view of the drug\u2019s potential to help. His 7-year-old daughter has developed a seizure disorder called Doose syndrome. And he says all of the treatments his family has tried have devastating side effects. All, except the cannabis oil, also known by the name cannabidiol oil.\n\nHe said Georgia\u2019s approach, under the bill Peake is proposing, would be extremely conservative.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started investigating this, the more I learned the more I realized how restrictive it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you treat just with the oil, you don\u2019t get the THC concentration that causes the psychotropic effect that you think of with lighting up a joint. What\u2019s out there, albeit some of it anecdotal, is pretty miraculous.\u201d\n\nFor more coverage of the medical marijuana bill and all the pros and cons, tune into GPB\u2019s On The Story on Tuesday, Jan. 28 for a panel discussion featuring Dr. Smith, Rep. Peake, and Janea Cox (whose daughter inspired the bill).\n\nBecause You Can\u2019t, You Won\u2019t And You Don\u2019t Stop\n\nThe legislative session continues to move at a clip. And Tuesday at the Capitol will be yet another day chock full of activity.\n\nMore than 1,000 charter school students are expected to descend upon Atlanta for a rally at the Capitol in honor of School Choice Week.\n\nAnd Rep. Jason Spencer, a Woodbine Republican, will be holding a press conference to push bills that would undermine the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019ll be presenting a petition with over 37,000 signatures in support of his legislation, which would bar state employees and agencies from enforcing and implementing the federal healthcare law.\n\nSpencer and his supporters are on the other side of the issue from the folks who staged the protest Monday afternoon at the Capitol. They\u2019re part of Moral Mondays, a weekly protest organized by Sen. Vincent Fort aimed at convincing Gov. Deal to expand Medicaid for the 650,000 Georgians who don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nThe Atlanta Democrat slipped something special into Monday\u2019s protest: a sit-in inside and outside of Deal\u2019s office.\n\nThere were songs, there were chants, there was filming (the protesters filmed the state troopers guarding Deal\u2019s office door and the troopers filmed them back). There were even arrests. Ten people, including Fort, were arrested for refusing to leave Deal's office.\n\nWith the troopers on one side and the protesters on the other, for a moment, the spirit of the 1960s was alive.\n\nIn case you forgot, Georgia could expand Medicaid under the ACA and the federal government would foot the bill for the new enrollees in the beginning. But Deal and others worry that eventually the federal government will close the coffers and leave Georgia on the hook to pay for all of the new Medicaid recipients.\n\nOn the first day of the session, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t blink,\u201d because the session will be motoring by. But maybe I should add \u201cdon\u2019t rest.\u201d It would appear the session will contain the same amount of activity, horse-trading and bill-vetting as normal \u2013 just in two months instead of three.
