Indiana Gov. Mike Pence sure has a long way to go if he ever wants to get in the LGBT community’s good graces. (For the record, it doesn’t seem as if this is something that interests the Republican governor much, but we’ll let that slide for the moment.)

Responding to backlash over his decision to sign a controversial religious freedom law that threatens LGBT rights, Pence attempted to garner a little goodwill among his critics this week, issuing a letter to the LGBT organization Indy Pride welcoming people to its annual pride festival. There’s just one hitch: Pence’s letter totally neglects to mention anything having to do with the LGBT community, save and except for his use of the word “pride” in addressing the organization.

“On behalf of the people of Indiana, welcome to Indianapolis,” the letter, which is addressed to an Indianapolis-based organization, reads. “I am confident that those of you who traveled from out of state will come to know our famous Hoosier Hospitality.”
