CareSource, the Dayton, Ohio-based heath insurance company, recently joined Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield in the exchange.\n\nCareSource is operating in 10 West Virginia counties. Currently the company serves more than 1.4 million consumers in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.\n\n\u201cCareSource wants to grow our mission-based, non-profit model to provide affordable coverage to West Virginians,\u201d CareSource Senior Vice President Scott Streator said. \u201cWest Virginians are asking for more health. They want more options; they want more affordable coverage.\u201d\n\nStreator said on their silver and gold plans, generic medications would be \u201cfree\u201d, which accounts for 90 percent of all prescriptions. He said their website is easy to understand.\n\n\u201cWhen a person goes to caresource.com, we actually translate the terms on what this means. What is a premium? What is a deductible?\u201d He said. \u201cWe made our plan designs very easy to understand as well. Rather than all the percentage co-payments, we found consumers want a flat co-pay.\u201d\n\nState residents want more help, options and affordable coverage, according to Streator.\n\n\u201cWe surveyed across West Virginia households before we entered the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want affordable coverage. They also want coverage they can understand. Fifty-two percent said it was confusing. West Virginians want an insurance program they can use not just when the are sick. They really want to get healthier.\u201d\n\nState residents wants affordable premiums and health insurance that can be used right away, Streator said.\n\nCareSource plans to create some jobs in the Mountain State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hiring West Virginians. We\u2019ve hired two already. We\u2019re going to put an office in Charleston,\u201d said Streator. \u2018We\u2019re going to be present and visible in the field to help consumers understand our health insurance benefits.\u201d\n\nCareSource is offered to residents in Brooke, Cabell, Hancock, Kanawha, Lincoln, Marshall, Mason, Ohio, Putnam, Wayne counties. The goal is to go statewide in the future, according to Streator.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Company surveys state residents before entering market.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Company surveys state residents before entering market.", "title": "CareSource operating in 10 counties as part of health insurance exchange", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/11/15/caresource-operating-in-10-counties-as-part-of-health-insurance-exhange/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CareSource.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CareSource.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T15:47:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T14:47:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0446\"", "article_summary": "CareSource is operating in 10 West Virginia counties.\n\u201cCareSource wants to grow our mission-based, non-profit model to provide affordable coverage to West Virginians,\u201d CareSource Senior Vice President Scott Streator said.\nThey really want to get healthier.\u201dState residents wants affordable premiums and health insurance that can be used right away, Streator said.\nBy Matt Maccaro in News | November 15, 2015 at 10:47AMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 West Virginia now has two insurance companies in the health insurance exchange that began three years ago in connection with the Affordable Care Act.\nWest Virginians want an insurance program they can use not just when the are sick."}
