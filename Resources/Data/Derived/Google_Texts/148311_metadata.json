Singing a version of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" \u2014 replacing \"saints\" with \"Yanks\" \u2014 the Outlaws banged drums and waved soccer scarves.\n\nThe crew has been chanting \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\" for the men's team since 2007, but this is the first time they'll have an organized presence to cheer on the women's national team at a World Cup. (About 700 members are expected to show up.)\n\nWhat is now a nonprofit with 180 chapters and 30,000 people started with three die-hard soccer fans in Lincoln, Neb. Korey Donahoo, one of the co-founders, says they traveled around for years to watch the U.S. men play (the closest soccer stadium is four hours away).\n\n\"We would let the U.S. soccer roster pretty much dictate our vacations,\" 32-year-old Donahoo says.\n\nThe guys lamented the lack of organized tailgates, fan sections or meetups to watch games at local bars. So, in 2007, when the U.S. men played Brazil in Chicago, they brought together like-minded fans for the first official event of the American Outlaws \u2014 or AO, for short.\n\nThere have been some growing pains for this nonprofit. Former Outlaws have accused the AO members of being \"bro-y\" and \"touchy-feely\" with women, as reported by Fusion. People have been put off by the pro-Americanness of the gatherings, saying at the stadiums or bars it can devolve into a negative \"us vs. them\" vibe.\n\nBack at the AO tailgate before the U.S. vs. Mexico women's game, there is a family-friendly atmosphere: grilling, kids kicking around the soccer ball and adults playing cornhole. John Santos of the Los Angeles chapter, who helped organize the event, says the women's games are usually like this, but he adds that he has encouraged members to speak up if they ever feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's just a game,\" Santos says. \"But, people on all sides, you know, the passion takes over. They want to see their team win, like a Yankees fan wants to see their team beat the Red Sox. We try to police ourselves as best we can, make sure everyone's being safe, but every now and then, unfortunately, things happen that are out of our control.\"\n\nSantos met his girlfriend at a U.S. women's event sponsored by the American Outlaws and says his chapter \u2014 which is one of the most diverse \u2014 does its best to keep things positive. Santos' family is from Mexico but says he's gotten his dad to sport red, white and blue and cheer on the U.S. national team.\n\nNearly everyone at the AO tailgate wears their red, white and blue, whether they are of Korean, Filipino, Central American or Mexican descent. There are even red-white-and-blue lucha libre masks and sombreros.\n\nAmerican Outlaw Linda Pickle, 65, rocks a red shirt that says, \"dos a cero\" on it, with all the dates the U.S. beat Mexico 2-0, and clutches her photo album from the 2014 Men's World Cup.\n\nBut Pickle says she especially loves watching the women play \u2014 so much so that she had her daughter change her wedding date so it wouldn't coincide with the Women's World Cup final in 1999. She is glad the AO is paying more attention to them this year.\n\n\"We are really pushing to get the women more recognized because they used to kind of ignore [them] and maybe get four or five people at a viewing party,\" Pickle says.\n\nThe American Outlaws are already practicing specific chants for players who will be taking the world stage in a couple of weeks. They've replaced \"the roof\" with \"Leroux\" \u2014 as in, \"Leroux, Leroux, Leroux is on fire!\" \u2014 to cheer on No. 2, forward Sydney Leroux, who scored two of the U.S. team's five points in its win over Mexico at the send-off game.\n\nAnd the players are listening.\n\n\"The Outlaws are absolutely amazing,\" says team captain Christie Rampone after the win. \"We couldn't do it without them; it's the fans that get us going, it's that's inspiration to keep going every day, and training and hopefully winning this World Cup for them.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 NPR.

The best players in the world will face off in Canada, so it's time for soccer fans to replace their favorite club jerseys with their national colors. The largest U.S. national soccer fan club will be rocking its red, white and blue. NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji hung out with some of the super fans as they prepare to support the women's team.\n\nSHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: They call themselves American Outlaws, AO for short.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, when the yanks.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Oh, when the yanks.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Go marching in.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Go marching in. (Singing) Oh, when the yanks go marching in.\n\nMERAJI: About a hundred AO fans marched into the StubHub Stadium in Carson, Calif., to support the U.S. women against Mexico for a recent World Cup Send-Off Series game.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) We are going. We are going. We are going, Canada.\n\nMERAJI: Yes, the AO will have about 700 members in Canada to cheer on the U.S. women at a World Cup for the first time. They've been chanting USA, USA, for the men's team since 2007, due in large part to this guy.\n\nKOREY DONAHOO: My name is Korey Donahoo, and I'm one of the cofounders of American Outlaws.\n\nMERAJI: 32-year-old Donahoo is a diehard soccer fan, and not from a soccer-loving city like D.C. or Portland. He's from Lincoln, Neb., a football town - American football. Nebraska Cornhuskers, anyone? The closest soccer stadium is four hours away, and Donahoo and his friends have been traveling to watch the U.S. play for years.\n\nDONAHOO: We would let the U.S. soccer roster pretty much dictate our vacations.\n\nMERAJI: The guys lamented the lack of organized tailgates, fan sections or meet-ups to watch games at local bars, so in 2007, when the U.S. men played Brazil in Chicago, they brought folks together for the first official American Outlaws event. Today, there's 180 chapters and about 30,000 members. A bit of pain has accompanied that growth. A couple of former Outlaws accuse the AO of being bro-y and handsy with women. People have been put off by the pro-Americanness of the gatherings, saying at the stadiums or bars, it can devolve into a super negative us-versus-them vibe.\n\nJOHN SANTOS: We ask people all the time - you know, you see something, tell us.\n\nMERAJI: John Santos from the Los Angeles chapter helped organize the American Outlaws tailgate at the U.S.-Mexico sendoff series game. He met his girlfriend at a U.S. women's game event sponsored by the group, and Santos says his chapter does its best to keep things positive.\n\nSANTOS: Don't take it too far. You know, it's just a game. But people on all sides know that the passion takes over. And, you know, they want to see their team win like a Yankees fan wants to see their team beat the Red Sox. We try to police ourselves as best we can - you know, make sure everyone's being safe.\n\nI got no tortillas, but we got buns over here.\n\nMERAJI: On this Sunday, the atmosphere is pretty family-friendly, and Santos says it's like this at most U.S. women's games. Grills sizzle while kids play soccer on the grass.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: What? Where you going? Where you going? Oh, my God. Oh, oh, and she scored.\n\nMERAJI: There are folks munching on hot dogs in red, white and blue lucha libre masks and sombreros - 65-year-old American Outlaw Linda Pickle is rocking a red shirt that says dos a cero on it with all the dates that the U.S. beat Mexico 2-to-nothing.\n\nLINDA PICKLE: And that's me right there with a German reporter.\n\nMERAJI: She's showing off her 2014 Men's World Cup photo book, but says she especially loves watching the women play - so much so she had her daughter change her wedding date so it wouldn't coincide with the Women's World Cup Final in 1999. And she's glad the AO is paying more attention to them this year.\n\nPICKLE: We are really pushing to get the women more recognized because they used to kind of ignore it and maybe get four or five people at a viewing party.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Leroux, Leroux, Leroux is on fire. Leroux, Leroux...\n\nMERAJI: The American Outlaws are already practicing specific chants for players who will be taking the world stage in a couple of weeks. This one's for forward number two, Sydney Leroux, who scored two goals in the U.S. women's 5-to-1 victory over Mexico. And the players are totally loving the attention, like team Captain Christie Rampone.\n\nCHRISTIE RAMPONE: The Outlaws are absolutely amazing. We couldn't do it without them. You know, it's the fans that get us going, and it's the inspiration to keep going every day and in training and hopefully winning this World Cup for them.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nMERAJI: Shereen Marisol Meraji, NPR News.
