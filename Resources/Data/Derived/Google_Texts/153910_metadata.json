Indeed, from the glitchy healthcare.gov website to unflattering hearings on the law\u2019s rollout, the execution of the ACA has been anything but smooth.\n\nBut for many Americans living outside the nation\u2019s capital, Obamacare has been a lot more than frustrating.\n\nTake, for example, the story of Stephen Blackwood, president of Ralston College in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nBlackwood in an op-ed published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal said his mother, who was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer in 2005, reportedly lost her health insurance because of Obamacare.\n\nAnd now she allegedly can\u2019t get treatment for her cancer.\n\n\u201c(I)n November, along with millions of other Americans, she lost her health insurance,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cShe\u2019d had a Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan for nearly 20 years. It was expensive, but given that it covered her very expensive treatment, it was a terrific plan. It gave her access to any specialist or surgeon, and to the Sandostatin and other medications that were keeping her alive.\u201d\n\nSandostatin is a drug that slows tumor growth. It also helps combat fatigue, nausea and gastrointestinal dysfunction, he explained.\n\nBut with the implementation of President Obama\u2019s law, Blackwood\u2019s mother lost access to what could be a life-saving drug.\n\n\u201cHer old plan, now considered illegal under the new health law, had been canceled,\u201d Blackwood said.\n\nAnd that was only the beginning.\n\n\u201cBecause the exchange website in her state (Virginia) was not working, she went directly to insurers\u2019 websites and telephoned them, one by one, over dozens of hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a medical-office manager, she had decades of experience navigating the enormous problems of even our pre-ObamaCare system. But nothing could have prepared her for the bureaucratic morass she now had to traverse.\u201d\n\nHis mother eventually tracked down and signed up for a plan that she hoped would fit her needs.\n\n\u201cThe enrollment agent said that after she met her deductible, all treatments and medications\u2014including those for her cancer\u2014would be covered at 100%. Because, however, the enrollment agents did not\u2014unbelievable though this may seem\u2014have access to the \u2018coverage formularies\u2019 for the plans they were selling, they said the only way to find out in detail what was in the plan was to buy the plan,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving exhausted all other options, she reportedly went ahead and signed up for the plan and was approved on Nov. 22.\n\nBut in January, she saw her that plan still had not updated on her online Humana account.\n\nSo she called to see if her plan was active and was told over and over again that she didn\u2019t have anything to worry about.\n\nThen it happened.\n\n\u201c(O)n Feb. 12, just before going into (yet another) surgery, she was informed by Humana that it would not, in fact, cover her Sandostatin, or other cancer-related medications. The cost of the Sandostatin alone, since Jan. 1, was $14,000, and the company was refusing to pay,\u201d Blackwood said.\n\n\u201cThe news was dumbfounding. This is a woman who had an affordable health plan that covered her condition. Our lawmakers weren\u2019t happy with that because . . . they wanted plans that were affordable and covered her condition. So they gave her a new one. It doesn\u2019t cover her condition and it\u2019s completely unaffordable,\u201d he added. \u201cObamaCare made my mother\u2019s old plan illegal, and it forced her to buy a new plan that would accelerate her disease and death.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, Blackwood\u2019s 58-year-old mother, the same woman who raised him and his nine siblings and helped manage his father\u2019s medical practice for three decades, reportedly awaits an appeal with her insurer.\n\n\u201cWill this injustice be remedied, for her and for millions of others? Or is my mother to die because she can no longer afford the treatment that keeps her alive?\u201d Blackwood asked. \u201cThe \u2018Affordable\u2019 Care Act is a brutal, Procrustean disaster. In principle, it violates the irreducible particularity of human life, and in practice it will cause many individuals to suffer and die. We can do better, and we must.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the full op-ed.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The implementation of the Affordable Care Act has been for many in Washington, D.C., a frustrating and embarrassing experience.
