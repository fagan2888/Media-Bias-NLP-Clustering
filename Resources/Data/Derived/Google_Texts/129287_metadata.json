Fees drop when you keep enough money in a single institution. Banking online is simpler than writing checks by hand.\n\nDeclutter your investments. If you own individual stocks, get rid of the dogs you haven\u2019t wanted to confess to. Then consider whether you want to own individual stocks at all. Blue-chip companies with rising dividends are only part of a growth and income strategy. When you rely on a limited number of stocks, \u201cyou\u2019re probably not well diversified,\u201d says financial planner Joseph Tomlinson of Greenville, Maine.\n\nChoose fewer funds\n\nIn general, the more experience investors have, the less they favor individual stocks (too many bad surprises) and the more they rely on mutual funds. But fund portfolios need decluttering, too. There\u2019s no reason to own 10 or 15 of them, Tomlinson says. They probably overlap each other. If you choose well-diversified funds, such as low-cost index funds that follow separate markets, all you need is a broad U.S. fund, a small-company fund, an international fund and an intermediate-term bond fund, spreading your money among them in whatever way you think is best. You might also consider a target-date mutual fund that allocates your investments across these sectors in a manner appropriate to your age, or an immediate-pay annuity, to create a guaranteed income for life.\n\nLow-fee funds save you money, too. Paying 2 percent on a $250,000 fund portfolio is like writing a check for $5,000 every year. With index funds, you could pay $60 or less. I mentioned that our growing wisdom and experience help us make sound financial decisions right into our 70s. After that, however, the news is not so good. The decline in our fluid, quick intelligence catches up with us. It becomes easier to make mistakes. That\u2019s the other great value of simplifying your financial life, Weber says. You\u2019ve got your systems in place for when the shaky days come.\n\nJane Bryant Quinn is a personal finance expert and author of Making the Most of Your Money NOW.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "Division1": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "page_title": "Declutter Your Finances: Put Your Wisdom to Work for You", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-06-16T11:13:25.210-04:00", "keywords": "money, finance, finances, investing, investments, financial security, financial advisor", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Jane Bryant Quinn", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_bulletin_today", "type": "info", "description": "AARP financial expert Jane Bryant Quinn shares how to simplify investments for increased financial security down the road.", "s43": "19a.Investor|MyFinancialSecurity", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Money/Investing", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Money/Financial Planning", "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Work and Retirement/Work/Retirement planning/401k plans", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "AARP financial expert Jane Bryant Quinn shares how to simplify investments for increased financial security down the road.", "title": "Simplify Investments for Healthy Financial Future - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/money/investing/info-12-2013/simplify-financial-investments.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/graphics/experts/180_jane_bryant_quinn_pg.imgcache.rev1291652039407.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/money/investing/info-12-2013/simplify-financial-investments", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "money", "IALevel2": "investing", "IALevel3": "info-12-2013", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "article_summary": "If you own individual stocks, get rid of the dogs you haven\u2019t wanted to confess to.\nThen consider whether you want to own individual stocks at all.\nWhen you rely on a limited number of stocks, \u201cyou\u2019re probably not well diversified,\u201d says financial planner Joseph Tomlinson of Greenville, Maine.\nI mentioned that our growing wisdom and experience help us make sound financial decisions right into our 70s.\nChoose fewer fundsIn general, the more experience investors have, the less they favor individual stocks (too many bad surprises) and the more they rely on mutual funds."}
