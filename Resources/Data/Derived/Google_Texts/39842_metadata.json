The decision to keep him and pay for care in federal custody was due to Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) appeal to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\n\nAccording to The Hill:\n\nThe Pinal County director of public health was right to be concerned: Drug-resistant tuberculosis can require 18 to 24 months of treatment and can cost more than $500,000. A local health department\u2019s entire budget can be depleted with just one case.\n\nDespite the fact that tuberculosis rates have generally been declining in the U.S., drug-resistant cases have shown up more and are concerning medical professionals that an epidemic could be emerging.\n\nOne of the issues at hand is the fact that people without legal status in the country aren\u2019t able to get an insurance plan through Obamacare. People coming in from abroad, even if they can afford it, can\u2019t protect set themselves up for care, and therefore others are at risk.\n\nEven if the federal government is taking financial responsibility for the case at hand, funding is still too low if it begins to spread, The Hill reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis could be a new epidemic concern.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis could be a new epidemic concern.", "title": "Concerns rise about cost and spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis with diagnosed immigration detainee", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Tuberculosis-x-ray-1.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/04/concerns-rise-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-diagnosed-immigration-detainee/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Tuberculosis-x-ray-1.jpg", "description": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis could be a new epidemic concern.", "card": "summary", "title": "Concerns rise about cost and spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis with diagnosed immigration detainee - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John McCain, tuberculosis, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "tuberculosis", "published_time": "2015-04-14T12:33:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf6e\"", "article_summary": "A man who has been diagnosed with drug-resistant tuberculosis is now being held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.\nAccording to The Hill:The Pinal County director of public health was right to be concerned: Drug-resistant tuberculosis can require 18 to 24 months of treatment and can cost more than $500,000.\nEven if the federal government is taking financial responsibility for the case at hand, funding is still too low if it begins to spread, The Hill reported.\nDespite the fact that tuberculosis rates have generally been declining in the U.S., drug-resistant cases have shown up more and are concerning medical professionals that an epidemic could be emerging.\nThe decision to keep him and pay for care in federal custody was due to Sen.
