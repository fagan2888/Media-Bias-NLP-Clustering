Robert Jeffress, Mediaite reported. And that opens the doors for the loss of individual freedoms \u2014 and the rise of a replacement, in the form of a despotic leader.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s role in this journey is \u201cconditioning\u201d people to rely on the government, Mr. Jeffress said, during the Fox interview.

Gay marriage is a \u201ccounterfeit\u201d of real marriage, he added, and \u201cwhenever you say marriage is whatever you want it to be \u2026 people say why bother getting married at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama is laying the groundwork for the anti-Christ to slide into his biblically based role and seize worldly power, said one pastor during a sit-down interview on Fox News with Bill O'Reilly.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama is laying the groundwork for the anti-Christ to slide into his biblically based role and seize worldly power, said one pastor during a sit-down interview on Fox News with Bill O\u2019Reilly.", "title": "The Rev.
