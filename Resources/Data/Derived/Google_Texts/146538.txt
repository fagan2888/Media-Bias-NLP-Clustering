Olympus Partners Invests in Liqui-Box

The PE fund, which also owns Pregis, is buying the food packaging company from the Sterling Group

Private equity firm Olympus Partners has completed the acquisition of Liqui-Box Holdings Inc. from the Sterling Group. Financial terms were not disclosed, but Olympus invests at least $50 million in businesses, according to the firm’s website.

Liqui-Box makes packaging and filling equipment mostly for the food and beverage industry. Sterling purchased the Richmond, Virginia-based company from E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co. (NYSE: DD) in 2011.

“The company has improved operations, expanded into new geographies and end markets, and successfully reached new customers,” says Liqui-Box CEO Ken Swanson. Olympus has experience investing in the packaging sector. One of the PE firm’s other portfolio company in the space includes Pregis, which makes paper and foam packaging products.

Buyers have been going after packaging targets in 2015. CC Industries is purchasing Selig Sealing; Gerresheimer AG (FRA: GXI) is adding Centor US Holding Inc.; and Sealed Air Corp. (NYSE: SEE) is buying held B+ Equipment.

Harris Williams & Co. and Willkie Farr & Gallagher advised Sterling Group. Kirkland & Ellis represented Olympus. The PE fund received financing from Antares Capital and Rabobank.
