These numbers attest to a serious public health concern.\n\nThe editorial\u2019s assertion that there is \u201cno evidence to suggest any pattern of unsafe, unsanitary or poor treatment\u201d at Virginia abortion clinics is false. Americans United for Life and other groups have documented that, from 2012 to 2014, at least 17 Virginia abortion clinics were cited for health and safety violations. Among the violations were poorly maintained buildings or offices, failure to ensure the competence of physicians performing abortions and failure to sanitize procedure tables between patients.\n\nInstead of recognizing that the Virginia regulations are designed to protect against such deplorable practices, the editorial scoffed at physical-plant standards, including minimum hallway widths. Clearly, Karnamaya Mongar, who died after emergency personnel could not get a stretcher into Kermit Gosnell\u2019s abortion clinic in Pennsylvania, has been forgotten. Thankfully, supporters of the regulations have not forgotten her or the abortion industry\u2019s many other victims.\n\nDenise M. Burke, Washington\n\nThe writer is vice president of legal affairs for Americans United for Life.\n\n\u25cf\n\nAs an obstetrician-gynecologist who served on the Virginia health commissioner\u2019s Regulatory Advisory Panel addressing building regulations for health clinics that provide abortion care, I thank Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) for his recent legal opinion in favor of evidence-based standards to promote the health and safety of Virginians.\n\nI support efforts to make abortion safer, but that is not what Virginia\u2019s requirements do. Abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, with a complication rate of less than 1 percent. Covered entrances and a minimum number of parking spaces could not possibly make a medical procedure with a 99 percent safety rate any safer. Yet these are some of the costly standards the legislature and Virginia\u2019s previous attorney general tried to impose on clinics in the name of improving patient safety. Instead, these medically unnecessary regulations threaten to shut down good, safe clinics that serve Virginia women.\n\nHealth-care regulations should be guided by medical evidence, not political agendas. I appreciate and applaud Mr. Herring\u2019s recognition of this fact.\n\nSerina Floyd, Alexandria", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "denise burke, abortion, virginia abortion clinics, virginia abortion rules, virginia abortion safety, Serina Floyd, mark herring", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Regarding the May\u00a06 editorial \u201cAn abortion rights win\u201d: Each year more than 625 women experience abortion-related complications in Virginia, and some experience serious complications requiring hospita...", "title": "Regulating Virginia\u2019s abortion clinics", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/regulating-virginias-abortion-clinics/2015/05/08/1babfc10-f4ce-11e4-bca5-21b51bbdf93e_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/regulating-virginias-abortion-clinics/2015/05/08/1babfc10-f4ce-11e4-bca5-21b51bbdf93e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "denise burke, abortion, virginia abortion clinics, virginia abortion rules, virginia abortion safety, Serina Floyd, mark herring", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1babfc10-f4ce-11e4-bca5-21b51bbdf93e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Regarding the May\u00a06 editorial \u201cAn abortion rights win\u201d: Each year more than 625 women experience abortion-related complications in Virginia, and some experience serious complications requiring hospita..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7ec\"", "article_summary": "The editorial\u2019s assertion that there is \u201cno evidence to suggest any pattern of unsafe, unsanitary or poor treatment\u201d at Virginia abortion clinics is false.\nAmericans United for Life and other groups have documented that, from 2012 to 2014, at least 17 Virginia abortion clinics were cited for health and safety violations.\nI support efforts to make abortion safer, but that is not what Virginia\u2019s requirements do.\nYet these are some of the costly standards the legislature and Virginia\u2019s previous attorney general tried to impose on clinics in the name of improving patient safety.\nInstead of recognizing that the Virginia regulations are designed to protect against such deplorable practices, the editorial scoffed at physical-plant standards, including minimum hallway widths."}
