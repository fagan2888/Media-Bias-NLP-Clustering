The Golden State Warriors are one of them, and their superstar \u2014 Stephen Curry \u2013 is this week\u2019s Post Player of the Week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games Curry shot the lights out. What else would we expect? He averaged 27.3 points on 52.2 percent shooting from the field, including 48.6 percent from the 3-point line during the evaluation period of Nov. 22-28. Curry added 6.8 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game in that span. The Warriors won all four games.\n\nBackground: There was question as to how Curry \u2014 and his Splash Brothers cohort, Klay Thompson \u2014 would react to the coaching change that removed a man they\u2019d grown close to, Mark Jackson. He was replaced by Steve Kerr. The result? More wins, more big games and a star in Curry who is not only playing some of the best basketball in the NBA right now, but is lifting his team to the upper crust of the league.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: If there\u2019s any part of Curry\u2019s game to nitpick, it\u2019s his penchant to try things that result in turnovers \u2013 no look passes, one-handed whip passes in traffic, these kinds of things. But the bottom line is he\u2019s ascended to being one of the NBA\u2019s top talents, an All-Star level point guard that will push for All-NBA First Team inclusion this season. And he\u2019ll deserve every accolade he gets.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Golden State Warriors,NBA,Stephen Curry", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "The Golden State Warriors are one of the NBA's elite teams, and their superstar, Stephen Curry, is this week's Post Player of the Week.", "title": "Stephen Curry: Spotlight on the Golden State Warriors' point guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/29/stephen-curry-spotlight-warriors-point-guard/12145/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/459102120-495x332.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Golden State Warriors are one of the NBA's elite teams, and their superstar, Stephen Curry, is this week's Post Player of the Week.", "title": "Stephen Curry: Spotlight on the Warriors\u2019 point guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/29/stephen-curry-spotlight-warriors-point-guard/12145/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/459102120-495x332.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Golden State Warriors are one of the NBA's elite teams, and their superstar, Stephen Curry, is this week's Post Player of the Week."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9d6\"", "article_summary": "The Golden State Warriors are one of them, and their superstar \u2014 Stephen Curry \u2013 is this week\u2019s Post Player of the Week.\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games Curry shot the lights out.\nBut the bottom line is he\u2019s ascended to being one of the NBA\u2019s top talents, an All-Star level point guard that will push for All-NBA First Team inclusion this season.\nWhen: There are a few teams that are truly separating themselves early on as being among the NBA\u2019s elite.\nThe Warriors won all four games."}
