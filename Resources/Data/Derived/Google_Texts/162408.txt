A Greek appeal for help in identifying an unknown girl who had been living with a Roma couple has triggered a global outpouring of sympathy and tips.

Greek police are investigating everything from a potential link with child trafficking rings to a welfare scam as they seek the child’s biological parents.

Authorities have also sought assistance from Interpol, the international police agency, which has 38 girls younger than 6 in its missing persons database.

None however fit the girl’s description and the agency only receives cases when member governments seek its help.
