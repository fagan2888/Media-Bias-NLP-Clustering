Simpkins / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nAs the third meeting of the task force charged with finding alternatives to Insure Tennessee began breaking up Monday in Memphis, Rep. Steve McManus took hold of the microphone to rebut citizens\u2019 criticism that the panel is a farce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re for real, and we\u2019re going to work for you,\u201d said McManus, a Cordova Republican who sits on the task force.\n\nThe task force, which was created by House Speaker Beth Harwell in April, is holding meetings across the state to get feedback from health care providers, along with business and community leaders, as it crafts a \u201cconservative\u201d plan to expand health coverage to the uninsured.\n\nRep. Cameron Sexton, chairman of the \u201c3-Star Healthy Project\u201d task force and a Crossville Republican, said after the meeting \u2014 agreeing with McManus \u2014 that the goal wasn\u2019t to completely scrap Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, which failed to win legislative approval. Instead, the task force will re-evaluate it to see what parts, if any, the General Assembly can support.\n\n\u201cInsure didn\u2019t have the votes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look to see if there\u2019s a different approach.\u201d\n\nSumming up his takeaways from the meeting, Sexton said the task force \u2014 which includes Rep. Karen Camper, D-Memphis \u2014 could try to ease restrictions on faith-based health care organizations like the Church Health Center, which connects patients with volunteer doctors for a flat $35 fee.\n\nDr. Scott Morris, CEO of Church Health Center, told the task force that state law should be changed to allow citizens to claim health care coverage to satisfy the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and avoid costly fines for being uninsured.\n\nAustin Baker, president of Memphis-based human resources firm HRO Partners, said the General Assembly should play a game of \u201ckill the rule\u201d and see how many other unnecessary health care rules could be eliminated from state law.\n\nSexton said the task force will also take a closer look at the possibility of \u201cdirect to provider\u201d health care, where businesses could pay clinics for their employees\u2019 health care visits instead of routing payments through health insurance companies.\n\nWhatever plan the task force comes up with, Sexton said, it will have to cover behavioral health issues, which \u201cclog up the (emergency room).\u201d\n\nAnother discussion topic was the effect the uninsured have on hospitals \u2014 especially rural hospitals, like Decatur County General Hospital. CEO Scott Barber said his hospital, like others, had its Medicare reimbursements cut as part of the ACA. But unlike in larger cities, it didn\u2019t feel the benefit from a large reduction in uninsured patients.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a classic example of how we gave and nothing came back,\u201d said CEO Reginald Coopwood of Regional One.\n\nThe task force will likely present its ideas in June to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which approves state Medicaid programs such as TennCare, allowing billions of dollars in federal funds to flow to the states.\n\nSeveral citizens spoke publicly about their concerns that the task force isn\u2019t putting enough of an emphasis on the people involved, whose lives will feel the impact of their decisions.\n\n\u201cI am caught in a cycle where I cannot always get my health needs met,\u201d said Rev. Faye London, who works with Memphis-based reproductive advocacy group SisterReach.\n\nDiane Cambron, who is active in local Democratic circles along with her husband, said the task force already has a solution to the problem of uninsured Tennesseans, and it\u2019s called Insure Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWhy are we throwing it out the window, kicking the ball down the field, when people are dying?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a classic example of how we gave and nothing came back.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1T830W8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The task force, which was created by House Speaker Beth Harwell in April, is holding meetings across the state to get feedback from health care providers, along with business and community leaders, as it crafts a \u201cconservative\u201d plan to expand health", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The task force, which was created by House Speaker Beth Harwell in April, is holding meetings across the state to get feedback from health care providers, along with business and community leaders, as it crafts a \u201cconservative\u201d plan to expand health", "title": "Tenn. health care task force eyes new ways to cover uninsured", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/09/tenn-health-care-task-force-eyes-new-ways-cover-uninsured/84166888/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The task force, which was created by House Speaker Beth Harwell in April, is holding meetings across the state to get feedback from health care providers, along with business and community leaders, as it crafts a \u201cconservative\u201d plan to expand health", "title": "Tenn. health care task force eyes new ways to cover uninsured", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Beth Harwell", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Beth Harwell", "title": "Tenn. health care task force eyes new ways to cover uninsured", "author": "Ryan Poe", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2ac10eb67624f64ffddd8c2bb54c1ec2fde7daa2/c=476-0-2600-2832/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffcf9ffae20ad5cc11182249bf77aaa4aba103f0/c=712-0-3544-2832/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56627f5e9790c71fbe5f3c7e33c8fb66dc81124b/c=245-0-4012-2832/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16005d6a5cea96fea5a77e473a56e7b0de25ccf1/c=0-323-4253-2726&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-09T21:35:25.657000-05:00", "shorthed": "Tenn. health care task force eyes new ways to cover uninsured", "articleid": 84166888, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0009595b04a84651170b07659b70a30c4f4c1992/c=0-323-4253-2726/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3b6e152993fe6aac33a566586f0e64e631d2126/c=373-0-1959-2832/local/-/media/2016/04/12/Nashville/Nashville/635960727910344668-NAS-Harwell-Haslam-05.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Insure Tennessee, Steve McManus, House Speaker Beth Harwell, Beth Harwell, Gov.
