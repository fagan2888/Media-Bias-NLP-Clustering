Some are then held for ransom.\n\nIn one recent well-publicized case, surveillance video captured a dognapping in progress at a tattoo shop in Canada \u2013 just one week after another pet owner was forced to pay $500 for the safe return of her Chihuahua, which was stolen from another business only a few miles away. (In the U.S., some dognapping cases have involved the payment of more than $10,000 for the safe return of \u201cmissing\u201d pets, with \u201cno questions asked.\u201d)\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nAlthough no breed is immune to dognapping, traditionally, Yorkies, Pomeranians and other small breeds are targeted most often because of their popularity and compact size.\n\nAdvice: In addition to keeping your furry friends on a leash and never leaving them unattended in a backyard or car, your best defense against dognapping is to invest in a microchip for pets.\n\nRoughly the size of a grain of rice, a microchip is an identifying integrated circuit implanted under an animal\u2019s skin. It carries a number and, once registered, can be scanned to identify lost pets (but it is not a GPS tracker). Because dognappers often remove collars and license tags, if your pet is microchipped, you\u2019re on stronger legal ground for proving rightful ownership should you get a ransom call \u2013 and can levy criminal charges against the thief.\n\nMicrochipped or not, \u201cmissing\u201d pets should be reported to police or your local animal control agency. And when posting fliers and ads, include a recent photo and the location where your pooch was last seen \u2013 but don\u2019t offer a reward. To many scammers, a reward shows you are willing to pay big bucks to get your dog back.\n\nPet Flipping\n\nSome stolen dogs end up being \u201cflipped\u201d to unsuspecting customers through ads on Craigslist or in local newspapers. In some cases rightful owners have seen ads for their MIA mutts and tried to buy back their pets, only to have their pleas and reward offers ignored as the thieves brazenly sell them to the highest bidders.\n\nAdvice: If your pet goes missing, check local Craigslist postings and newspaper \u201cfound\u201d classifieds. Although many scammers communicate solely by email \u2013 which is hard to track \u2013 pet flipping often necessitates providing a phone number for a quicker and easier sale. Police may be able to use that number to track down the thief.\n\nClassified Cons\n\nStealing photos of adorable pups from legitimate websites, scammers pose as breeders, animal-rescue employees or distressed pet owners who need to find new homes for their dogs, offering huge discounts in \u201cfor sale\u201d ads on Craigslist and elsewhere; some even establish bogus websites.\n\nAnd if you place an ad seeking a pet, it\u2019s scammers who may respond, offering to sell your dream companion.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nEither way, the gotcha is that you\u2019re asked to pay upfront, often via a wire transfer or prepaid debit card. And once you do, expect a string of additional money requests \u2013 for supposed shipping, vaccines or insurance. But the dog will never arrive because it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nAdvice: Realize that reputable shelters and breeders never ship (or even sell) dogs to people they haven\u2019t met and will rarely solicit prospective owners with such offers. Assume any correspondence done solely by email \u2013 but not telephone or in person \u2013 is a scam, and upfront payment, especially requested by wire transfer or prepaid debit card, is the calling card of most scammers.\n\nAnimal Control Impostors\n\nAlthough these incidents are sporadic, beware of scammers who pose as enforcers from the local dog pound and threaten to remove a family pet because of alleged complaints unless a fine is paid immediately. This ruse occurred last summer at a Florida retirement community, where a couple shelled out $550 to a scammer posing as a representative of the local animal control agency who had threatened to seize their dog.\n\n\u201cHe had a badge, had an ID, gave us a business card and represented himself completely as being part of an independent company for animal care and control,\u201d said the president of the community\u2019s homeowners association.\n\nAdvice: Such identifying \u201cproof\u201d can easily be produced by fraudsters, so before paying a fine, call police and the real animal control department. You\u2019ll likely hear something similar to what the couple were told: \u201cIf anybody comes to your house and says, \u2018Give me money; I\u2019m from the county; I\u2019m going to take your dog,\u2019 that\u2019s not us,\u201d said an official of Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control.\n\nRescue Charity Rip-Offs\n\nScammers know that people\u2019s love for their pets is an ideal means of pulling on their heartstrings \u2013 and getting owners to pull out their wallets. So think twice before donating to a self-described pet rescue operation that seeks an out-of-the-blue donation via unsolicited phone call, email or front-door visit.\n\nAdvice: As with any charity, check the legitimacy of animal-related causes at Charity Navigator, GuideStar or the Wise Giving Alliance, operated by the Better Business Bureau. If all checks out, your safest bet is to donate directly to that organization via a credit card or mailed check, not through commission-paid solicitors and never by email unless you have donated to the organization before and previously provided your email address.\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network.
