CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Denny Hamlin has given Joe Gibbs Racing its first victory in the NASCAR Sprint All-Star race by using clean air to hold off Kevin Harvick at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Hamlin won the pole for Saturday night’s race, and was decent through the first four 25-lap segments. He headed to pit road in sixth for the mandatory final pit stop, and his No. 11 team got him back on track in first.

Every driver in the 20-car field wanted to be out front for the final 10-lap sprint to the finish. NASCAR’s current rules package has shown that the leader, in clean air, is very difficult to pass.

So Harvick never got close enough to even attempt a move for the lead as Hamlin collected the $1 million prize.
