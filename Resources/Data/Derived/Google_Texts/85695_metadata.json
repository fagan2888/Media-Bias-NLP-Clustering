Peter Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of combat for The Associated Press and later gained fame as a CNN correspondent, has written a new memoir, \u201cSaigon Has Fallen,\u201d about his dozen-plus years reporting on Vietnam. Arnett has recounted this period before but approaches it with a fresh perspective for the 40th anniversary of the war\u2019s end. The book is published by RosettaBooks in partnership with The Associated Press (www.ap.org/books). This is an edited excerpt, focused on the war\u2019s final throes.)\n\n___\n\nArtillery explosions sound a fearsome 4 a.m. wake-up call, but I\u2019m already awake. The attackers waiting at the gates of a vanquished Saigon have been warning they would act, and now with each thump of the Soviet-made 130mm guns, sound waves rustle the curtains of my open seventh floor hotel window. As I reach for my water glass, it trembles, and me with it. The last full day of the Vietnam War is beginning.\n\nStreet lights shine below as I look out toward Tan Son Nhut airport, once described as the busiest in the world when America was waging war here. Now it is burning from one end to the other, the flames brilliantly lighting up the sky.\n\nThere will be two more hours of darkness, but this seems like a new dawn rising, an appropriate description, I think later, of the intentions of those wreaking havoc on the airport this morning, April 29, 1975. The commanders of North Vietnam\u2019s military juggernaut, pressing for victory after a 50-day rout of their South Vietnamese opponents, are pushing open the gates of the capital. They will force a new dawn on South Vietnam, America\u2019s once favored ally, as it loses its 20-year struggle to remain an independent, pro-western state.\n\nAfter watching the destruction of the airport, I phone the Associated Press office a few blocks away, and my colleague Ed White answers. He and George Esper, the bureau chief, have been up all night working the telex communications link with our New York headquarters.\n\nWhite tells me the American embassy confirms major damage at the airport with the runways probably unusable. American planners have been intending to airlift out of the country several thousand more vulnerable Vietnamese allies today, but what can they do now?\n\nSoon afterward, from an upstairs hotel balcony as daylight approaches I can clearly see thick black smoke hanging over the airport like a funeral shroud. I\u2019m joined by a few news colleagues, all of us knowing we are watching momentous history unfold right before our eyes.\n\nAs the sky brightens we see a Vietnamese air force transport plane, a de Havilland Caribou, rise sharply above the airport. Suddenly, it seems to break in half, bursting into flames and falling in pieces to the ground. Stricken silent by this horrifying spectacle, we see a second aircraft following the same path and suffering the same fate, like the first undoubtedly a victim of ground fire. It seems there\u2019ll be no escape for anyone from the airport today.\n\nAt the American Embassy, Ambassador Graham Martin is in disbelief, committed as he is to evacuating as many vulnerable Vietnamese as possible before the communists arrive. He insists on personally checking the airport tarmac. After the war, Martin would tell me, \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to me that we couldn\u2019t physically come in with transport planes. I wanted to check it for myself, to make my own judgment. It would have made a difference. We could have gotten five or ten thousand more people out. \u201c\n\nReaching the airport, Martin finds a usable runway amidst the still-burning buildings, but little security. He worries about a repeat of the earlier airport panics in Danang and Nhatrang that had hundreds of desperate people fighting with soldiers and police to get on departing rescue aircraft. He tells me, \u201cI decided it was not worth the risk. I picked up the phone and I told Secretary (of State Henry) Kissinger to inform the president that we have go to Option Four immediately, to the helicopter airlift for the remaining Americans, and as many Vietnamese as we can take.\u201d But Martin\u2019s urgent instruction is lost somewhere down the line. The airlift does not begin for several hours.\n\nOption Four is code for Operation Frequent Wind, planned as a large-scale evacuation of people to American Navy ships off the coast. Most of the passengers for the final helicopter lifts have been chosen in advance, alerted to keep listening to Armed Forces Radio for a signal. Thirteen helicopter pickup points have been selected around Saigon, using the small UH-1 Huey ships for the tops of tall buildings and the much bigger CH-53 Sea Knights for the American Defense Department compound at the airport and the embassy grounds.\n\nThose waiting to depart include the large contingent of international journalists covering the story. During the past week some have considered the possibility of remaining behind and seeing what transpires, but their home offices expect them to leave with the last Americans because of the uncertainty of the future. I know that Esper wants to stay. He\u2019s been here too long to miss the final moments of his most important story. Me too, and I message AP president Wes Gallagher, explaining that because I was here at the war\u2019s beginnings it\u2019s worth the risk to document the final hours. With us is Matt Franjola, an AP reporter in the region for several years. Esper sends a message to his boss, \u201cRequest you please reconsider\u2026\u201d Gallagher does. The three of us will stay.\n\nAs I drive through the city, I see crowds gathering at intersections and arguing. Several million people are now estimated to be living in Saigon, many of them recent refugees from the countryside. Not everyone wants to leave, but several hundred thousand believe their lives have been compromised in the eyes of the communists by their association with America and its policies, and are desperate to get out. I drive by Saigon\u2019s port and see small ships crowded with people setting off down the river.\n\nThe former CIA analyst Frank Snepp remembered that time in an interview with me after the war: \u201cThe city was holding its breath. We had always feared that the Vietnamese would mob us if we ever tried to leave. But they realized on that last day that we were their last hope. If they turned against us, there was no way out of the country.\u201d\n\nNo one is killed in the shameful melees that are to follow, but the mad scrambles to go anywhere but Vietnam remain today an ignominious coda to the already bleak history of America\u2019s last years in Vietnam. The main crisis unfolds in and around the U.S. Embassy, a six-story building with a concrete lattice facade that serves to keep the building cool and deflect incoming missiles.\n\nWhen the helicopters start emerging from the leaden afternoon skies to pick up the chosen few, a stampede begins. By late afternoon an estimated 10,000 desperate Vietnamese have advanced on the embassy, shoving to get close to the iron gates and the high walls, and when they do get there, endeavoring to claw themselves over. The U.S. Marine security force strives to get control, only to meet with shouted protests and insults.\n\nThat evening, I write a story for the AP that begins: \u201cTen years ago I watched the first U.S. Marines arrive to help Vietnam. They were greeted on the beaches by pretty Vietnamese girls in white silken robes who draped flower garlands about their necks. A decade has passed, and on Tuesday I watched the U.S. Marines shepherding Americans out of South Vietnam.\n\n\u201cThey were the same clean-cut looking young men of a decade ago. But the Vietnamese were different. Those who didn\u2019t have a place for them on the last helicopters \u2013 and there were thousands left behind \u2013 hooted, booed and scuffled with the Marines trying to secure the landing zones. Some Vietnamese threw themselves over walls and wire fences, only to be thrown back by Marines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Saigon has fallen\u2019 _ a reporter\u2019s view of Vietnam War\u2019s end", "author": "Peter Arnett", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Saigon has fallen\u2019 _ a reporter\u2019s view of Vietnam War\u2019s end", "title": "\u2018Saigon has fallen\u2019 _ a reporter\u2019s view of Vietnam War\u2019s end", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/saigon_has_fallen___a_reporters_view_of_vietnam_wars_end/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/saigons-fall-arnett.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Saigon has fallen\u2019 _ a reporter\u2019s view of Vietnam War\u2019s end", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/saigons-fall-arnett.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "\u2018Saigon has fallen\u2019 _ a reporter\u2019s view of Vietnam War\u2019s end", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u2018Saigon has fallen\u2019 _ a reporter\u2019s view of Vietnam War\u2019s end", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02e8\"", "article_summary": "The last full day of the Vietnam War is beginning.\nWhite tells me the American embassy confirms major damage at the airport with the runways probably unusable.\nA decade has passed, and on Tuesday I watched the U.S. Marines shepherding Americans out of South Vietnam.\nArnett has recounted this period before but approaches it with a fresh perspective for the 40th anniversary of the war\u2019s end.\nAt the American Embassy, Ambassador Graham Martin is in disbelief, committed as he is to evacuating as many vulnerable Vietnamese as possible before the communists arrive."}
