(Aug. 11, 2014) \u2014 The chronic health issues of Appalachia, the focus of a recent tour by the head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are really no different than the chronic health issues the entire country faces; they are simply more concentrated in one area, Laura Ungar writes for The Courier-Journal and USA Today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about proportion and intensity rather than something unique that\u2019s happening there,\u201d Jesse Roman, chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Louisville, told Ungar. \u201cThe problem is larger and more visible there, but they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nUngar describes the health challenges of one couple in Appalachia, 48-year-old Alisha Blankenbeckler and her husband, Tony. Alisha has diabetes, bowel and bladder problems and is on oxygen. Her condition makes it hard to take care of her husband who has heart disease and hip problems since being struck by lightening in 2010. He takes 11 pills a day; she takes 30.\n\n\u201cDying is something I think about every day,\u201d Alisha told Ungar.\n\nThis story, Ungar reports, is common in the Appalachian region, which is considered one of the nation\u2019s unhealthiest regions.\n\nHeart disease prevalence is 84 percent higher in the region than the national average, diabetes is 47 percent higher, and lung cancer kills at a rate 83 percent higher. The region has the highest-in-the-nation smoking rates, with nearly a third of adults smoking cigarettes, and Kentucky has the highest number of deaths caused by cancer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the stroke belt, the diabetes belt, the coronary valley. We get all those labels,\u201d Fran Feltner, director of theUniversity of Kentucky Center of Excellence in Rural Health at Hazard, told Ungar. \u201cWe\u2019re in a sad state here.\u201d\n\nSome experts say Appalachia \u201cmay be a harbinger of where the country is headed if we don\u2019t rein in epidemics like obesity,\u201d Ungar writes. Obesity spawns \u201cdiabetes, heart disease and many cancers and spanning all socioeconomic levels.\u201d\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden recently toured Eastern Kentucky to \u201cfind out more about the underlying causes of the region\u2019s ills and how to treat them \u2014 and in the process gain traction against the rising burden of chronic disease that ails the nation,\u201d Ungar reports.\n\n\u201cThe Appalachian region is just like the rest of the U.S. \u2014 only more,\u201d Frieden said on the tour. \u201cWe want to help an entire community and a whole nation.\u201d\n\nUngar writes, \u201cAppalachia, like some blighted urban areas and Native American reservations, mixes several ingredients of poor health: doctor shortages and access-to-care problems; stressful, unhealthy lifestyles; low education levels; and insidious poverty.\u201d\n\nAlisha Blankenbeckler told Ungar that at times she has had to stretch her insulin by taking less than the prescribed amount and once needed to go to the hospital but didn\u2019t because she had no insurance or money to pay the bill. She recently got insurance through the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, and her husband is on Medicare, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee access to all the care they need because of required Medicare co-payments, medical equipment that is not covered, and gas to get to the doctor. The couple gets disability benefits of $1,427 a month.\n\nThough more than half a million Kentuckians have enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, \u201caccess to health care is difficult in Appalachia,\u201d Roman told Ungar. \u201cAnd there seems to be something about culture \u2014 a sense of fatalism, that whatever happens, happens.\u201d\n\nUngar writes that Friden and Benjamin Sommers, assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard School of Public Health \u201csay improving the health of Appalachia and like communities will not be easy, because it depends on changing seemingly intractable socioeconomic disparities and personal health habits.\u201d\n\nFrieden said that while outreach and health education is crucial, he will \u201clisten and take cues from local communities about how best to attack their particular health problems. If he finds an effective program, he said, he will replicate it and fit it to other communities.\u201d\n\nKentucky Health News is a service of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Telecommunications at the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky.", "article_metadata": {"KEYWORDS": "lane report kentucky business portal news kybiz market review dining in the bluegrass", "og": {"url": "http://www.lanereport.com/37199/2014/08/cdc-director-visits-eastern-kentucky-where-health-concerns-are-widespread/", "site_name": "Lane Report | Kentucky Business & Economic News", "image": "http://ae-lane-report.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/lungcancer-160x160.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CDC director visits Eastern Kentucky, where health concerns are widespread"}, "fb": {"app_id": 342486779097520}, "description": "The chronic health issues of Appalachia are the focus of a recent tour by the head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8254\"", "article_summary": "We get all those labels,\u201d Fran Feltner, director of theUniversity of Kentucky Center of Excellence in Rural Health at Hazard, told Ungar.\nThough more than half a million Kentuckians have enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, \u201caccess to health care is difficult in Appalachia,\u201d Roman told Ungar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about proportion and intensity rather than something unique that\u2019s happening there,\u201d Jesse Roman, chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Louisville, told Ungar.\n\u201cDying is something I think about every day,\u201d Alisha told Ungar.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a sad state here.\u201dSome experts say Appalachia \u201cmay be a harbinger of where the country is headed if we don\u2019t rein in epidemics like obesity,\u201d Ungar writes."}
