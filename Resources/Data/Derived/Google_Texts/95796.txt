To the Editor:

Re “College Applications and Criminal Records” (editorial, March 15):

You suggest that students with criminal histories don’t necessarily present a “danger to campus safety.” There are plenty of incidents of campus violence that obligate universities to exercise caution.

Colleges have a responsibility to keep their students safe, and one way to do that is to ask about past criminal records. Just because a college has asked for disclosure does not mean that an applicant will be refused admission. It simply alerts schools to investigate certain applicants’ backgrounds and enables academic officers to determine, case by case, whether an individual poses a threat.

Many people with previous convictions have turned their lives around and should be given a chance to attain a college education. Yet not asking about criminal records is foolhardy.

The City University of New York, which claims that its practice of not asking about criminal history has not posed a safety problem, should not be held up as an example, since CUNY schools are commuter colleges with no dormitories and therefore less opportunity for violence.

If the question about a criminal record poses a barrier to completing an application for students with prior convictions, there are other ways, like counseling and nondiscrimination disclosure, to encourage those students without endangering a campus. Colleges would do well to balance the individual needs and potential of each applicant with a criminal record with the rights of the entire student population to a safe environment.
