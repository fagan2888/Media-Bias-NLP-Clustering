Once again he's facing strong competition as the November election approaches \u2013 this time from a retired Army National Guard general.\n\n'Doc' Benishek\n\nDan Benishek is a doctor and if you\u2019ve been watching TV at any point in the last few months you probably already know that from all the commercials.\n\nBut Benishek is also a congressman \u2013 running for a third term in Michigan's 1st Congressional District that includes part of the northern Lower Peninsula and all of the Upper Peninsula. Benishek\u2019s campaign has focused on two things: one, his background as a doctor; and two, Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat was actually something he did two years ago was run ads where he goes by \u2018Dr. Dan\u2019 or \u2018Dr. Benishek\u2019 or \u2018Doc Benishek,' and focuses a ton on his history in medicine and his work as a doctor,\" says Jack Fitzpatrick, who covers U.S. House races for National Journal. He wrote a story about this campaign strategy last month.\n\nFitzpatrick says this race is interesting because Benishek is not talking much about what he\u2019s actually accomplished in Washington since being elected. But that might not matter \u2013 especially when some voters are really upset about healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Obamacare is a major issue throughout the country in this race, and he wants to make it the major issue of this race, makes his background as a doctor more relevant,\" Fitzpatrick says. \"It gives him some authority on the subject.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick says the doctor image makes Benishek look like an outsider, even though he\u2019s been around Washington four years. That\u2019s a smart tactic since Congress\u2019 approval ratings are hitting all-time lows.\n\nBut Benishek\u2019s opponent is also running as an outsider.\n\n'General' Cannon\n\nJerry Cannon is a former Kalkaska County sheriff and also a retired general in the Army National Guard. Cannon\u2019s TV advertisements are focused on introducing him to voters.\n\nSteve Tuttle says that makes sense.\n\n\u201cWhen you get outside of Kalkaska County and the surrounding areas, he\u2019s not very well known,\" Cannon says.\n\nTuttle writes a column for the Northern Express and used to be a political consultant. He says he\u2019s actually surprised that Cannon hasn\u2019t focused more on his background as a general.\n\nAlthough Cannon is positioning himself as a fresh face, he\u2019s being attacked as a Washington insider. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce paid for one TV advertisement that attacks Cannon for statements he's made about Obamacare in the past and links him to \"Washington liberals.\" The ad claims that \"Cannon is their guy.\"\n\nCannon\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to IPR\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOutside groups are spending millions of dollars in northern Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 50-50 outside spending [to] actual campaign spending,\" Steve Tuttle says. \"And about two-to-one either pro-Benishek stuff or anti-Cannon stuff.\u201d\n\nRepublican political action committees are paying for many anti-Cannon TV spots, but national Democratic groups have mounted their own counterattacks. One anti-Benishek advertisement accuses the congressman of supporting a 23 percent national sales tax, which would raise taxes for many middle-income Americans.\n\nA spokeswoman for Benishek says he wants to simplify the tax code.\n\nBenishek pulling ahead?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find a poll that predicts what will happen in the 1st Congressional District in November, but Tuttle thinks the race is still a toss up. Still, he says he would put money on Benishek winning in the end.\n\nRepublicans are thought to have an edge in the district. And if you follow the money, you see that Democrats are now less bullish about Jerry Cannon beating the incumbent than before. News reports last month showed one of the two major Democratic PACs was scaling back the number of TV ads they planned to buy in the market.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a sign that Benishek\u2019s ads are working at least to some extent,\" Jack Fitzpatrick says. \"Maybe he\u2019s in a good position in this race, because apparently it\u2019s not as much of a top target for Democrats as it was a few months ago.\u201d\n\nAnd the news is not getting better for Jerry Cannon.\n\nThe newspaper Roll Call had a story last week saying another top Democratic group was canceling an order for $425,000 worth of pro-Cannon TV ads.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Northern Michigan Elections & Government", "description": "The race for northern Michigan\u2019s U.S. House seat was one of the most closely contested elections in the state in 2012.
