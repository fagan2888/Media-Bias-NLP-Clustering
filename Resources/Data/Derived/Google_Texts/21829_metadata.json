Seahawks\n\nWhy: The Seahawks have all they need, including the sting of the closing seconds of Super Bowl 49, to return them to the top of the heap once again.\n\nTHE REST\n\n2. Ravens; 3. Patriots (1-0); 4. Packers; 5. Colts; 6. Cowboys; 7. Texans; 8. Broncos; 9. Cardinals; 10. Panthers; 11. Steelers (0-1); 12. Eagles.\n\nTHE VIKINGS\n\n13: They have the look of a surprise playoff team. But it\u2019s tough to leap too hard considering there\u2019s a lot that has to be proven first.\n\nTHE REST OF THE REST\n\n14. Bills; 15. Chargers; 16. Rams; 17. Bengals; 18. Saints; 19. Chiefs; 20. Lions; 21. Dolphins; 22. Giants; 23. Falcons; 24. Raiders; 25. Jets; 26. Bears; 27. 49ers; 28. Browns; 29. Redskins; 30. Jaguars; 31. Titans.\n\nWORST OF THE BUNCH\n\n32: Buccaneers: It could be a long, long, loooooong year for Jameis Winston.\n\nTHREE REASONS FOR VIKINGS FANS TO BE HOPEFUL\n\n1, Teddy Bridgewater has the accuracy, (enough) arm strength, intelligence, personality, poise and work ethic to keep his many supporters from looking foolish for believing in him. Now he just has to prove his many anti-detractors right.\n\n2, Adrian Peterson is back and he\u2019s a tad determined.\n\n3, The defense should take another step following last year\u2019s Year 1 leap under Mike Zimmer.\n\nTHREE REASONS FOR VIKINGS FANS TO BE NERVOUS\n\n1, The offensive line has question marks hovering over every starter and little depth. Other than that, \u2026\n\n2, Blair Walsh missed more field goals than he made this preseason.\n\n3, Starting cornerback Terence Newman turned 37 a week ago.\n\nTHE PICKS\n\nVIKINGS\n\nVikings minus-2 \u00bd at 49ers: Vikings 23, 49ers 20.\n\nWhy?: A number of intangibles are going against the Vikings. A late Monday nighter, on the road, in a team\u2019s new stadium. But the Vikings are the better team and in the second year with a new coaching staff. The 49ers are reeling from heavy losses in personnel and breaking in a new coaching system under Jim Tomsula.\n\nTHE OTHER GAMES\n\nPackers minus-6 \u00bd at Bears: Packers by 10.\n\nChiefs plus-1 \u00bd at Texans: Texans by 3.\n\nBrowns plus-3 \u00bd at Jets: Jets by 7.\n\nColts minus-2 \u00bd at Bills: Bills by 3.\n\nDolphins minus-3 \u00bd at Redskins: Redskins by 7.\n\nPanthers minus-3 at Jaguars: Panthers by 7.\n\nSeahawks minus-4 at Rams: Seahawks by 10.\n\nSaints plus-2 \u00bd at Cardinals: Cardinals by 3.\n\nLions plus-3 at Chargers: Chargers by 10.\n\nTitans plus-3 at Buccaneers: Bucs by 6.\n\nRavens plus-4 at Broncos: Broncos by 3.\n\nGiants plus-6 at Cowboys: Cowboys by 10.\n\nEagles minus-3 at Falcons: Falcons by 7.\n\nUPSET SPECIAL\n\nBengals minus-3 at Raiders: The Pick: Raiders 27, Bengals 24.\n\nWhy?: Hey, every 20 years or so, the Raiders should feel like a surprise team that\u2019s getting ready to win. Finally. And a trip to the West Coast is a tough opener for the Bengals.\n\nFinal 2014 regular-season Record: Overall: 146-90-1.
