A private investigator says he spent a year looking into wrongdoing at the Broward Health system at the request of its CEO, who died last week from suicide, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.

A letter sent to Broward Health’s attorney claims Dr. Nabil El Sanadi met investigator Wayne Black at restaurants and at his home because El Sanadi thought his office was bugged, the Sun Sentinel reports.

Black claims that his work led to an investigation by the FBI, and a probe by Florida’s Inspector General, according to the Florida Bulldog. These investigations follow a $70 million settlement Broward Health made with federal authorities last year in connection to Medicaid and Medicare fraud.

In a statement, Broward Health said the investigator was unprofessional, according to the Sun Sentinel, and was asked to stop working for the hospital system last October.
