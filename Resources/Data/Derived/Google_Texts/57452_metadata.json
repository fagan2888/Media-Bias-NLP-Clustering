Rick Scott pointed to the lack of a university affiliation when he vetoed $2.5 million that the Legislature had designated in biomedical research funds for VGTI in this year's budget. The legislature had designated $6.25 million for a number of biotech research firms. All were vetoed from the budget.\n\nVGTI had received $3 million the prior two years. With the backing of former Gov. Charlie Crist and then-Senate President Ken Pruitt, R-Port St. Lucie, the institute was created in 2008 through local funding and a $60 million grant from Florida's Innovation Incentive Fund.\n\nStarting in 2003, former Gov. Jeb Bush pushed for Florida to attract more biotech jobs. That year, the state put up $310 million to entice California's Scripps Research Institute to open Scripps Florida in Jupiter.\n\nOver the next few years, the state put up: $157 million for California-based Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute to land in Central Florida; $94.1 million for the Germany-based Max Planck to open in Jupiter; and $24.7 million for Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies to expand from California to Port St. Lucie.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The cash-strapped Vaccine &amp; Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, which a decade ago was part of the state's drive to bring more biotech jobs to Florida,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/biotech-institute-close-after-state-incentives", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201508/VgtiLogo.png", "type": "article", "description": "The cash-strapped Vaccine &amp; Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, which a decade ago was part of the state's drive to bring more biotech jobs to Florida,", "title": "Biotech Institute To Close After State Incentives"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 365, "dc": {"title": "Biotech Institute To Close After State Incentives"}, "nid": 11644, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "story_id": 432558776, "keywords": "Biotech Institute, state incentives, Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute of Florida", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9bf\"", "article_summary": "That year, the state put up $310 million to entice California's Scripps Research Institute to open Scripps Florida in Jupiter.\nThe institute asked Port St. Lucie two weeks ago for a $21 million bailout to cover mortgage payments and operating costs, according to TCPalm.com.\nThe legislature had designated $6.25 million for a number of biotech research firms.\nThe cash-strapped Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, which a decade ago was part of the state's drive to bring more biotech jobs to Florida, is closing.\n\"This is a sadly disappointing outcome,\" Richard Jove, VGTI Florida's president and institute director, said in a release."}
