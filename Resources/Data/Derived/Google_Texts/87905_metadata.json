Technology and science are producing products that improve our lives at an amazing rate.\n\nHuman knowledge doubles every 13 months. Using that theory we should be twice as smart next December as we are today. Other than Congress of course.\n\nWhat to Expect in 2015\n\nThe biggest area to watch in 2015 will be seeing what the Supreme Court decides to do with the lawsuits regarding the state exchanges and healthcare. That ruling expected sometime in June.\n\nIt will also be interesting to watch what the Republican held Congress will throw at the President.\n\nObama has been pretty adamant about not being shy when it comes to utilizing the power of veto. I look for that animosity to continue.\n\nWill Oil Prices Stay Low?\n\nCurrently I see no indication for oil prices to rise at least within the first six months of the year. I believe that Saudi Arabia is out to get Putin and put him in an energy shortage box.\n\nEnjoy it while you can because there is little profit in $50 oil and the vast majority of those who drill for oil are small business wildcat drillers, not major oil companies.\n\nHealthcare and Taxes\n\nThe Obamacare penalties are increasing in the coming year. If you don\u2019t have a government approved plan either at your employment, or individually, you are facing a sizeable fine.\n\nThe annual fee for not having a government approved health insurance plan in 2015 is $325 per adult and $162.50 per child (up to $975 for a family) or 2% of your taxable income, whichever is greater. You\u2019ll pay 1/12 of the total fee, per household member, for each month they go without coverage.\n\nAgain this could change depending on the ruling from the Supreme Court in June.\n\nThe Numbers Look Good But\u2026\n\nUnemployment is low yet the US workforce participation is the lowest it\u2019s been since the 1970s.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is holding the line on interest rates that make home loans less profitable for banks and other lenders.\n\nThe stock market is setting new records but a sizable amount of those profits are being made in emerging overseas markets that do not create many jobs here.\n\nSome Final Thoughts\n\nI really don\u2019t want to rain on anyone\u2019s New Years Parade but I don\u2019t see a whole lot of positive change ahead in 2015 over what we just went through.\n\nCongress and the president will continue their capitalism versus socialism conflict. And the American voter will be the loser.\n\nThe racism controversy will most likely heat up during the summer.\n\nGas prices are one of the few positives I see on the 2015 horizon. I hope there are more positives than negatives as we enter the New Year. It\u2019s been awhile since we\u2019ve had a really good year. Maybe 2015 will be the start of several good ones.\n\nHappy 2015.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/kmmsam.com/files/2014/12/136302127.jpg", "sailthru.author": "tomegelhoff", "description": "Human Knowledge doubles every 13 months.
