The 21st century update? A riff on the Iraq war so despised by President Obama\u2019s base: \u201cIt is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America\u2019s long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan \u2018you\u2019re either with us or against us.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhite House says Putin owns Syria solution - A senior White House official tells Fox News: \u201cPresident Putin has invested his credibility in transferring Assad's chemical weapons to international control, and ultimately destroying them. The world will note whether Russia can follow through on that commitment.\u201d\n\nComrade Vlad lectures Obama -\u201cI carefully studied his address to the nation on Tuesday. And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States\u2019 policy is \u2018what makes America different. It\u2019s what makes us exceptional.\u2019 It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord\u2019s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway - As Russia pumps up its clout in the Middle East and Putin takes to publicly scolding the American president, Moscow\u2019s lifeline to Obama will look less attractive. Putin\u2019s plan appeals to the White House because it gets Obama out of a domestic political jam of his own making, but will the deal be worth eating this much borscht? With no chance of getting a war resolution through Congress, Obama may not have any choice.\n\nChemical weapons \u201cdeclaration\u201d an early test of credibility - Talks begin today in Geneva between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. At issue: the details of a Russian plan to secure Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile. Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen, traveling with Kerry, reports from Switzerland that senior U.S. officials will be watching closely as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime reveals details on its weapons programs. The completeness of the inventory will be an early indication of how serious Assad is about complying.\n\nDevil in the details - Rosen reports that Kerry and Lavrov \u201c\u2026will be joined by teams of technical experts whose goal will be to assess swiftly whether the Russians can present a credible and verifiable plan for bringing the Syrian chemical weapons program under international monitoring and control.\u201d\n\nUN report to blame Assad, but \u2018no game changer\u2019 - Foreign Policy: \u201cU.N. inspectors have collected a \u2018wealth\u2019 of evidence on the use of nerve agents that points to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons against his own people, according to a senior Western official. Today\u2019s report will not directly accuse Assad but is expected to provide a strong circumstantial case that links him to an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack.\u201d\n\nBaier Tracks: A long way to get there\u2026 \u201cWith now so much riding on the \u2018escape hatch\u2019 offered in the Russian proposal \u2013 despite open speculation that the U.S. is being played \u2013 now it's again up to Secretary of State John Kerry to deliver. Kerry, in Geneva today for negotiations, seems to be in the spotlight on Syria almost more than the president.\n\nAn aside - Thanks to the hardworking Amtrak crews who fixed the track and got my train moving. I can't say that the seven-and-a-half-hour trip from D.C. to New York was enjoyable, but I got there and was in the chair at 6 p.m.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee discusses Russia\u2019s Syria proposal in the 11 a.m. ET hour]\n\nEscalating anyway - WaPo: \u201cThe CIA has begun delivering weapons to rebels in Syria \u2026 promised by the Obama administration, according to U.S. officials and Syrian figures. The shipments began streaming into the country over the past two weeks, along with separate deliveries by the State Department of vehicles and other gear.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee discusses Syria in the 9 a.m. ET hour.]\n\nKerry\u2019s Syria source bounced over padded resume - Elizabeth O'Bagy, who wrote a WSJ editorial that Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., cited as evidence that the Syrian opposition had not been heavily infiltrated by al Qaeda, lost her post Wednesday at the Institute for the Study of War for lying about holding a doctorate from Georgetown University. O\u2019Bagy, who made a media circuit that included Fox News, was a staunch proponent of U.S. strikes. She was previously found to have failed to disclose her ties to Syrian rebel groups.\n\n[Michael Gerson - In full retreat on Syria: \u201c\u2026 the president prefers to address a single problem he regards as solvable instead of presenting and defending a regional strategy. He wants to improve his prospects by narrowing his focus. Foreign policy challenges can't be chosen in this way.\u201d]\n\nWhite House huddle with freshman Republicans - An administration official says a group of freshman Republicans has been invited to the White House to meet with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough this afternoon.\n\n[New Today on Fox News Opinion - Cal Thomas: America, we've been played on Syria ]\n\nDem on Dem on Dem violence - Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz offered a curt response to former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s opposition to President Obama\u2019s call for air strikes in Syria. The Florida congresswoman told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, \u201cI think President Carter speaks from experience about diminished stature in an international crisis.\u201d\n\nCAMPAIGN CARL CAMERON: IS IT REALLY TIME FOR ANOTHER RECESS?\u201cWill the meltdown on the budget and confusion over Syria policy make it impossible for lawmakers to do anything more complicated than naming a bridges and libraries until next year's midterms?\n\nAt this point, immigration reform feels forgotten. Government funds run out in 18 days; the House put off a stopgap funding vote this week; the automatic sequester spending reductions are supposed to go from $85 billion to over $100 billion next year, but nobody\u2019s talking about it. Uncle Sam hits the debt limit and must borrow billions more next month. But Dems won't negotiate. And, oh yeah, Dems want to re-legislate the Voting Rights Act.\n\nNone of it is moving, but the House is taking the last week of September off and both chambers plan a one-week break in October. They shouldn't count on it. But we shouldn't expect much if they stick around, either.\u201d \u2013 Carl Cameron\n\nLOOMING BUDGET BATTLES - Party leaders square off - Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi meet today to discuss ways to avoid a government shutdown as a mid-October deadline for a debt-limit hike approaches.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s maneuvers for ObamaCare delay - Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., filed an amendment Wednesday that would delay ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate for a year, as well as reinforcing the White House\u2019s one-year delay of the employer mandate. McConnell tacked the plan to a Democratic measure on energy efficiency. McConnell will take to the floor this morning to discuss the amendment.\n\nCruz rips Cantor\u2019s \u2018procedural chicanery\u2019 - TheDaily Caller reports on the plan by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor for \u201c\u2026trading the end of sequester cuts and a debt ceiling raise in exchange for a one year delay of Obamacare ... Sen. Ted Cruz\u2026 called it \u2018procedural chicanery.\u2019\u201d\n\nSauerkraut! White House cancels congressional picnic again - The White House has again cancelled a picnic for members of Congress and their families, originally scheduled for June, according to a White House memo to members.\n\nOBAMACARE DELAYS, BY THE NUMBERS -President Obama has signed 14 laws that amend, rescind or change parts of ObamaCare, and taken five independent steps to delay its implementation, according to a new report from the Library of Congress\u2019 Congressional Research Service.\n\nObamaCare rules for Hill staff may be delayed - The White House Office of Personal Management released a memo to Hill staffers warning, \u201c\u2026 it will not be possible to confirm plan options, costs, benefits, or which House staff will be affected until OPM issues final regulations, which could very well be after the exchanges have already opened.\u201d\n\nAFL-CIO makes its ObamaCare demand - Washington Examiner: The nation\u2019s largest labor union, the AFL-CIO, approved a resolution calling for major changes to ObamaCare: \u201c[The Affordable Care Act] should be administered in a manner that preserves the high-quality health coverage multi-employer plans have provided to union families for decades and, if this is not possible, we will demand [the law] be amended by Congress.\u201d\n\nTwo Buck Chuck[ed] - Fox Business looks at how employers like Trader Joe\u2019s are shedding employee hours and coverage ahead of the next phase of ObamaCare implementation. Read it here.\n\nSILVER SPANKS PPP - StatisticianNate Silver, who crunches numbers for Disney properties ESPN and ABC News, blasted Democratic survey firm Public Policy Polling over its decision to not release polling results for the Colorado state senate recall election that showed Democrats trailing. The polls turned out to be predictive, but PPP defended withholding the results that might have further harmed Democratic fortunes, citing polling anomalies. Silver tweeted: \u201cVERY bad and unscientific practice for @ppppolls to suppress a polling result they didn't believe/didn't like.\u201d PPP shot back \u201cNot releasing a poll we never announced we were conducting is not \u2018putting our finger on the scale.\u2019\u201d\n\nCHICAGO TANGLED UP ON GUNS - Chicago Sun-Times: \u201cThe City Council moved Wednesday to both comply with \u2014 and undermine Illinois\u2019 new concealed carry law. The end-run around concealed carry came when aldermen imposed a requirement that Chicago restaurants that serve liquor ban firearms or lose their city licenses.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE - PERRY TARGETS TAXES IN MARYLAND - Texas Gov. Rick Perry is taking aim at business in Maryland, one of the most heavily taxed states in the nation, in his bid to lure employers to low-tax Texas. Governor Martin O\u2019Malley and his rain tax are just the latest in his job poaching campaign: California, New York, Connecticut, Illinois and Missouri were already targeted. Thirty-second ads are rolling out on cable, broadcast and radio for Baltimore and Washington. Maryland Democrats are not amused.\n\nThe TV script - \u201cWhen you grow tired of Maryland taxes squeezing every dime out of your business - think Texas. Where we\u2019ve created more jobs than all other states combined. Where you\u2019ll find limited government, low taxes and a fair legal system.

Martin O\u2019Malley: \u201cUnfortunately your governor has made Maryland the \u2018Tax and Fee State,\u2019 where businesses and families are paying some of the highest taxes in America. Since taking office in 2007, he\u2019s approved 40 new and increased taxes and fees, projected to cost you $9.5 billion through 2014. That\u2019s a job killer. He\u2019s even passed a rain tax on some property - a tax even New York doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...National Review\u2019s Kevin Williamson considers how tax policies could cause France to lose its top sports stars and how New York could suffer a similar fate if Public Advocate Bill de Blasio is elected mayor, as expected: \u201cIt is indicative of the times in which we live that it takes the possible loss of sports stars to make France see that, and that nothing seems likely to sober up New York\u2019s would-be class warriors.\u201d\n\nPOLL CHECK - Real Clear Politics Averages\n\nObama Job Approval: Approve \u2013 43.6 percent//Disapprove \u2013 51.0 percent\n\nDirection of Country: Right Direction \u2013 28.0 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 60.8 percent\n\nHILLARY\u2019S HELPERS IN HOT WATER - Troy White, a New York marketing executive, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws, when he received $608,000 from D.C. businessman Jeffrey Thompson.
