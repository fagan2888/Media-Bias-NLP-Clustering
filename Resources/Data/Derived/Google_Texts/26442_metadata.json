As early as March 2010, four different IRS offices sought out applications from conservative groups with the words \u201ctea party\u201d or \u201cpatriot\u201d in their names and made demands that were so onerous, the groups\u2019 tax exempt status was held up for more than two years.\n\nRelated: How Congress Could Have Prevented the IRS Scandal\n\nThe action followed a BOLO (be on the lookout) after the Supreme Court ruled on Citizens United and found it unconstitutional to ban free speech by corporations, unions and other organizations.\n\nA few liberal groups were caught in the sweep, but most received their tax-exempt status in far less time than the conservative groups. USA Today analyzed the IRS data and concluded that liberal groups were given a free pass.\n\nDid Lois Lerner act alone or did someone else give her the green light to target these groups? If she wouldn\u2019t talk about it, maybe her emails would finally settle the issue.\n\nThen, incredulously, the head of the IRS announced that Lerner\u2019s emails were lost. Not just lost\u2014deleted and irretrievable because the hard drive was fried and destroyed and whatever had been backed up on servers had been permanently deleted. Yikes!\n\nLast Thursday, the IRS inspector general said it took only two weeks for investigators to find hundreds of tapes\u2014the very tapes IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said were either destroyed or deleted. To punctuate the problem, the IRS claims it has spent $10 million producing documents, including 67,000 Lois Lerner emails.\n\nRelated: IRS Scandal\u2014Who\u2019s Next on the Chopping Block?\n\nThroughout it all, Lerner, who was placed on administrative leave, received her salary and benefits and continued to receive bonuses\u2014a total of $129,300 over three years, according to Forbes. The former commissioner also received a $100,000 bonus.\n\nTo date, taxpayers have spent millions investigating the IRS scandal\u2014including the $10 million spent trying to recover the \u201clost tapes\u201d to the millions spent on six different investigations.\n\nChances are, by the time this issue is resolved, there will be a new president, a new cabinet, and a new investigation.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Let\u2019s review.", "title": "32,774 \u2018Found\u2019 IRS Emails Prompt Criminal Probe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/02/32774-Found-IRS-Emails-Prompt-Criminal-Probe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-06-26T015522Z_2_LYNXMPEA5P011_RTROPTP_2_USA-IRS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/02/32774-Found-IRS-Emails-Prompt-Criminal-Probe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-06-26T015522Z_2_LYNXMPEA5P011_RTROPTP_2_USA-IRS.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Let\u2019s review.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb282\"", "article_summary": "To date, taxpayers have spent millions investigating the IRS scandal\u2014including the $10 million spent trying to recover the \u201clost tapes\u201d to the millions spent on six different investigations.\nTo punctuate the problem, the IRS claims it has spent $10 million producing documents, including 67,000 Lois Lerner emails.\nLast Thursday, the IRS inspector general said it took only two weeks for investigators to find hundreds of tapes\u2014the very tapes IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said were either destroyed or deleted.\nA few liberal groups were caught in the sweep, but most received their tax-exempt status in far less time than the conservative groups.\nUSA Today analyzed the IRS data and concluded that liberal groups were given a free pass."}
