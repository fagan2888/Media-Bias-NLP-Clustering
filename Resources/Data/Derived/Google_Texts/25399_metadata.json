I understand what it's like raising a family on a stretched budget in an environment where wages are not keeping up with taxes and health care costs. If elected, I will work tirelessly to decrease taxes for hard-working families and small businesses.\n\nI consider myself an average American, and I believe in the American dream. First, I am a husband and a dad. My wife, Stephanie, and I chose to raise our kids here in the 85th Assembly District because we love Wausau and the people of central Wisconsin. We want our community to continue to be a place where families and businesses can prosper.\n\nI grew up in a big family of 15 siblings that taught me the value of hard work. My father worked multiple jobs to provide for us: milkman, taxi driver, ice cream truck driver \u2014 whatever it took to make ends meet. He did all this while attending college at night. When he finally earned his college degree, five children were there cheering Dad on at graduation. He went on to a career as a computer systems analyst.\n\nThey never had much money, but Mom and Dad lived the dream and inspired in us the desire to excel and serve. My parents instilled in us love of God and country and compassion for the most vulnerable in our society. They taught us that love and service go hand in hand. Dad served overseas in World War II, and when I graduated high school I also wanted to serve my country. I joined the Air National Guard and simultaneously worked my way through college.\n\nLater, I put myself through law school and became a prosecutor.\n\nAs a prosecutor, I defended the rights of crime victims. I helped people during their darkest moments. The victims and families I fought for came from all walks of life and many from challenging backgrounds. My experiences as a prosecutor deepened my compassion for others. If elected, that compassion will guide my decisions.\n\nToday, I am a businessman who knows what it means to do more with less. In business, we constantly strive to improve processes, improve efficiency and spend dollars wisely. Government needs to do the same.\n\nMadison needs legislators who respect taxpayers. I will treat your tax dollars as if they were my own. I will work across party lines to get things done and grow Wisconsin's economy. Jobs are my top priority.\n\nI firmly believe government should partner with job-seekers and businesses, not put up barriers. To keep Wisconsin headed in the right direction, government must foster an environment that is fair to workers and friendly to businesses.\n\nI truly desire a bright and prosperous future for my kids and for everyone in the Wausau area. I would be honored to serve as your representative in the Wisconsin Assembly.\n\nDave Heaton of the town of Wausau is the Republican candidate for the 85th Assembly District.
