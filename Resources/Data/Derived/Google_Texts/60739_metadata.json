Burwell, a case charging that the federal government lacks the authority to provide consumers tax credits in health insurance exchanges not run by states.\n\nThe order agreeing to hear the case technically cancels the three-judge ruling from July that found for the plaintiffs. That ruling, if upheld, could jeopardize the entire structure of the Affordable Care Act by making insurance unaffordable for millions of consumers in the 36 states where the federal government operates the exchange.\n\nThe court will hear oral arguments in the case in December. For the time being, the order also eliminates the \u201ccircuit split\u201d that could prompt the Supreme Court to take up the case.\n\nThe same day the panel from the Washington, D.C., circuit decided that tax credits are not allowed in federal exchanges, a three-judge panel from the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., decided exactly the opposite.\n\nThe losers in that case, King v. Burwell, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court on July 31.\n\nBut now that there are no appeals courts technically in disagreement, \u201cit\u2019s much less likely the Supreme Court will take it,\u201d said Ian Millhiser of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\nIt is also considered likely that the full District Court of Appeals in Washington will rule that the subsidies are allowable in federal exchanges. A majority of judges on the full appeals court are Democratic appointees, including four appointed by President Barack Obama and recently confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMillhiser said the full appeals court\u2019s action is rare. \u201cUsually they mean (a majority of the full court) disagree with the panel\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nThe issue is still live, however. Similar lawsuits asserting the subsidies are not allowed in the federal exchange are pending in Indiana and Oklahoma. Those cases are still at the lower, district court level.\n\nMichael Cannon of the Cato Institute, who has been among those advocating the hardest for the lawsuits\u2019 claims, called the full court\u2019s decision \u201cunwise and unfortunate.\u201d\n\nHe said the ruling \u201chas the appearance of a political decision and will likely only delay Supreme Court review.\u201d\n\nBut Millhiser says the longer subsidies remain in place, the harder it would be for the Supreme Court to take them away. With a full D.C. Appeals Court decision not likely until next spring, the soonest the Supreme Court would likely hear the case would be in the 2015-2016 session. By that time, he said, \u201cpeople will have had subsidies going on three years.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
