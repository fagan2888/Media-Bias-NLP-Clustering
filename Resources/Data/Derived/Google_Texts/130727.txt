Towards the race for the 2016 presidential election, Republican controversial frontrunner, Donald Trump on Sunday shows a softer side at his campaign. At a Reno, Nevada, rally, the GOP presidential frontrunner completely stopped his speech after a woman in the crowd fainted. “Is she OK?” a stern-faced Trump inquired multiple times, in addition to calling for a doctor and demanding his aides get the woman a glass of water. According to the CNN, Trump said “We love our people, we’ve got to take care of our people,” Trump said. “Who cares, we’ll hold it for a couple of minutes.” Trump attacks Ted Cruz

At the Nevada rally, the republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on sunday hammered away at his closest challenger’s eligibility to be U.S president, while the party’s Senate leader said the chamber will stay out od the fray involving Ted Cruz’s citizenship. Under the Constitution, presidents must be “natural born citizens”. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, to an American mother which he says makes him eligible to run. Trump said that Cruz’s Canadian birth makes him ineligible to be president. The father of the senator from Texas was born in Cuba.

Trump shows his caring side to supporters

After seeing the woman that fainted at the rally was being treated by two doctors, Trump couldn’t resist an impromptu jab at the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s signature domestic achievement. “We’ve got great people in our audience,” Trump said. “She’s surrounded by doctors — no thanks to Obamacare.”

After a couple of minutes, the woman gave Trump the go ahead to continue his speech. Trump told the woman to rest backstage and to return for the end of the speech, adding that if she wants him to stop, he will. Trump has been noted for hitting at his opponents at any opportunity he has, especially at campaign rallies.
