But the judge, Paul L. Friedman of the Federal District Court here, said that was absurd and contrary to the whole purpose of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe plain text of the statute, the statutory structure and the statutory purpose make clear that Congress intended to make premium tax credits available on both state-run and federally facilitated exchanges,\u201d Judge Friedman said.\n\nAfter analyzing the law and its legislative history, he said, \u201cCongress assumed that tax credits would be available nationwide\u201d and \u201con any exchange, regardless of whether it is operated by a state\u201d or by federal officials.\n\nThe ruling is important because the federal government runs the exchange serving 36 states, which account for about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRonald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families U.S.A., a liberal-leaning advocacy group, said the ruling was \u201can important win for health care consumers across the country.\u201d\n\nSam Kazman, general counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group that is coordinating and helping finance the lawsuit, said the plaintiffs would appeal the decision.\n\nFrom Oct. 1, when the exchanges opened, through Dec. 28, nearly 1.2 million people selected health insurance plans in the federal marketplace, and nearly a million chose plans in state exchanges.\n\nAbout four-fifths of people choosing health plans at both levels of government qualified for subsidies that reduced their premiums. Subsidies may be available to people with annual incomes up to $45,960 for individuals and up to $94,200 for a family of four.\n\nThe lawsuit, Halbig v. Sebelius, was filed by several people in states that use the federal exchange: Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. They objected to being required to buy insurance even with subsidies to help defray the cost.\n\nThey said the health care law authorized subsidies specifically for insurance bought on \u201can exchange established by the state.\u201d Congress, they said, provided subsidies in that way as an incentive for states to establish and operate exchanges, rather than leaving the task to the federal government.\n\nHowever, Judge Friedman found no evidence of such a purpose. He quoted remarks on the Senate floor by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and an architect of the law, who said in December 2009 that Congress was giving states a choice to set up their own exchanges or to allow the federal government to do so.\n\nWhen federal officials create an exchange, Judge Friedman said, they \u201cstand in the shoes of the state.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn voting for the Affordable Care Act, Democrats in Congress assumed that states would set up their own exchanges. But many Republican governors and state legislators balked, and opposition to the law became a rallying cry for the party.\n\nJudge Friedman said the plaintiffs\u2019 argument seemed intuitively appealing. The section of the law providing health insurance subsidies, \u201cviewed in isolation, appears to support plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation\u201d because \u201cthe federal government, after all, is not a state,\u201d he said.\n\nBut this reading of the law leads to \u201cstrange or absurd results,\u201d the judge said, adding that courts must interpret statutes as a whole, not just isolated provisions.\n\nThe first page of the law declares the intent of Congress to ensure \u201chealth care for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction in this case \u2014 that tax credits are available only for those purchasing insurance from state-run exchanges \u2014 runs counter to this central purpose of the Affordable Care Act: to provide affordable health care to virtually all Americans,\u201d Judge Friedman said.\n\nThus, he said, the regulation in question, issued by the Internal Revenue Service in May 2012, was a reasonable interpretation of the law and was consistent with the intent of Congress to provide subsidies in the federal exchange as well as state exchanges.\n\nSimilar lawsuits, challenging subsidies in the federal exchange, have been filed by several Virginia residents and by state officials in Oklahoma and Indiana.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140115164245, "twitter": {"description": "A judge\u2019s ruling means that
