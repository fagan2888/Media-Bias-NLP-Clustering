His four recent medals came as he was competing against kids three years his senior.\n\n\u201cHe's a wonderful acrobat, he's got a great sense of where he is in the air,\u201d said Nunzio Esposto, the Duke swimming and diving coach who trains both Windle and Capobianco. \u201cJordan is essentially the future of U.S. Diving.\"\n\nCampobianco, who is also 15 and relocated to the Triangle from New York to work with Esposto, won gold\u2019s in the 1-meter, 3-meter and platform at the junior championships. He said he enjoys the rush.\n\n\u201cYou can hear the sound of the rip,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when you come out of the water, hear all the people cheering, you just go 'wow.'\"\n\nEsposto points to Campbiano\u2019s technical abilities as a key to his future success\n\n\n\n\"He is a great twister,\u201d Esposto, who was an 11-time junior national finalist in his own right, said. \u201cHe's also developing some great entries, a great rip, and as far as his future, he's going to be a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\n\nIn two weeks, the two best in the country will get to see how they stack up against the best in the world at FINA World Junior Championships in Penza, Russia.\n\n\"It's sort of like a mini-Olympics for them because it is Junior Worlds and all the countries are represented,\u201d Esposto said. \u201cIt's going to be phenomenal and I'm hoping they come back with some medals.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-08-24 23:30:00", "description": "In two weeks, the two best youth divers in the country will get to see how they stack up against the best in the world at FINA World Junior Championships in Penza, Russia.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-08-25 00:24:39", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13920576|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "In two weeks, the two best youth divers in the country will get to see how they stack up against the best in the world at FINA World Junior Championships in Penza, Russia.", "title": "Pair of youth divers will represent Triangle, U.S. at Worlds :: WRALSportsFan.com", "url": "http://www.wralsportsfan.com/pair-of-youth-divers-will-represent-triangle-u-s-at-worlds/13920576/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wralsportsfan.com/asset/olympics/2014/08/25/13920948/13920948-1408940061-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wralsportsfan", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T23:30:00-04:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRALSportsFan.com", "description": "In two weeks, the two best youth divers in the country will get to see how they stack up against the best in the world at FINA World Junior Championships in Penza, Russia.", "title": "Pair of youth divers will represent Triangle, U.S. at Worlds :: WRALSportsFan.com", "url": "http://www.wralsportsfan.com/pair-of-youth-divers-will-represent-triangle-u-s-at-worlds/13920576/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wralsportsfan.com/asset/olympics/2014/08/25/13920948/88959-dive-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cc0\"", "article_summary": "Campobianco, who is also 15 and relocated to the Triangle from New York to work with Esposto, won gold\u2019s in the 1-meter, 3-meter and platform at the junior championships.\n\"It's sort of like a mini-Olympics for them because it is Junior Worlds and all the countries are represented,\u201d Esposto said.\nThe 15-year-old Windle was born in Cambodia but adopted at a young age by an American family.\n\u201cAnd then when you come out of the water, hear all the people cheering, you just go 'wow.'\"\n\u201cIt's going to be phenomenal and I'm hoping they come back with some medals.\""}
