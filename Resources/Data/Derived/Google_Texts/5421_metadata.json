A Kansas Highway Patrol trooper said the ignition source was a \"little cap gun\" the boy was using.\n\nSchell described what exploded as leftover fireworks from a campout. But the state fire marshal's agent said damage to this vehicle was consistent with commercially made or homemade explosives.\n\nRather than scheduling a jury trial Friday, attorneys asked the judge to schedule a status conference because they're negotiating a non-trial resolution.\n\nThe status conference is March 11.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacob Schell's son, Roman, was injured when he was in a car with Schell and a sack containing explosives blew up in the child's lap.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Topeka-man-charged-in-car-explosion-waives-hearing-366349521.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jacob+schell.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Jacob Schell's son, Roman, was injured when he was in a car with Schell and a sack containing explosives blew up in the child's lap.", "title": "Topeka man charged in car explosion waives hearing"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Jacob Schell's son, Roman, was injured when he was in a car with Schell and a sack containing explosives blew up in the child's lap.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Topeka-man-charged-in-car-explosion-waives-hearing-366349521.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jacob+schell.jpg", "title": "Topeka man charged in car explosion waives hearing", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Topeka man charged in car explosion waives hearing", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Topeka man charged in car"}, "article_summary": "A Topeka man facing charges linked to an explosion in his car that injured his 4-year-old son has pleaded not guilty and waived his preliminary hearing.\nRather than scheduling a jury trial Friday, attorneys asked the judge to schedule a status conference because they're negotiating a non-trial resolution.\nAn arrest affidavit says that a sack containing \"several improvised explosive devices\" blew up in the lap of Schell's son.\nThe status conference is March 11.\nSchell's son, Roman, who was 4 at the time, was injured July 5, 2015, when he was in a car with Schell and a sack containing explosives blew up in the child's lap."}
