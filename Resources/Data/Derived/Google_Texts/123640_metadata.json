It is one of the best travel-based programs the U.S. has for combating terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is one of the best travel-based programs the U.S. has for combating terrorism,\u201d says @dr_inserra of the visa waiver program.\n\nSens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who calls the program the \u201csoft underbelly\u201d of America\u2019s national security, are preparing legislation to ban a visa waiver for people who\u2019ve traveled to Syria and Iraq in the past five years.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is also proposing a bill that would impose a 30-day waiting period for people traveling through the program.\n\nThese lawmakers worry that Europeans who have gone to fight with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Iraq or Syria can return to their home nations and use the visa waiver program to enter the United States.\n\nYet those familiar with the program say that people applying for a visa waiver\u2014a program established in 1986 that allows 20 million each year to enter the U.S.\u2014are screened through an electronic system more intense than even the normal visa process.\n\n\u201cThe name \u2018visa waiver\u2019 brings to mind an overzealous third base coach waving people into the country with reckless abandon, but that belies the serious intent of the program,\u201d said Jonathan Grella, executive vice president of public affairs for the U.S. Travel Association.\n\nThe U.S. travel industry opposes efforts to restrict the visa waiver program and is lobbying legislators to inform them of the program\u2019s security and screening requirements.\n\n\u201cWhat the program really does is enable countries who we have strong relationships with to share intelligence information and collaborate even more on keeping the world safer,\u201d Grella told The Daily Signal. \u201cThat has been lost in the debate to this point. We want to avoid constructing travel hurdles that undermine our economy and give terrorists the victory\u2014of fear\u2014they are seeking.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the countries that join the visa waiver program\u2014including most European countries such as France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom\u2014must meet high data-sharing standards.\n\nCountries must share information about known and suspected terrorists in their countries, lost and stolen passports, and law enforcement data related to serious crimes.\n\nStewart Verdery, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who worked on the visa waiver program, helped oversee reviews of participating countries.\n\n\u201cThe program has been strengthened substantially going back the last 12 years,\u201d Verdery said. \u201cThe countries have to do very good things to be in the program, like providing state-of-the-art passports, help the U.S. build watch lists and a national criminal database, and take back criminal aliens if they do something wrong. But in an era of high threat, the [Homeland Security] department and Congress should be looking for strengthening measures.\u201d\n\nIn a requirement added after 9/11, travelers using the visa waiver program must apply online and pass the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), an automated system that runs checks on a person\u2019s security risk, including criminal history and whether one is on a national security watch list or no-fly list.\n\n\u201cIn an era of high threat, the [Homeland Security] department and Congress should be looking for strengthening measures,\u201d says @StewartVerdery of the visa waiver program.\n\nIf this system flags a person, he or she is denied a visa waiver and would have to apply for a visa through the regular process. Those seeking a traditional visa have to be interviewed in person at an American embassy abroad. The visa waiver program does not require an in-person interview.\n\nIn addition, this August, the Department of Homeland Security announced enhancements to the visa waiver program requiring travelers from participating countries to carry e-passports that contain biometric data embedded in computer chips.\n\n\u201cThe agreement that we have made with these allied countries is, we will make it a little easier for you to come here in exchange for you giving us intelligence we need to watch out for bad guys,\u201d Inserra told The Daily Signal.\n\nStill, supporters of the visa waiver program are not opposed to certain improvements, and the Obama administration has expressed a willingness to work with lawmakers on the issue.\n\nOne concern with the visa waiver program that people seem to agree on is that some participating countries are better than others at sharing data.\n\nRep. Candice Miller, R-Mich., introduced legislation earlier this year that would allow Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to suspend a country without notice from the visa waiver program if it doesn\u2019t follow information-sharing requirements.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association endorsed Miller\u2019s legislation.\n\nGrella and Verdery are less supportive of the Flake-Feinstein plan, but not because of its attempt to prevent travel for people who\u2019ve recently been to Iraq and Syria.\n\nThey are worried about a less talked-about provision of the proposal that would mandate that travelers using the visa waiver program be fingerprinted and photographed before leaving their home countries.\n\nVerdery contends that this measure would be redundant and expensive, because currently travelers are fingerprinted and photographed immediately after they arrive in the U.S., where airports are better equipped to collect that information.\n\nIf fingerprints taken after the flight match criminal records, that person could be arrested or sent back to his or her home country.\n\n\u201cIn theory, it\u2019s a good security addition if there was a way to do that,\u201d Verdery said of collecting fingerprints before the flight. \u201cBut right now, there is no way to collect that. Is the added security benefit of finding an impostor eight hours earlier worth the cost of building the IT capability in every airport in world? That\u2019s the question.\u201d\n\nInserra believes that the Flake-Feinstein proposal does not address the biggest vulnerability of the visa waiver program.\n\n\u201cIf we knew someone went to Syria, that would already be a red flag,\u201d Inserra said.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is the people you don\u2019t know went to Syria and Iraq, the people we don\u2019t know anything about, who are not on a watch list, who could come to us on the waiver program. But that\u2019s a problem with intelligence. It\u2019s not a unique program of the visa waiver program. It\u2019s a weakness of intelligence.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some lawmakers worry a program that allows citizens from 38 approved countries to travel to the U.S. without a visa could present a terrorism risk.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Some lawmakers worry a program that allows citizens from 38 approved countries to travel to the U.S. without a visa could present a terrorism risk.", "title": "Terrorism Fears Fuel Debate Over Visa Waiver Program", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/VisaWaiver.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-25T13:38:32+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YsLwG0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Some lawmakers worry a program that allows citizens from 38 approved countries to travel to the U.S. without a visa could present a terrorism risk.", "title": "Terrorism Fears Fuel Debate Over Visa Waiver Program", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/VisaWaiver.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-11-24T18:17:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T13:38:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "visa waiver program, Paris, Syria refugee, Brussels, Diane Feinstein, Jeff Flake, Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, Rand Paul, terrorism, ISIS"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not a unique program of the visa waiver program.\nWhile lawmakers faced some pushback for targeting Syrian refugees, the idea of reforming the visa waiver program is supposedly a safer\u2014and more effective\u2014bet.\nThat\u2019s the question.\u201dInserra believes that the Flake-Feinstein proposal does not address the biggest vulnerability of the visa waiver program.\n\u201cWe have gained so much information from the visa waiver program.\nThe visa waiver program does not require an in-person interview."}
