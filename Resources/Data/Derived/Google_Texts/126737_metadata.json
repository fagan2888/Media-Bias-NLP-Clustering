(VIDEO: Flashback: Obama Says Illegal Immigration Hurts \u2018Blue-Collar Americans,\u2019 Strains Welfare)\n\nAccording to The Washington Times, because those who have received amnesty will not be eligible for Obamacare, those workers won\u2019t count against business\u2019 employee total that trigger employer mandate penalties \u2014 making illegal immigrants much more attractive than either native-born Americans or legal immigrants, who are eligible for Obamacare coverage.\n\nObamacare\u2019s employer mandate, which will partially take effect in January, requires businesses with a certain number of full-time employees to provide \u201caffordable\u201d health coverage (as defined by the federal government) or pay a $3,000-per-worker penalty for failing to do so.\n\nFederal Reserve banks across the country have reported that the mandate is forcing many businesses to stop hiring or to cut back workers\u2019 hours to part-time only in order to avoid the tax and costly health coverage.\n\nBut illegal immigrants, because they don\u2019t qualify for Obamacare, won\u2019t count against the total; The Washington Times reports that the loophole has been confirmed by congressional aides. That will give illegal immigrants a massive edge not only over native-born Americans and citizens, but those immigrants who came here legally.

Once again changing the law to make illegal immigrants eligible for Obamacare \u2014 a move supported by Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Burwell \u2014 would likely cause a political uproar.\n\nBrain Rogers, a spokesman for Republican Sen. John McCain, told The Washington Times Congress should eliminate the incentive to hire illegals by eliminating the employer mandate entirely.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Could hurt employment for legal immigrants, Americans", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama now swears his executive amnesty will be good for American workers, but formerly illegal immigrants will have at least one big advantage over legal immigrants and Americans: the", "title": "Report: Under Obama\u2019s Amnesty, Obamacare Will Make Illegals $3,000 Cheaper To Hire", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/26/report-under-obamas-amnesty-obamacare-will-make-illegals-3000-cheaper-to-hire/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-26T152328Z_1_LYNXNPEAAP0S4_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1417035504217.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Could hurt employment for legal immigrants, Americans", "title": "Report: Under Obama\u2019s Amnesty, Obamacare Will Make Illegals $3,000 Cheaper To Hire Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/26/report-under-obamas-amnesty-obamacare-will-make-illegals-3000-cheaper-to-hire/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-26T152328Z_1_LYNXNPEAAP0S4_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1417035504217.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-26 16:08:42", "sailthru.title": "Report: Under Obama's Amnesty, Obamacare Will Make Illegals $3,000 Cheaper To Hire", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "President Barack Obama now swears his executive amnesty will be good for American workers, but formerly illegal immigrants will have at least one big advantage over legal immigrants and Americans: the", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-26T152328Z_1_LYNXNPEAAP0S4_RTROPTP_4_USA-OBAMA-e1417035504217.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Illegal immigrants eligible for amnesty after Obama changed the law will not be eligible for Obamacare, according to the administration, in a move to cut down on political opposition to the president\u2019s executive action.\nOnce again changing the law to make illegal immigrants eligible for Obamacare \u2014 a move supported by Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Burwell \u2014 would likely cause a political uproar.\nThat will give illegal immigrants a massive edge not only over native-born Americans and citizens, but those immigrants who came here legally.\nBut illegal immigrants, because they don\u2019t qualify for Obamacare, won\u2019t count against the total; The Washington Times reports that the loophole has been confirmed by congressional aides.\nBrain Rogers, a spokesman for Republican Sen.
