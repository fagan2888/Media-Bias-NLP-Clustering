Seth Perlman/AP Photo\n\nCoca-Cola is not backing down.\n\nTo celebrate the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, Coke released a longer version of what is becoming the most talked about 2014 Super Bowl ad, \u201cAmerica Is Beautiful,\u201d in which \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d is sung in many languages common to American immigrants.\n\nThis is Coke\u2019s response to the conservative backlash that erupted, according to ABC News, within seconds of the Super Bowl ad airing, with tweets saying, \u201cThis is an outrage. America the Beautiful in foreign languages\u201d and \u201cNever buying Coke again. America the Beautiful in a language other than English is just wrong\u201d and the hashtag #BoycottCoke. (Meanwhile, supporters of diversity are using Coke\u2019s proposed hashtag, #AmericaIsBeautiful).\n\n\u201cEverybody was talking about it,\u201d Adweek\u2019s managing editor Lisa Granatstein told ABC. \u201cIt was really part of the national conversation.\u201d (It should be noted that Coke\u2019s ad also showed footage of a gay family \u2013 although the gay factor hasn\u2019t caused the same uproar.) In a statement, Coke explained it was standing by \u2013 and expanding \u2013 its ad because \u201cthe overall message of inclusion communicated by the ad reflects some of Coca-Cola\u2019s most important values.\u201d\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on immigration.]\n\nCoke\u2019s got more news for the conservative boycotters: All the foreign-language singers are Americans. Not only that; they\u2019re all adorable American girls, who are sunny and positive about America. And nothing can win a culture battle more decisively than adorable, happy American children. Coke released a series of behind-the-scenes videos, showing each girl in the recording studio.\n\n\u201cWhen I sing the song, I feel really happy. I feel joyful,\u201d says Naya, the smiley American girl singing in Arabic in the ad. \u201cWe should always be friendly to each other, no matter what difference you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message that we\u2019re sending through this video, it\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d offers Sushmitha, who sings in Hindi. \u201cWe are all the same. We just have different backgrounds. And that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all Americans and we can come together.\u201d\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the economy.]\n\nHer little-kid legs swinging from the chair, Leilani, who sings in Tagalog, says the ad will make people \u201cfeel really good in themselves ... to hear it in many other languages spoken, especially if one of those languages is one that you speak, then it will really get deep inside of you.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Coke has bad news for the boycotters: If sweet-natured Christy isn\u2019t American, then the boycotters sure as heck aren\u2019t. That\u2019s because Christy is a Native American. She sings \u201cAmerica The Beautiful\u201d in her native Pueblo language of Keres. \u201cTranslating the lyrics \u2018America the Beautiful\u2019 was difficult because Keres is not a written language,\u201d Christy explains in the behind-the-scenes video. \u201cSo we had to go back to our Elders to help translate.\u201d\n\nBy pitting smiley American children against ugly, angry adults, Coke has flattened the boycotters\u2019 arguments. The only limitation is that Coke\u2019s videos of these little girls were released only on YouTube. To really win against the haters, Coke should consider airing an ad with snippets of these wise but adorable girls.\n\n[See a collection of editorial cartoons on the 2014 Sochi Olympics.]\n\nThe haters need to wake up and smell the coffee. As a young American woman explains in a related Coke video, \u201cWe don\u2019t get to pick and choose whether America should be diverse or not. It is diverse.\u201d\n\nAnd why is America so diverse? Why do people come here from every corner of the globe? As young Naomi, who sings in Spanish for the ad, says, people come here because in America, \u201cwe have the right to be ourselves. We can speak whatever we want. We can pray whatever we want to pray. And I just think that\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThat quintessentially American freedom of thought, speech and prayer have drawn generations to our shores for hundreds of years, starting with the Mayflower pilgrims. These also remain essential reasons America is the incubator of great ideas and innovations. Having the intellectual freedom to blow open entirely new ways of approaching problems and issues has always driven American success. Consider the invention of the car, the telephone, electricity, space exploration and scientific breakthroughs \u2013 the American approach is to carry the world to new heights.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nAmerican innovation also benefits from having the diversity of ideas and peoples that come from other shores. Many of America\u2019s best minds in Silicon Valley, Ivy League universities or in research labs across the country are the minds of first-generation Americans, kids whose parents came here from other countries and who grabbed hold of American freedom of thought.\n\nBack to the Olympics, where Coke is upping the ante: American innovation was on display \u2013 and rewarded \u2013 in the first medals awarded at Sochi. Sage Kotsenburg took home the first gold medal of the 2014 Olympics (in men\u2019s slopestyle snowboarding) largely because he wowed the judges with a move nobody had ever tried before \u2013 a \u201cbackside 1620 with a Japan grab,\u201d also called the Holy Crail. Indeed, it was a move Sage, himself, had never tried before (not even in practice). Sage exemplified the quintessentially American style of innovating in the moment. The same thing happened in the women\u2019s freestyle ski moguls, where American Hannah Kearney took bronze despite a critical error in which one leg flew out to her side. Even so, she impressed the judges with a daring grab at her ski, tweaking it back. This led her to beat out the Japanese skier Aiko Uemura, who had a more technically perfect run, but who did not offer that American dazzle and innovation in the air.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Coke Is Right to Celebrate American Diversity After Super Bowl Ad Outrage", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The company used children to defend its Super Bowl ad featuring America the Beautiful sung in different languages.", "title": "Coke Takes On the Haters", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/carrie-wofford/2014/02/12/coke-is-right-to-celebrate-american-diversity-after-super-bowl-ad-outrage", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/77/7c/d6d4d2fb426fbba0d25865df3e52/140212-coke-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The company used children to defend its Super Bowl ad featuring America the Beautiful sung in different languages.", "card": "summary", "title": "Coke Is Right to Celebrate American Diversity After Super Bowl Ad Outrage"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 12, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Carrie Wofford,immigration,Coca-Cola,culture,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The company used children to defend its Super Bowl ad featuring America the Beautiful sung in different languages."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01f5\"", "article_summary": "To celebrate the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, Coke released a longer version of what is becoming the most talked about 2014 Super Bowl ad, \u201cAmerica Is Beautiful,\u201d in which \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d is sung in many languages common to American immigrants.\nTo really win against the haters, Coke should consider airing an ad with snippets of these wise but adorable girls.\nShe sings \u201cAmerica The Beautiful\u201d in her native Pueblo language of Keres.\nAs young Naomi, who sings in Spanish for the ad, says, people come here because in America, \u201cwe have the right to be ourselves.\nThis is Coke\u2019s response to the conservative backlash that erupted, according to ABC News, within seconds of the Super Bowl ad airing, with tweets saying, \u201cThis is an outrage."}
