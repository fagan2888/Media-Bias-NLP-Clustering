Jefferson County sheriff’s deputies have arrested a 33-year-old man for investigation of murder in the death of his 34-year-old common-law wife, authorities say.

Michael Allen Sommerfield is being held in connection with the death of Michele Elaine Lucero, said Mark Techmeyer, spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.

Investigators were called to a condominium on the 9300 block of West Ontario Drive before 9 p.m. Friday, Techmeyer said. When they arrived they found Lucero’s body.

“It was pretty chaotic,” Techmeyer said.

Sommerfield is being held without bail in the Jefferson County jail. His first court appearance is scheduled for Monday.

Sommerfield had fled the area following the homicide, but he later called 911 and turned himself in.

Techmeyer said officials are not yet releasing the cause of death.

Sommerfield was convicted in 2011 of child abuse causing injury and was given a one-year deferred sentence that was later dismissed, according to Colorado Bureau of Investigation records.
