Thomas Aquinas College students, faculty and staff members will fast and pray Wednesday as the Supreme Court hears the school's case involving birth control.

"There's a tradition that, when there's something seriously important to you, you pray and fast," said Anne Forsyth, spokeswoman for the small Catholic college in Santa Paula. "Because fasting is difficult, we believe it evokes many graces."

Other Catholics across the country, including Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., have told college officials they plan to join them in fasting and praying, Forsyth said. Fasting involves eating less than two full meals a day, she said.

Under the Affordable Care Act, employers must include birth control in the health insurance they offer.

However, Thomas Aquinas officials argue that following the federal mandate would violate their religious beliefs. The government has countered that Thomas Aquinas and other objectors can offer coverage through a third party, without paying directly for it.

Thomas Aquinas is one of 35 plaintiffs in the case, Zubik v. Burwell. The court is expected to start hearing the case at 7 a.m. Wednesday Pacific time.
