About 30 percent of the populations of Estonia and Latvia speak Russian, and 8 percent speak the language in Lithuania.\n\nSEE ALSO: Carly Fiorina: Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin \u2018have a lot in common\u2019\n\nAccordingly, many Russians in the Baltics have long watched television programming, including news, produced in Russia. Those broadcasts often have reflected a pro-Russian bias that has concerned Baltic leaders.\n\nRecently, however, in the wake of Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and Moscow\u2019s interference in eastern Ukraine, officials in Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius increasingly fear that Russia\u2019s propaganda could be a precursor to more violent aggression.\n\n\u201cIf you look at those TV channels from Russia, you will not find a pluralistic approach,\u201d said Andis Kudors, executive director of the Center for East European Policy Studies, a Latvian think tank. \u201cFor example, Russian officials are saying, through the media, that Latvians are like fascists. It\u2019s the same kind of thing they are saying about Ukrainians.\u201d\n\nThe Russian TV channel RTR Rossiya, for example, recently covered a dispute between the Latvian government and the Russian organizers of a popular song contest with a pro-Moscow bent that was clearly designed to embarrass Riga, Mr. Kudors said.\n\nThe contest usually takes place in the popular Latvian beach town of Jurmala, but when officials banned two Russian singers from entering the country to participate in the event because they publicly supported Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the organizers moved the contest to Sochi, Russia, this year.\n\n\u201cRTR Rossiya showed an empty beach in Jurmala,\u201d said Mr. Kudors. \u201cMaybe they filmed in the early morning, because the beach is busy every day. They said, \u2018Look what happened. They lost 30 percent of Russian tourists because Latvia is against this Russian song contest.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe television newscast didn\u2019t mention that Russian tourism abroad has dropped with the plummeting value of the ruble.\n\nSimilarly, Russian television covers World War II remembrance events every year in Latvia by saying the government in Riga is permitting a neo-Nazi march. It\u2019s true that the march memorializes Latvian troops who fought for Germany, Mr. Kudors said, stressing that Latvians were drafted into the German and Soviet armies during the war.\n\nIn Latvia, three of the six most popular TV channels are Russian-owned and transmit a steady diet of anti-Western messages into the country, said Mr. Kudors. He believes the broadcasts undermined Russian speakers\u2019 integration into Latvian society, where more than 300,000 Russian speakers are technically not Latvian citizens but hold either Russian passports or are officially stateless.\n\n\u201cHow can you unite two groups if they are living in different informational spheres with different interpretations of events?\u201d he said.\n\nWestern officials have responded to the problem.\n\nLast year, NATO opened the Strategic Communications Center of Excellence in Riga in part to counter Russia\u2019s media influence in the region. In one of its first reports, the center found that Moscow\u2019s influence over the mass media was a powerful tool in its aggressive policies.\n\n\u201cThis control over the media has made it difficult for democratic states with free media to compete with the forceful, synchronized messaging of the Russian government,\u201d the report said.\n\nPropaganda, no propaganda\n\nIn the past year and a half, Latvia and Lithuania have imposed temporary bans on the Russian-owned TV channels for breaking local laws by inciting hatred and knowingly disseminating false information, including downplaying a violent Soviet crackdown that resulted in 13 deaths in Lithuania after the country declared independence in 1991.\n\nUldis Lielpeters, deputy state secretary for the media at the Latvian Ministry of Culture, said Riga has increased its Russian-language programming on Latvian public television and promoted public awareness about Russian propaganda.\n\nThe government decided not to launch its own public relations push to oppose Russia\u2018s, said Mr. Lielpeters. Officials preferred to offer Russian speakers quality journalism as an alternative to Moscow\u2019s state-controlled channels rather than spend money on spin.\n\n\u201cI would say the best answer to propaganda is no propaganda,\u201d he said.\n\nEstonian officials had the same idea. At the end of the month, the country is slated to open a Russian-language public broadcasting television channel that will include an online presence.\n\n\u201cIn Estonia, we don\u2019t currently have a multimedia environment which allows Russian-speaking people to receive, create and exchange information,\u201d said Ainar Ruussaar, who sits on the board of the Estonian public broadcaster, ERR. \u201cThere is a growing need among Russian-speaking people here and elsewhere for balanced and just news and journalism.\u201d\n\nLocal coverage might be an antidote to Moscow\u2019s broadcasts that treat everyone in the Russian diaspora as a monolithic community, Mr. Ruussaar said.\n\n\u201cToday, the Russian-speaking people can consume media which represents a collective historical narrative, but not their personal and local stories,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Estonia\u2019s and Latvia\u2019s television stations will succeed against the power of Russian-backed broadcasting. The combined budgets of all of Latvia\u2019s television stations are equal to the budget of one Russian television channel, Mr. Kudors said.\n\nThe Lithuanian public broadcaster, LRT, has no plans to establish more Russian-language media. It broadcasts in many minority languages, but the chairman of the LRT board, Zygintas Peciulis, said the county\u2019s Russian-speaking population is too small to have a channel devoted to it.\n\nEstonians are relying partly on support from Germany, whose public foreign news service Deutsche Welle will be sharing programming with the Russian-language channel in Estonia, according to ERR.\n\nIn the city center of Riga, 42-year-old chemist Inese Puzule said she was glad more resources were going into Russian-language broadcasting.\n\n\u201cRussians will watch TV in their own language,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have Latvian news in Russian, they will watch TV from Russia, with those views and ways of understanding things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Baltic states and NATO are training troops, repositioning armor and bulking up other defenses to counter Moscow's increasingly bellicose stance toward Russia's neighbors.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Baltic states and NATO are training troops, repositioning armor and bulking up other defenses to counter Moscow\u2019s increasingly bellicose stance toward Russia\u2019s neighbors.", "title": "Russian language, propaganda at center of Baltics war over airwaves", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/23/russian-language-propaganda-at-center-of-baltics-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/23/9_232015_balkins8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/23/9_232015_balkins8201.jpg", "description": "The Baltic states and NATO are training troops, repositioning armor and bulking up other defenses to counter Moscow's increasingly bellicose stance toward Russia's neighbors.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Russian language, propaganda at center of Baltics war over airwaves"}, "Author": "Markus Kuokkanen - Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Riga, Estonia, Russia, Latvia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe46d6\"", "article_summary": "The combined budgets of all of Latvia\u2019s television stations are equal to the budget of one Russian television channel, Mr. Kudors said.\nAbout 30 percent of the populations of Estonia and Latvia speak Russian, and 8 percent speak the language in Lithuania.\nSimilarly, Russian television covers World War II remembrance events every year in Latvia by saying the government in Riga is permitting a neo-Nazi march.\n\u201cFor example, Russian officials are saying, through the media, that Latvians are like fascists.\nRIGA, Latvia \u2014 The Baltic states and NATO are training troops, repositioning armor and bulking up other defenses to counter Moscow\u2019s increasingly bellicose stance toward Russia\u2019s neighbors."}
