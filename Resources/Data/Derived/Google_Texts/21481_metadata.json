In the same month, Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C., and God\u2019s Power of Christ Church in Macon, Ga., were also burned and listed as arsons by fire investigators.\n\n\u201cWe have already forgiven the individual who started this fire,\u201d said Mannix Kinsey, pastor of Briar Creek Road Baptist Church.\n\n\u201cGod has taken the sourness of someone\u2019s heart and He\u2019s made it into a sweet lemonade,\u201d Kinsey added, referring to the outpouring of love their church has received from across the country.\n\nThe pastors of each of the three churches say they want their stories to be ones not of racism and hate, but of Christian love and forgiveness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Following the devastating June 17 shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., several black churches across the south have been affected by serious fires.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Following the devastating June 17 shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., several black churches across the south have been affected by serious fires.", "title": "The Story of 3 Pastors Whose Black Churches Were Burned", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SC-Church1250x650.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-20T11:11:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JfTGrn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Following the devastating June 17 shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., several black churches across the south have been affected by serious fires.", "title": "The Story of 3 Pastors Whose Black Churches Were Burned", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SC-Church1250x650.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2015-08-20T03:01:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T11:11:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Black church fires, religious freedom, church arson, who is burning black churches, briar creek baptist church"}, "article_summary": "Three of the pastors whose churches were burned in cases of arson spoke to The Daily Signal for an exclusive video featuring them sharing their stories.\nFollowing the devastating June 17 shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C., several black churches across the South have been affected by serious fires.\n\u201cWe have already forgiven the individual who started this fire,\u201d said Mannix Kinsey, pastor of Briar Creek Road Baptist Church.\nThe pastors of each of the three churches say they want their stories to be ones not of racism and hate, but of Christian love and forgiveness.\nIn the same month, Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C., and God\u2019s Power of Christ Church in Macon, Ga., were also burned and listed as arsons by fire investigators."}
