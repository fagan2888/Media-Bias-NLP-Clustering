Officials say there were 22 people, from Indianapolis and Louisville, staying at the cabin. The group arrived there on Friday.\n\nPastor Christopher Armstrong of Mount Vernon Community Missionary Baptist Church said Hudson and his wife were the patriarchs of the family. Hudson was a long time member of the church.\n\nOn Saturday, police dispatchers received the call about the fire around 4:30 a.m. from Cabins at the Crossing. When crews arrived, the three-story cabin was almost completely on fire.\n\n\u201cMad, angry, depressed. I just can\u2019t believe it happened to us,\u201d said Tynisha Brown.\n\nShe\u2019s one of 20 people lucky to be alive after their cabin caught fire. She said her uncle, Ricky Hudson, smashed several windows out as he helped others get outside.\n\n\u201cWhen he busts the windows open he cut his main artery,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite his injuries, Brown said he continued to get people outside. She said the fire started by the front door so everyone had to jump off the balcony. She said Hudson was waiting down below to catch them.\n\nAll the members of the group escaped from the cabin, except 5-year-old Tyveon Temple. Officials said he died in the fire.\n\n\u201cWe wasn\u2019t even there a whole day and now my little brother\u2019s gone and I feel like it\u2019s my fault that I should have went in there and I should have got him,\u201d Brown said with tears in her eyes. \u201cNow he not even with me no more.\u201d\n\nArmstrong and other church leaders drove to Tennessee to pick up the family. The family\u2019s vehicles were destroyed in the fire so they had no other way to get home.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how they were coming back, we were going because that\u2019s what families do,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the church group got to the hospital, authorities and the Red Cross had already provided assistance with food and clothing.\n\n\u201cThe ride back was very long as one could understand. Tears all the way, just sniffles, all the way.\u201d\n\nArmstrong made it back in time for Sunday service, making sure to tell the congregation of Hudson\u2019s selfless act.\n\n\u201cA man died saving his family,\u201d he proclaimed during his sermon.\n\nA man Brown is proud to call her uncle.\n\n\u201cHe was brave, he died a brave man. He died a hero,\u201d she said.\n\n17 members returned home Saturday night. Three others were expected to return home on Sunday. Sunday morning, Hudson\u2019s wife was still in a Tennessee hospital.\n\nPastor Armstrong said Hudson\u2019s wife had donated his organs to the Tennessee Donors Society. Investigators are working to recover Tyveon\u2019s remains.\n\nFirefighters, the Tennessee State Fire Marshal Bomb and Arson Section, as well as the University of Tennessee Forensics Center are investigating.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \u2013 An Indianapolis man and a 5-year-old child have died following a cabin fire in Tennessee this weekend.
