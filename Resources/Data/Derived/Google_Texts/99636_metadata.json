Not because she disagrees, but because the guests are brothers and both her sons and she is sick and tired of their shit.\n\nThis perfect moment comes via the eagle-eyes at the Washington Post. You see, brothers Brad and Dallas Woodhouse sit on opposite sides of the the aisle, politically, and so they make joint appearances to argue bitterly about things like Obamacare. And their mother has had enough, by God, and so she called into their latest C-SPAN appearance from Raleigh, North Carolina to say that she is glad they both went to their in-laws' this year for Thanksgiving and she wants this nonsense out of their system BEFORE they come home for Christmas, goddammit. She loves them both, but she wants a peaceful Noel.\n\nWatch and cringe as one of the brothers drops his head into his hands and bemoans, \"Oh God, it's mom.\" At least they've got something to bond over before the trip home for the holidays.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "angry moms, Brad and Dallas Woodhouse, woodhouse divided, north carolina, Jezebel", "author": "Kelly Faircloth", "og": {"site_name": "Jezebel", "description": "Oh my Lord, shut it down, here is the greatest moment in the history of C-SPAN: A (very Southern) mama called into one of their shows to yell at the guests.
