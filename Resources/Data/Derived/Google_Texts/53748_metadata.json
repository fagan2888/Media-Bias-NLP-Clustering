The 2-1 ruling said, however, that Congress has the power to write immigration laws, and congressional inaction is not an excuse for Mr. Obama to try to write law himself.\n\nThe administration signaled Tuesday it will appeal, and if it moves quickly, the case could reach the Supreme Court by the end of the term, next June.\n\nMeanwhile former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernard Sanders, two of the candidates for Democrats\u2019 presidential nomination, insisted the appeals court got the ruling wrong and predicted the Supreme Court would change it.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama believes that the parents of children who are citizens or legal permanent residents should be able to stay with their children, not be forced out of the country. I look forward to the Supreme Court acknowledging the president\u2019s position,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement.\n\nMrs. Clinton, meanwhile, insisted the legal backing for Mr. Obama\u2019s moves \u201cis well established.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidates \u2014 including those who agreed with Mr. Obama\u2019s goals \u2014 have blasted him for taking a go-it-alone stance on the issue, saying he needed to work with Congress to win a compromise instead.\n\nThe issue is already playing out on the campaign trail, where Hispanic activists have said voters should punish Republicans for backing the lawsuit that challenged the amnesty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hoping to cash in on Hispanic voters' support, Democratic presidential candidates pushed President Obama Tuesday to speed an appeal of this week's decision blocking his deportation amnesty, saying they're confident he'll prevail at the Supreme Court.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hoping to cash in on Hispanic voters\u2019 support, Democratic presidential candidates pushed President Obama Tuesday to speed an appeal of this week\u2019s decision blocking his deportation amnesty, saying they\u2019re confident he\u2019ll prevail at the Supreme Court.", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton cheer Obama appeal of immigration case", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/10/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-cheer-obama-appeal-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/14/95c590ea3072c12e840f6a706700bb0f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/14/95c590ea3072c12e840f6a706700bb0f.jpg", "description": "Hoping to cash in on Hispanic voters' support, Democratic presidential candidates pushed President Obama Tuesday to speed an appeal of this week's decision blocking his deportation amnesty, saying the", "card": "summary", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton cheer Obama appeal of immigration case"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Law Crime"}, "article_summary": "The administration signaled Tuesday it will appeal, and if it moves quickly, the case could reach the Supreme Court by the end of the term, next June.\nI look forward to the Supreme Court acknowledging the president\u2019s position,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement.\nThe 2-1 ruling said, however, that Congress has the power to write immigration laws, and congressional inaction is not an excuse for Mr. Obama to try to write law himself.\nHoping to cash in on Hispanic voters\u2019 support, Democratic presidential candidates pushed President Obama Tuesday to speed an appeal of this week\u2019s decision blocking his deportation amnesty, saying they\u2019re confident he\u2019ll prevail at the Supreme Court.\nMeanwhile former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen.
