Oregon got no closer than six the rest of the way.\n\nUnsung star\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Zak Showalter averages just 7.5 minutes and 2.0 points per game. The 6-foot-2 sophomore on Sunday contributed five points, five rebounds and two assists in 15 minutes. With the Badgers up three, he hit a 3-pointer and a reverse layup midway through the second half to push the lead to eight.\n\nStat-sheet stuffer\n\nNigel Hayes of Wisconsin does a little bit of everything well. The 6-8 sophomore had 14 points, five rebounds, three assists, a block and a steal on Sunday.\n\nHigh riser\n\nOregon freshman Dillon Brooks took it to a higher floor than the Badgers expected, launching himself along the left baseline and throwing down a one-handed jam with 12:28 left in the first half.\n\nCould have gone either way\n\nThe memory of Wisconsin\u2019s 2014-15 season. Sam Dekker and Frank Kaminsky played like the veterans they are down the stretch, providing the clutch plays needed to survive and advance.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nA female fan from Wisconsin didn\u2019t appreciate the officials calling a foul on Josh Gasser in the first half. The foul was changed to Zak Showalter. \u201cGo look at the film, you idiot!\u201d she yelled.\n\nOur take\n\nRarely does any team steamroll four opponents to reach a Final Four. Wisconsin was vulnerable to an upset on Sunday, lacking the dominance it\u2019s displayed during long stretches of the Big Ten season. But the Badgers came through when it mattered and will head to Los Angeles confident they can reach Indianapolis.\n\nThey said it\n\n\u201cLot of friends and family. I love Omaha. Omaha\u2019s a great city. It was really good, really enjoyed being here. Just wish we could have won.\u201d \u2014 former University of Nebraska at Omaha player and assistant coach Tony Stubblefield, now an Oregon assistant, on returning to his old stomping grounds.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Wisconsin held off an Oregon surge in the second half to beat the Ducks 72-65 at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha.", "title": "Badgers stay step ahead of Ducks to reach Sweet 16", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/sports/ncaa-tournament/badgers-stay-step-ahead-of-ducks-to-reach-sweet/article_33017d00-d100-11e4-a444-27e4ca86362b.html", "image": {"width": 1170, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/3f/43ff442a-d100-11e4-b260-8b4a22c3540e/550f73b9d3377.image.jpg?resize=1170%2C780", "height": 780}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Wisconsin held off an Oregon surge in the second half to beat the Ducks 72-65 at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "ncaa-tournament,sports", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "ncaa-tournament,sports"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a38\"", "article_summary": "Unsung starWisconsin\u2019s Zak Showalter averages just 7.5 minutes and 2.0 points per game.\nThe foul was changed to Zak Showalter.\nBut the Badgers came through when it mattered and will head to Los Angeles confident they can reach Indianapolis.\nThe 6-foot-2 sophomore on Sunday contributed five points, five rebounds and two assists in 15 minutes.\nThe 6-8 sophomore had 14 points, five rebounds, three assists, a block and a steal on Sunday."}
