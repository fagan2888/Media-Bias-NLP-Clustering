He kept us safe.\"\n\nQUOTE 4: \"So 40 years ago I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people.

We can contribute to that and be economically sound.\"\n\nQUOTE 3: On the woman he'd want on the $10 bill: \" I think the Adams family has been shorted in the currency business.

These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying. I would encourage every American to watch the videos.
