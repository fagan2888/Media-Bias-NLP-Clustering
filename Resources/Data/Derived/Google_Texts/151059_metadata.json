However, he also acknowledged that he had received criticism for not being active enough in Washington and not passing a lot of legislation. Neugebauer responded by saying he was a \u201cwork horse,\u201d not a \u201cshow horse,\u201d and that his intention in office was to shrink big government and not to expand it with more legislation.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I came to Congress was I felt like they were passing too many laws up here. And so, I didn\u2019t come up here to expand government; I came up here to shrink government. Because, every time we pass a law up here or pass a bill, somebody\u2019s individual liberties and freedoms are infringed upon. So, I didn\u2019t come up here to see how many bills I could pass while I was in Congress.\u201d\n\nNeugebauer said that, if re-elected, his focus would be on repealing Obamacare, as well as working towards fiscal conservatism and working on improving the Farm Bill. He also shared his thoughts on unemployment, saying that instead of focusing on unemployment benefits, Congress should really be focusing on creating jobs.\n\nCongressman Randy Neugebauer appears Monday mornings from 7:35 AM to 8 AM on Lubbock\u2019s First News.
