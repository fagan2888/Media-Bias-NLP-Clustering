“The Rock” as President Obama, sort of. (NBC)

Many an episode of “Saturday Night Live” has opened at the White House. From Bill and Hillary’s marriage troubles to Obamacare meetings, we’re always poised to see a cast favorite don a suit and a wig to impersonate our top politicos.

That’s how Saturday’s episode began, with Jay Pharoah as President Obama giving the stink eye to Rep. John Boehner and Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton. And then, the man impersonating the president wasn’t Pharoah anymore: Dwayne Johnson, “The Rock,” became Barack Obama.

Or, rather, “The Rock Obama.”

His bulging muscles rip his shirt, his feet outgrow his shoes, and somehow he also acquires chest tattoos.

“Don’t be alarmed,” he tells the scared lawmakers. “The Rock Obama much like Barack Obama, only larger and more violent.”

Later in the night, Johnson starred in a Wrestlemania skit and a trailer for a Disney remake of “Bambi.” We’ve been through live-action “Cinderella” and “Maleficent” remakes, so a human playing a big-eyed doe must be next, right? A human playing a big-eyed doe with guns in both paws and a cigar in his mouth. (But still a butterfly on his nose!)

“When I was a boy, they took away my mother. Now it’s time for them to pay – deerly.”
