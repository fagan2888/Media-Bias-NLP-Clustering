Although the 2015 World’s Largest Swimming Lesson scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday is supposed to be fun, it also has a vital purpose: to save lives from accidental drowning.

Each year a coalition of the nation’s leading water safety and training organizations tries to top the previous year’s attendance at a one-day lesson while teaching basic water safety skills.

In Ventura County, all of the YMCA facility pools will be holding the lesson, as will the Daland Swim School in Thousand Oaks.

“Drowning is the leading cause of accidental death in children ages 1 to 14,” said Leslie Daland-James. “It happens quickly and silently. The best thing to do to minimize risk is to fence your pool and give children swimming lessons. Also, we are living by the ocean, and teaching kids to be stronger swimmers makes them safer by the beach as well.”

For the past five years, the World’s Largest Swimming Lesson has set a Guinness World Record for attendance at one lesson. In 2014, 36,564 swimmers from 22 countries participated in learning such basic skills as “throw, don’t go,” said Cassie Hughes, aquatics coordinator at the Camarillo YMCA.

“We teach kids to attempt a rescue with noodles and rings instead of going in after the victim and creating a double drowning,” Hughes said, noting that it’s just one part of the very specific curricula required to participate in The World’s Largest Swimming Lesson. “We also cover sun safety, use of sun screen, pool rules, being safe in and around an aquatic environment and how to get help in an aquatic emergency.”

Hughes said she hopes to have 80 people sign up for the event, and she has eight instructors ready to give the lesson Thursday. The World’s Largest Swimming Lesson is open to people of all ages, and YMCA membership is not required to participate.

At the Ventura YMCA, Cheri Hays, associate aquatics director, explained that all of the Channel Islands YMCAs, which include facilities in Santa Barbara County as well as Ventura County, are participating.

“We have been really marketing all over. Last year we had 60 participants and we’re hoping for more this year,” Hays said. “It will be that one event where everyone can participate. It really gets awareness out for water safety.”

Daland-James said one of the first things instructors try to teach young children is how to survive an accidental fall into a pool.

“We give the children the skill that if they fall in pool, they can take a breath and get out,” she said, adding that there is usually some apprehension to overcome. “It takes time. We build rapport. We are teaching them to learn about their own buoyancy, while helping them become more comfortable in the water. We want them to think of water as a happy place.”

The event starts at 9:30 a.m. so people can sign in and learn the rules of the lesson, which will be offered promptly at 10 a.m. in each time zone across the United States.

Organizers at all venues ask people to sign up ahead of time.
