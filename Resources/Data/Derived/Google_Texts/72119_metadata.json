Maybe you need to embrace your dark side, according to a new study that shows people with certain extreme pathological personality traits fare well in the game of love.\n\nIn the study researchers focused on nearly 1,000 heterosexual men and women with a variety of pathological personality traits whose disorders ranged in severity from none to diagnosable. Participants were referred to the study by general practitioners or other medical professionals, says Fernando Guti\u00e9rrez at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, who led the research. Guti\u00e9rrez and his team inquired about participants\u2019 lifetime numbers of mates and children, along with job level, income and other sociodemographic factors using a combination of self-reporting surveys and interviews.\n\nTheir results show that people with some pathological personality types, such as those considered neurotic and impulsive, had more mates and even more children than average, suggesting that such traits are not being weeded out by natural selection and actually may confer an evolutionary advantage.\n\nThe conclusions of the findings, published online in the October 23 Evolution & Human Behavior, are speculative due to study limits. For example, Corinna E. L\u00f6ckenhoff, a human developmental psychologist at Cornell University who was not involved with the study, points to the possibility that there may be some biases in participants\u2019 self-reports of relationship. \u201cRespondents could have inflated the number of partners in an effort to depict themselves as more desirable. This may be especially true for individuals whose personality characteristics make them prone to dishonesty and for male respondents since cultural norms tend to view promiscuity [as] more favorable in men than in women,\u201d she says. Additionally, it\u2019s important \u201cto make it clear that there is no ideal personality type and that variation in personality traits reflects a common phenomenon in the evolution of a wide range of anatomical, physiological and behavioral phenotypes,\u201d adds says Alfonso Troisi, a research psychiatrist at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, also not involved with the study.\n\nThe study results show both males and females who were pathologically reckless and impetuous attracted more short-term partners than participants with average personalities. And obsessive-compulsive males\u2014but not females\u2014were successful at securing long-lasting mates, an outcome strongly associated with this group\u2019s high income (obsessive-compulsives made nearly twice as much as the less obsessive study participants), Guti\u00e9rrez says.\n\nThe study results also revealed that neurotic females were more likely to be in lasting relationships. The most neurotic female participants had 34 percent more long-term mates and 73 percent more children than average despite exhibiting a trait typically associated with instability, anxiousness and insecurity, he explains.\n\nAccording to Guti\u00e9rrez their results provide the first solid evidence that some personality disorders, rather than illnesses, could be sexually selected evolutionary strategies. \u201cThese strategies are supposed to be ancestral,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of them, such as impulsivity-boldness, probably predate humanity itself.\u201d\n\nBut why would anyone marry and have children with people whose behaviors are outside the norm?\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez says he once asked a patient why he married a neurotic woman. The man responded: \u201cMe gusta por que es muy mujer\u201d (I like her because she is \u201cvery woman\u201d), an answer that may reveal a link between gender differences and stereotypes, says L\u00f6ckenhoff. \u201cThe literature on gender differences suggests that, on average, women are slightly higher in neuroticism than men. Thus, some men could interpret high levels of negative emotionality in a mate as a sign of femininity,\u201d she says. Further research, however, is needed to examine this possibility, she notes.\n\nAs for the impulsive and risk-takers\u2014who were shown to have multiple short-term mates, Guti\u00e9rrez speculates that a number of people are attracted to those types because they are considered captivating. \u201cWhile they are selfish, rule-breaking, imprudent and rebellious, they are also brave, temerarious, independent and self-reliant\u2014and they live frantic, galvanizing lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThis captivates many people. This desirability could also have an evolutionary basis,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez says, as this behavior could function as a fitness indicator, \u201c\u2026a signal that the subject has such good genetic quality and condition as to live dangerously without suffering harm,\u201d he adds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Always falling for the wrong guy or gal?
