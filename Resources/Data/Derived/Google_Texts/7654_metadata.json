The report shows more than 126,000 Oklahoma residents enrolled in the health care marketplace for 2015 plans.\n\nOpen enrollment begins Sunday for coverage that starts on Jan. 1. Residents can enroll in the health marketplace, renew or change their plan.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s 35.7 percent increase for the second-lowest cost silver plan is the highest among the 37 states that use the federal health insurance exchange. The average rate increase was 7.5 percent for this plan, which is used as a benchmark to determine the amount of premium tax credits for which consumers qualify.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, about 70 percent of enrollees choose silver plans.\n\nMike Rhoads, deputy commissioner of health and life for the Oklahoma Insurance Department, said the cost increase in Oklahoma is the result of fewer providers in the marketplace and high losses by Blue Cross Blue Shield Oklahoma, the largest provider on the exchange.\n\nTwo other providers that offered plans this year \u2014 GlobalHealth of Tulsa and Tulsa-based HMO Community Care \u2014 both dropped out of the exchange, Rhoads said.\n\n\u201cIf Community Care and GlobalHealth had stayed in the exchange, this average would have come way down,\u201d he said.\n\nNational insurance company UnitedHealthcare is a new entrant into the Oklahoma marketplace this year, Rhoads said.\n\nHe said health insurance companies also underestimated how much treatment consumers would seek, especially those with longstanding medical conditions who may have been uninsured for years.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of money to get people treated for diabetes or congestive heart failure,\u201d Rhoads said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that they\u2019re getting treated, but it comes at a cost.\u201d\n\nStill, Rhoads said once tax credits are applied to the cost of the premiums, there are numerous plans that are extremely affordable, even ones as low as $20 per month.\n\n\u201cEven though you\u2019ve got this rate increase, it\u2019s still a bargain,\u201d he said.\n\nThe latest Health and Human Services data shows nearly 80 percent of returning marketplace customers will be able to buy a plan with premiums less than $100 per month once tax credits are applied.\n\nRhoads said the number of uninsured Oklahoma residents also is continuing to drop, from nearly 22 percent in 2010, to around 15 percent currently.\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
