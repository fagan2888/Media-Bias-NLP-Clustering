The data collection was also criticized by privacy advocates and tech companies wary of broad government surveillance.\n\nUnder a replacement program that took effect on Nov. 29, NSA and law enforcement agencies must get a court order and ask communications companies like Verizon Communications to authorize monitoring of call records of specific people or groups for up to six months.\n\nWhile some Republicans vying for the White House have criticized the shutdown of the bulk program, other Republican contenders have defended it.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas has defended his vote in favor of NSA reforms by saying that the new program actually is capable of collecting a greater percentage of calls than the old one, due to technical upgrades.\n\nSome privacy advocates expressed skepticism at Friday\u2019s report, given the level of secrecy shrouding the U.S. intelligence community.\n\n\u201cThe USA FREEDOM Act ended bulk collection, but this report leaves us guessing just how good a job it did,\u201d said Robyn Greene, policy counsel with Open Technology Institute at the New America, a Washington think tank.\n\nThe other four privacy principles that have been complied with are individual participation, purpose specification, data quality and data security.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new system for collecting domestic telephone records meets se", "title": "NSA says new phone spying program meets privacy safeguards", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/NSA-says-new-phone-spying-program-meets-privacy-safeguards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-security-records_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/NSA-says-new-phone-spying-program-meets-privacy-safeguards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-security-records_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new system for collecting domestic telephone records meets se", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A presidential review committee found that the bulk data collection, exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, was an ineffective tool in fighting terrorism.\nThe data collection was also criticized by privacy advocates and tech companies wary of broad government surveillance.\nWhile some Republicans vying for the White House have criticized the shutdown of the bulk program, other Republican contenders have defended it.\nThe other four privacy principles that have been complied with are individual participation, purpose specification, data quality and data security.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new system for collecting domestic telephone records meets several privacy and civil liberties benchmarks, the U.S. National Security Agency said on Friday."}
