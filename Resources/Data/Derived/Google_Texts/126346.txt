The work-life balance of most employees is tipping more toward the workplace, according to a new study by TriNet, a cloud-based human resources provider. Employees at small and medium-sized businesses work an average of 5.14 more hours per month than in 2007.

Furthermore, employees in all industries except professional services worked more hours during the recession, and working hours still have not returned to pre-recession levels.
