Ted Cruz doesn't like Obamacare. But he likes \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham.\u201d Not only the book, the Dr. Seuss classic, but also the dish. Green eggs and ham.\n\n\n\nSeems appropriate for someone who spent fully 21 hours on the Senate floor, endlessly yakking, hamming it up \u2013 toward no purpose whatsoever.\n\n\n\nThe freshman Republican, the darling of the tea partiers, talked and talked and talked last week \u2013 ostensibly because he doesn\u2019t want the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 to become law. Except that it already is the law of the land, passed by the Congress, signed by the president, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough to have kept Cruz from his antics.\n\n\n\nBecause the newly minted senator really had something else on his mind, had another, unstated goal: promoting himself.\n\n\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Cruz, just nine months in the U.S. Senate, has been making all the moves of someone who plans to seek his party\u2019s nomination for the presidency. This is why he was critical of fellow Republicans even as he talked up a blue streak about \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d and actor Ashton Kutcher and did an impression of Darth Vader and quoted Ayn Rand and Rush Limbaugh\u2019s father and, well, you get the point.\n\n\n\nHe had a yak attack. On the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\nAnyone who caught even a brief moment of the senator\u2019s talk-a-thon could see that shameless self-promotion was the name of his game. Through and through.\n\n\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to suggest that Cruz likes Obamacare. Or that he doesn\u2019t like \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut what he quite obviously likes most of all is the sound of his own voice, the idea of himself at center stage.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "congress, editorials, gop, obamacare, politics, ted-cruz, opinion", "title": "Editorial: GOP Sen.
