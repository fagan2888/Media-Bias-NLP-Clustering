Story highlights Trump's jab at Cruz was just one of many the billionaire leveled at Cruz

Just two days earlier Cruz defeated Trump to win the Iowa caucuses

Little Rock, Arkansas (CNN) Donald Trump on Wednesday leveled a bold accusation at one of his chief rivals for the Republican nomination: "Ted Cruz gave us Obamacare."

"He'll get up and he'll talk about his relationship with God, his relationship with the Bible, his relationship with all sorts of things and then he'll say Donald Trump loves Obamacare.

"He's the one that got Justice Roberts onto the United States Supreme Court," Trump added.

The Cruz campaign did not immediately return with a request for comment.
