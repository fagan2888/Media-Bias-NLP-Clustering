The House made some significant changes to a bill that would extend Medicaid expansion for two more years.The House voted 207-136 to preliminarily approve House Bill 1696 , which will have to return to the House for a final vote after the Finance Committee reviews the bill...The House voted down several amendments aimed at scuttling the bill before approving changes to require a person on the program be a state resident and participants would not open a person to a federal background check...Supporters said the New Hampshire Health Protection Program has had a significant impact on the health of low-income adults on the program, as well providing treatment and recovery services to those suffering from drug and alcohol addiction...The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Joseph Lachance, R-Manchester, said the program has had a positive impact for many people in his community, noting 6,600 people from the Manchester area have coverage through expansion...Other supporters noted the state would see an influx of about $1 billion into the state’s economy over the two years the program would be extended.And they said the plan is not a referendum on the Affordable Care Act...Opponents said instead of a plan designed for New Hampshire, the bill would allow federal bureaucrats to make key decisions, while increasing the federal debt.The program has not done what was promised, reduced health costs and insurance premiums, nor improved the health of those on the program...Rep. Frank Edelblut, R-Wilton, said the plan is a classic case of kicking the can down the road while failing to address the real problem.“We all support a safety net,” the freshman lawmaker said during House debate. “But I do not support a security fence that locks people into a stasis of poverty.”..House Bill 1696 would extend the New Hampshire Health Protection Program for two years until Dec. 31, 2018, with insurance companies and hospitals kicking in $37 million of the $51 million the state would pay once the federal government stops paying 100 percent Jan. 1, 2017...The proposal includes a work requirement similar to the Temporary Aid for Needy Families Program, which would require someone to work 30 hours, do community service or be in a job training or higher-education program...To discourage the use of emergency rooms for routine medical care, an $8 co-pay would be charged for the first non-emergency visit and $25 for subsequent visits.The program would end if the federal government fails to provide its promised contribution or if the hospitals or insurers fail to make their payments...Most of the criticism of the Republican plan to continue health coverage for about 47,000 state residents came from GOP lawmakers who said state taxpayers could ill afford to commit scarce dollars to a program that has failed to deliverer on its promises...grayno@unionleader.com..
