Houusoo, pronounced \u201cHo-sah,\u201d is Chief Little Raven, according to the Boulder Daily Camera. The Arapaho allegedly spent winters in Boulder and the renaming of the dorms are meant to honor the area\u2019s original inhabitants, officials said.\n\nIn an email to ICTMN, CU Spokesman Ryan Huff said the university believes the names Niwot Hall and Little Raven Hall will be more easily recognizable to all parties on campus.\n\n\u201cWe suggested these names to the Regents last week because we believe they will be more easily recognized and referenced to by students, visitors and emergency responders,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cPer guidance from the Regents, we will continue working with the descendants and other interested parties to make the best recommendation that honors their ancestors.\u201d\n\nDescendant of Chief Little Raven Ava Hamilton has been working with the university on the renaming of the dorms, the Daily Camera reports. And although Hamilton allegedly ponders why both English and Hinono\u2019ei spellings weren\u2019t suggested for use, she is still appreciative of the recognition.\n\n\u201cAt least their intentions are really good to name and recognize the people who once lived in this area and whose land and homeland this is,\u201d Hamilton told the Daily Camera.\n\nIn a letter to the University Planning Board, Native American professors and faculty involved in the renaming urged the university to use the traditional Hinono\u2019ei spelling.\n\n\u201cWe also want to be clear that using the Native names in the Arapaho/Hinonon\u2019ei language is absolutely vital, in order for CU Boulder to follow current practices in naming buildings to honor Native peoples,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cNeither phonetic spellings (Hosa, Niwot) nor literal translations (Little Raven, Left Hand) of these options seems culturally sensitive and attuned to the unique political status of Native Americans and Arapahos in Colorado, specifically.\u201d\n\nFor the Native American student body on campus, there is an issue of accuracy.\n\nJesse Zamora, Rar\u00e1muri (Tarahumara), a junior and a member of the Oyate Native American Student Organization at CU Boulder, told ICTMN that it\u2019s widely expected of a university to be as accurate as possible in all matters and he wonders why administrators would be so blatantly inaccurate with the translations.\n\nLittle Raven is the literal English translation of Houusoo, yet Niwot, he said, is a mispronounced phonetic version of Nowoo3.\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a bit disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I believe the university is at fault for this. I understand that they are trying to simplify it. At an academic institution, you would expect accuracy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zamora, there is currently a dorm on campus named for the Cheyenne and Arapaho people, aptly named Cheyenne Arapaho Hall. But, he said, students there have \u201cbastardized\u201d the name and refer to the building as \u201cShy-Ho.\u201d He said he\u2019s concerned the same offensive name clipping will happen with Niwot and Little Raven halls.\n\nZamora said regarding the renaming of the new dorms, he feels the university is \u201cstepping away from a chance to demonstrate cultural sensitivity\u201d and accuracy.\n\n\u201cI still see it as a lack of respect. It\u2019s in right direction, but it\u2019s not on target. It\u2019s not on point. If they really, truly want to respect the people who lived here in the Boulder area they should use the proper spelling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two new dormitories on the University of Colorado Boulder campus will not be renamed using traditional Arapaho Hinono\u2019ei spelling.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/29/cu-boulder-wont-be-renaming-dorms-using-arapaho-spellings-156633", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/kittredge-complex-university-of-colorado.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "CU-Boulder Won\u2019t Be Renaming Dorms Using Arapaho Spellings"}, "abstract": "Two new dormitories on the University of Colorado Boulder campus will not be renamed using traditional Arapaho Hinono\u2019ei spelling.", "dc": {"title": "CU-Boulder Won\u2019t Be Renaming Dorms Using Arapaho Spellings"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/29/cu-boulder-wont-be-renaming-dorms-using-arapaho-spellings-156633", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "University of Colorado-Boulder, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Native American language, Native American students", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-29T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "CU-Boulder Won\u2019t Be Renaming Dorms Using Arapaho Spellings"}, "article_summary": "Two new dormitories on the University of Colorado Boulder campus will not be renamed using traditional Arapaho Hinono\u2019ei spelling, university officials said.\nAt an academic institution, you would expect accuracy.\u201dAccording to Zamora, there is currently a dorm on campus named for the Cheyenne and Arapaho people, aptly named Cheyenne Arapaho Hall.\nThe Arapaho allegedly spent winters in Boulder and the renaming of the dorms are meant to honor the area\u2019s original inhabitants, officials said.\nLittle Raven is the literal English translation of Houusoo, yet Niwot, he said, is a mispronounced phonetic version of Nowoo3.\nHouusoo, pronounced \u201cHo-sah,\u201d is Chief Little Raven, according to the Boulder Daily Camera."}
