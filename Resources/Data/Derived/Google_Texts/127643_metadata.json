Max Baucus. But where exactly does Zinke hope to lead Montana in Congress?\n\nHe\u2019s said he\u2019s pro-life and pro-gun. He wants to abandon Obamacare and boost American production of oil, gas and coal. He\u2019s blasted government regulation for \u201csmothering\u201d business. He\u2019s said he wants to improve Montana\u2019s infrastructure, even its cell phone service.\n\n\u201cIraq has better cell phone coverage than Montana,\u201d Zinke said.\n\nFrom war to politics\n\nHe knows about Iraq. In his 23 years as a Navy Seal, Zinke fought there, overseeing special operations, winning two Bronze Stars for combat and suffering wounds. Before that he oversaw missions in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo. In the 1990s, he served with Seal Team Six, the group that killed Osama bin Laden three years after Zinke\u2019s retirement.\n\nA fifth-generation Montanan who starred in football at the University of Oregon, Zinke returned to his hometown of Whitefish in 2008 with his wife and three children. He started a consulting business that deals with aerospace, oil and gas, and national security.\n\nHe began a political career, serving one term in the Montana Senate, where he chaired the Education Committee and was known as a moderate who sought compromise on subjects like school funding and workers\u2019 compensation reform.\n\n\u201cHe consistently put his conscience and constituents above his caucus\u2019 position,\u201d said Sen. Llew Jones, a Conrad Republican.\n\nIn 2012, Zinke lost a race for lieutenant governor but when Congressman Steve Daines decided to run for the U.S. Senate, Zinke joined four other Republicans in the race to replace him.\n\nSurviving the primary\n\nIt was a tough campaign. His claim to be the \u201cright conservative for Montana\u201d drew fire from rivals who questioned his stance on abortion, saying he was less of a pro-life stalwart than he appeared.\n\nThey attacked his record on gun control, noting that he had once supported background checks, scored a mediocre rating from the National Rifle Association\u2019s Victory Fund in 2008, and had qualms about civilians owning .50-caliber rifles.\n\nCritics also questioned Zinke\u2019s role in a Super PAC he formed to support Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. He quit as the chairman of Special Operations for America PAC before announcing his candidacy for Congress, but his campaign has since collected more than $175,000 from the group.\n\nSeveral groups want the Federal Election Commission to investigate whether Zinke and SOFA coordinated those donations, which would violate FEC rules.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t coordinate, and those allegations are absolutely political B.S.,\u201d Zinke said.\n\nHe also was criticized for releasing some, but not all, of his military records, and he admitted that the Navy made him repay $211 he charged it for making a recruiting trip to Montana in the 1990s.\n\nZinke won the five-way primary, though two of every three Republicans voting chose another candidate.\n\n\"A lot of Republicans supported other candidates in the primary who were perceived to be more conservative,\u201d said professor David Parker, a political scientist at Montana State University. \u201cSo some are less than thrilled with Zinke and are still getting comfortable with him.\"\n\nOn to November\n\nZinke has spent much of the campaign since stressing leadership and explaining his positions to independent voters, who will likely decide the race\u2019s outcome.\n\nHe said he\u2019s pro-life, but supports pregnancy education and prevention programs, including access to contraceptives. Despite his personal beliefs, he said, the U.S. Supreme Court has legalized abortions, so abortion shouldn\u2019t be a congressional issue. \u201cThe court has ruled, and I respect the court,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the American process.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s called for abandoning Obamacare like a \u201csinking ship.\u201d He says the law discourages business from adding jobs, though likes its coverage of pre-existing conditions and extended coverage for young people.\n\nZinke, who\u2019s on the board of a company that improves the performance of oil and gas pipelines, also stresses the need to make America energy independent.\n\nHe supports completion of the Keystone XL pipeline, saying it would be the safest ever built \u201cIt is about making this country energy independent, which is about jobs,\u201d Zinke said.\n\nZinke acknowledges climate change and that humans are an influence, but said the research is inconclusive. \u201cYou don\u2019t dismantle American power and our energy sources on a maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou work to make it cleaner.\u201d\n\nIf elected\n\nIf elected, Zinke said he would put America\u2019s interests ahead of partisan politics. \u201cJust because it\u2019s a Republican bill doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right bill,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Jones, a Republican, said Zinke had a legislative reputation for independence. \u201cHe consistently put his conscious and constituents above his caucus\u2019s position,\u201d Jones said.\n\nJones predicted Zinke\u2019s experience would make him a good leader for Montana. \u201cThey say the past is a good prediction for the future, and to date, he\u2019s stepped up to a number of leadership roles,\u201d Jones said.\n\nLeadership and experience remain the twin drumbeats of Zinke\u2019s mission as the campaign races toward Election Day.\n\nOne of his TV ads opens with a photograph of Zinke among members of his Navy Seal team in 1988. The ad then explains that, John Lewis, the 36-year-old Democratic nominee, spent that year in the fifth grade. Lewis rankles at the implication, saying ideas matter more than years.\n\nBut Zinke isn\u2019t backing off. \u201cMy experience is extensive,\u201d he said. \u201cHis experience is not.\u201d\n\n--By KACI FELSTET\n\nUM School of Journalism", "article_metadata": {"category": "Montana News", "description": "You\u2019ve seen Ryan Zinke\u2019s ads, the ones with the medals, the flags and the tall, square-jawed candidate in combat fatigues or the dress uniform of a Navy", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://mtpr.org/post/house-hopeful-ryan-zinke-banks-experience-leadership", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kufm/files/styles/medium/public/201410/Zinke1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "You\u2019ve seen Ryan Zinke\u2019s ads, the ones with the medals, the flags and the tall, square-jawed candidate in combat fatigues or the dress uniform of a Navy", "title": "House Hopeful Ryan Zinke Banks On Experience, Leadership"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@mtpublicradio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "UM School of Journalism", "wordCount": 1121, "dc": {"title": "House Hopeful Ryan Zinke Banks On Experience, Leadership"}, "nid": 25767, "datePublished": "2014-10-10", "story_id": 355120436, "keywords": "2014 elections, Ryan Zinke, Montana politics, John Lewis, Llew Jones", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In his 23 years as a Navy Seal, Zinke fought there, overseeing special operations, winning two Bronze Stars for combat and suffering wounds.\nOne of his TV ads opens with a photograph of Zinke among members of his Navy Seal team in 1988.\n\u201cIraq has better cell phone coverage than Montana,\u201d Zinke said.\nJones predicted Zinke\u2019s experience would make him a good leader for Montana.\nYou\u2019ve seen Ryan Zinke\u2019s ads, the ones with the medals, the flags and the tall, square-jawed candidate in combat fatigues or the dress uniform of a Navy Seal."}
