The woman told police that Saxton, a relative of her boyfriend, fled in her sport utility vehicle after she escaped to a nearby home.\n\nSaxton, also known as Gary Zarders, also is suspected of kidnapping a second woman in New Orleans before driving to Baton Rouge.\n\nSaxton arrived at Baton Rouge General Medical Center with a pregnant woman who accused him of kidnapping her, according to Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola. The woman was complaining of complications from her pregnancy, Coppola said.\n\nCoppola said Saxton was handcuffed behind his back when he fatally shot himself with a gun that he apparently hid in a seat before hospital security searched and detained him.\n\n\"He was sitting in a chair. He was in a waiting area\" with security guards but nobody else when he shot himself around 5 a.m., Coppola said.\n\nCoppola said the shooting occurred before Baton Rouge police officers arrived at the hospital.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police: Cuffed kidnap, carjack suspect fatally shoots self - AP News: BATON ROUGE, La.
