After a fruitless search, the duo decided their only option was to buy something they could turn into the perfect space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's when they found the Skyway building: A mile from I-25 and right off Highway 119. Perfect for shipping. Twenty thousand square feet of potential.\n\n\"It was a blank slate for us to do whatever we want to do with it,\" said Ross Eggers.\n\nSo they went to work, adding 7,8000 square feet of warehouse space and more than 10,000 square feet of refrigerated storage space \u2014 a hot commodity in the food business. They planned for six separate manufacturing areas, with shared break rooms, locker rooms and conference rooms.\n\nIt was an 'If you build it, they will come' approach, prepping a space before hunting for tenants. And it worked.\n\nMcHugh was the first to hop on board, in January, right after construction began. Keen One followed in April; Bhakti signed on in late September. Leases for Pie in the Sky and Simply Dara's were signed in December.\n\n'Very limited options' in Boulder\n\nWorking with a co-packer in Denver while hunting for a space of his own, McHugh came up against the same problems the brothers Eggers had \u2014 too few options for too much money.\n\n\"We just couldn't get the caliber of production facility we were looking for (at a good) price,\" McHugh said.\n\nFiona's Natural Foods packager Anitra Schlieker (CQ) boxes up retail packages of granola in the production facility at Skyway Foods on Tuesday.

Smaller spaces (like those sought after by nascent food companies) command even higher rates.\n\n\"Longmont's market is not as tight\" \u2014 closer to 10 percent vacancy for \"quality space,\" Crabtree said. And rates are more affordable: roughly $8 to $10 per square foot.\n\nThose savings make the long trek to east Longmont more attractive, particularly for a quality space.\n\n\"I initially told (Jarrett) he was crazy: It was so far out there,\" McHugh said. \"But (the planned building) was so much nicer than anything we'd seen. We decided on the spot\" to move in.\n\nTim Conarro, owner of Longmont Commercial Real Estate, said that the \"slim pickings\" among industrial space are motivating more of his clients to buy vacant land and build, noting that a number of lots are available in Weld County, between County Line Road and I-25.\n\n\"People are not finding what they need,\" Conarro said. \"The existing inventory is so low that more people are looking into buying land and building.\"\n\nThe Eggers already have plans for another, smaller facility on an adjacent two-acre lot. And they have eyes on surrounding land for future expansion.\n\n\"Hopefully, there's five more buildings in the next five years,\" said Ross Eggers. \"The natural food (trend) seems to be continuing, and we hope it does.\"\n\nFiona's Natural Foods packager Anitra Schlieker (CQ) boxes up retail packages of granola in the production facility at Skyway Foods on Tuesday.

When you have manufacturers who are all mission-aligned working out of the same building, it seems to create a lot of good energy.\"\n\nSharing space also paves the way for most cost savings when speciality equipment is needed. When Veggie Gos needed a metal detector, it borrowed time on Fiona's instead of buying its own.\n\n\"We're all at different stages and have different strengths, so we can crowd source a solution,\" McHugh said. Plus, he added, \"It's really good to have landlords that are on the same page as your company.\"\n\nThe Eggers love their new role as lessors.\n\n\"As we've gotten into this more and more, we decided we like servicing this industry and providing space that doesn't exist,\" said Jarrett Eggers. \"We're building a community of like-minded people that have the same interests.\"\n\nIf things go according to plan, that community will keep on growing.\n\n\"There's so many entrepreneurs in this industry coming out of the area,\" Ross Eggers added. \"Just to be able to pull them into one area would be incredible.\"\n\nShay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/shayshinecastle", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2016-01-02T09:00:29-0700", "byline": "By Shay CastleStaff", "sailthru.author": "By Shay Castle \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "East of Longmont on Highway 119, surrounded by car dealerships and auto shops, two brothers are putting the finishing touches on what they hope will become the new epicenter of natural foods in Boulder County.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29331747:view"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "East of Longmont on Highway 119, surrounded by car dealerships and auto shops, two brothers are putting the finishing touches on what they hope will become the new epicenter of natural foods in Boulder County.", "title": "In east Longmont, an industrial-strength natural foods sector is sprouting"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "East of Longmont on Highway 119, surrounded by car dealerships and auto shops, two brothers are putting the finishing touches on what they hope will become the new epicenter of natural foods in Boulder County.", "title": "In east Longmont, an industrial-strength natural foods sector is sprouting", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1231/20151231__03DCBPHUBw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-02T09:00:29-0700", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "sailthru.title": "In east Longmont, an industrial-strength natural foods sector is sprouting", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "modificationDate": "2015-12-31T17:20:36-0700", "endDate": "2025-12-31T17:10:46-0700", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-12-31T17:22:18-0700"}, "article_summary": "Fiona's Natural Foods packager Anitra Schlieker (CQ) boxes up retail packages of granola in the production facility at Skyway Foods on Tuesday.\n'A blank slate'The lack of adequate, affordable space was what pushed brothers Jarrett and Ross Eggers, owners of Fiona's Natural Foods, out east.\n\"The natural food (trend) seems to be continuing, and we hope it does.\"\nBut the businesses who have divvied up the nearly 50,000 square-foot former post office sorting facility are Boulder County through and through.\n\"We decided it was time to make a move, and we started looking around Boulder, Longmont, Denver and just were not finding any quality food production spaces.\""}
