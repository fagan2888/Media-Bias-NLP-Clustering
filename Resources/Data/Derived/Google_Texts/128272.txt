After news broke that Sen. Ted Cruz could walk away from Louisiana’s March 5 primary with more delegates than Donald Trump—despite losing to him—anyone could’ve predicted that Trump would threaten to sue over it.

Sure enough, the real estate mogul took to Twitter on Sunday to promise that a lawsuit is indeed coming.

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2016

Cruz lost to Trump in The Bayou State by 3.6 percentage points. At the time, both walked away with 18 delegates, but after Rubio dropped out of the race, his five delegates became free agents. Furthermore, Louisiana has five unbound delegates who are free to support the candidate of their choosing—in this case, they’re more likely to back Cruz. Thus, it was reported last week that Cruz could end up winning 10 more delegates than Trump.

Trump took issue with that, however.

“Welcome to the Republican Party,” he said on ABC’s “This Week." “What’s going on in the Republican Party is a disgrace.”

"I won Louisiana and now I hear he's trying to steal delegates," Trump said, referring to Cruz.

"I have so many more votes and so many more delegates," Trump continued. "And, frankly, whoever at the end, whoever has the most votes and the most delegates should be the nominee."

Despite Trump’s fury over the fate of those Louisiana delegates, Cruz gaining the additional 10 delegates would not amount to “stealing” as the businessman suggests. It’s just the name of the game--something Cruz spokesman Ron Nehring had to remind him of on Sunday evening.
