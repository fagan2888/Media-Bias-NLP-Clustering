EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- Question: Do TRICARE beneficiaries meet health care requirements established by the Affordable Care Act, also known as the health care reform law?



Answer: In most instances, yes.



The Affordable Care Act requires individuals to maintain basic health care coverage called minimum essential coverage. This is the type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE and certain other coverage programs.



If you're using any of the following health plans, you have the minimum essential coverage required by the health care reform law:



- TRICARE Prime

- TRICARE Prime Remote

- TRICARE Prime Overseas

- TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

- TRICARE Standard and Extra

- TRICARE Standard Overseas

- TRICARE For Life

- TRICARE Reserve Select (if purchased)

- TRICARE Retired Reserve (if purchased)

- TRICARE Young Adult (if purchased)

- US Family Health Plan



Unless you're considering other health coverage, you don't need to take any action at this time.



For Tax Year 2015



· The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) will report your health care coverage to the IRS
