To date, the program has produced an estimated $840 million in energy savings.\n\n\u201cWe know that we can cost-effectively drive reductions of 20 to 30 percent in our energy use,\u201d said Maria Vargas, senior program adviser in the DOE\u2019s office of energy efficiency and renewable energy. \u201cAchieving national progress starts at the local level.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Housing Authority has invested $10 million in solar photovoltaic systems at seven housing developments and $35 million in energy-efficiency improvements at 18 properties. The projects will save a projected $2.5 million annually.\n\nNorth Lincoln Homes resident Eddie Chavez said that even though he realizes no personal gain \u2014 his electric bill is covered in his monthly rent \u2014 he is happy with the DHA\u2019s energy initiative.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real good program,\u201d he said.\n\nJerry Tinianow,\n\nDenver\u2019s chief sustainability officer, noted that Denver recently was ranked No. 10 among big U.S. cities for energy efficiency by the Washington, D.C.-based American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver solar, energy-efficiency programs touted by federal officials", "title": "Denver solar, energy-efficiency programs touted by federal officials", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/08/denver-solar-energy-efficiency-programs-touted-by-federal-officials/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150608__20150609_A11_BZ09HUDTOUR1p1.jpg", "height": 383}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150608__20150609_A11_BZ09HUDTOUR1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-08T16:48:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T09:07:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Green Business"}, "article_summary": "The focus of Castro\u2019s attention was a $2.5 million solar generation and energy-efficiency program at the Denver Housing Authority\u2019s North Lincoln Homes campus southwest of downtown.\n10 among big U.S. cities for energy efficiency by the Washington, D.C.-based American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\nWith a backdrop of shimmering rooftop solar panels, government officials gathered Monday to extol an energy-saving initiative at a Denver low-income housing project.\n\u201cAchieving national progress starts at the local level.\u201dThe Denver Housing Authority has invested $10 million in solar photovoltaic systems at seven housing developments and $35 million in energy-efficiency improvements at 18 properties.\nNorth Lincoln Homes resident Eddie Chavez said that even though he realizes no personal gain \u2014 his electric bill is covered in his monthly rent \u2014 he is happy with the DHA\u2019s energy initiative."}
