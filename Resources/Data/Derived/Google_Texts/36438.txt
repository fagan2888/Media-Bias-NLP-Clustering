School management can not be compelled to give admission: Madras High Court

Dismissing a petition filed by the father of a girl who scored 489 out of 500 in the class X examination, seeking a direction to the school management to admit his daughter in class XI, Justice S Vaidhyanathan said the school authorities were right in denying admission for her girl, who was allegedly" disobedient and disrespectful".

MADURAI: The Madras High Court today ruled that a school management could not be compelled to admit a student if it is not satisfied with the pupil's character and discipline even though he or she is meritorious.

"Teachers are the best judges" to evaluate the character of a student and not parents, the judge said.

"Education was the panacea for all the evils in the world, but education without moral values and behaviour will definitely vouchsafe reversal attitude. Knowledge was not given but earned and character was not granted but cultivated over the years," the court observed.

The court could not compel the management to admit the girl as the school had stated that their institution was known for integrity, discipline, values and virtues.

If the student got admission on the court orders, she would not feel comfortable. There would not be a healthy atmosphere in the school for both the student and the teachers, the judge said.
