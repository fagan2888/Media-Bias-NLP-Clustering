State\u2019s Cat Barber was busted in an unguarded moment directing a cutting remark at President Barack Obama.\n\nBarber was caught by TV cameras saying \u201cWhat \u2026 (is) wrong with Barack Obama\u201d to his teammates in the locker room.\n\nObama had picked Villanova to reach the NCAA Tournament championship game. But the Wolfpack busted his bracket and countless others with a 71-68 win over the Wildcats on Saturday night.\n\nObama correctly guessed that Villanova and N.C. State would each win its first tournament game. He picked Kentucky to win it all.\n\nThe Wolfpack will play Louisville or Northern Iowa in the East Regional semifinals on Friday in Syracuse, New York.\n\nBarber tweeted later in the night that his comment was all in good fun.\n\n\u201cGood team win tonight and Yall know I loveeee Obama HONEST!!\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Wildcats (33-3) saw a 16-game winning streak end and have not reached the second weekend since 2009.\n\nThe Wildcats \u2014 who the national championship in 1985 as the No. 8 seed \u2014 came up empty after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament opener.\n\n\u201cI know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again,\u201d coach Jay Wright said. \u201cWe have to own that. But it\u2019s not going to define us within our program. It\u2019s going to define us outside of our program and we accept that.\u201d\n\nN.C. State was back in the Sweet 16 for only the third time since 1989 (2012, 2005). The Wolfpack hadn\u2019t defeated a top seed since that memorable night in 1983 when they upset Houston.\n\nWins this season over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville in ACC play let them know they could knock off the elite. When it mattered most, they pulled off their signature win under coach Mark Gottfried.\n\n\u201cWe respect Villanova, but we\u2019ve seen good teams,\u201d Gottfried said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of them in our conference. You see them about every night. So a league like that prepares you for games like tonight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NC State shocks Villanova; Notre Dame wins with heavy heart", "title": "NC State shocks Villanova; Notre Dame wins with heavy heart", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NC State shocks Villanova; Notre Dame wins with heavy heart", "title": "NC State shocks Villanova; Notre Dame wins with heavy heart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/nc_state_shocks_villanova_notre_dame_wins_with_heavy_heart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ncaa-butler-notre-dame-basketball.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NC State shocks Villanova; Notre Dame wins with heavy heart", "title": "NC State shocks Villanova; Notre Dame wins with heavy heart", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ncaa-butler-notre-dame-basketball.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dan Gelston", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbfa\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Thirty years after its improbable national championship, Villanova was on the wrong side of a massive March upset.\nObama correctly guessed that Villanova and N.C.
