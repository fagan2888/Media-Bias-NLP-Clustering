My strong suspicion is that if the ACA has an impact on the labor force (which it probably will) it will be through a different mechanism. Right now "in order to qualify for health benefits" is a very good reason to work full-time, even if you'd rather have more free time and less money at your current wage level. The Affordable Care Act will make this benefit qualification rationale less compelling, and for families who are within the range for ACA subsidies it will also make the trade of more free time for less money more attractive. Which is to say that rather than making employers more reluctant to hire, the ACA is likely to make workers more reluctant to workâ€”especially more reluctant to work long hours for meager wages in unpleasant conditions.
