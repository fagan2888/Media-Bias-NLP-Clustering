Jones\n\n[email protected]\n\nLaGRANGE \u2014 Before announcing they were eyeing a partnership with Marietta-based health care system WellStar, West Georgia Health officials promised they would keep the public informed when the time came.\n\nAbout two dozen people sat in the rear rows of an auditorium at the Enoch Callaway Cancer Clinic on Tuesday during a public forum as WGH CEO Jerry Fulks laid out why WGH is hoping to partner with WellStar and how that could impact the local hospital and people of Troup County.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown, according to Fulks:\n\n\u2022 The proposed WGH-WellStar deal is not a sale of the hospital, but a merger in which WGH would remain relatively autonomous, but fall under the umbrella of WellStar\u2019s $1.8 billion network. WellStar\u2019s board would act as the parent and hold reserve powers over WGH.\n\n\u2022 WGH\u2019s board of trustees still would remain intact with the addition of WellStar representatives. One WGH board member also would be appointed to WellStar\u2019s parent board.\n\n\u2022 WGH would make up about 10 percent of WellStar\u2019s overall assets if the deal goes through. Being part of WellStar would give WGH access to its network, including legal services and other administrative perks.\n\n\u2022 The proposed deal has become necessary because of the increasing cost of the delivery of health care under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act \u2013 commonly called Obamacare.\n\n\u2022 One of the biggest shifts WGH has seen in recent years is a complete flip in the levels of inpatient versus outpatient care. The hospital is also grappling with changes in government Medicare reimbursements. Under Obamacare, hospitals\u2019 reimbursements are tied to the quality of care they provide patients, as well as patient satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 The proposed WGH-WellStar deal would make the local hospital\u2019s balance sheet stronger, enabling it to continue its mission.\n\n\u201cThis is a partnership, not a purchase,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cThey (WellStar) will merge our assets into theirs to make it a stronger company.\u201d\n\nThe proposed merger is a two-way street, though, Fulks added. WellStar is interested in a partnership with WGH because of its \u201cquality of excellence, financial performance and the credentials of its staff and services,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal is still in its early phases and has not been completed. Fulks likened the process to a marriage.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re dating,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we (sign the final agreement) is when we get married.\u201d\n\nThat period of dating began May 19 and is slated to last 90 days, after which any tentative agreement would head to the state attorney general\u2019s office for review. That review period could take between 90 and 120 days, Fulks said.\n\nAfter Fulks finished his prepared presentation, he took questions from audience members.\n\nOne attendee, former state Rep. Jeff Brown, questioned why WGH hasn\u2019t released its most recent IRS 990 forms, which would give a clearer, more complete picture of the hospital\u2019s financial standings. The 990 forms are required filings for all nonprofits and are publicly available. They detail revenue, expenses, compensation and other financial data.\n\nThe 990 forms are due five months and 15 days after the end of the nonprofits\u2019 fiscal year, which means WGH\u2019s 990s would have been due on February 15.\n\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t seen any details in 21 months, really,\u201d Brown noted.\n\nAccording WGH marketing director Jan Nichols, the only outstanding 990 that WGH has not yet filed is for fiscal year 2014, which closed on Sept. 30, 2014. \u201cIt is not late,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cRather, (WGH has) requested an extension, which is usual and routine as indicated by the last few years filing and signature dates. The official due date is Feb. 15, 2015 and was extended to Aug. 15, 2015. That\u2019s 11 months, not 21 months.\u201d\n\nWGH\u2019s fiscal year 2013 tax return was filed on Aug. 8, 2014, Nichols said.\n\nFulks said the compilation of the 990 forms is complex, and requires data from a myriad of sources. He, nor his legal council who was at the forum, were sure why the 990s hadn\u2019t been made available yet.\n\nAnother attendee questioned why the strategic planning subcommittee, which sought potential partners and oversaw the search process, was made entirely of white men, none of whom are physicians.\n\nFulks countered that first, to serve on the strategic planning subcommittee, the member would have to already have been on WGH\u2019s trustee board. Of that board, three members are physicians and have a financial interest in any potential merger or sale of the hospital, which immediately disqualified them from serving on the subcommittee, he said.\n\nAfter the disqualification of the physicians, only one woman was among the six other trustees. That woman had joined the board only months prior and \u201cwas not up to speed,\u201d Fulks said. Of the remaining five, four were chosen.\n\nFulks said the public hearing, which lasted about an hour, would be the final forum WGH would hold regarding its proposed partnership, although the state attorney general\u2019s office would hold a public hearing if the proposed WGH-WellStar makes it that far.\n\nFulks told the audience he wasn\u2019t sure when that hearing would be held, but it would occur within the 90 to 120 period of review by the attorney general. A location has not been set, but Fulks said it would likely occur in LaGrange.\n\nAnyone seeking more information or wanting to ask questions about the proposed merger may visit www.wghealth.org and click on the WellStar Partnership link under the About Us tab at the top of the page.\n\n\u2014 This article updated on Wednesday, July 1, 2015 at 2:56 p.m. to reflect a clarification regarding WGH\u2019s IRS 990 filings.\n\nTyler H.
