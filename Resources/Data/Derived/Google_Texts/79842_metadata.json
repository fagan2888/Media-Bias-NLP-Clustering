These are not the signs of a successful program.\n\nIn its latest enrollment report, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says 9.9 million were still enrolled in ObamaCare exchange plans.\n\nThat\u2019s almost 2 million fewer than the administration claimed in the spring, when it bragged that 11.7 million had signed up, and way below the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s earlier forecast of 13 million.\n\nAnd if this year is anything like last year, that 9.9 million will dwindle further as the year goes on.\n\nYear-over-year growth isn\u2019t terribly impressive, either. The CBO had figured sign-ups would almost double this year. Instead, they climbed 24%, when you compare the latest figures to those the administration put out in May 2014. Enrollment in big states like California and New York is virtually unchanged.\n\nIt would appear ObamaCare isn\u2019t such a great product after all. And it\u2019s about to get much worse.\n\nEarlier this year, insurers started putting in rate requests for 2016, and in many cases they were gut-wrenchingly high \u2014 with some above 50%. Obama told the public not to worry, that state insurance regulators would knock them down to size.\n\nBut like every other promise he\u2019s made about his namesake law, this one was phony.\n\nIn state after state, insurance commissioners are approving huge rate hikes, based on the fact that the people who\u2019ve signed up for ObamaCare are older and sicker than insurers hoped.\n\nBy one estimate, the average rate hike in Oregon \u2014 a state that eagerly embraced ObamaCare \u2014 is above 24%. Average approved rates are 20% or higher in Alaska, Idaho, Iowa and Kansas.\n\nAn analysis by Agile Health Insurance found almost a third of all plans being sold through the federal Healthcare.gov exchange \u2014 which covers 36 states \u2014 had double-digit rate hikes.\n\nPremiums for every plan offered in South Dakota, Delaware and West Virginia will be up by 10% or more.\n\nThese premium increases \u2014 combined with narrow provider networks and big deductibles \u2014 are sure to drive down the already low enrollment rates among the younger and healthier, and those who aren\u2019t eligible for ObamaCare subsidies.\n\nThe CBO expects 21 million will enroll in the Obama-Care exchanges next year.\n\nThat\u2019s increasingly looking like a pipe dream.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Reform: ObamaCare enrollment has fallen sharply since March, and that's before consumers confront huge rate hikes for 2016.
