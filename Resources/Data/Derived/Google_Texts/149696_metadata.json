That is a 2 percent increase from 2012, according to the IG\u2019s report.\n\nMeanwhile, the amount the Pentagon underpaid for official travel shrank from over $55 million in fiscal 2012 to the $33.5 million figure.\n\nOverall, the results are a troubling sign for the Pentagon, which has tried to crack down on such mistakes after Congress passed a law in 2010 specifically designed to reduce improper reimbursements for official travel. About 51 percent of the inaccurate reports involved per diem payments. However, the Pentagon\u2019s budget office didn\u2019t offer any reasons why per diem mistakes occurred, according to the IG report.\n\nRelated: Half a Trillion for the Pentagon?
