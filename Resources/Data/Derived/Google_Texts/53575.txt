PIMA COUNTY, AZ (Tucson News Now) – The search for lost hiker Mauricio Carreon-Maltos continues in the Sabino Canyon area where he was last known to be.

Carreon-Maltos, 28, was last seen hiking in Sabino Canyon on Friday, April 8. His family called the Pima County Sheriff’s Department that evening when they did not hear from him. The Southern Arizona Rescue Association and other rescue groups have been searching for Carreon-Maltos since then.

Helicopters from PCSD and the Arizona Department of Public Safety would normally alternate shifts during a search, but both are out at the same time to cover more ground quickly.

"They will continue to fly until they absolutely cannot," PCSD spokesman Dep. Ryan Inglett said.

SARA and mounted patrols continued the search despite the rain.

Carreon-Maltos is described as Hispanic, 5' 6" tall and weighing 160 pounds. He has brown eyes and brown/black hair. He was last seen wearing green camouflage shorts and Nike or Puma running shoes.

Anyone with information should contact the Pima County Sheriff's Department.
