Last year, auditors reported that workers were pocketing an extra $5 million of unearned pay at the Department of Homeland Security while their supervisors looked the other way.\n\nNow, another agency seems to be plagued with similar problems.\n\nRelated: DHS Winks at Workers Stealing Unearned Overtime\n\nIn a new inspector general report, auditors slammed the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for allowing workers to collect millions in overtime without having any way to verify if they should actually receive it. The IG concluded that without any way to know if the agency was paying the appropriate amount, there was likely an increased risk of \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d within the payment system.\n\nFor example, 98 percent of the overtime hours billed at the agency\u2019s mission in Afghanistan didn\u2019t get verified at all. That amounts to more than $16 million that went into employees\u2019 pockets unchecked.\n\nThe main issue, auditors said, was from the payment system software. When employees claim overtime, they aren\u2019t required to document why they qualified for it, so there was no information provided to help the agency verify it. Instead, supervisors simply approved what was requested without challenging the need for the overtime.\n\nThough agency officials acknowledged that the current payroll system could result in some problems, they stood by it, arguing that its flexibility is better for their employees. They said that adding more explanatory requirements would make it difficult for employees to collect pay in certain circumstances in a timely manner. Auditors recommended that the agency develop a strategy to coordinate better oversight of the overtime pay and USAID officials concurred.\n\nMeanwhile, offices within the Department of Homeland Security have began developing ways to curb abuse of their employees\u2019 overtime pay as well.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal government has struggled for years to ferret out employee abuse of overtim", "title": "USAID Flagged for Employee Overtime Abuse", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/16/USAID-Flagged-Employee-Overtime-Abuse", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08062012_clawbacks_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/16/USAID-Flagged-Employee-Overtime-Abuse", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08062012_clawbacks_money_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The federal government has struggled for years to ferret out employee abuse of overtim", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdeaf\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, offices within the Department of Homeland Security have began developing ways to curb abuse of their employees\u2019 overtime pay as well.\nAuditors recommended that the agency develop a strategy to coordinate better oversight of the overtime pay and USAID officials concurred.\nThe federal government has struggled for years to ferret out employee abuse of overtime pay\u2014which costs taxpayers tens of millions of extra dollars a year.\nWhen employees claim overtime, they aren\u2019t required to document why they qualified for it, so there was no information provided to help the agency verify it.\nFor example, 98 percent of the overtime hours billed at the agency\u2019s mission in Afghanistan didn\u2019t get verified at all."}
