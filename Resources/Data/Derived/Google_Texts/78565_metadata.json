Ultimately, 751 patients were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of medications produced by the drug-mixing pharmacy; of that total, 64 people died. Westborough, Mass.-based NECC and its sister business, Ameridose LLC, were shut down in 2012.\n\nIBISWorld said in a report while the compounding pharmacies \u201cexperienced negative media attention,\u201d the industry still \u201cproved to be indispensable\u201d in catering to patients\u2019 medication habits. The data provider said it expects revenue for the compounding pharmacies to increase at an annual rate of 3.6% in the next five years from a base of $7.9 billion in revenue this year, partly because a \u201cburgeoning elderly population has stimulated demand for prescriptions, including compounded medications.\u201d\n\nDrug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen said Tuesday it agreed to acquire PharMEDium in an all-cash deal valued at $2.58 billion. New York-based CD&R acquired a majority stake in PharMEDium in January 2014 at a valuation of $900 million, said a person familiar with the situation.\n\nCD&R declined to comment on the returns of its investment.\n\nBaird Equity Research described AmerisourceBergen\u2019s deal for PharMEDium as one in which the publicly traded company paid a \u201chigh valuation for a high-quality asset.\u201d\n\nIn a research note issued Tuesday, Baird said the nearly $2.6 billion sale price translates to 22.1 times PharMEDium\u2019s projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $116.5 million for 2015 and 18.9 times its $136.5 million Ebitda estimate for 2016.\n\nThe high price multiple PharMEDium garnered reflects \u201ca growth renaissance\u201d in the compounding pharmacy sector \u201cas hospitals more aggressively outsource compounded sterile needs in wake of new government regulations,\u201d Baird analysts Eric Coldwell, Evan Stover and Michael Polark said in the note.\n\nIn response of the meningitis outbreak, President Obama signed the Drug Quality and Security Act in November 2013 and enacted an overhaul of compounding oversight, forcing hospitals to have a more stringent oversight over the quality of the compounded sterile preparations they use.\n\nFrom October 2012 to September 2014, the Food and Drug Administration inspected nearly 150 compounding pharmacies, according to IBISWorld, which added a number of industry operators have exited the industry or \u201chave contended with costs related to complying with FDA standards.\u201d\n\nLake Forest, Ill.-based PharMEDium\u2014one of the largest providers of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to U.S. hospitals\u2014has experienced increasing Ebitda despite the industry turmoil.\n\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August, when the company was pursuing a listing on the public market, PharMEDium reported adjusted Ebitda of $71.2 million for 2013, up 77% from $40.1 million for 2012. Net sales for 2013 rose 42% to $293.1 million compared with year-earlier results. The company posted net sales of $209.5 million for the first six months of 2015.\n\nThe exponential increase in revenue benefited PharMEDium\u2019s previous private equity owners. Baird Private Equity\u2014which in 2003 acquired PharMEDium from Baxter International Inc. and subsequently sold a majority stake of the company to Oak Investment Partners\u2014expected a 44-times return upon its full exit, LBO Wire reported at the time.\n\nIndeed, drug-compounding businesses are drawing investors.\n\nBain Capital in August formed a new platform called QuVa Pharma Inc. and acquired the assets of the compounding pharmacy services division of Healix Inc.\n\nBelgian company Fagron NV, which counts more than a third of its business from compounding services in Europe, the U.S., Colombia and South Africa, said this month it received indications of acquisition interest and has hired investment bank J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as its financial adviser.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Clayton Dubilier & Rice\u2019s planned sale of drug-compounding company PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. for $2.58 billion reflects revived interest in compounding pharmacies.", "title": "PharMEDium a Hit for CD&R as Firms Renew Interest in Sector", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/10/08/pharmedium-a-hit-for-cdr-as-firms-renew-interest-in-sector/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR347_Pharma_P_20151008120745.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "PharMEDium a Hit for CD&R as Firms Renew Interest in Sector", "description": "Clayton Dubilier & Rice\u2019s planned sale of drug-compounding company PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. for $2.58 billion reflects revived interest in compounding pharmacies.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Clayton Dubilier & Rice\u2019s planned sale of drug-compounding company PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. for $2.58 billion reflects revived interest in compounding pharmacies.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-10-08T19:00:38-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/10/08/pharmedium-a-hit-for-cdr-as-firms-renew-interest-in-sector/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19077", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Clayton Dubilier & Rice\u2019s planned sale of drug-compounding company PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. for $2.58 billion reflects revived interest in compounding pharmacies.", "title": "PharMEDium a Hit for CD&R as Firms Renew Interest in Sector", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/10/08/pharmedium-a-hit-for-cdr-as-firms-renew-interest-in-sector/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR347_Pharma_P_20151008120745.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19077", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-10-08T19:08:03-04:00"}, "article_summary": "It also reflects revived interest in compounding pharmacies, which mix or dilute pharmaceutical agents to create hospital-grade dosage forms that aren\u2019t commercially available.\nReutersClayton Dubilier & Rice\u2019s planned sale of drug-compounding company PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. for $2.58 billion stands to land the private equity firm a nice return on its investment.\nIBISWorld said in a report while the compounding pharmacies \u201cexperienced negative media attention,\u201d the industry still \u201cproved to be indispensable\u201d in catering to patients\u2019 medication habits.\nNew York-based CD&R acquired a majority stake in PharMEDium in January 2014 at a valuation of $900 million, said a person familiar with the situation.\nThe industry faced regulatory and media scrutiny three years ago when New England Compounding Center Inc.\u2019s steroid injections were linked to a deadly meningitis outbreak."}
