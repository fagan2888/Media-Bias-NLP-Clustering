Good morning! As you’re going about your pre-Labor Day Friday, not one but two volcanoes are in the process of erupting.

In Iceland, we have the long-anticipated Bárðarbunga eruption, which began Thursday night in the form of a “small fissure eruption” that sent lava — but not ash — to the surface.

First pictures from TF-SIF show that the fissure is 900m long and around 5km from the glacier. #Bardarbunga pic.twitter.com/PjoMm332KR — Almannavarnir (@almannavarnir) August 29, 2014

So far, we’re not looking at a $5 billion disruption to air travel of the type seen in 2010: After temporarily closing the airspace directly overhead, the Iceland Met Office this morning lowered its alert level from “red” to the less-urgent “orange,” and all airports remain open.

Meanwhile, in Papua New Guinea, East New Britain Island’s Mount Tavurvur, one of the region’s most active, began spewing lava early Friday morning, sending smoke as high as 60,000 feet into the air, diverting flights, covering surrounding areas in half an inch of ash and making for some spectacular images:
