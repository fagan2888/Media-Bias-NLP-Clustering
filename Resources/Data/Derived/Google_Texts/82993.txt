ENGLEWOOD â€” Olympic swimmer Amy Van Dyken-Rouen is getting back in the pool as part of her rehabilitation.

A photo of her swimming for the first time since severing her spinal cord in an ATV crash earlier this month was posted to her Instagram account on Tuesday.

The six-time gold medalist tweeted early Tuesday that she was excited to find out she would be swimming later in the day. She found out when a nurse came in the middle of the night to change her position and immediately posted about it using the hashtag #Freedom.

On Monday, she posted a photo of herself standing up with the help of a standing frame at Craig Hospital in suburban Denver, where she arrived last week.

A June 6 ATV crash in Arizona has left the 41-year-old paralyzed just below the waist. The odds of her ever walking again are long but she has impressed her doctors and fans with her positive attitude.
