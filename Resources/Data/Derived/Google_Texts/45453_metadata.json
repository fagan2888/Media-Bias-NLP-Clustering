In 1992, the city of Berkeley, California, became the first to abolish Columbus Day, and several other California cities have followed suit. As have a number of other cities, including Seattle, Washington; St. Paul, Minneapolis; Grand Rapids and Duluth, Minnesota; and Traverse City, Michigan.\n\nFor many groups, convincing city council members to make the change has been a struggle, in large part because it requires that leaders be open to dealing with aspects of history that do not reflect the American myth every school child learns, a myth that dismisses or simply ignores the devastation colonialism inflicted on the continent\u2019s original inhabitants.\n\nRELATED: New AP US History Exam Perpetuates Lies About Native Americans\n\n\u201cThere is a reluctance on the part of some people to accept the truth about Columbus and the Doctrine of Discovery and the brutal acts that he committed,\u201d says Maylynn Warne, Pawnee/Santa Ana Pueblo, a member of the Fargo [N.D.] Native American Commission. The commission has had to make difficult compromises to write a resolution that the city council might find acceptable.\n\nClinton Alexander, an enrolled member of the White Earth Ojibwe Nation, is chair of the Fargo commission. \u201cWe looked at some existing resolutions and decided we wanted to further explain some of the points, to use our resolution as an educational document.\u201d He says the commission did not want a resolution that was merely a politically correct statement.\n\nSo the first version of the resolution talked about the things that needed to be said: \u201cgreat acts of genocide, sex trafficking, mass rape, mass murder. We really spelled it out, using references to [16th-century Dominican friar and Spanish historian] Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas and his work,\u201d Alexander explains.\n\nRELATED: Mutilation and Other Carnage: War Crimes Committed by Columbus\n\nMichael Yellow Bird, Three Affiliated Tribes, director of Tribal and Indigenous Peoples Studies and a professor of sociology and anthropology at the University of North Dakota, was called in to consult and he urged the commission to be direct.\n\nHe urged the commissioners to \u201cread some of the transcripts that de Las Cases was talking about, what happened to these children, these babies, these women, these little girls who were sold into sexual slavery. They were just taken, abducted, kidnapped and gang raped. Then they were killed and they would go out and get more. That\u2019s got to mean something. That\u2019s got to be in the story.\u201d\n\nFargo city officials were critical of the first version of the resolution, saying they felt the language was harsh and accusatory. Alexander says, \u201cWe worked with them, revised the language and made it more of a consensus draft. We lost a couple of our paragraphs that we felt really needed to be in there, but for myself, I was willing to make that compromise [because it means] that we can make this a focus for education over the next year and work toward a community that respects all people.\u201d\n\nThe Fargo City Council voted 4-1 to pass the resolution on the evening of October 12.\n\nThe federal government has proclaimed November Native American Heritage Month and a number of cities celebrate the last Friday in September as Native American Day, while others have renamed Columbus Day using terms such as Cultural Diversity Day.\n\nSome 16 states do not even recognize Columbus Day as a holiday, so why is it important that this be the particular day that becomes Indigenous Peoples Day?\n\nMelanie Yazzie, Din\u00e9, a co-founder of The Red Nation, is one of the people who worked to convince the city of Albuquerque to change the name of Columbus Day. She explains, \u201cIt is important because the second Monday in October is officially recognized nationally and even internationally as Columbus Day. As countless people have pointed out over the past decades of trying to abolish Columbus Day, it is a holiday created to celebrate the genocide of Native people. This is experienced by Native people as a violent event that has not ended. We still live under a sort of colonialism here, at least in the United States.\u201d\n\nWhile some think changing the name of a holiday should not be a priority given the many other pressing needs in Indian country, Yazzie says, \u201cSymbolic change opens the door for real material changes for the very deep-seated issues that Native people face. So when we mobilize and come together around these issues we\u2019re demonstrating that we care, that we can actually tackle the bigger issues that Native people face.\u201d\n\nAlexander sees a direct relationship between what happened 500 years ago and those bigger issues. \u201cWhen I look at disparities, such as health outcomes, in North Dakota, I have to think that is somehow related to this [history]. I want people to understand that. Let\u2019s address some of those issues, recognize past trauma and acknowledge the impact it has had, not to get lost in that, but to name it and move our community forward.\u201d\n\nOn October 7, the Albuquerque City Council passed the resolution to abolish Columbus Day and declare the second Monday in October Indigenous Peoples Day. The city joined several other municipalities that in the past two weeks have made that change, including Lawrence, Kansas; Portland, Oregon; Anadarko, Oklahoma; Olympia, Washington; Alpena, Michigan; and Bexar County, Texas.\n\nRELATED: Indigenous Peoples Day, Challenging Colonialism in Albuquerque and Beyond\n\nRELATED: Making a Promise: Monday Will Be Indigenous Peoples Day in Portland\n\nThese are victories for Indian country and for the nation as a whole. Crystal Gonzales, Three Affiliated Tribes and a descendent of the Kiowa people of Oklahoma, has been on the Fargo Native American Commission for five years. She says, \u201cWe need to be sympathetic to the people in our country [Native and non-Native alike] because they\u2019re not taught [an accurate history of colonialism]. It\u2019s not their fault. You can\u2019t fault people for not knowing what they\u2019re not taught.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 8 Myths and Atrocities About Christopher Columbus and Columbus Day\n\nRELATED: Celebrating Columbus I: The Myths Behind the Man\n\nRELATED: Celebrating Columbus II: For the Love of Larceny", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the Northern Plains to Southwestern deserts, American Indian groups are working to correct historic falsehoods, and say goodbye to Columbus Day.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/10/11/truth-telling-american-history-groups-fight-indigenous-peoples-day-162033", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/columbus-didnt-discover-america.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Truth-Telling in American History: Groups Fight for Indigenous Peoples Day"}, "abstract": "From the Northern Plains to Southwestern deserts, American Indian groups are working to correct historic falsehoods, and say goodbye to Columbus Day.", "keywords": "Tanya H.
