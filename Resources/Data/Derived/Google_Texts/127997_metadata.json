It features a pool, a basketball court, pilates studio and space for a variety of exercise and wellness programs.\n\nIt is the second health club for St. Joseph, which operates Petaluma Valley Hospital, Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital and Napa\u2019s Queen of the Valley Hospital, after the opening of a medical fitness center in Napa in 2007. The health care provider is also planning to open a third center in Newport Beach later this year as part of a joint venture with Sausalito-based Active Wellness LLC.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. Active, which entered a partnership with St. Joseph in July of 2015, will continue to manage and operate the facility, and all employees will continue under the new ownership. The company also manages the center in Napa, Synergy Medical Fitness Center.\n\n\u201cHealth care is an ever-changing field,\u201d said Todd Salnas, president of St. Joseph Health, Sonoma County, in an announcement of the deal. \u201cWith employers and consumers seeking more value from their providers, the exciting addition of this notable health club will further strengthen our position as a leader in integrated, outcomes-oriented health and fitness models.\u201d\n\nIn the announcement, St. Joseph officials described the Napa club as having been successful in decreasing the number of individuals at a higher risk of chronic disease. Patient outcomes like fewer hospital readmissions now play a significant part in the calculation of Medicare payments, giving room for providers to broaden their approach in manners outside of a traditional hospital setting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest to have anybody cycling in and out of the hospital,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of health care consumer advocacy organization Health Access California.\n\nThe purchase did not come without ruffling some feathers, as the Petaluma Health Care District, the public entity that owns the hospital and leases it to St. Joseph, had commissioned a study in 2013 that explored the feasibility of launching a similar venture capable of supplying roughly $2.27 million in annual revenue. While no concrete plans have gone forward, board member Robert Ostroff said last Wednesday that he was nonetheless surprised to \u201copen the paper\u201d to see that St. Joseph, one of four bidders to operate the hospital past 2017, was acquiring Active.\n\nThough noting the earlier study, Ramona Faith, the district\u2019s CEO, said the approach by St. Joseph was increasingly common among health care providers. The 2013 study found the club now known as Active to be the highest-ranking fitness facility in southern Sonoma County, based on measures like program variety and amenities.\n\n\u201cThey have experience in that area,\u201d she said of St. Joseph.\n\nThe facility opened as Club One in 2009 and became Active Sports in 2014.
