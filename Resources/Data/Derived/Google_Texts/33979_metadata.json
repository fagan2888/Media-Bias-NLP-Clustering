( Sasha Khokha/KQED )\n\nIt\u2019s almond season in the Central Valley, when loud mechanical harvesters with long arms grip and shake the trees, knocking down the nuts.\n\nBut the process also sends up huge dust clouds. Farm machines and trucks make multiple trips on dirt roads between fields, and that creates dust, too.\n\nThe drought has been contributing to a dust bowl in Central Valley farm country. The dust, in turn, exacerbates the region\u2019s high rates of asthma. To keep dust down, farmers usually use a watering truck, spraying the roads to knock down the dust and comply with air pollution rules.\n\nBut now, in the fourth year of a crippling drought, the approach is changing.\n\nIt\u2019s the job of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to oversee dust rules, and the district\u2019s Ryan Hyashi says farmers have been very responsive. Now the district is trying to balance competing tensions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s potable water that they\u2019re usually putting on these roads,\u201d Hyashi says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have water to drink, and we\u2019re putting it on roadways. It sends a poor message.\u201d\n\nInstead, the air district is encouraging farmers to limit access to dirt roads, or cover them with things like gravel. If those options won\u2019t work, farmers can now sign up for a program to avoid enforcement penalties as long as they meet certain requirements, such as not being within 1,000 feet of a school or hospital.\n\n\u201c[Farmers] want to do their part and be good stewards,\u201d says Hayashi. But if there\u2019s no water for dust control, they may \u201cjust have no alternative.\u201d\n\nBut air quality advocates say the air district is essentially giving farmers a free pass to pollute.\n\n\u201cWhen we see any relaxation in the rules, we get very nervous,\u201d says Kevin Hamilton, with the Central California Asthma Collaborative.\n\nAs we\u2019re talking, Hamilton watches a cloud of dust billow up on a farm road west of Fresno.\n\n\u201cSo here goes another truck with more dust coming up,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is dangerous stuff. This is actually a health hazard.\u201d\n\nHamilton treats patients for asthma and says this kind of dust can travel for miles, ending up in people\u2019s lungs. He criticized air regulators not only for the new dust guidelines, but also that they\u2019re allowing well-drilling rigs from out of state that may have dirtier engines than California trucks.\n\n\u201cI understand that we\u2019re in an emergency,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we\u2019ve all fought so long to begin making progress here \u2014 and I feel we are making progress. At this moment, it feels like we\u2019re going to go backward again.\u201d\n\nJust a few miles away, farmer Paul Betancourt says he doesn\u2019t want his family breathing dusty air either. But he also doesn\u2019t want the dust on his almond trees because it can cause mites. Watering down the roads on his farm, he says, means he uses fewer pesticides.\n\n\u201cWe want to use less chemicals on the farm,\u201d Betancourt says. \u201cYou want us to use less chemicals on the farm. But in a year like this, when we\u2019re really short of water, it\u2019s balancing out how to keep the dust down.\u201d\n\nBetancourt\u2019s almond farm near the Fresno County town of Kerman has very fine, silty soil. For now, Betancourt says as long as he has water in his well, he\u2019ll still periodically spray down the roads. Gravel is too expensive, and road oil just doesn\u2019t work, he says.\n\n\u201cWe need to use the water carefully and keep the dust down,\u201d Betancourt said. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s still the most cost-effective way.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t plan to apply for the air district\u2019s emergency drought relief programs. Farmers who do can avoid using water to control dust through Nov. 1. After that, the valley\u2019s particulate matter season starts, and the air district says it will require farmers to use water to spray down roads again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health advocates say it's a step backward in region with soaring rates of asthma.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Drought Health Hazard: Not Enough Water to Keep Down Central Valley Dust\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/21\\/another-drought-casualty-controlling-dust-with-water-in-the-central-valley\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-21 14:42:50\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-21 17:34:49\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":65276,\"author_id\":\"254\",\"author_name\":\"Sasha Khokha\",\"author_display_name\":\"Sasha Khokha\",\"tags\":[\"air pollution\",\"asthma\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/08\\/IMG_6806-e1440192308416.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Health advocates say it's a step backward in region with soaring rates of asthma.", "title": "Drought Health Hazard: Not Enough Water to Keep Down Central Valley Dust", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/21/another-drought-casualty-controlling-dust-with-water-in-the-central-valley/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/08/IMG_6792-400x300.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KQEDSashaKhokha"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "air pollution,asthma,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbddd\"", "article_summary": "The drought has been contributing to a dust bowl in Central Valley farm country.\nTo keep dust down, farmers usually use a watering truck, spraying the roads to knock down the dust and comply with air pollution rules.\n\u201cWe need to use the water carefully and keep the dust down,\u201d Betancourt said.\n\u201cWe want to use less chemicals on the farm,\u201d Betancourt says.\nA tractor pulls a watering tank to water down dusty roads on Paul Betancourt's farm near Kerman in Fresno county."}
