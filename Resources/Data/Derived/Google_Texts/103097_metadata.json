I\u2019m curious if that fee that I\u2019m paying for my university also covers me under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway: It\u2019s probably enough if it gets you care at a hospital.\n\nMost Americans are required to have a health insurance policy next year \u2013 but not just any old policy. It has to include a minimum level of care called essential health benefits. Those include: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\n\nThe USD health center doesn\u2019t offer emergency care, hospitalizations or the full range of specialists needed to offer every essential benefit. Dr. Kimberly Woodruff, USD\u2019s lead physician, said students will need to take out a traditional insurance policy to avoid paying a fine next year.\n\nFor students at other universities, the key is to make sure they\u2019re not just paying a fee to use the campus health facility, as they would to use the student union. They should have insurance that extends beyond the campus. That can be a policy through any of the large providers (just make sure they cover doctors in your new town if you go away to college) or through a special group plan insurance companies often put together for college students.\n\nThe Orders: Pick a plan, get on Medi-Cal or take the fine.\n\nIf Rengstorf were an undergrad, I\u2019d tell her to stay on the family plan. Under the Affordable Care Act, kids can keep their parents\u2019 coverage until age 26.\n\nBut Rengstorf is 30. She\u2019ll have to go for the add-on group plan advertised by her school or sign up for Medi-Cal. Her unpaid gig as a student teacher and her husband\u2019s part-time job mean the couple qualifies for the public plan, which puts them out of the running for subsidies on the health insurance exchange.\n\nSince we\u2019re talking colleges, I should point out that residency doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to Medi-Cal as it does to universities collecting out-of-state tuition. All Rengstorf needs to do for Medi-Cal is prove she\u2019s physically present in the state and intends to stay a while, according to a California Department of Health Care Services spokesman. In other words \u2013 her apartment lease agreement will do.\n\nOf course, Rengstorf has one other option: Pay the fine. Some folks have found paying the government 1 percent of their income in lieu of getting covered makes financial sense. (The fine goes up to 2.5 percent in 2016.)\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: What if my income increases after I sign up for Obamacare?\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
