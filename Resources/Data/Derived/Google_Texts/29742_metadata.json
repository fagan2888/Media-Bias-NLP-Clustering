It is not expected to have the support of Democrats.\n\nThe Senate compromise option, sponsored by Senators Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, is expected to get widespread support from Democrats and Republicans, despite falling short of the White House request. The Senate is scheduled to vote on all three amendments Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats, including Murray, are expected to vote for the full funding option as well as the compromise to register their support for the White House proposal. Murray told reporters that her deal with Blunt is a good compromise.\n\n\u2018\u2018I continue to urge my colleagues to support the president\u2019s full request, but I am very encouraged that Democrats and Republicans will be able to come together,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe underlying spending bill, which combines funding for military construction and veterans programs with transportation and housing spending, is expected to easily pass the Senate late in the week.\n\nThe legislation faces a less certain outcome in the House where Republicans have struggled to reach any agreement on a spending blueprint and have resisted White House calls for immediate action on its Zika request.\n\nHouse Republicans say the White House should be able to use funds leftover from battling the Ebola virus to combat Zika. The administration has already tapped that account but says more funds are needed.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3708036585", "eomportal-id": 295851, "description": "The Senate\u2019s bipartisan agreement would provide $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The Senate\u2019s bipartisan agreement would provide $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus.", "title": "Senate reaches deal on Zika funding; House Republicans ready proposal - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/05/14/senate-reaches-deal-zika-funding-house-republicans-ready-proposal/3XggNcqwaRnkBlGAHlXMrI/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 07:52:05 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Zika,Senate reaches deal on Zika funding, Patty Murray, Barack  Obama,Senate, Republican Party, Washington Post, Democratic Party", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "49b0f09a-1a05-11e6-973b-f53259ae5a52", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Zika,Senate reaches deal on Zika funding, Patty Murray, Barack  Obama,Senate, Republican Party, Washington Post, Democratic Party"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans say the White House should be able to use funds leftover from battling the Ebola virus to combat Zika.\nHouse Republicans are preparing to unveil their own proposal this week that is expected to provide less than $1 billion in funding.\nDemocrats, including Murray, are expected to vote for the full funding option as well as the compromise to register their support for the White House proposal.\nThe funding package was introduced as an amendment to a spending bill that is expected to be considered this week.\nThe legislation faces a less certain outcome in the House where Republicans have struggled to reach any agreement on a spending blueprint and have resisted White House calls for immediate action on its Zika request."}
