John Barrasso (R-WY), a member of both the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Foreign Relations Committee, appeared to allege that uranium mined in the United States has illegally been taken out of the country.\n\nBarrasso went on to say that he is specifically concerned that the uranium may have been transported to Iran.\n\nRelated: An Angry Obama Blasts Democrats on Trade Deal\n\nThe claim has particular political salience at the moment because of an investigative piece published by The New York Times on Thursday that showed the Clinton Foundation, run by former President Bill Clinton and current presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, had accepted millions of dollars from foreign donors, including some in Russia, who were seeking the government\u2019s approval of a deal that would transfer the rights to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium mines to a Russian-held company.\n\nHillary Clinton was Secretary of State at the time, and her department, as well as a number of other U.S. agencies, approved the deal. Multiple approvals were required because uranium is considered an asset with national security importance\n\nUnder the deal, Russian firm Rosatom took control of a Canadian company called Uranium One. This gave Rosatom control of uranium production facilities across the globe, including about one-fifth of the capacity in the United States.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, Barrasso said that he opposed the sale back in 2010, when it was first contemplated. And said, \u201cNow you have [Russian President] Vladimir Putin owning 20 percent of American uranium \u2013 controlling that. And we know that Russia sends uranium to people who are not our friends, to our bitter enemies, including Iran.\u201d\n\nRelated: EU Dials Back Gazprom Investigation, but Still Riles Kremlin\n\nAt the time, Barrasso said, he was assured by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the Uranium would not leave the U.S.\n\nIn fact, we do know that uranium has left the United States, has gone overseas, and under the direction of Vladimir Putin.\n\nBecause of the importance of uranium to both national security and energy generation, uranium exports are tightly controlled. On Thursday, though, Barrasso claimed that that Rosatom is moving it out of the country without permission.\n\nVan Susteren asked if the Nuclear Regulatory commission had granted an export license, and Barrasso said that it had not \u2013 he had asked the NRC to alert him if a license request was submitted.\n\nRelated: Uh Oh! Congress Is \u2018Fixing\u2019 Military Retirement\n\nHad there been such a request?\n\n\u201cNot that I know, but I know that uranium has left the country. They have a number of different companies and shell organizations.\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cWhen you talk to people on the ground, uranium has left the United States. It has gone to Canada, has gone overseas.\u201d\n\nBarrasso pointed out that the U.S. still has to import uranium to satisfy nuclear power generation needs. \u201cI think there\u2019s an issue of national security as well as energy security, and I worry about Iran getting this uranium,\u201d he said.\n\nBarrasso offered no proof to back up his claim, and Van Susteren asked for none.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct a reference to Sen. Barrasso's 2010 position regarding the sale of uranium rights to a Russian company.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Wyoming Sen.
