She certainly didn\u2019t anticipate spending the next 70 years with him.\n\nMabel and her husband, Robert, celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary Sunday.\n\n\u201cI met his sister, and we became good friends,\u201d said Mabel Burrows, 88.\n\nShe began writing letters to Robert, who was overseas at the time, as a teenager.\n\n\u201cWe wrote for a year or two,\u201d she said. \u201d When he came home, we got married.\u201d\n\nThat was in March of 1946. Since then, the couple has raised six children and witnessed the birth of 17 grandchildren, 27 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.\n\n\u201cThe Lord\u2019s been good to us,\u201d said Robert Burrows, 91.\n\nThough the couple has endured its share of challenges, like caring for two disabled children, they said the keys are simple.\n\n\u201cForgiveness,\u201d Mabel said. \u201cAlways be considerate. Do what you can to try and help.\u201d\n\nMabel and Robert keep the love alive through their shared passion for travel. Just last year, they took a trip to England. And they spend every Thanksgiving with family members in Arizona.\n\nAlmost the entire family came together Sunday to celebrate their anniversary. Friends and five generations of children and grandchildren filed into the Broomfield Community Center to congratulate them.\n\nMabel and Robert have defied the odds.\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, 40 to 50 percent of all marriages end in divorce.\n\nThe couple\u2019s granddaughter, Andrea Miller,said their happy marriage is something to aspire to.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re inspiring to me,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cI would have moved mountains to be here today. When we get together, it\u2019s familiar and comfortable. It makes you feel like you\u2019re home.\u201d\n\nPat and Lou Zoghby,friends of the couple, said Mabel and Robert have always gotten along well.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s love and duty that made it work,\u201d Pat Zoghby said. \u201cThey just complement each other.\u201d\n\nKaty Canada: 303-954-1043, kcanada@denverpost.com or @KatySusanna", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broomfield couple celebrates 70 years of marriage and counting", "title": "Broomfield couple celebrates 70 years of marriage and counting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/06/broomfield-couple-celebrates-70-years-of-marriage-and-counting/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__Anniversary_1p1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__Anniversary_1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T17:50:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:42:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Mabel Burrows never expected to marry the soldier she started writing letters to on a whim during World War II .\nShe began writing letters to Robert, who was overseas at the time, as a teenager.\n\u201cI met his sister, and we became good friends,\u201d said Mabel Burrows, 88.\nIt makes you feel like you\u2019re home.\u201dPat and Lou Zoghby,friends of the couple, said Mabel and Robert have always gotten along well.\nSince then, the couple has raised six children and witnessed the birth of 17 grandchildren, 27 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren."}
