From 2 to 6 inches of snow was possible at elevations of 10,000 feet and above, with wind gusts up to 25 mph.\n\nFriday night\u2019s storm took dead aim at Loveland, even as flash-flood alerts were issued for much of the Front Range.\n\nA thunderstorm that stalled over Loveland delivered as much as 4 inches of rain to neighborhoods scattered across the community, causing severe street flooding and damage to basements and windows, the Reporter-Herald said.\n\nSome lightning strikes also were reported.\n\nMuch of last week saw hail pound the Front Range and Denver International Airport. Frontier Airlines had to ground some planes because of damage.\n\nKurtis Lee: 303-954-1655 or klee@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver metro area again hit with severe weather", "title": "Denver metro area again hit with severe weather", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/24/denver-metro-area-again-hit-with-severe-weather/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__2014-05-24-09_59_56-PHOTOS_-Denver-area-hit-by-tornadoes-hail-storms-street-floodingp1.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__2014-05-24-09_59_56-PHOTOS_-Denver-area-hit-by-tornadoes-hail-storms-street-floodingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-24T10:07:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:30:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have a lot of moisture in the atmosphere,\u201d said Kyle Fredin, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Boulder.\nThe National Weather Service said some storms produced 2 to 3 inches in less than 90 minutes, leading to flash-flood warnings.\nA flash-flood watch began at 1 p.m. Saturday and continued until midnight.\nFriday night\u2019s storm took dead aim at Loveland, even as flash-flood alerts were issued for much of the Front Range.\nMuch of last week saw hail pound the Front Range and Denver International Airport."}
