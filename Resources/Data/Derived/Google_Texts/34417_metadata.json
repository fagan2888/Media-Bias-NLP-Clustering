Janak Joshi, a doctor for over 30 years, affirmed that \u201cpatient privacy is of paramount importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the government officials we trust to keep us safe would move forward with a program that lacks the most basic protections for Americans\u2019 privacy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe institute said the bills that have been introduced establish background checks and disqualification procedures for felons seeking positions that would give them access to bank account numbers, tax information and other details.\n\nThe legislation also would let state authorities revoke Obamacare navigator grants for negligent loss of private information.\n\n\u201cWith the continued refusal of Obamacare\u2019s implementers to put identity theft safeguards into the navigators\u2019 program, Americans have no reason to believe that their privacy will be protected,\u201d said Goldwater Institute health-care policy analyst Christina Corieri, who worked with lawmakers to draft the legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s now the duty of state lawmakers to forge their own protections for citizens.\u201d\n\nMore than 120 \u201cnavigator\u201d grants have been issued in 34 states. The list of recipients is a veritable \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the left-wing political machine, including organizations with ACORN ties like Southern United Neighborhoods and the Structured Employment Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThat group, Goldwater confirmed, recently settled a $1.725 million lawsuit for fraud committed under another government program.\n\nFederal rules don\u2019t preclude groups or individuals convicted of fraud or identity theft from serving as navigators, even though navigators have unprecedented access to the financial, health, employment and identification records of private citizens.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has admitted that the Obamacare law has no way of preventing felons from being navigators.\n\nSo the bills \u2013 which also are being considered in Louisiana and South Carolina \u2013 would demand background checks and bar those with felony convictions or misdemeanors involving fraud or dishonesty.\n\nThe existence of fraud among Obamacare navigators has been documented by investigative reporter James O\u2019Keefe.\n\nHe said, \u201cLying about incomes and smoker status came natural to the navigators we encountered.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe has released a video revealing that navigators advise undercover actors to to leave cash unreported.\n\nSee the video:\n\nIt\u2019s not the only effort by the states under way .\n\nIn fact, the whole Obamacare program is in the crosshairs of a number of efforts. Missouri state Sen. John Lamping has introduced SB 546, which states that \u201cno law or rule shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system.\u201d\n\nIt provides a disincentive for health insurance carriers to cooperate with Washington\u2019s massive plans for coverage, premiums, penalties and taxes. It requires the suspension of the license on any carrier that \u201caccepts any remuneration that may result in the imposition of penalties contrary to the public policy set forth in this section.\u201d\n\nTo give the law some teeth, it adds: \u201cThe attorney general shall take such action as is provided in this subsection in the defense or prosecution of rights protected under section 1.330 and this section. It is the duty of the attorney general to seek injunctive and any other appropriate relief as expeditiously as possible to preserve the rights and property of the residents of the state of Missouri.\u201d\n\nMissouri is not the first state to consider just punching the switch on an Obamacare lights-out plan.\n\nIn South Carolina, a plan has been put forward to exempt citizens and businesses from Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt would prohibit state agencies and officers from implementing any portion of the federal mandate, outlaw state insurance exchanges and direct the state attorney general to sue over selective enforcement of the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nSupporters of the bill contend it aligns with a Founding Father\u2019s solution for states confronted by an unwarranted federal law.\n\nHouse Bill 3101, called the South Carolina Freedom of Health Care Protection Act, already has passed the House 65-34 and soon heads to the Senate.\n\nThe bill\u2019s chief sponsor, state Sen. Tom Davis, said there are several components which \u201cin my judgment are legal, effective and within the state\u2019s power to do.\u201d\n\nNow Missouri is joining the movement.\n\nAt the New American, Joe Wolverton II explained it \u201ctakes the teeth out of the Obama administration\u2019s ability under Obamacare to impose penalties on employers who take \u2026 federal subsidies.\u201d\n\nHe noted Georgia also is expected to take similar action, and the movement rests \u201con the anti-commandeering doctrine that has long been a key principle of federalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut simply, anti-commandeering prohibits the federal government from forcing states to participate in any federal program that does not concern \u2018international and interstate matters,'\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe prohibition recently was confirmed in the 1997 Mack and Printz v. United States case, he said. The case brought by two sheriffs against the Clinton administration over \u201cunconstitutional gun control measures\u201d was decided for the sheriffs at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment Center said as many as 10 more states could be on the bandwagon soon, including Oklahoma.\n\nNullification: The \u2018rightful remedy\u2019\n\nWolverton said the most potent weapon against federal encroachment of states\u2019 rights is nullification.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe states, through the exercise of the Tenth Amendment and their authority to rule as sovereign entities, may stop Obamacare at the state borders by enacting state statutes nullifying the healthcare law and criminalizing state participation in administering or executing the unconstitutional provisions thereof. Nullification is the \u2018rightful remedy\u2019 and is a much more constitutionally sound method of checking federal usurpation. It is quicker and less complicated than an attempt to have the law repealed by Congress or overturned by a future federal bench more respectful of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nMichael Maharrey, a spokesman for the Tenth Amendment Center, explains that the nullification idea already has been applied to issues ranging from gun regulation, driver\u2019s license requirements and most recently, marijuana laws. The federal government folded when Colorado and Washington states made marijuana legal, despite a ban by the federal government.\n\nThe center\u2019s model legislation for accomplishing nullification includes a rejection of the federal law, a specific act implementing the nullification and legal challenges as needed.\n\nThe idea had been promoted in a movie, \u201cNullification: The Rightful Remedy,\u201d which notes Thomas Jefferson was among the early Americans who acknowledged the strategy.\n\n\u201cHis draft of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 first introduced the word \u2018nullification\u2019 into American political life, and follow-up resolutions in 1799 employed Jefferson\u2019s formulation that \u2018nullification \u2026 is the rightful remedy\u2019 when the federal government reaches beyond its constitutional powers,\u201d it explains. \u201cIn the Virginia Resolutions of 1798, James Madison said the states were \u2018duty bound to resist\u2019 when the federal government violated the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe foundation for the idea is that states predate the union, and the Declaration of Independence speaks of \u201cfree and independent states\u201d with \u201cpower to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\u201d\n\nThus, the union does not own the states but represents and protects them and their actions.\n\nWND has reported previously on nullification, including a poll that found 29 percent of registered voters believe an \u201carmed revolution\u201d may be needed in America to restore liberties. A second poll said Americans already have figured out a solution \u2013 reject federal laws that are unconstitutional.\n\nA Washington Times editorial at the time said supporters of nullification \u201csee it as a necessary and effective tool to protect states and citizens from the every-growing power of the federal government.\u201d\n\nEven in left-leaning California, the state Senate has joined dozens of other states in approving legislation designed to prevent the president from executing the indefinite detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nFox News reported that in Missouri, a proposal declares all federal gun regulations unenforceable.\n\nMissouri state Rep. Doug Funderburk said: \u201cWe have the authority to enforce these laws. We are trying to position us so that we in this state can have safer neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nA commentary by the nonprofit tea-party group FreedomWorks noted the federal government \u201conly has about 30 enumerated powers delegated to it in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 10th Amendment, any issue not found in the U.S. Constitution should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nNow, FreedomWorks said, the United States has \u201cgone grossly astray,\u201d with the federal government \u201cinvolved in nearly every aspect of our daily lives from what foods we put into our bodies to what we\u2019re allowed to watch on television.\u201d\n\nThe earlier poll on armed revolution was by Fairleigh Dickinson University. It said that among Republicans, 44 percent think armed revolution soon might be needed.\n\nOn the general question of \u201cnullification,\u201d 44 percent believe states should have the right to block any federal laws they disagree with on legal grounds. Thirty-six percent disagree and 20 percent are undecided, the pollsters said.\n\nWeighing in on the subject, WND columnist Walter Williams argued that \u201cmoral people\u201d can\u2019t rely only on courts to determine what is right and wrong.\n\n\u201cSuppose Congress enacted a law \u2013 and the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional \u2013 requiring American families to attend church services at least three times a month,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShould we obey such a law? Suppose Congress, acting under the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause, enacted a law requiring motorists to get eight hours of sleep before driving on interstate highways. Its justification might be that drowsy motorists risk highway accidents, and accidents affect interstate commerce. Suppose you were a jury member during the 1850s and a free person were on trial for assisting a runaway slave, in clear violation of the Fugitive Slave Act. Would you vote to convict and punish?\n\n\u201cA moral person would find each one of those laws either morally repugnant or to be a clear violation of our Constitution. You say, \u2018Williams, you\u2019re wrong this time. In 1859, in Ableman v. Booth, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 constitutional.\u2019 That court decision, as well as some others in our past, makes my case. Moral people can\u2019t rely solely on the courts to establish what\u2019s right or wrong. Slavery is immoral; therefore, any laws that support slavery are also immoral. In the words of Thomas Jefferson, \u2018to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions (is) a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The authors of the federal health-care takeover known as Obamacare saw no reason to prevent felons from sitting in positions of trust in which they have access to citizens\u2019 personal and confidential information.
