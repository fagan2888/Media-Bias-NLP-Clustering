(AP) \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s Republican campaign for president is built on the same win-at-all-costs, no-second-guessing confidence that made him billions in real estate and a star of reality television.\n\nYet in a recent interview with The Associated Press, the GOP front-runner displayed rare, if fleeting, moments of humility and introspection.\n\n\u201cI think I could lose a state, sure,\u201d Trump said of the first three states to vote in next year\u2019s presidential primaries. \u201cIf I came in second or third I think that would be, you know, I wouldn\u2019t be happy, \u2019cause I want to win.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, Trump also said he might not have used the phrase \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d in his 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d The phrase has trailed Trump in the 2016 campaign, as have questions about whether his penchant for exaggeration and tenuous relationship with some facts would be appropriate for a president.\n\n\u201cI think maybe if I had that phrase to do over again, I\u2019d use the word \u2018optimistic,\u2019 perhaps. I would want to be very optimistic,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump displayed his signature bravado throughout much of the 30-minute interview with AP at his golf course in northern Virginia. He declined to name a single thing he\u2019s said over the course of the campaign that he wished he could take back. He repeatedly referenced his dominant standing in preference polls and the enthusiasm of his crowds.\n\nBut the glimmers of self-reflection and self-awareness stood out. They offered a look at a side rarely seen at Trump\u2019s rallies and television appearances.\n\nTrump unexpectedly leapt to the top of the GOP field this summer and has yet to be knocked from that perch. With less than two months until the Iowa caucuses, his hold shows no signs of slipping. But people in early states often make final decisions close to voting day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to win,\u201d Trump said, and \u201cclean the table.\u201d\n\nHistory suggests that\u2019s unlikely, even if Trump does win the nomination.\n\nIn modern history, a nonincumbent has never won all the first three early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nTrump said that while he\u2019s doing \u201cvery, very well\u201d in them, he was aware of the precedent. Even if he were to lose one, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t lose badly.\u201d\n\nHis political rise has set the party\u2019s establishment on edge. Trump draws large and enthusiastic crowds to rallies and repeatedly says things viewed by some women, racial and religious minorities, and disabled people as offensive.\n\nHe also has developed a pattern of repeating falsehoods in speeches and interviews. Among them: There are 100 million unemployed workers in the United States, and President Barack Obama plans to allow 250,000 Syrian refugees to resettle in the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Interview: Moments of humility, introspection from Trump", "title": "AP Interview: Moments of humility, introspection from Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Interview: Moments of humility, introspection from Trump", "title": "AP Interview: Moments of humility, introspection from Trump", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/ap_interview_moments_of_humility_introspection_from_trump/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/gop-2016-trump.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Interview: Moments of humility, introspection from Trump", "title": "AP Interview: Moments of humility, introspection from Trump", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/gop-2016-trump.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jill Colvin, Julie Pace and Steve Peoples", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a34\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019d like to win,\u201d Trump said, and \u201cclean the table.\u201dHistory suggests that\u2019s unlikely, even if Trump does win the nomination.\nYet in a recent interview with The Associated Press, the GOP front-runner displayed rare, if fleeting, moments of humility and introspection.\nTrump displayed his signature bravado throughout much of the 30-minute interview with AP at his golf course in northern Virginia.\nThey offered a look at a side rarely seen at Trump\u2019s rallies and television appearances.\n\u201cI think I could lose a state, sure,\u201d Trump said of the first three states to vote in next year\u2019s presidential primaries."}
