But his concern was not for, say, childhood obesity. Instead, he was protesting the company\u2019s partnership with the It Gets Better project, which seeks to combat anti-LGBT bullying among young people.\n\nLast month, Frito-Lay offered to send a bag of rainbow-coloured Doritos to anyone who donated $10 (\u00a36.59) or more to the initiative. The firm\u2019s marketing chief, Ram Krishnan, said the multi-hued comestibles demonstrated Frito-Lay\u2019s \u201ccommitment toward equal rights for the LGBT community\u201d.\n\nYet Mr Huckabee took issue with the scheme because, he said, the man who originated the It Gets Better project \u2013 sex columnist, podcaster and gay rights activist Dan Savage \u2013 had made \u201chateful and vulgar comments towards Christians.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t see how a gay bag of chips limits anyone else\u2019s religious freedom\n\nMr Savage is known for his biting criticism of gay rights opponents, particularly those on the Christian Right and in the Republican Party. Mr Huckabee, a critic of same-sex marriage and an ordained Christian minister, wrote in the letter, dated 23 September: \u201cIt is beyond me to understand how a responsible corporation would think that partnering with someone who spews the vicious vitriol that Savage does would be worthy of your corporate contributions.\u201d\n\nApparently unruffled, Frito-Lay continued the partnership, and the rainbow Doritos proved so popular that they sold out. Mr Huckabee has since joined forces with the American Renewal Project (ARP), a lobbying group of evangelical pastors, to demand a boycott of all snacks made by the company, which include not only Doritos, but also Cheetos, Fritos and Tostitos.\n\nFrito-Lay offered to send a bag of its rainbow-coloured Doritos to anyone who donated $10 or more to the It Gets Better project\n\nIn a letter sent to more than 100,000 pastors, ARP founder David Lane wrote: \u201cTolerance for Frito-Lay\u2019s brazen corporate support of hate speech by Dan Savage... is chipping away at the very character and soul of the American experience.\u201d\n\nMr Savage said the Christian group\u2019s response to the rainbow Doritos was analogous to their attitude to other gay rights issues. \u201cI don\u2019t see how a gay bag of chips limits anyone else\u2019s religious freedom,\u201d he told Time. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to live in a world without bags of gay chips, and it doesn\u2019t infringe on anyone\u2019s private beliefs.\u201d\n\nPresidential prowess?

In 2003, he struck back at anti-gay comments by the then-US Senator for Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, by introducing his surname to the lexicon of homosexual activity. Mr Savage invited his readers to choose an alternative meaning for the term \u201cSantorum\u201d, so anyone searching for the Senator\u2019s name online would see its sexually graphic definition.\n\nOf the Doritos controversy, Mr Savage said: \u201cMichelle Obama\u2019s probably going to call to thank me for getting so many right-wing nuts to give up snacks. Maybe they\u2019ll be a little thinner.\u201d\n\nThe First Lady has led a campaign against childhood obesity, winning praise from Mr Huckabee among others.
