That's according to the latest polling from the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY.\n\nFifty-three percent of respondents disapprove of the law, while 42 percent approve, and uninsured voters are almost evenly divided, 49 percent approve, 46 percent disapprove. But only 23 percent of voters think Republicans \u201cshould do what they can to make the law fail.\u201d\n\n\n\nFewer than half of all Republicans and Republican leaners (43%) want elected officials who oppose the law to do what they can to make it fail; 37% say they should try to make it work as well as possible. However, 64% of Tea Party Republicans oppose the law and want elected officials to do what they can to make it fail. By comparison, just 31% of Republicans and Republican leaners who do not agree with the Tea Party favor this approach.\n\nGuess who's in control of the Republican Party?\n\nThat's just 23 percent of voters\u2014less than half of all Republicans and leaners\u2014who endorse the current \"shut it down\" policy Senate extremists are pushing and House leadership seems unable to resist. That's because just 23 percent of the public, has far too many representatives in the House, allowing the extremist to hold the entire country hostage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "The public is still confused about exactly what Obamacare is going to mean for them, and still divided in their opinion about it, but there's only one bloc of the public that thinks ...", "title": "Pew poll: Obamacare still confuses, but few support Republican sabotage", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/9/16/1239236/-Pew-poll-Obamacare-still-confuses-but-small-minority-support-GOP-sabotage", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/49122/story_image/11.png?1379350170", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "The public is still confused about exactly what Obamacare is going to mean for them, and still divided in their opinion about it, but there's only one bloc of the public that thinks Republican sabo...", "title": "Pew poll: Obamacare still confuses, but few support Republican sabotage", "image": {"src": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/49122/story_image/11.png?1379350170"}, "creator": "@joanmccarter", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25a8\"", "article_summary": "By comparison, just 31% of Republicans and Republican leaners who do not agree with the Tea Party favor this approach.\nHowever, 64% of Tea Party Republicans oppose the law and want elected officials to do what they can to make it fail.\nGuess who's in control of the Republican Party?\nThat's because just 23 percent of the public, has far too many representatives in the House, allowing the extremist to hold the entire country hostage.\nThe public is still confused about exactly what Obamacare is going to mean for them, and still divided in their opinion about it, but there's only one bloc of the public that thinks Republican sabotage of it is a good thing: a small minority of Republicans who self-identify as tea party."}
