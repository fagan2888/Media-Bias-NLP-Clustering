Two busloads of Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma citizens were at Moody Coliseum today — but not to cheer on the women’s basketball team that’s geographically closest to them.

They were rooting on Louisville University guard Shoni Schimmel and her sister Jude.

The Schimmel sisters grew up in Mission, Ore., on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Their careers have inspired Native American tribal members throughout the U.S.

Members of the Creek Nation, an Okmulgee, Okla.-based tribe, are among those who have taken an interest in the career of Schimmels. Shoni is regarded as one of the premier players in women’s college basketball. Jude is a part-time starter.

The Creek Nation arranged for two charter buses carrying 118 people, including Creek Nation Chief George Tiger, to watch the Schimmels lead Louisville against SMU.

Tiger said he saw members of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas at the game in addition to Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma citizens. The night before, the Schimmels’ parents, Rick and Ceci, delivered a motivational seminar for the Creek Nation.

Diane Jobe Buck of Edmond, Okla., made the 500-mile trip to watch the Schimmels play basketball. Shoni is the team’s leading scorer, averaging about 17 points per game.

“[Shoni] is a classic example of Native athleticism,” Buck said. “We have many Natives that have talent but aren’t able to take advantage of their skills.

“She has and has done so in a way that inspires people. Plus, she is so humble and respects Native people from all over.”

Schimmel scored 12 points to lead No. 5 Louisville to an 81-66 victory. Jude did not play.

“At Creek Nation, we always want to support our student-athletes,” Tiger said. “The Schimmel sisters have been role models and they’ve brought a lot of togetherness among Native people.”
