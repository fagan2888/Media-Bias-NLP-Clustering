The similarities between Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are demographic, biographical, and ideological. Both are young Cuban-American conservatives who won election to the U.S. Senate by defeating more established Republican politicians. They agree on nearly everything. Listening to them now, though, you would think their worldviews are fundamentally at odds. Cruz\u2019s version of Rubio is an amnesty-loving warmonger; Rubio\u2019s version of Cruz is a pandering isolationist. In reality, the candidates disagree more on political strategy than on policy.\n\nThe backbiting could get more intense. Many analysts think the Republican primary race could turn into a contest between the two men, with Cruz representing the more conservative factions of the party and Rubio the \u201cparty establishment.\u201d It is a theory that so far has more adherents than evidence to back it. It depends on Donald Trump\u2019s fading away, so that it\u2019s not a three-way race. It also assumes that Rubio will become a more serious contender than polls currently suggest. Cruz \u2014 who has, I should note, been a friend of mine for two decades \u2014 is ahead in Iowa in some polls; Rubio isn\u2019t ahead in any state. Cruz also seems to be doing better among the most conservative Republicans than Rubio is doing among the less conservative ones: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and John Kasich are competing for those same voters and are not far behind Rubio in the polls.\n\nCruz and Rubio have sparred on three issues to date: immigration, surveillance by the National Security Agency, and foreign policy. The first of these issues is the most politically important.\n\nWhen Rubio ran for the Senate in 2010, he said he would oppose giving illegal immigrants legal status. In 2013, however, he co-sponsored legislation with Democrats that would have let many illegal immigrants receive legal status and citizenship. He later said that the bill was too ambitious, and that Washington would have to prove that immigration laws would be enforced before addressing the status of illegal immigrants.\n\nRELATED: Rubio vs. Cruz: The Fight for Conservatism\n\nCruz opposed that 2013 bill. He said he favored \u201cimmigration reform,\u201d but that a path to citizenship was a \u201cpoison pill\u201d: Democrats had included it to keep House Republicans from voting for the bill, so that they could keep using immigration as a political issue. He proposed an amendment that would have let illegal immigrants receive legal status but not citizenship. That change, he said, would make it possible to pass immigration reform.\n\nBoth senators are moving rightward on the issue. Cruz, though, seems more in tune with the sentiments of Republican voters.\n\nCruz hits Rubio for backing that \u201camnesty\u201d bill. Rubio parries that giving legal status to illegal immigrants isn\u2019t that different from giving them citizenship. Cruz says that he never really came out for legal status: The goal of his amendment was to highlight how extreme the bill was and thus kill it. He now vows to oppose legalization. In recent weeks, Cruz has also shifted on legal immigration levels: He used to favor increases, but now opposes any increase until more Americans are working.\n\nBoth senators are, then, moving rightward on the issue. Cruz, though, seems more in tune with the sentiments of Republican voters, very few of whom tell pollsters they want more immigration, and who do not remember Rubio\u2019s legislation fondly.\n\nCruz voted for the USA Freedom Act, which ended the NSA\u2019s storage of metadata from millions of phone calls made to and from the United States. (Metadata includes numbers dialed, times of calls, and so forth, but not the content of calls.) Under the new law, enacted this summer, the government must request specific records from phone companies. Rubio says that Cruz\u2019s vote weakened national security; Cruz says that attack impugns his patriotism.\n\nRELATED: How Rubio Could Foil Cruz\u2019s Plot to Unite Conservatism\n\nThat\u2019s a stretch, as is Cruz\u2019s claim that, before the new law, the NSA treated all Americans as guilty until proven innocent. More plausibly, Cruz says that he wants to fight terrorism and protect privacy rights at the same time. He can find safety in numbers. The legislation passed by large margins. It was sponsored by James Sensenbrenner, who sponsored the Patriot Act right after the September 11 attacks and had the support of now-speaker Paul Ryan. Rubio\u2019s line of criticism implicitly portrays most House Republicans as soft on terrorism. It is not a conclusion to which Republican primary voters are naturally drawn.\n\nThe foreign-policy debate has taken a somewhat surprising direction. Rubio has aligned himself with those Republicans who believe the country must take an aggressive role in spreading liberty and democracy abroad. Cruz has for a long time said that he stands somewhere in the wide space between John McCain and Rand Paul, who represent the most and least interventionist poles of the party.\n\nRELATED: Ted Cruz\u2019s View of the Race: Iowa Locked Up, Immigration at the Fore, and a Looming Battle with Rubio\n\nAs the campaign has progressed, though, Cruz has begun to criticize \u201cneocon\u201d foreign policy more pointedly for being too interventionist and to voice skepticism about promoting democracy abroad. At times, he has said, the U.S. should accept that dictators can be better than the probable alternatives: a lesser evil. He has suggested that Rubio, like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, was wrong to favor ending the regimes of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and the late Moammar Qaddafi in Libya. He has even said that Iraq was more stable when Saddam Hussein ruled it. These views have drawn the \u201cisolationist\u201d charge from Rubio.\n\nThe argument on both sides is overdrawn. Cruz is not a knee-jerk opponent of intervention, and he is not indifferent to human rights in other countries. He has done a lot to publicize abuses in Iran, for example, and has argued for deploying missile defenses in Europe. Nor is Rubio indiscriminate in his advocacy of military action: Like Cruz, he declared President Obama\u2019s proposed air strikes against Assad in 2013 unwise and said he would vote against them. But the differences between the men are real and reflect real differences among Republican voters.\n\nRELATED: Nevada Is Rubio\u2019s Firewall, but Cruz Could Tear It Down\n\nThese differences over policy have contributed to the associations of Cruz with \u201ctea-party conservatives\u201d and Rubio with \u201cthe establishment,\u201d but they are not the primary reasons for those associations. The political style of the two men has played a bigger role. In the fall of 2013, Rubio went along with Cruz in tying the budget to Obamacare in a way that precipitated a partial government shutdown. But it was Cruz, not Rubio, who said that the skeptics of the strategy that led to the shutdown were the \u201csurrender caucus.\u201d\n\nBoth men are gifted speakers, which is part of their appeal to Republicans tired of tongue-tied candidates. But Cruz is more likely to use combative language, Rubio to wax inspirational. In each case the rhetorical approach is matched to a distinctive diagnosis of the national condition and a political strategy.\n\nRELATED: Cruz and Rubio Atop the GOP\n\nCruz portrays an America that, thanks to the Obama administration, is on the brink of irreversible decline. Its people are growing too dependent on government. Unless they change course now, they will lose their ability to reclaim their constitutional inheritance and their economic dynamism. And the way to change course is to rouse conservatives to action. In the primaries, the rightmost elements of the Republican party must unify behind him. In the general election, he will motivate conservatives to vote in a way that relative moderates John McCain and Mitt Romney were unable to. Cruz often claims that millions of conservatives and Evangelicals stayed home in the 2008 and 2012 elections. (This is true, as millions of potential voters of every type stay home in any election; it is also true that conservatives and Evangelicals made up the same share of the electorate as usual.)\n\nRubio seeks to modernize the Republican party, Cruz to purify it.\n\nRubio also believes that Obama is leaving America in a parlous state, but his critique is more conventional and less apocalyptic. In Rubio\u2019s telling, Obama has made unwise choices driven by a liberal ideology unsuited to the realities of 21st-century American life. Our problems have grown worse, and our mood more sour, because of this disconnect. In the primaries, Rubio\u2019s strategy is to assemble a coalition more akin to those of previous Republican nominees, one that includes elements from every part of the party. In the general, he is signaling that he will employ a strategy like that of past election winners: Like Cruz, he will seek to mobilize the base; more than Cruz, he will attempt to persuade non-ideological voters that his agenda will make a positive difference in their lives. Rubio seeks to modernize the Republican party, Cruz to purify it.\n\nBoth men are running campaigns that defy the political rulebook. In Rubio\u2019s case, the bet is that the old rules about needing a \u201cground game\u201d no longer apply: His campaign is lightly organized. Cruz, by contrast, has an impressive organization. But he is betting that the endorsements from other politicians that candidates have traditionally coveted do not matter. He is betting that he can simultaneously do several things that have not been done in decades, or ever: unite the right of the party in the primaries, battle the party\u2019s leadership explicitly and bitterly and then win the nomination, and win the general election with a base-mobilization strategy.\n\nBoth men, then, are in different ways defying the odds. They aim to prove that what everyone said couldn\u2019t be done can be. Which is, in a final parallel, how they both got to the Senate in the first place.\n\n\u2014 Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at National Review.
