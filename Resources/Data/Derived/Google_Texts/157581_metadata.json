A spokesman noted that snow has started to accumulate on roads, particularly in northwestern New Jersey, and plows are starting to go into operation.\n\n\"Basically we're busy now and we expect to be busy later,\" said Joe Dee, a spokesman at for the agency.\n\nThe forecast for the remainder of the day remains difficult, however.\n\nA stubborn area of high pressure is allowing cold air at the surface to remain deeply entrenched across much of the state, a phenomena known as cold-air damming.\n\nWarm air is expected to push into portions of the state as a coastal low pressure system takes over, but how far it encroaches will ultimately determine where a changeover to sleet, freezing rain or rain is possible.\n\n\u201cThis storms is setting up to be very, very tricky for central New Jersey,\u201d said Steven DiMartino, who noted short-term forecast models are not accurately picking up current conditions, potentially throwing their forecasts off. \u201cThat high pressure system is putting up a hell of a fight.\u201d\n\nForecasters are urging travelers to be very careful, as conditions could change dramatically in the span of just a few miles.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "nj-snow, nj-weather, weather, news", "title": "Snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour possible tonight; up to 10 inches could fall in parts of state", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Travel conditions will deteriorate as day progresses.", "title": "Snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour possible tonight; up to 10 inches could fall in parts of state", "url": "http://www.nj.com/weather-guy/index.ssf/2013/12/snow_overspreads_nj_up_to_10_i.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-snowjpg-59179185bc3f604b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Travel conditions will deteriorate as day progresses.", "creator": "@sstirling", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-snowjpg-59179185bc3f604b.jpg", "title": "Snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour possible tonight; up to 10 inches could fall in parts of state", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 14, 2013,  4:17 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephenDStirling"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 14, 2013,  1:25 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Travel conditions will deteriorate as day progresses."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat high pressure system is putting up a hell of a fight.\u201dForecasters are urging travelers to be very careful, as conditions could change dramatically in the span of just a few miles.\nSnow has markedly picked up in intensity across New Jersey in the last hour and the National Weather Service now warns that snowfall rates of up to two inches per hour are possible for the balance of the evening.\nThe state Department of Transportation has mobilized more than 1,500 plow trucks and 560 salt spreaders as part of a statewide mobilization.\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect for much of the northern half of the state through early Sunday morning, where forecasters predict between 4 and 10 inches could fall before the storm departs.\n\"Basically we're busy now and we expect to be busy later,\" said Joe Dee, a spokesman at for the agency."}
