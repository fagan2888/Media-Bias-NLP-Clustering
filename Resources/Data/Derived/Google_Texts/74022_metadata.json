Perry showed none of the vocal histrionics of Carrie Underwood, the stagy drama of Taylor Swift or the low-energy nonchalance of Lambert. Instead, she seemed like the real deal.\n\nPerry owned the sold-out Treasure Island Casino in Red Wing, Minn., on Saturday night with rock-star abandon and panache. She sang with whiskey-voiced passion and thrilled 3,000 fans with the kind of authenticity, spirit and freshness that most of the big-name women in country music lack in concert.\n\nWait a minute \u2014 Kimberly who? Why isn\u2019t she a big star?\n\nBecause she is featured on only two albums and she\u2019s actually the lead singer of her sibling trio, the Band Perry. Hiding behind that unbecoming and anonymous moniker, Perry, 30, isn\u2019t as widely known as her hit songs or as frontwoman Jennifer Nettles has been with Sugarland.\n\nBut Perry made all the right moves on Saturday. She arrived like a sibling trio should \u2014 on an elevated platform, with her boy-band-cute little brothers on either side and the letters TBP on separate big screens behind them. Then the trio tore into \u201cDone,\u201d a scorching kiss-off that rivals any incendiary bye-bye tune by Lambert or Underwood.\n\nWhen the band\u2019s fiddler ripped into a solo, Perry was down on her knees at his feet, worshiping him. When the fiddler took his next solo, Perry, her two brothers and three other bandmates (including Twin Cities-reared guitarist Matt Revere) stood in a line and danced \u201cRiverdance\u201d style in unison. This girl just knows how to have fun.\n\nReview of country trio Band Perry with lead singer Kimberly Perry as they appeared in concert at Treasure Island Casino.\n\nThen Perry bounced into \u201cYou Lie,\u201d a peppy accusation worthy of the Dixie Chicks. She seemed infectiously effervescent without being cute or cloying. No country woman has had this much fun onstage in years.\n\n\u201cGet your hands up,\u201d she implored at the beginning of \u201cNight Gone Wasted,\u201d a noisy barroom stomp that soon found Perry dancing with her microphone stand, tossing off her leather jacket and strutting around in her 4-inch heels and shaking her pleated skirt-clad booty. Fun, fun, fun.\n\nTime for the obligatory chat about the challenges of working with siblings. She called the stage their therapy, playground and recess, and she encouraged the crowd to leave their troubles behind and dance like one family. Good advice, but not maybe before a ballad.\n\nYes, Perry sat on a stool, with her brother Neil on mandolin, for the chart-topping ballad \u201cAll My Life,\u201d with her voice sounding a little road-weary hoarse. But she sounded so sincere and so country.\n\nPerry may be from the Appalachian town of Greene- ville, Tenn., but she\u2019s no backwoods woman. She unleashed her rock \u2019n\u2019 roll swagger on the Stones-like \u201cI\u2019m a Keeper,\u201d then went Meat Loaf-meets-boy-band on \u201cForever Mine\u201d before cutting loose on Queen\u2019s rock classic \u201cFat Bottomed Girls.\u201d\n\nThroughout the 80-minute set, Perry didn\u2019t fuss with her hair, change outfits or flaunt her bling (she\u2019s engaged to a Toronto Blue Jays catcher) like so many country princesses do. About her only concession to stardom was her Louboutin boots with those spiked heels.\n\nThe Band Perry did make the crowd wait for the encore to hear its signature song, the Kimberly Perry-penned \u201cIf I Die Young,\u201d an award-winning 2010 smash. They followed that bluegrassy reflection on mortality with the raucous death-wish rocker-as-love-song \u201cBetter Dig Two,\u201d their third No. 1 tune.\n\nThere is no question that Kimberly Perry and her two shaggy-haired brothers are ready to become country\u2019s next arena headliner. In fact, they\u2019ve already announced arena shows for next year in Duluth and Bemidji.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "REVIEW: Perry owned the sold-out Treasure Island Casino in Red Wing, singing with whiskey-voiced passion and thrilling 3,000 fans.", "title": "Review: Country singer Kimberly Perry owns the stage", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/kimberly-perry-shows-all-the-right-moves-at-treasure-island-casino/230425651/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138351622487953.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138351622487953.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "REVIEW: Perry owned the sold-out Treasure Island Casino in Red Wing, singing with whiskey-voiced passion and thrilling 3,000 fans.", "title": "Review: Country singer Kimberly Perry owns the stage", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/kimberly-perry-shows-all-the-right-moves-at-treasure-island-casino/230425651/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138351622487953.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138351622487953.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "REVIEW: Perry owned the sold-out Treasure Island Casino in Red Wing, singing with whiskey-voiced passion and thrilling 3,000 fans."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd373a\"", "article_summary": "Fun, fun, fun.\nReview of country trio Band Perry with lead singer Kimberly Perry as they appeared in concert at Treasure Island Casino.\nThere is no question that Kimberly Perry and her two shaggy-haired brothers are ready to become country\u2019s next arena headliner.\nPerry owned the sold-out Treasure Island Casino in Red Wing, Minn., on Saturday night with rock-star abandon and panache.\nKimberly Perry attacked the stage the way you wish Miranda Lambert would."}
