The double-digit increase compares with an estimated hike of 5 percent for employer-based insurance.\n\nThese are preliminary figures and could be reduced by regulatory reviews. Federal tax credits will also cut the net costs for those eligible for the subsidy. Final prices will be released next month, ahead of open enrollment in November.\n\nStill, the big requests should serve as a wake-up call to people buying insurance on their own and as a reminder that the Affordable Care Act continues to reverberate.\n\nNearly half of Texas residents get health coverage through their employers and aren\u2019t affected by the proposed increases. Many others buy health plans directly, including nearly 1 million Texans who go through Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange.\n\nTheir participation has sharply reduced the number of uninsured in the state, a key goal of the health law. But the individual market has been a financial challenge. Many newly insured people in Texas had more medical conditions and used more medical services than expected, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.\n\nThe state\u2019s largest insurer compounded the problem by lowballing the price for individual coverage.\n\n\u201cIn all transparency, we misjudged the risk,\u201d said Dr. Dan McCoy, chief medical officer. \u201cBut so did a bunch of other people.\u201d\n\nLast year, Blue Cross Blue Shield lost $400 million on its PPO for the individual market, officials said. So the company is dropping that product entirely, which will affect 365,000 Texans.\n\nBlue Cross customers in the company\u2019s much larger group plans and other products are not affected by the decision.\n\nThose losing the individual PPO will have to switch to another provider or be rolled into Blue Cross\u2019 HMO. HMOs generally have fewer doctors and hospitals in their network, along with other restrictions.\n\nBlue Cross also wants to raise the average premium for that HMO by 20 percent. The combination of dropping a popular health plan and ratcheting up rates on the lower-priced alternative has the company bracing for a backlash.\n\n\u201cI believe in setting expectations: You\u2019re hearing complaints; you will hear even more complaints,\u201d said Bert Marshall, president of the Richardson-based insurer. \u201cThis will be disruptive \u2014 and that made it very hard for the organization to make this decision.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross, which has about 40 percent of the commercial health insurance market in Texas, said the PPO losses were unsustainable. Raising premiums would have made the PPO unaffordable for the individual market.\n\nThe HMO will work, the company said, in part because it has more coordinated care, controlled costs and financial predictability. And Blue Cross will continue to offer the HMO throughout the state.\n\nYet the move represents a retreat. As Obamacare began ramping up two years ago, Blue Cross made a big splash by offering a PPO and HMO in every Texas county. It was also a leader in recruiting the uninsured at health fairs and other events.\n\nIn employer-sponsored insurance, the company has years of data on patients and operations. Not so for the individual market.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were gonna get when open enrollment first occurred,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nBlue Cross isn\u2019t the only insurer to be surprised. State regulators have reviewed 32 filings for 2016 for the individual market, and most policyholders in that segment will face a rate increase of over 20 percent, said Ben Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance.\n\nInsurers cited high medical claims, including a sharp increase in prescription drugs. In addition to seeking higher rates, insurers are cutting the size of provider networks and out-of-network benefits, he said.\n\nThe higher prices aren\u2019t a lock. Last year, Texas regulators reviewed 23 filings for increases of at least 10 percent, and nine were reduced, said Stacey Pogue of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin.\n\nBut some big increases for 2016 have already been granted elsewhere. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee won a 36 percent average increase for the individual market, and the Kentucky Health Cooperative got a 25 percent increase.\n\nThey\u2019re dominant players in their respective states, similar to Blue Cross in Texas. But average increases for premiums can be deceiving because consumers often have workarounds. They can switch providers, accept narrower networks and choose a plan with skimpier benefits.\n\nAll this depends on having competition, and Dallas has plenty of it. For 2015, it had six insurers offering 60 plans in the individual market, up from 38 plans the year before.\n\nTo gauge the impact on consumers, the Kaiser Family Foundation compares a benchmark premium rate in major cities. It looks at the second-lowest-priced silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker.\n\nBy that measure, preliminary increases for 2016 were averaging 3.1 percent for 13 cities. That\u2019s almost exactly the increase in Dallas\u2019 benchmark rate last year.\n\n\u201cAverage increases assume you\u2019re going to stay with the same company and product \u2014 and that\u2019s not a realistic assumption,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, an associate director who studies health reform at Kaiser.\n\nLast year, over half the customers on Healthcare.gov actively renewed their plans. And half of them selected new offers.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to stay as active and engaged this year, especially in Texas.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@mitchschnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the individual market, many insurers in Texas are seeking premium increases of 20 percent.", "og": {"description": "In the individual market, many insurers in Texas are seeking premium increases of 20 percent.", "title": "Schnurman: Health care rates may sting", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150919-schnurman-health-care-rates-may-sting.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-22T03:43:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-09-19T23:43:19Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Schnurman: Health care rates may sting\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150919-schnurman-health-care-rates-may-sting.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2443066\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-19T23:43:19Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-19T23:43:19Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc962a\"", "article_summary": "Many others buy health plans directly, including nearly 1 million Texans who go through Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange.\nMany newly insured people in Texas had more medical conditions and used more medical services than expected, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee won a 36 percent average increase for the individual market, and the Kentucky Health Cooperative got a 25 percent increase.\nThose losing the individual PPO will have to switch to another provider or be rolled into Blue Cross\u2019 HMO.\n\u201cBut so did a bunch of other people.\u201dLast year, Blue Cross Blue Shield lost $400 million on its PPO for the individual market, officials said."}
