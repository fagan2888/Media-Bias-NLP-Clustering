Test scores in those two school districts are among the lowest in the state while dropout rates are among the highest.\n\nThe parties suing also contend that the quality of educational resources\u2014including facilities, teachers, learning materials, and curricular and extra-curricular resources\u2014provided to students in Halifax County, and especially students in the majority black districts, falls well below constitutional standards:\n\nStudents at Northwest High School in HCPS have endured sewage in the hallways, crumbling ceilings and exposure to mold, and failing heating and air systems. By contrast, the students at RRGSD\u2019s high school attend a school that has been repeatedly renovated since its initial construction, is on the National Register of Historic Places, has a building dedicated solely to physical education and music and a pristine athletic field.\n\nThey are asking the court to find that the three-district system fails to provide county students, especially those at risk, with the constitutionally-required sound basic education and to order the board to come up with a plan to unify and better fund county schools.\n\nRead the full complaint in Silver v. Halifax County Board of Commissioners here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Read the full complaint in Silver v.
