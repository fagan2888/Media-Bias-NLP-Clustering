Also, federal dollars will be given to individuals who qualify, to help them purchase health insurance plans which may, too, include abortion coverage.\n\n\"ObamaCare's annual net increase in insured abortions that are either fully publicly funded through Medicaid or heavily subsidized through the exchanges could be as high as 71,000 to 111,500,\" according to The Charlotte Lozier Institute.\n\nCritics say this would go against the president's promise, and the so-called Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal money from paying for abortions.\n\n\"We were assured that this plan would maintain the spirit of the Hyde Amendment. It doesn't do that,\" said Charles Donovan, president of the institute. \"It will extend abortion funding and even make morally and religiously opposed people pay for those plans.\"\n\nBut pro-choice advocates say that is not what is happening here.\n\nThey say it's always the case, and is here, that the federal dollars will be separated, and will not be directly used to pay for abortion.\n\nThey say the president is keeping his promise.\n\n\"The president has been very clear that ObamaCare -- the Affordable Care Act -- would comply with the Hyde Amendment and there's nothing that I have seen including in this study, which basically is a theory at this point, thus far that shows otherwise,\" liberal radio host Leslie Marshall said.\n\n\"I do feel the Affordable Care Act complies with the Hyde Amendment.\"\n\nPro-life advocates contend there is no way to separate out the federal dollars.\n\nRep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., has introduced legislation that requires the ObamaCare exchanges to state upfront whether a health insurance plan covers abortion -- so people have all the facts before they purchase a plan.\n\n\"There's nothing transparent about this,\" he said. \"The president has broken his word. ... This is a massive violation of the Hyde Amendment.\"\n\nFox News' Molly Henneberg contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Social Policy", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:27:49 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "President Obama promised that taxpayer dollars would not fund abortions through the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But now, a new study by a pro-life group suggests that may not be true.", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama promised that taxpayer dollars would not fund abortions through the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But now, a new study by a pro-life group suggests that may not be true.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/does-obamacare-subsidize-abortions.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112213/0/0/112213_sr_henneberg_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Does ObamaCare subsidize abortions?", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Social Policy\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/executive\",\"title\":\"Does ObamaCare subsidize abortions?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112213/0/0/112213_sr_henneberg_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-22T21:26:13Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/does-obamacare-subsidize-abortions.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"88872d03-447d-4ba0-8b2f-b47869b037c4\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "President Obama promised that taxpayer dollars would not fund abortions through the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But now, a new study by a pro-life group suggests that may not be true.", "dc.identifier": "88872d03-447d-4ba0-8b2f-b47869b037c4", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare,spolicy", "description": "President Obama promised that taxpayer dollars would not fund abortions through the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But now, a new study by a pro-life group suggests that may not be true.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Does Obamacare Subsidize Abortions?", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 01:27:49 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "President Obama promised that taxpayer dollars would not fund abortions through the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0But now, a new study by a pro-life group suggests that may not be true.", "title": "Does ObamaCare subsidize abortions? | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/does-obamacare-subsidize-abortions.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112213/0/0/112213_sr_henneberg_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-11-22", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Social Policy\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/executive\",\"title\":\"Does ObamaCare subsidize abortions?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/112213/0/0/112213_sr_henneberg_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-22T21:26:13Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/22/does-obamacare-subsidize-abortions.html\",\"post_id\":\"88872d03-447d-4ba0-8b2f-b47869b037c4\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2531\"", "article_summary": "Critics say this would go against the president's promise, and the so-called Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal money from paying for abortions.\nPresident Obama promised that taxpayer dollars would not fund abortions through the Affordable Care Act.\n\"We were assured that this plan would maintain the spirit of the Hyde Amendment.\nAlso, federal dollars will be given to individuals who qualify, to help them purchase health insurance plans which may, too, include abortion coverage.\nPro-life advocates contend there is no way to separate out the federal dollars."}
