That includes the cost of cleanup and security.\n\nBy contrast, the 2012 parade that celebrated the New York Giants winning the Super Bowl had more than a dozen corporate sponsors.\n\nRelated: For World Cup Hero Carli Lloyd, 16 Minutes Can Mean Millions\n\nCity officials told the Post that the dearth of sponsors reflected the short period of time in which the city pulled together plans for the parade. The team is the first women\u2019s squad to receive a New York City ticker tape parade, although the city has honored individual women, such as Olympic athletes and Amelia Earhart.\n\nMore than 12,000 people entered a lottery for tickets to the parade, which will feature the team atop patriotic floats moving down the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan as spectators throw confetti from surrounding buildings.\n\nWhile companies may not have shown much interest in the parade, they are clearly interested in star Carli Lloyd. Her agent has repeatedly received more than 200 inquiries from marketers who want to work with the athlete.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for Lloyd, who like all other National Women\u2019s Soccer League players, is subject to a $37,800 salary cap, about one 10th of what the average male Major League Soccer player makes in a year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While the country celebrates the U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer team\u2019s World Cup Championship with a New York City ticker tape parade, corporations have been reluctant to pony up cash to cover the $2 million celebration.", "title": "Corporate Sponsors Didn't Kick in Much for Women's World Cup Parade", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/10/Corporate-Sponsors-Didnt-Kick-Much-Womens-World-Cup-Parade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07102015_Carli_Lloyd_US_Soccer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/10/Corporate-Sponsors-Didnt-Kick-Much-Womens-World-Cup-Parade", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07102015_Carli_Lloyd_US_Soccer.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While the country celebrates the U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer team\u2019s World Cup Championship with a New York City ticker tape parade, corporations have been reluctant to pony up cash to cover the $2 million celebration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While the country celebrates the U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer team\u2019s World Cup Championship with a New York City ticker tape parade, corporations have been reluctant to pony up cash to cover the $2 million celebration.\nThat\u2019s good news for Lloyd, who like all other National Women\u2019s Soccer League players, is subject to a $37,800 salary cap, about one 10th of what the average male Major League Soccer player makes in a year.\nBy contrast, the 2012 parade that celebrated the New York Giants winning the Super Bowl had more than a dozen corporate sponsors.\nThe team is the first women\u2019s squad to receive a New York City ticker tape parade, although the city has honored individual women, such as Olympic athletes and Amelia Earhart.\nMajor League Soccer, Nike, fod company Mondelez and video game giant Electronic Arts have contributed a total $450,000 toward the parade, leaving New York City to cover the difference, the New York Post reports."}
