Howard, SD

Freezing conditions made it difficult to put out the fire at the downtown business, and Howard Cold Storage was looking for a new place.

Luckily there was the building that used to house Dakota Beef in Howard that was foreclosed in 2009. Owner Tim Glanzer has started to move the business to its temporary home, with plans on building a permanent place. This is a horrible time for the relocation, considering this is the height of the business during deer hunting season.

“If you had appointments please call us. I mean, we're going to get you in, and if you had meat in the locker call us and tell what you thought you had and insurance is going to work with us with that,” owner Tim Glanzer said.

There are challenges in dealing with the new building that he estimates is ten times larger than the building lost in the fire.
