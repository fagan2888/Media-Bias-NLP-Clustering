Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat, Berwick wasn't shaking hands with voters.\n\nThe group, which also included representatives from the T Riders Union and Youth Way, young public transit advocates, took rows of seats facing each other and talked transit policy as the bus drove down Blue Hill Avenue. For nearly two hours, and one bus transfer, they discussed how to promote pedestrian and bike friendly policies, how to avoid forcing low-income residents out of gentrifying areas, how to expand a Youth Pass giving university students cheap access to the MBTA and how to create regional equity in transportation.\n\nBerwick peppered the others with questions. How can the ease of Boston transportation be recreated in Springfield? What cities globally provide a model for effective public transportation? What kind of \"smart streets\" technology is available to sync public buses with traffic lights? What is the governor's role?\n\nIt was Berwick at his most comfortable, not as a politician but as a policy wonk. Though Berwick's expertise is in health care, he wants to apply the management skills he developed in health care to other policy areas he would oversee as governor. Facing Attorney General Martha Coakley and Treasurer Steve Grossman in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary, Berwick faces the challenge of communicating his skills to voters. He has struggled to break out of the single digits in polling.\n\n\"Part of the problem is that competence and accomplishment doesn't necessarily translate into political crackle,\" said Blumenauer.\n\nBerwick has carved out a niche among primary voters as the most liberal candidate. He made the implementation of single-payer health care the core of his campaign. He is the only candidate to oppose casino gambling. His campaign slogan \"all means all\" focuses on income inequality. But his resume is not easily communicable in slogans. Berwick spent his career applying management principles to improve the health care system to make it safer and more patient-centered.\n\n\"It's a pretty wonky area,\" Berwick said, rattling off the disciplines he worked with, including systems thinking, industrial engineering and human psychology.\n\nBerwick has been hurt before by his inability to play politics. He resigned as administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services because he could not get confirmed over Republican opposition.\n\nBerwick, a doctor, started his career in health policy in charge of quality assurance for the HMO Harvard Community Health Plan, the precursor to Harvard Vanguard. He studied ways to improve quality, measured by metrics like complication and death rates. He looked at models outside healthcare, including NASA.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Berwick founded the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a policy organization dedicated to identifying problems in the health care system, developing ways to improve health care, then implementing them.\n\nOne campaign, mentioned in Berwick's first television ad, was the \"100,000 lives campaign.\" The goal was to get hospitals to institute six specific evidence-based practices to reduce hospital deaths. The institute got 2,300 hospitals to sign on and, based on hospital mortality figures, said it saved 123,000 lives in 18 months. A study in the Journal on Quality and Patient Safety found that methodology concerns make it difficult to say whether that number is accurate. But it did credit IHI for creating social pressure for hospitals to meet achievable goals to improve patient safety.\n\nJoe McCannon, who managed the 100,000 lives campaign and a subsequent campaign to avoid 5 million instances of harm by health care providers over two years, said Berwick was the organization's \"visionary\" and generated most of its activities. \"Don's great skill is in both generating powerful new ideas, then making them happen,\" said McCannon, who is also an adviser to Berwick's campaign.\n\nJohn McDonough, professor of the practice of public health at Harvard University's School of Public Health, wrote in 2011 that Berwick's major contributions were in identifying the need for continuous improvement in health care and developing concrete plans to improve patient care, cut health care costs, and improve population health. Much of Berwick's work \u2013 he has numerous publications to his name - was about making the system work better for patients. Berwick wrote about his wife's difficult experiences obtaining health care as he analyzed how to improve it.\n\n\"In the late 1990s, when the nation first woke up to the epidemic of medical errors and in particular the epidemic of deadly health care errors in system, Dr. Berwick conceptualized, then organized, then delivered the (100,000 lives) campaign through IHI,\" McDonough told The Republican/MassLive.com.\n\nMcDonough said Berwick \"had a profound influence on moving the American and global health care systems in a positive, proactive direction.\"\n\nThe queen of England knighted Berwick in 2005 for his work advising the government on modernizing Britain's National Health Service. A key feature of his work reduced waiting times for access to primary care doctors.\n\nOther work IHI did under Berwick included developing better ways for U.S. community health centers to treat people with chronic diseases and working with health centers in Ghana to reduce child mortality.\n\nAmy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of the health care advocacy group Health Care For All, which is neutral in the governor's race, called Berwick a \"thought leader.\" When she came to Massachusetts in 2008, she sought Berwick out for his expertise. \"He was helpful in providing guidance...in ways we could continue to incorporate patients and consumers in making improvements in the health care system,\" Whitcomb Slemmer said.\n\nBerwick was chosen by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2010 as a recess appointment to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He came in with an ideology he described as \"triple aim;\" improving patients' experiences, improving health and reducing costs. He led staff trainings on how to help Medicare and Medicaid become more customer-focused. He took office as the administration was implementing the Affordable Care Act, Obama's national health care reform, and worked to write regulations and implement the new law.\n\nHe set up an approximately $1 billion a year Innovation Center, which gives grants to health care providers to experiment with new ways of delivering care. Supporters said the center could save taxpayers money by finding new best practices. But, the Washington Post reported, detractors derided it as an unnecessary and expensive bureaucracy to fund projects that could fail.\n\nBerwick says he appreciated the chance to use his skills to help people through government, but he was angry and frustrated by the \"paralysis\" in Washington.\n\nBerwick resigned in 2011 when it became clear he could not be confirmed. Critics cited Berwick's comments praising the British national health system and statements he made regarding rationing of care. Berwick was asked during a 2009 interview about concerns that having a government agency evaluate the comparative effectiveness of treatments would lead to rationing. \"The decision is not whether or not we will ration care \u2014 the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open. And right now, we are doing it blindly,\" Berwick said.\n\nRepublicans said the comments showed that Berwick favored health care rationing. Berwick told The Republican/MassLive.com that this was an example of Republicans' \"demagoguery and soundbite manipulation that's just nonsense.\"\n\nBerwick said he was referring to the current system were \"every single insurance company makes decisions every day about what you're going to get.\" Berwick said insurers decide in secrecy, without accountability. \"I was saying either that secrecy is going to continue, or we're going to shine a spotlight ... and hold people accountable for what they're doing,\" Berwick said.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'2014-elections','2014-massachusetts-governors-race','2014-race-for-governor','affordable-care-act','don-berwick','earl-blumenauer','health-care','health-policy','john-mcdonough','josh-archambault','martha-coakley','steve-grossman'", "title": "Don Berwick brings health care policy, managment experience to Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Don Berwick brings health care policy, managment experience to Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/don_berwick_brings_health_care.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14055171-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13701129\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-27T10:06:21Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"2014-elections\",\"2014-massachusetts-governors-race\",\"2014-race-for-governor\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"don-berwick\",\"earl-blumenauer\",\"health-care\",\"health-policy\",\"john-mcdonough\",\"josh-archambault\",\"martha-coakley\",\"steve-grossman\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@masslivenews", "image": "http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/14055171-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Berwick, with a background in health care policy, is most comfortable as a policy wonk not a politician.
