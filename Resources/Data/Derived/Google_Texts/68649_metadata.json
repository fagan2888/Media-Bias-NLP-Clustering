Residents have access to primary care at Community Health Centers. They have access to dental care and mental health services.\n\nThe project has won awards, including one this week, Roadmaps to Health Action Award, from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute\n\nBut it has a long way to go.\n\nMany still wake up to yellow, smelly water. The nearest grocery store is across State Road 50. According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data, of the nearly 10,000 residents of the community, 20 percent live below poverty level.\n\nMany residents fall in the coverage gap -- they're the working poor who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut community activists like McKinney, and partners like the University of Central Florida and its volunteers and Florida Hospital say that they aren't giving up.\n\n\"We want to transform Bithlo, keeping the same people in it,\" said McKinney. \"Real lives depend on is. Real people depend on us to work faster.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Transforming Bithlo work in progress", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Since 2009, when United Global Outreach commited to transforming this 12-square-mile community east of Orange County, a new school has taken root in town.
