Its investments range in seed stage startups to large public companies across the world.\n\nBecause of the extent and candor of the interview, we\u2019re publishing the majority of the talk \u2013 broken in two segments, edited for length and clarity. The first focuses largely on investment strategy. Part Two, which will address Isaly\u2019s views on the public markets and the political environment, will be posted soon.\n\nHow has the dynamic in healthcare investing changed?\n\nWhen I started, the business of investing in healthcare was much less than it is today. The palette of investing opportunities is very, very much more colorful now than it was in years back. We believe that you now need skills in both science and business.\n\nMy most senior partner, Sven Borho, and I tease that as of today, we couldn\u2019t get hired by OrbiMed. We don\u2019t know enough in terms of PhDs and MDs.\n\nThe skills dedicated to investing in this area are particularly high. Analytical skills are important, and the speed of transmission of information. I can\u2019t emphasize it enough. Here\u2019s a boring anecdote:\n\nWhen I\u2019d go to the American Society of Clinical Oncologists meeting, I\u2019d watch all of the abstracts \u2013 and would have to ask ASCO to FedEx them to me. I\u2019d get them a day or two later. Now, with the push of a button, the whole world knows. The speed of transmission of information\u2019s become very, very rapid \u2013 and we need to keep up with it.\n\nWhat differentiates OrbiMed as an investor?\n\nWhen I started, instead of trying to do well in the United States, or do well in Japan, or do well in Europe, I\u2019d try my hand at doing well in a sector worldwide. At the time, that was rather rare. We are very much worldwide investors.\n\nAnother distinguishing characteristic: I never really felt that there was any difference between public and private. I\u2019m agnostic as to whether a company is public or private, and the stage of development.\n\nWhat\u2019s OrbiMed\u2019s secret sauce?\n\nWe want management to have special skills: Bright, hardworking, honest, and most challenging of all \u2013 lucky. Of course, you can\u2019t define lucky \u2013 but in any event, when it comes to our people, I would insist they possess those characteristics.\n\nWhat\u2019s your investment process? How do you anticipate the anticipators?\n\nWhen it comes to selecting companies, the concept I follow comes from economist John Maynard Keynes: The Keynesian Beauty Contest.\n\nSay, the New York Post has a page listing 50 of the most beautiful ladies \u2013 and you\u2019re asked to pick five out of the 50 that are the most beautiful. To solve that question, you don\u2019t pick the five you think are the most beautiful \u2013 you pick the five you think that other people will pick.\n\nThat\u2019s anticipating the investors. When evaluating a company, you ask questions like \u2013 what\u2019s the outlook two years from now? What technologies will come out? In venture capital, how long will the value last, and when to an inflection point?\n\nWhat\u2019s the state of biopharma innovation today?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to quantify. Some of my tech colleagues earlier today said, \u201cbest I know, the pace of change is accelerating. The pace of scientific advancement is accelerating.\u201d I can\u2019t prove it. I just look around and see it.\n\nBut clinicaltrials.gov is a goldmine \u2013 and you find the number of candidates in human trials growing eight percent per year. There was once a time when growth was much more modest, and maybe not at all.\n\nThe FDA approved 45 new products last year. An equal amount went into the FDA this year \u2013 and a lot of that is because personalized medicine is arriving. All the quirks of your diabetes, or asthma, are carved away into separate orphan diseases \u2013 with a $10,000 price tag.\n\nThe pace of advancement is good. I\u2019m delighted by CRISPR.\n\nWhat\u2019s the right way to approach R&D?\n\nPeople who punch time cards are not likely those who discover new drugs. It takes continuous thinking. It takes smaller, academic groups to make discoveries.\n\nWhat technologies do you find interesting?\n\nThe technologies are the most exciting for people who have, or will have, cancer. The development of immuno-oncology is clearly dramatic. We all have the capabilities in our bodies to destroy this stuff. The war on cancer is within us.\n\nGene therapies for single gene disorders are looking very promising. Multiple gene disorders are very hard to get to at this moment, but if you look at hemophilia or beta thalassemia \u2013 I think there\u2019s great promise that those will be successfully addressed in five to ten years.\n\nWhat about Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nI will make a forecast: A pill for Alzheimer\u2019s disease will be the world\u2019s largest selling drug one day.\n\nI just don\u2019t know where that\u2019ll come from.\n\nThere have been a lot of disappointments in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but we\u2019re seeing monoclonals in deep development \u2013 and with the work from Eli Lilly and Biogen, there\u2019s a reasonable chance we\u2019ll see some activity.\n\nThose earlier pathway drugs that extended functioning by a year or two \u2013 that\u2019s really not so dramatic, and I don\u2019t see a cure there. But earlier interventions will be determined by genetic prediction.\n\n[Image courtesy of OrbiMed Advisors]", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"People who punch time cards are not likely those who discover new drugs,\" OrbiMed Managing Partner Samuel Isaly said in a fascinating discussion at the BIO CEO conference in New York.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "\"People who punch time cards are not likely those who discover new drugs,\" OrbiMed Managing Partner Samuel Isaly said in a fascinating discussion at the BIO CEO conference in New York.", "title": "OrbiMed\u2019s secret sauce: A Q&A with Founder Samuel Isaly (Part One)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-09-at-7.34.57-AM.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-13T08:23:29-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/02/orbimed-isaly/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-09-at-7.34.57-AM.png", "creator": "@meghanakeshavan", "description": "\"People who punch time cards are not likely those who discover new drugs,\" OrbiMed Managing Partner Samuel Isaly said in a fascinating discussion at the BIO CEO conference in New York.", "card": "summary", "title": "OrbiMed's secret sauce: A Q&A with Founder Samuel Isaly (Part One) - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,events, OrbiMed Advisors, samuel isaly, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Biotech", "tag": "samuel isaly", "published_time": "2016-02-09T07:55:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-13T08:23:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16e5\"", "article_summary": "Isaly helped launch OrbiMed in 1989, and the New York investment firm now has $15 billion of assets under management \u2013 making it the world\u2019s largest independent healthcare investor.\nMy most senior partner, Sven Borho, and I tease that as of today, we couldn\u2019t get hired by OrbiMed.\nPart Two, which will address Isaly\u2019s views on the public markets and the political environment, will be posted soon.\nThe palette of investing opportunities is very, very much more colorful now than it was in years back.\nWhen I started, the business of investing in healthcare was much less than it is today."}
