To make room on the 25-man roster, the Rockies placed lefty reliever Ken Roberts on the DL with left elbow inflammation. The club doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a serious injury, but they are watching it carefully.\n\nThe Rockies and Giants can both expand their rosters to 26 players for the second game of the doubleheader, and in the Rockies\u2019 case, the 26th man will be starting pitcher David Hale, who will make his Rockies debut.\n\nThird baseman Nolan Arenado, who experienced back spasms during Friday night\u2019s rain-delayed 11-8 loss to the Giants, said he\u2019s fine and expects to be in the lineup for both games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI tweaked it a little and it tightened up during the long (rain) delay, but I feel good, ready to go.\u201d\n\nBrown said he\u2019d been dealing with a shoulder issue for most of the spring.\n\n\u201cI had a little bit of an issue with my shoulder during spring training, but I was still able to get loose then,\u201d said Brown, who is 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 appearances. \u201cBut over the last week or 10 days, I had trouble staying loose, especially when I had to sit back down after throwing.\n\n\u201cBut the three rehab starts were good, and then in the last one I threw really well and was able to stay loose.\u201d\n\nManager Walt Weiss said he will continue to use Brown the same way he did before Brown went on the DL.\n\n\u201cHe will be in the same role,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cSometimes one inning, sometimes one-plus. He\u2019s a nice piece to have because you don\u2019t have to match up with \u2018Brownie.\u2019 He gets lefties and get gets righties. It makes it a lot smoother late in the game when you go to the \u2018pen.\u201d\n\nRoberts, who gave up three runs on four hits while facing just seven batters Friday night, said he Friday night was the first time the elbow pain flared up during a game.\n\n\u201cI would usually feel it the day after,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s just some inflammation and I tweaked something in there.\u201d\n\nWeiss said the club would be cautious.\n\n\u201cThere is always concern when we are talking about sore elbows and inflammation in the elbow,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut we are not overly concerned. We will see how Kenny progresses with treatment. But there are not any major concerns right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brooks Brown,Ken Roberts,Nolan Arenado,Walt Weiss", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "The Rockies shuffled their bullpen Saturday.
