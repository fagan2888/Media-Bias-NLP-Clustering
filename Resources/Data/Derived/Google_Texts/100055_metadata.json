And more, of course.\n\nAnd the subject of the militarization or weaponization of local cop shops has, too. Mainly since the violence erupted in Ferguson after Michael Brown\u2019s death. But that was just an outbreak, the actions and consequences have been permeating America for a long time.\n\nWND has been reporting on the potential for such problems stemming from both of those issues since 1997, the year WND was launched by co-founders Joseph and Elizabeth Farah.\n\nThe news site now is approaching, in a week, its 18th anniversary, having become the first Internet-only content provider to launch a movie-production enterprise, see one of its books made into a feature film, launch an online store, to secure credentials to cover Capitol Hill, to secure White House credentials, and much more.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of the daily news reporting that consistently has broken new ground \u2013 called \u201cscoops\u201d in the industry.\n\nFor example, just a few months ago, WND broke the story that the city of Houston had subpoenaed copies of sermons of several pastors who had objected to the city\u2019s move toward a transgender-advocating society.\n\nIt seems the city was demanding to know what the preachers were telling their parishioners about the fight over morals.\n\nAnd when a federal judge in Texas issued an order halting President Obama\u2019s amnesty program in its tracks earlier this year, WND reported on the decision and quoted from the ruling 20 minutes to an hour before other agencies.\n\nBut what about those warnings about the IRS, and about militarization, from 1997?\n\nIt was a report about Californian Margie Gray writing an email to President Clinton lamenting that his actions in the White House were \u201cimmoral, unethical and dishonest.\u201d\n\nWND reported that not even four weeks later, she got a letter from the Internal Revenue Service claiming she owed $3,500 in interest since 1991 due to a \u201cmistake\u201d she had made on her personal income tax return for that year.\n\nBut WND reported the claim was suspicious, since the Grays did not file separate returns.\n\nReported WND, \u201cMrs. Gray suspects she knows why the IRS contacted her. She believes she was selectively targeted not only for her critical note to Clinton but for other political correspondence as well. Since her retirement, the former San Francisco Bay Area businesswoman has become an Internet activist who spends \u2018hours and hours\u2019 on the web every day, contacting public officials and urging their opposition to administration policies.\u201d\n\nSound like the IRS targeting scandal that erupted during the 2012 election, when agents were deliberately delaying and posing questions such as about the content of their prayers to conservative and Christian groups? Those who would, naturally, take a position in opposition to many of the Obama administration\u2019s pro-homosexual, pro-spending, pro-abortion actions?\n\nAnd about that militarization?\n\nWND reported during its first year in operation on the massive numbers of federal agents who were being handed weapons, publishing series focusing on the \u201cnearly 60,000 armed federal agents.\u201d\n\nThe number prompted Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America at the time to declare, \u201cGood grief \u2013 that\u2019s a standing army.\u201d\n\nIt seems Obama took up the theme, stating during his first campaign during an appearance in Colorado Springs, \u201cWe cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we set. We\u2019ve got have a civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.\u201d\n\nSee him:\n\nBut WND reported that even that astounding 60,000 number proved, through more research, to be low.\n\n\u201cNew documentation shows the number is more than 80,000. The operative phrase is \u2018at least.\u2019 With 25,000 new agents in training each year at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for the next three years, the number is sure to rise on almost a daily basis,\u201d the report told America.\n\nHere are more of WND\u2019s scoops:\n\n1998\n\nWND reported when President Clinton \u201cquietly signed a skillfully crafted executive order that fundamentally alters the relationship between Washington and the states and seriously erodes the balance of powers established by the 10th Amendment.\u201d After exposure by WND and subsequent protests from local and state officials the White House ultimately backed down.\n\nAnd WND reported when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed a strategy that would have banks report \u201cunusual\u201d customer activity, including simple deposits and withdrawals, to the federal government. Ultimately the Senate voted 88-0 to call a halt.\n\n1999\n\nWND first reported how White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster\u2019s death was characterized as a professional \u201chit\u201d in a 511-page court document charging obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd WND was first to provide national exposure to the story of the homosexual-rape-murder of 13-year-old Jesse Dirkhising. Subsequently, the Associated Press acknowledged its error in failing to cover the gruesome Arkansas case.\n\n2000\n\nOn another issue that may seem familiar, WND reported on a stash of unrecorded West Wing emails totaling close to one million. The Justice Department\u2019s campaign-finance task force had yet to see the trove of information. But it already, under Attorney General Janet Reno\u2019s direction, had charged 24 people in its three-year criminal probe.\n\nOn the issue of government intrusion into personal lives, WND reported a judge decided the Census Bureau has no automatic right to ask questions felt to be personal or intrusive and that it cannot threaten citizens who refuse to answer such questions.\n\n2001\n\nWND reported that one of the suspects in the hijacking of American Airlines Flight 11, which ripped into the north tower of the World Trade Center like a guided missile, probably lived in the leafy Washington suburb of Vienna, Virginia, only months before the attack. The suspect was identified as Waleed M. Alshehri.\n\nAnd how about that sophisticated telecommunications equipment the 9/11 attackers used? WND reported the Islamic terrorists had access to encryption technology that most armies don\u2019t have, and they got it, according to an angry senior strategic trade adviser at the Defense Department, from a shipment rubber-stamped by the Clinton administration to Syria.\n\n2002\n\nWND reported clothing found in Sept. 11 hijacking ringleader Mohamed Atta\u2019s bags wasn\u2019t a pilots\u2019 uniform, as first reported, but his paradise wedding suit. An American Airlines employee who was with authorities when they first opened Atta\u2019s luggage told WND the navy suit was eerily laid out as if Atta were in it. At the foot of the bag was a leather-bound Quran painted gold.\n\nWND also reported on its fight to acquire credentials to cover Congress. Washington Bureau Chief Paul Sperry discovered that the lead obstructionist in the case worked for Bloomberg, \u201can electronic newspaper\u201d that, similar to WND, went through a full year of \u201cstonewalling\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d tactics by the gallery committee to gain its own credentials.\n\n2003\n\nWND reported when the University of Victoria in British Columbia hosted a special seminar called \u201cBondage 101\u201d to teach participants how to use ropes safely in a sexual context.\n\nAnd when a new archeological discovery was reported, WND followed up. It was when reports surfaced of Egyptian chariot wheels being found in the Red Sea. Diver Peter Elmer said, \u201cI am 99.9 percent sure I picked up a chariot wheel. It was covered in coral.\u201d\n\n2004\n\nWhen a Christian organization\u2019s ads were banned from Google, WND was there to report. It was \u201cStand to Reason,\u201d a nonprofit apologetics organization, that was targeted by the Internet giant. It seems Google was targeting \u201call moral judgments\u201d about homosexuality.\n\nIn the extended aftermath of 9/11, WND reported when a U.S. Customs Department whistleblower said airports are insecure from terror attacks because of unauthorized ramp access prevalent across the nation.\n\n2005\n\nWND\u2019s Jerusalem Bureau Chief Aaron Klein and nationally syndicated talk-show host Rusty Humphries conducted an exclusive interview with gun-toting leaders of the terror group Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. They were told that the Old and New Testaments were falsified.\n\nWND also reported when a book revealed that the Lawrence legal case out of Texas, through which the Supreme Court ultimately created a \u201cright\u201d to sodomy in America, likely was a setup in which activists actually invited arrest so they could fight the constitutionality of anti-sodomy laws.\n\n2006\n\nWhen Mahmoud Ahmadinejad rose to power in Iran, WND was there to report on his mystical preoccupation with the coming of an Islamic messiah figure, and concerns that such activism would \u201ctrigger the kind of global conflagration he envisions will set the stage for the end of the world.\u201d\n\nWND launched a multiyear reporting effort in 2007 on Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, who intervened in a drug smuggler\u2019s attempt to bring drugs into the U.S. For their work, they were railroaded by federal officials who were under pressure from the Mexican government and they eventually went to prison. WND was able to report later on their release.\n\n2007\n\nMillions of tons of consumer products are imported annually from China. WND reported when FDA inspectors reported food imports intended for American people were rejected with increasing frequency because they are filthy, contaminated with pesticides and tainted with bacteria and banned drugs.\n\nAmid all the talk about a \u201cNorth American Union,\u201d WND reported when the state of Washington announced a pilot project to introduce a driver\u2019s license \u201cenhanced\u201d with a radio frequency identification, or RFID, chip that would encode personal information.\n\n2008\n\nWND Editor in Chief Joseph Farah wrote about Obama\u2019s \u201csecret $439 billion plan for a mysterious initiative called the \u2018civilian national security force.'\u201d Why, he asked, \u201cis it that the Obama campaign has gone mum on this proposal? Why is it that operatives keep promising us clarification that is never forthcoming? And, furthermore, is an expansion of the Foreign Service to the size of the $439 billion Defense Department (in 2007 dollars) really such an innocent idea?\u201d\n\nWND was first to report that year when a California court released the stunning ruling that several children in one homeschool family must be enrolled in a public school or \u201clegally qualified\u201d private school, and must attend. The decision from the 2nd Appellate Court in Los Angeles granted a special petition brought by lawyers appointed to represent the two youngest children after the family\u2019s homeschooling was brought to the attention of child advocates. Eventually, the decision was reversed.\n\n2009\n\nAmid the furor and dozens of lawsuits questioning Barack Obama\u2019s eligibility to be president because of the Constitution\u2019s requirement presidents be a \u201cnatural born citizen,\u201d WND reported that Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, reported Obama may have been born in the United States. Or Kenya.\n\nMost parents, when they think of Girl Scouts, think Thin Mints and Tagalong cookies. But WND revealed that the organization held an agenda for teaching stone labyrinths, world peace, global warming, yoga, avatars, Zen gardens and feminist, communist and lesbian role models.\n\n2010\n\nWND reported when the TSA instituted invasive \u201cpat-down\u201d searches of airline travelers, including children, and one TSA manager said the workers should try to make a \u201cgame\u201d out of the intimate touching. That worried many, who reported that\u2019s exactly what pedophiles do to children.\n\nThe federal government in Washington just seems to keep expanding, prompting several campaigns among the states to push back. One key move developed when states declared guns made inside their borders, and sold inside those borders, were exempt from rules on \u201cinterstate\u201d commerce. Idaho was the seventh state to make that statement.\n\n2011\n\nWND\u2019s Aaron Klein was the first to report that the founders of a radical group that teaches tactics of direct action, confrontation and intimidation were among the main speakers at a union convention at which one leader called for opposing \u201cright-wing threats to dismantle the Middle Class.\u201d Heather Booth, director of a Saul Alinsky-style community organization group, was among the speakers at the \u201c2011 State Battles Summit.\n\nThis one falls under the \u201cNow I\u2019ve heard everything\u201d category, but WND reported when a board of county commissioners in North Carolina asked the Supreme Court for help: Its members don\u2019t believe they should have to forbid volunteers from mentioning the name of Jesus in prayers offered before their meetings.\n\n2012\n\nWND\u2019s Chelsea Schilling wrote about \u201cBig Love\u201d and \u201cSister Wives\u201d television shows about polygamy, and the surging momentum for the status that was banned by Congress in 1862, based are arguments identical to those used by same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d advocates to pursue their agenda.\n\nWND broke the story when Dr. James Dobson, of Family Talk Radio, issued a message both loud and clear to President Obama: \u201cI WILL NOT pay the surcharge for abortion services \u2026 come and get me if you must, Mr. President. I will not bow before your wicked regulation.\u201d The fight became part of the massive public backlash against the government over Obamacare.\n\n2013\n\nEducation long has been a focus on WND reporting, including when at a national convention in Atlanta, the National Education Association \u201cencouraged teachers to dance to a sexually explicit rap song that featured the \u2018N\u2019-word and declared, \u2018When it\u2019s over you ain\u2019t gon need ya vibrator.'\u201d\n\nWhen a woman was shot and killed virtually in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol, WND reporter Garth Kant was on the scene. He found out that little information was available from the officers who did the shooting, or witnesses. But he\u2019s been digging into the case ever since, recently using the Freedom of Information Act to try to find out why Miriam Carey was shot and killed.\n\n2014\n\nA startling trend started developing regarding Obama, and WND was there to report: Crowds starting simply walking out on him. Video captured crowds departing even while Obama continued to speak.\n\nAnd it was WND writer Leo Hohmann who reported the Obama administration was greasing the skids for tens of thousands of refugees, mostly Muslim, to be brought from Syria to the United States and dropped off at cities across the countryside.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The IRS has been in the news much in recent months over that admission that the bureaucracy targeted Christians and tea-party groups with what essentially was harassment.
