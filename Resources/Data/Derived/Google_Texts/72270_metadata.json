If this were ever enacted it would only serve to shuffle the healthy people into one set of health insurance policies and the sick into another thereby driving down costs for the healthy and in return just driving costs up for the sick\u2013\u2013and accomplishing nothing toward fundamentally making insurance cheaper.\n\nPeople who promote the idea are targeting the many state benefit mandates that drive health insurance policy prices up. The idea is, after the federal Obamacare mandates are repealed, to allow the sale of cheaper policies from states with the fewest benefit mandates to be able to be sold in high mandate states\u2013\u2013thereby encouraging the state with more mandates to curtail them.\n\nBut if their aim is to eliminate many of these \u201cexcessive\u201d state benefit mandates with a federal law, why not just curtail these mandates in all of the states with a federal law? If they are going to stick their federal noses into some of the states that have traditionally regulated insurance, why not just go ahead and stick their noses in all of the states at once and create a level playing field while they are at it?\n\nContinue Reading\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Galen Institute", "description": "By Robert Laszewski.
