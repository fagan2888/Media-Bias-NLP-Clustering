Highmark first revealed losses last fall, stating then that the loss was due to unexpectedly high use of services among those covered under the ACA.\n\nThose losses have now reached about $500 million, according to Alexis Miller, senior vice president of individual and small group business at Highmark.\n\nHighmark's earnings report for 2015 hasn't been released.\n\nDespite the losses, Miller said, \u201cWe are certainly committed to this market and certainly recognize that it is underserved.\u201d\n\nMiller said that physician payment fee reductions aren\u2019t the first way the insurer has attempted to address its losses, and it won\u2019t be the last.\n\nIn the past, Highmark has also made adjustments to its product portfolio, invested in new care-management strategies and made adjustments to broker commissions.\n\n\u201cThis is just one in a series of steps that we are thoughtfully taking,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWhen asked how much the company expects to save by reducing physician payment fees, Miller responded, \u201cWhat\u2019s more important to focus on is the impact to the average physician.\u201d\n\nMiller said Highmark has estimated the revenue impact on physicians to be about half a percent.\n\nLast year, Highmark had about 350,000 ACA members across all of its markets. Numbers for this enrollment period are not yet available.\n\nIn response to Highmark's fee reduction, the Pennsylvania Medical Society is asking about the purpose of Highmark\u2019s estimated $2 billion to $3.8 billion in reserves, and why the formula to calculate ACA utilization appears to have been off.\n\nMiller responded that reserves are for managing short-term periods of recovery, not to sustain long-term finances.\n\n\u201cIn this case, with the ACA market, it is a question of long-term sustainability, and reserves aren\u2019t the answer to that,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take steps that will have a year-over-year impact on sustainability.\u201d\n\nIn a letter, meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Academy of Family Physicians asked the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance to intervene in Highmark\u2019s decision.\n\nThe insurance department has not yet received the letter, according to Ali Fogarty, deputy press secretary, and the department declined to comment further.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Central Penn Business Journal", "description": "Physician-focused organizations in Pennsylvania are questioning the rationale behind a Harrisburg-area insurer's decision to slash reimbursement for patients covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Physicians raise concern over payment cuts by local payer | CPBJ", "url": "http://www.cpbj.com/article/20160225/BLOGEXTRA/160229886/physicians-raise-concern-over-payment-cuts-by-local-payer", "image": "http://www.cpbj.com/images/cpbj-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "cpbj.com", "description": "Physician-focused organizations in Pennsylvania are questioning the rationale behind a Harrisburg-area insurer's decision to slash reimbursement for patients covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Physicians raise concern over payment cuts by local payer | CPBJ", "image": {"src": "http://www.cpbj.com/images/cpbj-logo-share.jpg"}, "site": "@cpbj", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Physician-focused organizations in Pennsylvania are questioning the rationale behind a Harrisburg-area insurer's decision to slash reimbursement for patients covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Miller responded that reserves are for managing short-term periods of recovery, not to sustain long-term finances.\nHighmark announced that it will reimburse physicians 4.5 percent less for patients covered under ACA plans starting April 1, and both the Pennsylvania Medical Society and the Pennsylvania Academy of Family Physicians responded this week with official statements.\nThose losses have now reached about $500 million, according to Alexis Miller, senior vice president of individual and small group business at Highmark.\nIt is no secret that insurance companies have lost money because of the ACA.\nHighmark first revealed losses last fall, stating then that the loss was due to unexpectedly high use of services among those covered under the ACA."}
