GOP strategist Ed Gillespie is resurfacing on K Street following his narrow defeat last year in a battle for a Senate seat.

He is rejoining the consulting firm Brunswick Group as a senior counselor, splitting his time between its Washington office and his own firm, Ed Gillespie Strategies, which he formed in 2009.

ADVERTISEMENT At Brunswick, he will work on corporate reputation, crisis communications, data security, campaign strategies and public affairs issues for clients.

“Ed’s insights and experience will bring tremendous value to the firm as we continue to grow our Washington, D.C. practice and our global public affairs offer,” said Nick Lovegrove, Brunswick’s U.S. managing partner, in a statement.

The global firm has grown to 23 offices located in 14 countries over the last 25 years. Brunswick briefly had registered lobbyists working for a handful of clients about a decade ago, but no longer has any direct advocacy, according to disclosure records.

“Brunswick Group provides its clients with the best communications advice in the world,” Gillespie said in a release. “I’m excited to be working with the firm again, and specifically, with the Washington office.”

Gillespie has not been a registered lobbyist since the mid-2000s, when he was working for another firm he founded, Quinn Gillespie & Associates, now known as QGA Public Affairs.
