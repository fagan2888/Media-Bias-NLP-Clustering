This compares to 6% recorded in a study by the same researchers in 2009, which did not factor in deals between 2005 and 2008.\n\nThe findings challenge the view by some industry figures that leverage has fuelled returns from deals made during the buyout boom. For private equity deals made between 2005 and 2008, 40% of value was created through growth in EBITDA and 29% through leverage.\n\nThis represents a shift from deals made between 2001 and 2004, when 31% of value was created through EBITDA growth and 35% through leverage.\n\n\u201cDespite the higher entry leverage across deals made during the buyout boom, the leverage contribution in value creation was lower,\u201d said Kairat Perembetov, a vice president in research at Capital Dynamics. \u201cEBITDA growth was the highest single value creation driver across those deals, and that explains why the leverage contribution was lower, because with the deals that were made during the buyout boom general partners had to work on the growth of EBITDA in order to pay down the higher entry leverage that was put into those deals.\n\n\u201cYou read all these things about private equity just being financial engineering, this study shows that this is not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nOliver Gottschalg, a professor at HEC Paris and founder of Peracs Analytics, who was not connected with the study, said that the message from the findings is particularly relevant to investors.\n\n\u201cSome of them might have wondered \u2018what does private equity really do for the fees we\u2019re paying other than generating leveraged equity returns?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re realizing that there has been alpha even after the crisis, and these guys actually do something beyond leverage that fundamentally enhances the profitability of the target that they acquire. That is an important message for limited partners [investors] to consider with respect to where they want to put private equity in their asset allocation going forward.\u201d\n\n-Write to Alec Macfarlane at alec.macfarlane@wsj.com and follow on Twitter @AlecMac11", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Operational improvements, rather than debt, have fuelled returns at private equity-backed businesses sold since the financial crisis, according to a new study.", "title": "Data Buffet: Buyout Firms Graduate From Debt-Fuelled Returns", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/06/24/data-buffet-buyout-firms-graduate-from-debt-fuelled-returns/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Data Buffet: Buyout Firms Graduate From Debt-Fuelled Returns", "description": "Operational improvements, rather than debt, have fuelled returns at private equity-backed businesses sold since the financial crisis, according to a new study.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Alec Macfarlane", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Operational improvements, rather than debt, have fuelled returns at private equity-backed businesses sold since the financial crisis, according to a new study.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-24T18:15:50-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/06/24/data-buffet-buyout-firms-graduate-from-debt-fuelled-returns/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-16970", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Operational improvements, rather than debt, have fuelled returns at private equity-backed businesses sold since the financial crisis, according to a new study.", "title": "Data Buffet: Buyout Firms Graduate From Debt-Fuelled Returns", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/06/24/data-buffet-buyout-firms-graduate-from-debt-fuelled-returns/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-16970", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-24T18:06:37-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf018\"", "article_summary": "Overall, private equity deals yielded an annualized rate of return of 41% on average, while publicly traded peers returned 15%.\n\u201cSome of them might have wondered \u2018what does private equity really do for the fees we\u2019re paying other than generating leveraged equity returns?\u2019\u201d he said.\n(This item also appears in Private Equity News, a U.K. trade publication owned by Dow Jones & Co.)After excluding leverage, private equity deals averaged an annual unlevered return of 28% compared to 14% for public equities, resulting in operational private equity alpha of 14%.\nThe findings challenge the view by some industry figures that leverage has fuelled returns from deals made during the buyout boom.\nFor private equity deals made between 2005 and 2008, 40% of value was created through growth in EBITDA and 29% through leverage."}
