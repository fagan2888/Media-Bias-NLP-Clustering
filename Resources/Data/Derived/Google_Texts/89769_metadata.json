Amid the upset, confusion, outrage, and applause that exploded in the wake of the freeze, this professional recommended the following:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s reserve judgment and self-righteous indignation \u2026 until the facts are known.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be the first, or even the thousandth, to say that there are a lot of questions about how and why New Mexico\u2019s Human Services Department initiated and handled this funding crisis. Though the overall number of providers involved is relatively small \u2014 15 \u2014 the scope of the freeze was stunning, since these providers served more than 85 percent of the state\u2019s 30,000 seriously mentally ill people. It\u2019s a crisis that certainly disrupted and may yet decimate behavioral health services in that state.\n\nIn a story like this one, there is plenty to hear from those who believe that something is terribly wrong. First, of course, is the state\u2019s HSD, which defends the freeze decision based on its findings of \u201ccredible allegations of fraud\u201d and maintains that its actions are entirely \u201cby the book.\u201d But there are many others as well:\n\nThe 30,000 people battling serious mental illness whose services were disrupted.\n\nThe CEOs, providers, and managers of the defunded agencies who in a number of cases were forcibly separated their life\u2019s work.\n\nThose who worry about the ramifications of the freeze, a \u201ctransition\u201d process that is forcing the restructuring of about a dozen of the 15 providers under state-appointed transition managers.\n\nThose who fear the destruction of statewide culture of collaboration that, through years of effort, linked the state, behavioral health providers, and consumer-driven collaboratives in an energetic service transformation program.\n\nThe fact that all of these things are occurring without an official finding of provider fraud \u2014 according to a provision of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is what seems most terribly wrong. How could this happen to 15 organizations at once? What does this mean for us? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to know. For this reason, our coverage focuses on the clash of legal interpretations over the payment provisions of the Affordable Care Act and how these interpretations might shape the outcome of this story and more to come.\n\nMeanwhile, the larger questions of the story remain unanswered: Will the \u201ccredible allegations of fraud\u201d held by New Mexico will add up to the real thing? Did leaders we know, work with, or advocate with commit fraud or ask others to do so? Do states really have the power to halt your organization\u2019s funding without notice and legally put CEOs or other agency leaders on the street?\n\nNew Mexico officials point to the law, point to their findings, and state a confident \u201cYes.\u201d And, until all the facts of the case are known, that opinion is the only fact that matters.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07bd\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a crisis that certainly disrupted and may yet decimate behavioral health services in that state.\nThose who fear the destruction of statewide culture of collaboration that, through years of effort, linked the state, behavioral health providers, and consumer-driven collaboratives in an energetic service transformation program.\nIn a story like this one, there is plenty to hear from those who believe that something is terribly wrong.\nThe CEOs, providers, and managers of the defunded agencies who in a number of cases were forcibly separated their life\u2019s work.\nDo states really have the power to halt your organization\u2019s funding without notice and legally put CEOs or other agency leaders on the street?"}
