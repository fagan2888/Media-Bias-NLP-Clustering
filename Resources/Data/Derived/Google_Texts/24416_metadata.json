The e-mail pitched the Republican National Committee\u2019s \u201cbrand new travel tumbler\u201d so \u201cyou can let \u00adeveryone know that it\u2019s time for America to wake up.\u201d\n\nSure enough, it pictured a splashy red cup with a stylized elephant over the words \u201cWake Up America.\u201d By using a promo code, I would get 10 percent off!\n\nBut something was missing \u2014 there was no price listed. Ten percent off what? It was such an obvious error that I thought the e-mail must be a hoax or a joke.\n\nYou know, like the Republican Party itself.\n\nA priceless tumbler is a priceless metaphor for a party leadership that is foolish enough to openly conspire to thwart the front-runner of its presidential field. The meeting where the pashas and pooh-bahs discussed how they could block Donald Trump was described as hush-hush. That makes sense only if you think 20 well-known Republicans could meet in a DC restaurant and nobody would squeal to The Washington Post.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume boss Reince Priebus, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others wanted word to get out that they were aiming to dump Trump. Given that national polls show him with twice as much support as his closest rival, their scheming borders on political malpractice.\n\nIt signals that the quaking core of the GOP establishment is more afraid of Trump than of a President Hillary Clinton.\n\nInstead of seeing an opportunity in the fact that Clinton herself is confused about how to handle Trump, his party leaders have decided they can\u2019t stomach him.\n\nTo be sure, The Donald has that effect on many people, but most are not Republicans. While the leaders claim to be looking for a winner in November, they are overlooking the fact that no candidate of their liking has been able to command the support of more than a small fraction of the party\u2019s actual members.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump the leaders don\u2019t like. They are also not fond of Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. In effect, they don\u2019t like anybody that actual GOP voters like.\n\nBy deluding themselves that Jeb Bush is going to rise again or that Mitt Romney is available for a draft, the leaders are revealing their ignorance and arrogance. When even the gentle Carson blasts the anti-Trump conclave and threatens to bolt the party if the nominating rules are changed, you know the plotting is a first-class screw-up.\n\nLike it or not, Trump has captured the national mood of \u201cHELL NO\u201d better than anybody else. From illegal immigration to Islamic terrorism to America\u2019s standing in the world, he offers visceral confirmation about voter concerns over decline.\n\nPoll after poll shows that most Republicans aren\u2019t looking for policy white papers; they want somebody who gets their angst and anger. Sizable numbers of independents and Democrats want the same thing.\n\nSure, Trump can be crude and vulgar and mean and his rogue campaign is way outside any box. But if his flaws are fatal, one of his rivals should be able to put together a march through the primaries and win the old-fashioned way \u2014 by getting the most delegates.\n\nFor the bosses to try to find a legal trick to manipulate that result would be an act of suicide. They don\u2019t have to embrace Trump, but they should have enough respect for democracy and their own limits to let the process play out.\n\nAfter all, nobody can say for sure what will happen in Iowa or New Hampshire or anyplace else. But it is certain that making Trump a victim of insider dirty tricks would be the fastest way to boost his outsider appeal.\n\nAnd that could lead to the worst possible outcome for the party. If Trump is forced out and runs as an independent, it is more likely the Republican nominee would finish third than first, and Democrats would almost certainly win the White House and one or both houses of Congress.\n\nIn that event, the pashas and pooh-bahs could fill their unsold crates of priceless red tumblers with beer and have a pity party. They could even do it in public, and nobody would care.\n\nBlasio placing blame on you\n\nQuestion: How do you know when a politician is failing?\n\nAnswer: When he blames his problems on \u201ccommunications.\u201d\n\nEnter Bill de Blasio. Mayor Putz is so certain he\u2019s right about everything that he\u2019s stumped about why New Yorkers aren\u2019t bursting with adoration and gratitude.\n\nSo he\u2019s decided that widespread criticism of his policies on homelessness and affordable housing means that people just don\u2019t understand the facts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job of . . . communicating the solutions we\u2019re working on,\u201d he told a TV interviewer. Later, he said that if something is \u201cnot getting the kind of response we expected, I start with the assumption we\u2019re not explaining it well enough.\u201d\n\nThere is another option. It\u2019s best captured by an old tale about Madison Avenue trying to sell a certain dog food.\n\nTasked with making a commercial where dogs would be filmed wolfing down the product, the admen had no luck. When even hungry hounds turned up their noses, the admen admitted defeat with honesty: \u201cThe dogs don\u2019t like the dog food.\u201d\n\nSo it is with de Blasio and his big-ticket solutions to every problem. People live in the here and now and expect City Hall to fix what\u2019s broken. They want a mayor to fill the potholes, catch the crooks and clean the streets.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough for him. Like his idol in the White House, the mayor envisions himself as a Great Transformer. The city must be remade!\n\nHis problem isn\u2019t a failure to communicate that vision. It\u2019s that the public doesn\u2019t share it because people don\u2019t trust his leadership.\n\nThey see that the results so far are more disorder, chaos and polarization. They don\u2019t like what he\u2019s serving and certainly don\u2019t want more of it.\n\nNY Times putting on a front\n\nTwo thoughts about The New York Times boasting that its front-page editorial on gun control was the first time an editorial had been \u201cfronted\u201d in its paper since 1920.\n\nFirst, that means the paper thinks gun control is more important than anything that happened in World War II, the assassination of JFK, the civil-rights era, Vietnam, the moon landing, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 9/11, Iraq and everything else in the last 95 years.\n\nSecond, the claim about making history isn\u2019t even true. Editorials appear on the front page every day. They\u2019re just mislabeled as news stories.\n\n\u2018Common\u2019 enemies\n\nThe easiest way to make sense of the complex recommendations from Gov.
