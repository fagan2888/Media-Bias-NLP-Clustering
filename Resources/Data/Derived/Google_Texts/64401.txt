The final piece of the tower fell around 3:30 p.m. on Monday, hitting the ground with a loud thud.

The tower stood at more than 1,572 feet tall, around 300 feet higher than the Empire State Building.

The historic tower was dismantled because it wasn't being used anymore as a result of the changing media landscape.
