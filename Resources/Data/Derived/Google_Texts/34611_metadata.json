This means big trouble for uninsured women who have just discovered that they\u2019re pregnant.\n\nThough it may seem like a no-brainer, pregnancy is not defined as a \u201cqualifying event\u201d to obtain health insurance outside of the open enrollment period.\n\nOfficials including NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer, Sen. Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Assemblymember Aravella Simotas (D-Queens) point out that this policy costs more money and trouble than it saves, and are working on state legislation to change it.\n\nThe legislation would treat pregnancy as a \u201cqualifying event\u201d for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStringer, who has written to the state Department of Health requesting a regulatory change, released a report on Thursday describing the dilemma faced by pregnant women who find they\u2019ve missed the official timetable. Prenatal healthcare can cost upwards of $20,000 out of pocket, leading some women to simply skip it.\n\n\u201cExpectant mothers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between seeking prenatal care and paying the rent, yet this is the choice the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is placing upon women who become pregnant at the wrong time,\u201d Stringer said in a statement. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a women\u2019s issue -- -it\u2019s a societal issue in which all of us have a stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure of the ACA to recognize pregnancy as a qualifying event for accessing health coverage outside of special enrollment periods is a glaring error that must be remedied,\u201d Krueger said in a statement.\n\nAssemblymember Simotas called the legislation a \u201ccommon sense legislative fix.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stringer\u2019s report, every $1 of counseling and nutrition advice provided to pregnant women can save between $1.77 and $3.33 in medical care in the first 60 days after birth.\n\nBabies born to women who receive no prenatal care have an infant mortality rate five times that of women who received recommended care, and are three times more likely to be born at low birth weight, requiring hospitalization and neo-natal intensive care.\n\nThe non-profit group Young Invincibles (YI) in February issued a study on the issue of prenatal care. Besides pointing out the benefits of allowing pregnant women to enroll in insurance year round, YI also looked at why insurers might not want to allow it.\n\nInsurers worry that allowing anytime enrollment could \u201cincentivize women to wait to sign up for health insurance until they become pregnant,\u201d YI explains. This is known as \u201cadverse selection,\u201d offering a bad return on investment for insurance companies and increased costs for the pool of insured individuals.\n\nYI maintains the concerns are overblown, however, chiefly because of a \u201cdecreasing number of women without insurance, and the decreasing number of plans that do not offer maternity coverage.\n\n\u201cThis significantly reduces concerns about risk pool destabilization and premium increases,\u201d the group says. By 2019, health care reform could further reduce the number of uninsured individuals by tens of millions, they add.\n\nOther advocacy groups, including A Better Balance and the New York Civil Liberties Union, have backed the legislation.\n\nStringer\u2019s report is titled: \u201cTime to Deliver: Pregnancy and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation would permit pregnant women to obtain insurance year round.
