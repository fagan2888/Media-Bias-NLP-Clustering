Following the death of SurveyMonkey CEO David Goldberg, the United States has been forced to evaluate the safety of its most popular piece of exercise equipment. Physical activity is an important part of our health, but it should always be done with safety in mind. Data collected by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has revealed that over 20,000 Americans were admitted to a hospital’s emergency department due to treadmill-related injuries last year.

Goldberg, who is also the husband of Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, allegedly suffered severe head trauma after slipping on a treadmill at his hotel in Mexico. The debate over treadmill safety entered the public spotlight in May 2009 when boxing legend Mike Tyson’s 7-year-old son Miguel found his 4-year-old daughter Exodus unconscious with the cord from the family’s treadmill wrapped around her neck. She died as a result of her injuries the next day.

Researchers from the CPSC conducted an extensive review of its database system that revealed nearly 460,000 people who were sent to a hospital in 2012 due to an exercise-related injury. A total of 24,400 injuries were tied to treadmills, including broken bones, abrasions, rectal bleeding, and chest pain during exercise. Between 2003 and 2012, 30 reported deaths have been linked to treadmills. Around 62,700 injuries were caused by swimming pools, weights, and trampolines.

Although ambitious gym rats should always account for safety while using exercise equipment, physical activity is essential for a healthy lifestyle and should never be neglected. To help Americans stay safe while staying fit, Consumer Reports offers seven steps to safe treadmill use and a good workout:

1. Clear the area

2. Use the safety key

3. Straddle the deck

4. Keep your head up

5. Don’t overdo it

6. Come to a complete stop

7. Keep children away
