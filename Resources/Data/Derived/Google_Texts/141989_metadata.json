In two highly publicized announcements last week, top Obama health officials claimed the Affordable Care Act is slowing health care spending and improving hospital safety.\n\nThe media parroted these boasts, but the evidence shows they\u2019re bogus.\n\nEven as administration figures \u2014 from President Obama down \u2014 distance themselves from Jonathan Gruber, the ObamaCare adviser caught calling the public stupid, they\u2019re still relying on his playbook: They assume we\u2019re not going to check their facts.\n\nOn Dec. 3, federal actuaries released data showing that health spending inched up only 3.6 percent in 2013.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, boasted that it\u2019s \u201cevidence that our efforts to reform the health-care-delivery system are working.\u201d Sorry, not true.\n\nThat 3.6 percent figure is an improvement only by a hair.\n\nThe real slowing of health care spending started way back in 2009, in the wake of the Great Recession, long before ObamaCare even passed. Health spending slowed to a comfortable 3.8 percent rise that year, and stayed at that slow pace in 2010.\n\nNot that the president acknowledged that health spending was growing at the slowest rate in a half-century.\n\nTo pass his health bill, he needed a crisis. So he and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius repeatedly lied, warning that costs were \u201cskyrocketing,\u201d spending was \u201cspiraling\u201d out of control and health needs would gobble up ever more GDP unless Congress quickly passed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFast-forward to today. There\u2019s nothing remarkable about the 3.6 percent rate in 2013. But there is bad news ahead, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFederal actuaries predict that health spending increases will nearly double soon, averaging 6 percent a year through 2023, pushing total health spending to a staggering 19.3 percent of GDP, up from 16.6 percent pre-ObamaCare.\n\nSo much for ObamaCare controlling costs.\n\nWhat of the boast that the president\u2019s health law is making it safer to go to the hospital? Don\u2019t bet on that, either.\n\nOn Dec. 2, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced \u201cdemonstrable progress\u201d in making hospital care safer.\n\nHer report claims that some 50,000 fewer patients died from bed sores, infections, medication errors, falls and other mishaps from 2010 to 2013, largely due to new payment incentives and a patient safety program in ObamaCare.\n\nThat happy claim was repeated verbatim by many media outlets.\n\nNot so fast, say patient safety experts who actually read the report.\n\nDr. Peter Pronovost, senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine, and Dr. Ashish Jha of the Harvard School of Public Health had already taken to the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine to caution about the patient safety program\u2019s cherry-picking methodology, lack of data transparency and unsubstantiated claims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to tell,\u201d they said, whether the program\u2019s changes \u201cled to better care.\u201d\n\nThe administration bragged about reducing infections, but didn\u2019t count the type of infection that kills the most patients \u2014 Clostridium difficile or C. diff.\n\nThat\u2019s like a kid\u2019s report card that leaves out reading and math. It doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nTruth is, C. diff is raging through hospitals. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Thomas Frieden calls it one of the \u201cnightmare bacteria.\u201d\n\nIt kills 14,000 patients a year, and increases your risk of dying while in the hospital by 75 percent.\n\nThe Leapfrog Group, a trusted patient safety advocacy outfit, released a new assessment of US hospitals on Oct. 30 that gave 41 percent of hospitals C, D or F grades because patients there were harmed by medical mistakes, falls and other injuries and infections.\n\nAccording to Leapfrog, progress on patient safety is stagnant \u2014 and by some measures hospitals are doing worse. That\u2019s the opposite of what the administration claims.\n\nFinagling data is nothing new for the Obama team. Just weeks ago, it was caught red-handed inflating ObamaCare enrollment numbers by counting dental-only plans as health insurance.\n\nTruth is, four years after its passage, the ACA has managed to cover only one out of four previously uninsured people, spending $57 billion to do it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s forced millions to give up plans they liked and pushed employers to cut hours and jobs \u2014 as well as inciting voters to retire dozens of Democratic members of Congress.\n\nInstead of lying about ObamaCare, some top Democrats are taking another tack, distancing themselves from this increasingly toxic issue. Shrewd politicians like Sens. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) can spot a loser.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is chair of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The ObamaCare lies keep coming.
