Videos threatening violence are against YouTube\u2019s guidelines and we remove them when they are flagged,\" Smith told the Post.\n\nYouTube's community guidelines prohibit videos displaying \u201cpredatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment [and] intimidation . . . and inciting others to commit violent acts. . . . Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from YouTube.\u201d\n\nIn one of the videos, entitled \u201cElliot Rodger\u2019s Retribution,\" Rodger sits sun-lit in his black BMW, with palm trees in the background. He spoke of his murderous plans, saying, \u201cTomorrow is the day of retribution for the last 8 years of my life, ever since I\u2019ve hit puberty, I\u2019ve been forced to endure and existence of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires\u2026I don\u2019t know why you girls are not attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it,\u201d Roger said in his video.\n\nThough YouTube has removed the videos, news outlets and bloggers have redistributed them online.\n\nRodger's grim outlook was shared in a 138-page manifesto, which has been made readily available online.\n\nIn his writings, Rodger also makes his misogynistic views clear, saying \"Women are like a plague\u2026 They don\u2019t deserve to have any rights . . . Women are vicious, evil, barbaric animals, and they need to be treated as such.\"\n\nOne manifesto upload on scribd.com shows more than 510,035 views.\n\nHis anti-female ravings inspired #YesAllWomen, a social media conversation about the daily sexism faced by women, and their common experiences with misogyny, frustrations with entitlement and their fears about men.\n\nFollow Morgan Rousseau on Twitter: @MetroMorgan\n\nFollow Metro Boston on Twitter: @MetroBOS\n\nFollow Metro New York on Twitter: @Metronewyork\n\nFollow Metro Philly on Twitter: @MetroPhilly", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elliot Rodger videos removed from YouTube as manifesto spreads online", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Elliot Rodger videos removed from YouTube as manifesto spreads online", "title": "Elliot Rodger videos removed from YouTube", "url": "http://www.metro.us/news/elliot-rodger-videos-removed-from-youtube/tmWneA---58nmEYjDcl6as/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$quhv301phq3wfxbzddrze3mr1b9k5cr/elliot-rodger-screenshot-614x364.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Elliot Rodger videos removed from YouTube as manifesto spreads online", "title": "Elliot Rodger videos removed from YouTube", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$quhv301phq3wfxbzddrze3mr1b9k5cr/elliot-rodger-screenshot-614x364.jpeg"}, "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "mediatype": "Article", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "keywords": "National,Region Boston,Region National,Region New York,Region Philadelphia,Elliot-Rodger,california, Elliot Rodger, killing spree, mass shooting, massacre, shooting, videos, youtube", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-10", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/news/national", "published_time": "2014-05-27T16:19:49Z", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T16:19:49Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "National,Region Boston,Region National,Region New York,Region Philadelphia,Elliot-Rodger,california, Elliot Rodger, killing spree, mass shooting, massacre, shooting, videos, youtube"}, "article_summary": "Follow Morgan Rousseau on Twitter: @MetroMorganFollow Metro Boston on Twitter: @MetroBOSFollow Metro New York on Twitter: @MetronewyorkFollow Metro Philly on Twitter: @MetroPhilly\nA selection of angsty self-recorded videos uploaded by Elliot Rodger have been removed from YouTube, days after the 22-year-old went on a killing spree in Isla Vista, Calif.\nElliot Rodger is seen in a self-recorded YouTube video titled \"Why do girls hate me so much?\"\nThough YouTube has removed the videos, news outlets and bloggers have redistributed them online.\nYouTube spokeswoman Samantha Smith declined to tell the Post when Rodger's videos were uploaded, or when they came to the company's attention."}
