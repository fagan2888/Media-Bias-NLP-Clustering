Her old insurance is no longer offered, because it doesn\u2019t comply with ObamaCare requirements on preventive services, among other issues. In January, she logged onto the state health exchange and signed up for ObamaCare.\n\nLike many healthy young people, she chose a \u201cbronze\u201d plan, with an annual $5,800 deductible and a monthly premium of $357. She figured a more expensive \u201csilver\u201d or \u201cgold\u201d plan wasn\u2019t worth it, since she\u2019d never need to rely on the lower deductible of those plans.\n\nLast month, she came to see me for a routine follow-up visit and discovered that though her insurance plan was active, I wasn\u2019t covered by it, because her Blue Cross HMO hadn\u2019t chosen to include me or my hospital in its network. I charged her just $100 to see me, but this amount wasn\u2019t covered by her plan and didn\u2019t even count toward her whopping deductible because I was out-of-network.\n\nDuring that visit, I discovered that she had mild hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). The most likely cause of this in a young woman is an autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\n\nThis is a relatively benign disease that didn\u2019t require immediate treatment, but to confirm this diagnosis, I needed to do a blood test for thyroid antibodies, which she said she couldn\u2019t afford right away. I also needed to order a thyroid ultrasound to check for thyroid nodules, which she also said was too much to pay for.\n\nThese tests would count toward her deductible, but she was forced to shoulder 100 percent of the cost until she\u2019d spent the whole $5,800 of the deductible out of her own pocket.\n\nWe both came to the realization that her ObamaCare insurance was useless \u2014 that it was actually hurting her by providing the illusion of coverage.\n\nI felt very uncomfortable with this patient visit, because I wanted to help Melody but couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t too happy, either; she opted to change to a Silver plan (which does have me in-network), which meant a $2,300 deductible and a monthly premium of $450.\n\nShe still didn\u2019t have enough money set aside to pay for her thyroid tests, but at least when she does come up with the money, she\u2019ll be closer to working her way through the deductible.\n\nI wanted her to see an in-network endocrinologist, but she said she didn\u2019t want to pay his several-hundred-dollar consultation fee.\n\nPre-ObamaCare, her old insurance (not in New York, but not unlike policies others of my patients have had here) would\u2019ve covered the ultrasound and the lab tests, and all she\u2019d have to contribute was a $35 co-pay toward her office visits.\n\nWith her new insurance, even when her \u201csilver\u201d plan kicks in, Melody will be paying over $5,000 per year for a health-insurance policy that provides her with no health care whatsoever beyond paying for her birth-control pills.\n\nIt\u2019s a very small consolation that at least the $100 she pays me per visit to prescribe her pills will now count toward her deductible.\n\nHow does Melody\u2019s experience fit with President Obama\u2019s promises?\n\nWell, she couldn\u2019t keep her insurance. And she pays far more for the new plan but doesn\u2019t get to keep the same health care. True, she gets to keep her doctor, but this doctor\u2019s hands are tied in terms of what he can do to help her.\n\nDr. Marc Siegel is a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical correspondent.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The real face of ObamaCare paid me a visit last week; let\u2019s call her Melody.\nMelody, 27, works as a real-estate broker; the job doesn\u2019t provide for her health insurance.
