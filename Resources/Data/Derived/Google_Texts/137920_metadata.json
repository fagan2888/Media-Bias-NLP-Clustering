He was in a coma for more than two months.\n\nDoctors originally told Regina only 10% of people with Tommy\u2019s injuries actually wake up, and some stay in a vegetative state.\n\n\u201cNow he is awake and getting better every day,\u201d Regina told FOX40. \u201c\u201dIt\u2019s amazing, our children have their daddy to hold him kiss him.\u201d\n\nTommy is able to sit up, eat and Regina says his speech is getting better.\n\nThe couple decided to celebrate Tommy\u2019s recovery and got married on Christmas Day.\n\nBut the opportunity to have Tommy home with loved ones couldn\u2019t have happened without the support of friends, families and the Hubble Foundation; an organization dedicated to helping tower climbers\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cPeople can argue facts and figures, but the dangers we are exposed to every day are real,\u201d Bryce Mallory, another tower climber, said.\n\nMallory connected with the Jeglum\u2019s through the foundation, and has been offering a helping hand through Tommy\u2019s treatments.\n\n\u201cTo know that true love exists like that today. Today is a Christmas miracle,\u201d Mallory said of Regina and Tommy\u2019s wedding.\n\n*For more on this story click here.*", "article_metadata": {"description": "SACRAMENTO, California (KTXL)--Love knows no bounds; a terrifying fall, months-long coma and on-going therapy couldn't stop a Sacramento couple from tying the knot on Christmas Day.
