Tom Carper (D-DE), who introduced the bill last summer, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCongress must continue to work across the aisle to ensure that federal agencies crack down on charge card abuse and taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly across the federal government,\u201d he added.\n\nThe legislation, which now goes to the House, bolsters a 2012 law instructing federal agencies to firm up internal safeguards for identifying and stopping unauthorized purchases.\n\nThat law was inspired in part by a report earlier this year from the Defense Department finding that government credit card holders from across the agency improperly spent more than $1 million at casinos and adult entertainment clubs in a single year, according to Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA).\n\nRelated: More Federal Workers Abusing Government Credit Cards\n\n\u201cOur bill will make sure we\u2019re looking for similar patterns of misuse across all federal agencies and that agencies are sharing best practices to prevent misuse and identify potential cost savings,\u201d Grassley, who backed both waste measures, said in a statement.\n\nOf course, the Pentagon is hardly the only federal government agency experiencing such abuse. An audit by the Veterans Affairs Department last year found employees spent $650,000 in improper credit card purchases.\n\nLikewise, the inspector general for the Environmental Protection Agency reported that some agency\u2019s employees had used their federal charge cards to buy gym memberships for themselves and their family members.\n\nEchoing Grassley, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said the new bill is about more than catching employees red-handed. The data gleaned from the new layer of oversight can help Congress determine if the government is making smart purchases.\n\n\"We can use this data to find fraudulent uses of employee cards and determine where agencies are repetitively spending money on items that could be bought in bulk at lower cost,\u201d said Johnson, chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress thinks it\u2019s time the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department got out of the Parisian luxury hotel business.", "title": "Congress Takes Aim at Millions in Fraud on Government Credit Cards", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Congress-Takes-Aim-Millions-Fraud-Government-Credit-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/creditcards_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Congress-Takes-Aim-Millions-Fraud-Government-Credit-Cards", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/creditcards_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Congress thinks it\u2019s time the scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department got out of the Parisian luxury hotel business.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "An audit by the Veterans Affairs Department last year found employees spent $650,000 in improper credit card purchases.\nCongress has long struggled to prevent the fraudulent use of government credit cards, and now Senate lawmakers think it\u2019s time for another crackdown on the millions of dollars of waste seen each year.\nThe legislation, which now goes to the House, bolsters a 2012 law instructing federal agencies to firm up internal safeguards for identifying and stopping unauthorized purchases.\nLikewise, the inspector general for the Environmental Protection Agency reported that some agency\u2019s employees had used their federal charge cards to buy gym memberships for themselves and their family members.\n\u201cCongress must continue to work across the aisle to ensure that federal agencies crack down on charge card abuse and taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly across the federal government,\u201d he added."}
