But the hope is to engage as many presidential candidates as possible on these issues to find out where they stand.\n\nWhile some of the recommendations will be a nonstarter for Republican candidates \u2014 none support Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law \u2014 the group says a focus on the Hispanic community is really a bet on the country because of changing demographics.\n\n\u201cThe future of education in the nation is a Latino future,\u201d said NHLA chair Hector Sanchez, noting that 25% of students in the country are Hispanic.\n\nThe letter calls on candidates to \u201chold states and school districts accountable for improving the educational outcomes of Latino and English learner students\u201d because the future economic competitiveness of the country will depend in great part on the educational attainment of the growing Hispanic community.\n\nNHLA and one its member organizations, the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), have become involved in making the conversation around criminal justice and police abuse in the country one that includes Latinos as well. At the same time, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, led by Rep. Tony Cardenas sent a letter to the Justice Department this summer asking for statistics on Latinos killed by cops in the last five years.\n\nNHLA believes the issue needs to be given more prominence and Sanchez said a member organization Latino Justice PRLDEF is putting together an upcoming criminal justice summit on police brutality, mass incarceration and more.\n\nIn defending Obamacare, the letter said implementation of the law should continue because it \u201chas resulted in 2.6 million previously uninsured Latinos gaining health coverage during the first enrollment period alone.\u201d\n\nThe letter also calls on policies that help small businesses grow and more Latinos to be hired into the federal workforce.\n\nDuring a summer where Donald Trump has drawn attention to the issue of illegal immigration, using rhetoric about Mexican immigrants that has angered the Latino community, Sanchez said these policy priorities are an opportunity to refocus the debate on what will actually garner the support of the crucial bloc of Hispanic voters.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique opportunity to engage on real issues, substantial issues critical to Latinos,\u201d he said. \u201cIf presidential candidates want the Latino vote, it\u2019s a priority to know where they stand.\u201d\n\nAnd while he stressed that there are both progressive and conservative organizations among the 40 member coalition, he said this early outreach is just the first step in civic engagement and Latino voter education, because many of the groups are involved in voter registration efforts as well.\n\nNHLA will join Voto Latino, Mi Familia Vota, SEIU and be among 70 advocacy organizations in a Hispanic Heritage Month of Action launch this week to register Latino voters.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4021704, "userid": 741910}, "description": "In a letter sent to all presidential candidates, a coalition of 40 of the top national Latino organizations introduced policy...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
