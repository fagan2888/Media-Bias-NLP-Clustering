( Photo by Thomas Hawk, courtesy of Flickr/Creative Commons. )\n\nA new message appearing at the top of the menu at Camino, a high-end restaurant in Oakland, California, declares the end of an age-old American practice. \u201cNo more tips!\u201d it reads. \u201cOur prices now include service so we can pay our employees a living wage.\u201d\n\nThe new prices\u2014which have gone up 22 percent, and which now range from $29 to $37\u2014and the restaurant\u2019s corresponding tipping policy went into effect earlier this year, around the time the city\u2019s minimum wage rose 36 percent to $12.25. And the two are related. While the new policy probably won\u2019t put more into pockets of Camino\u2019s decently paid servers, it will do something quietly revolutionary: it will help them offer a living wage to their (traditionally underpaid) cooks, dishwashers, and bussers.\n\nCamino\u2019s husband-and-wife co-owners Russell Moore and Allison Hopelain shared their philosophy on the restaurant\u2019s website: \u201cWe have tried to instill a sense of teamwork at Camino\u2014a place where each member of the team\u2014waiters, bartenders, cooks, hosts and dishwashers\u2014is all involved in serving our guests. And yet, we have been paying them as if we are running two separate businesses.\u201d But the new policy changes all that.\n\nA server working on a recent weekend seemed optimistic, although she has the least to lose from the new arrangement. Her new hourly wage is livable, she said, even if it means she never walks away with the occasional motherlode of tips in the high season. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to stick it out through the year, it makes up for the lack of big nights in the high season on slow shifts, during the less-crowded times of year,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt means that all employees are paid based on their experience and have\n\nroom to grow,\u201d says Hopelain. \u201cWe offer any employee who is scheduled for five shifts a week health insurance and we do not cut shifts when we are slow.\u201d\n\nWhile a handful of cities across the country have plans to raise their minimum wages over the next five years, only a few have put the rubber to the road. Like Oakland and San Francisco, Seattle is taking a tiered approach to raising its minimum wage (i.e., different businesses are required to increase wages at varying rates, depending on their size) with the goal of hitting $15 an hour by 2020. While restaurants are inevitably passing some of these costs on to their customers, many are also taking the opportunity to develop progressive pay models that could begin to level the playing fields between the front and back of the house.\n\nRaising food prices to replace tipping is only one of the approaches Oakland restaurants are taking to survive the wage hike and redistribute the wealth.\n\nAt several other restaurants around the city, such as Toast, Boca Nova diners now pay an added 15 to 20 percent service charge. Although it doesn\u2019t make a big difference in the final amount paid, service charges might be an easier pill for some customers to swallow than higher menu prices.\n\nDr. Michael Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior and marketing at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, says that his research shows that, \u201cpeople don\u2019t think about the tip as a part of restaurants\u2019 expensiveness.\u201d The same goes for a service charges, he adds. \u201cSo voluntary tipping and service charges are roughly the same in terms of perceptions of cost.\u201d\n\nIn both cases the goal is to improve living conditions for the lowest paid workers in the chain\u2014while paying their bills and retaining their most valuable employees.\n\nAn Industry Rife With Inequality\n\nThe American restaurant industry can be seen as a microcosm for the nation as a whole, in that it has long upheld a strong class divide. On the one hand, you have servers, bartenders, and hosts who run the \u201cfront of the house\u201d in high-end restaurants. These jobs are often seen as a means to an end, a notorious way to help finance higher education and beginning careers in the arts, or\u2014in some cases\u2014a path to advance to a higher-profile career in the food world.\n\nBut for back of the house workers, as well as servers in lower-end establishments and most casual chain restaurants (think: the thousands of Red Lobsters and Olive Gardens around the country), that\u2019s simply not the case. The median hourly wage in the restaurant industry, including tips, is just $10, compared with $18 outside the restaurant industry. And just as they do in our nation at large, gender and race play an important role in this divide.\n\nAccording to the Restaurant Opportunity Center United, an advocacy group working for restaurant workers around the nation, the median wage among white restaurant workers is almost $4 per hour higher than the median wage among restaurant workers of color, who are most likely to work the lowest-paying positions like cashiers. Similarly, ROC says female restaurant workers \u201csuffer a 21.8 percent gender tax even after experience, education, and English language ability are accounted for.\u201d\n\nAccording to Saru Jayaraman, director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California at Berkeley and co-director of ROC United, \u201cSeventy percent of tipped workers are women\u2013women who suffer from deep poverty.\u201d In fact, one in six restaurant workers lives below the poverty line. Furthermore, the current approach to paying tipped workers tends to compound these problems. While a handful of states don\u2019t differentiate between the minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers, many pay them much less, and the federal minimum has been $2.13 since 1991. (ROC United has been campaigning to do away with tipped minimum wage entirely in recent years.)\n\nCan Fair Wage Pioneers Survive the Jump?\n\nIn light of this context, the move away from tipping appears all the more progressive. But the big question is: Will the restaurants working the hardest to level the playing field for their employees be able to survive the shift?\n\nTake Sal Bednarz, owner of Actual Caf\u00e9 and Victory Burger, a side-by-side caf\u00e9 and casual grass-fed burger joint in Oakland.\n\n\u201cAll of our employees are making more than they were, but it\u2019s our kitchen workers who have benefited considerably,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re happy about that\u2014we\u2019re happy about that.\u201d\n\nBednarz says he raised his prices by 9 percent to account for the wage increase, and after an initial uptick in business, he\u2019s seen what he calls \u201csoftness in certain areas of business,\u201d including the caf\u00e9\u2019s counter lunch and breakfast service, which he says are more price sensitive than the table service they offer in the evenings. He hasn\u2019t moved to a service charge because, he says, it just isn\u2019t possible for counter service.\n\nThe Actual Caf\u00e9\u2019s location hasn\u2019t helped either. \u201cWe\u2019re a block away from the city of Emeryville and a few blocks from Berkeley,\u201d Bednarz. \u201cThe fact that our minimum wage went up before those other cities meant that some of our most price-sensitive customers probably went elsewhere for their latt\u00e9s.\u201d In the long term, he says, he trusts that those cities will follow suit with higher wages, but Bednarz is nervous about the long-term viability of his and other small businesses that run on extremely tight margins.\n\n\u201cI believe that the long-term macro-economic forces at work here will put more money into lots of workers\u2019 pockets and wages will go up everywhere, creating more disposable income for folks. And retail prices will go up as a result of folks paying higher wages. So I\u2019m not sure which will be the stronger force. We may end up paying our workers more, but they\u2019ll have less spending power in the end. It\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d\n\nFooting the Bill\n\nIn Seattle, several restaurants are responding to the city\u2019s recent wage increases and getting out ahead of the coming ones, including casual seafood restaurant Ivar\u2019s and the higher-end Sea Creatures chain, which have both gotten rid of tips and brought all their workers up to at least $15 an hour.\n\nThe decision, says Sea Creatures co-owner Jeremy Price, came as a result of a combination of the rising city wages, the need to provide health insurance for their workers via the Affordable Care Act, and a philosophy that he describes as \u201cnot loving tips in the first place.\u201d\n\nAll the Sea Creatures Restaurants now include a 20 percent service charge, added on to the bill. And there is no longer a space on the credit card slip for tips. Price says his customers have been quick to adapt to the change, and some even leave small cash tips when they are especially happy with the service. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very few complaints,\u201d he says.\n\nAs at Camino and other Bay Area restaurants, Price and his partners have set up a system that maintains server pay of $31 to $40 an hour (including both wages and a percentage of the service charge), and now servers are also eligible for health insurance and a 401K retirement plan.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a ton of cooks making less than $15, but now they are all making at least that,\u201d says Price, who estimates that, \u201cIf you aggregate all the cooks, it\u2019s around a 7 percent increase.\u201d\n\nPrice says the company has seen more people sign up for healthcare and 401K plans than expected. The service charge isn\u2019t covering all of that cost, he says, so Price and his co-owners are taking pay cuts.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to attract and retain the best people,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo long-term, this is going to be a win for us, and we\u2019re willing to take a pay cut to get there.\u201d\n\nIndeed, ROC\u2019s Jayaraman says the forward-thinking restaurants she\u2019s encountered feel that investing in their workers pays off in the long term. There\u2019s usually less turnover, she says, which saves costs. But that\u2019s not all. \u201cThey also see more invested employees interested in protecting their employers\u2019 bottom lines by reducing things like energy costs, and reducing food waste,\u201d she says.\n\nIt also has the potential to prompt a deeper sense of commitment to the work in other ways. The goal at Sea Creatures, Price says, \u201cis making service work a little more professional, creating a situation where people can treat it like a career.\u201d\n\nAt a time when the bulk of American workers are seeing wage stagnation, increasing income inequality and many employers\u2019 move toward less-formal contract and temporary employment, this is no small deal.\n\nCamino\u2019s Hopewell sees the shift as an opportunity to approach the way her employees work in a whole new way\u2013one that views the restaurant a little more like a single, living organism. \u201cIf there is a service issue, we address it as a restaurant concern. It is not just the server who gets a bad tip,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In cities like Oakland and Seattle, where the minimum wage is on the rise, restaurants are raising prices and rethinking tips as a way to level the playing", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Goodbye Tipping, Hello Living Wage: The Changing Face of Progressive Restaurants\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/bayareabites\\/2015\\/07\\/22\\/goodbye-tipping-hello-living-wage-the-changing-face-of-progressive-restaurants\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-22 14:50:02\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-22 15:00:05\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":98365,\"author_id\":\"5583\",\"author_name\":\"Civil Eats\",\"author_display_name\":\"Civil Eats\",\"tags\":[\"minimum wage\",\"Oakland minimum wage\",\"restaurant workers\",\"restaurant workers wages\"],\"categories\":[\"bay area\",\"Civil Eats\",\"east bay\",\"economy and food costs\",\"food trends and technology\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/bayareabites\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/24\\/2015\\/07\\/Homestead-680x453.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "Bay Area Bites", "description": "In cities like Oakland and Seattle, where the minimum wage is on the rise, restaurants are raising prices and rethinking tips as a way to level the playing field for workers.", "title": "Goodbye Tipping, Hello Living Wage: The Changing Face of Progressive Restaurants", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2015/07/22/goodbye-tipping-hello-living-wage-the-changing-face-of-progressive-restaurants/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2015/07/Homestead-680x453.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In cities like Oakland and Seattle, where the minimum wage is on the rise, restaurants are raising prices and rethinking tips as a way to level the playing field for workers.", "creator": "@CivilEats", "image": {"width": 680, "identifier": "http://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2015/07/Homestead-680x453.jpg", "height": 453}, "title": "Goodbye Tipping, Hello Living Wage: The Changing Face of Progressive Restaurants", "site": "@BayAreaBites", "widgets": {"link-color": "#000000", "border-color": "#000000"}, "partner": "tfwp", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "minimum wage,oakland minimum wage,restaurant workers,restaurant workers wages", "google-site-verification": "-0no7Gdd-CreGOvsvIvus_90srITnYezg2AJq5hkH5A", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(ROC United has been campaigning to do away with tipped minimum wage entirely in recent years.)\nAccording to the Restaurant Opportunity Center United, an advocacy group working for restaurant workers around the nation, the median wage among white restaurant workers is almost $4 per hour higher than the median wage among restaurant workers of color, who are most likely to work the lowest-paying positions like cashiers.\nThe median hourly wage in the restaurant industry, including tips, is just $10, compared with $18 outside the restaurant industry.\nRaising food prices to replace tipping is only one of the approaches Oakland restaurants are taking to survive the wage hike and redistribute the wealth.\nWhile a handful of states don\u2019t differentiate between the minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers, many pay them much less, and the federal minimum has been $2.13 since 1991."}
