Oklahoma City police arrested a second suspect in the assault and robbery of a casino winner.

According to police, on March 25, the victim told his friend, 25-year-old Derrick King, that he had just won $2,400 at a casino.



Police say the victim went to a carwash at 950 N. Council to meet King. However, when he arrived, two masked men, one of them later identified as 25-year-old Royal Jones, jumped him and started pistol-whipping him.

The suspects stole the victim's cellphone, wallet, and $270 in cash.
