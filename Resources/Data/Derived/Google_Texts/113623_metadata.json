Some revelers even keep track of the number of complete strangers they kiss.\n\nBecause Zika has been linked to microcephaly, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation scientists recommended that pregnant women take special precautions and avoid crowds during Carnival.\n\n\"In light of the possibility of being in contact with someone who is infected, do not kiss, obviously,\" Dr. Paulo Gadelha, the foundation's president, told reporters.\n\n\"We cannot say today that there is no possibility of transmission,\" Gadelha added.\n\nThe scientists said they used genetic testing to identify the virus in saliva and urine samples from the two patients, who had symptoms caused by Zika infection, and determined that the virus was active, meaning it had the potential to cause infection. They said more research was needed to determine whether Zika could be transmitted by either fluid.\n\nThey said this marked the first time the virus had been detected in either fluid.\n\nBrazil, the country hardest hit by Zika, is grappling with the virus even as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August.\n\nThe WHO said that between January 2014 and Feb. 5, 2016, a total of 33 countries have reported indigenous circulation of Zika virus. The U.N. agency also said there was evidence of indirect local transmission in six other countries.\n\nCDC TESTING GUIDELINES\n\nReflecting concern over potential harm to fetuses, the CDC updated its guidelines on Friday for testing pregnant women who have traveled to affected areas, saying even those without symptoms should be tested after returning home.\n\nThe guidelines recommend pregnant women be offered testing two to 12 weeks after returning home. The agency had earlier suggested tests only for those with symptoms of the illness, which causes a fever, rash and red eyes.\n\nThe CDC already earlier urged pregnant women not to travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. The agency has not issued guidance regarding kissing, Frieden said.\n\nAt the center of the concern over Zika, until recently viewed as a mild illness, is the possibility that infection with Zika during pregnancy may cause microcephaly.\n\nCDC chief Frieden said the suspected link appears \"stronger and stronger\" as researchers study whether there is a causal connection. He added that his agency is working with researchers in Brazil to study a potential link between Zika and a wider array of developmental disorders in babies.\n\nMuch remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly. Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly. Researchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly.\n\nFrieden and other U.S. health officials are due to testify before Congress next Wednesday on the Zika threat.\n\nBrazilians have been rushing to buy repellant, creating a shortage of some brands on pharmacy shelves and boosting sales for the industry - a trend some producers are preparing for elsewhere as the outbreak spreads.\n\n(Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago, Natalie Grover in Bengaluru, Paulo Prada and Caroline Stauffer in Sao Paulo; Writing by Frances Kerry and Will Dunham; Editing by Grant McCool and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "zika, virus, found, saliva, urine, brazil, cdc, offers, sex, advice", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "U.S. issued new guidelines around Zika after Brazilian authorities detected the virus in the saliva and urine of two patients on Friday.", "title": "CDC Offers Sex Advice Around Zika Virus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/zika-virus-saliva-urine-brazil-cdc-sex-advice-372484", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/06/zika-virus.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. issued new guidelines around Zika after Brazilian authorities detected the virus in the saliva and urine of two patients on Friday.", "title": "CDC Offers Sex Advice Around Zika Virus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/zika-virus-saliva-urine-brazil-cdc-sex-advice-372484", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/06/zika-virus.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/06/zika-virus.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-02-06T10:33:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-06T10:33:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "U.S. issued new guidelines around Zika after Brazilian authorities detected the virus in the saliva and urine of two patients on Friday."}, "article_summary": "The CDC already earlier urged pregnant women not to travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing.\nThe WHO said that between January 2014 and Feb. 5, 2016, a total of 33 countries have reported indigenous circulation of Zika virus.\nResearchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended more stringent measures for monitoring pregnant women for Zika and for preventing sexual transmission of the virus.\nIn fact, the president of the Brazilian federal biomedical research institution that made the announcement urged pregnant women not to kiss strangers during the country's free-wheeling Carnival celebrations."}
