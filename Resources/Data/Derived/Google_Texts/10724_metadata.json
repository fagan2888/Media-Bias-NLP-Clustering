Abu Dhabi plans to stock 0.75 million tons, or 6 million barrels of oil, here, and 0.5 million tons will belong to India.\n\nThe deal is reflective of a wider, global storage panic and talk of what could happen when we reach \u2018\u2019peak storage\u2019\u2019. A number of analysts have suggested that oil prices might crash to $20, or even $10 a barrel, if storage tanks become full.\n\nStorage is now at the highest level in at least a decade.\n\nIn the U.S., crude storage levels hit 487 million barrels in early November, closing in on the 80-year high of 490 million barrels hit earlier this year.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), about 60 percent of the U.S.\u2019 working storage capacity is filled.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Low Oil Prices Are Saving You Money\n\nGlobally, the picture isn\u2019t much better, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) saying that 1 billion barrels were added to storage in 2015 alone. OPEC has reported that crude oil stockpiles in OECD countries currently exceed the running five-year average by 210 million barrels.\n\nThis has given impetus to more creative storage ideas and will at least be a boon to massive storage projects such as India\u2019s.\n\nFloating storage\u2014a more expensive option\u2014is now looking more attractive as well. But to make this work, the math has to be in order, which means that front-end crude spreads would have to be wide enough to cover the cost of storing oil in pricey floating facilities.\n\nLate last month, Bloomberg reported that trading giant Glencore had chartered four very large crude carriers (VLCCs) to store oil off Southeast Asia. But there\u2019s still onshore storage capacity, and we\u2019re not quite to the point where the floating option is widespread.\n\nThe U.S. still has 100 million barrels of available storage, and we should see more storage capacity by the end of this year. The Middle East is also slated to add capacity in the coming years, with the UAE specifically planning to expand its capacity to take on another 10 million barrels.\n\nThe analytical panic is perhaps premature. We\u2019re not facing \u2018\u2019peak storage\u2019\u2019 just yet, but Abu Dhabi is playing it smart and safe.\n\nStill, the UAE estimates the oil glut at 2 million barrels a day and growing, and its own storage expansion plans will benefit from this. After all, it houses the biggest oil storage port on the Persian Gulf\u2014Fujairah Oil Terminal FZC\u2014on the Hormuz Strait.\n\nFujairah received its first shipment just this month of 1 million barrels, and storage capacity is slated to increase 75 percent this decade.\n\nThis piece originally appeared on Oilprice.com.
