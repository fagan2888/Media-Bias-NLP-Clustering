A dog who lost both his eyes has gone up for adoption today at the Arizona Humane Society’s Sunnyslope campus in north Phoenix.

The 2-year-old pup, Ashton, was found on the side of the road near 35th Avenue and Encanto with severe damage to his eyes. He had collapsed from exhaustion and both eyes had popped out of their sockets.

Emergency animal medical technicians came to his aid and rushed him to AHS’ animal hospital, where veterinarians performed an emergency surgery to remove both of his eyes, which were causing him intense pain.

Although Ashton healed quickly after his surgery, he initially struggled to adjust to life as a blind dog. The AHS dog training team has been working with him extensively and he is now learning how to cope.

The team has been working to teach Ashton how to utilize his other senses to navigate through life. Despite not being able to see, Ashton hasn't skipped a beat – the resilient and determined dog carries on with a tail wag and an unwavering spirit. He plays in the yard, has learned new tricks and loves belly rubs from staff and volunteers.

Ashton is in search of a special family to give him a forever home. He doesn’t need much, just a lot of love and perhaps a canine pal to help him navigate through the world.

He is available with an adoption fee of $110 that includes all of his medical treatment, neuter surgery and vaccinations.

For more information on adopting Ashton, call the Adoption Center at 602-997-7585.
