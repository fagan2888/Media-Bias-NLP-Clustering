WASHINGTON, DC—AARP’s Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond released the following statement that backs the Senate’s decision to deliberate on a final Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) bill vote and reiterates AARP’s longstanding support for a permanent fix to the SGR formula:

“AARP is pleased that the Senate is taking time to consider the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2) and waiting until Congress returns from recess in two weeks. A dead-of-night vote on an important SGR package would not have allowed time for ample consideration of ways to improve the bill.

“Although the SGR patch expires on March 31, 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) typically holds Medicare reimbursement claims for 10 additional business days. This additional time period will ensure that holding a full Senate vote after the spring recess will not disrupt Medicare reimbursements.

“While AARP applauds the bipartisan effort thus far to repeal and replace the flawed SGR formula, we remain concerned that Medicare beneficiaries are unfairly shouldering more than their fair share of the cost of the SGR “Doc Fix.” AARP is prepared to work with the Senate to improve H.R. 2 for seniors.
