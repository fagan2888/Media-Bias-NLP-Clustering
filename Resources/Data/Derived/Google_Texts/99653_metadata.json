His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nI was the first political commentator in the country to predict a GOP landslide in Tuesday\u2019s election. I described the predicted GOP landslide as \u201cmassive and historic\u201d here at TheBlaze.\n\nI stuck with the prediction even in the face of the Wall Street Journal front page story on Monday reporting the GOP held the slimmest possible lead (one point).\n\nTuesday\u2019s results literally define \u201cmassive and historic.\u201d The GOP needed to win six U.S. Senate seats. It looks like they\u2019ve won a remarkable nine (with a comfortable lead in Alaska and a projected win in the December Louisiana runoff). The 12 House seats won by the GOP now expands the GOP majority to historic levels.\n\nBut there are more highlights. The GOP destroyed Jimmy Carter\u2019s grandson in Georgia\u2019s Governor race. Governor Scott Walker was re-elected in Wisconsin despite tens of millions spent by unions across the country. The GOP elected Governors in deep, deep blue states like Illinois, Massachusetts and Maryland. Obama himself campaigned for the Democrat Governor candidate Anthony Brown in Maryland. The man that some in the media called \u201cmini Obama\u201d went down to a stunning defeat. Michelle Obama campaigned for Senator Mark Pryor in Arkansas. He lost big time in the same state where he won 79% of the vote only six years ago. Hillary and Bill campaigned all over the country- almost every candidate they supported was wiped out (only Senator Sheehan in New Hampshire won). And the defeat of a Democratic Governor in the President\u2019s home state hasn\u2019t happened since 1892.\n\nWhen I predicted \u201cmassive and historic,\u201d I might have understated the results!\n\nSo what happened? How did I know what was about to transpire?\n\nThis was a total rejection, repudiation and condemnation of everything Obama believes in. This was middle class America telling Obama to shove it where the sun don\u2019t shine. I wrote the national bestseller, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d pointing out what Obama and his socialist cabal were doing to America, capitalism and the great American middle class. What we all just witnessed was a middle class uprising. This was THE REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS.\n\nWhat woke the sleeping giant? What caused the middle class to rise up against Obama? In my previous commentaries I explained that the root of Obama\u2019s election day debacle would be the Obama lies about the economy and the twin disasters of Obamacare and Ebola.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the economy. Obama constantly repeats the lie that the \u201ceconomy is improving\u201d and \u201cwe are in recovery.\u201d But middle class America knows otherwise. The election results prove middle class voters are no longer buying Obama\u2019s lies or the government\u2019s manipulated economic statistics. In exit polls 70% of voters said the economy is bad, versus 30% that called it \u201cimproving.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the centerpiece of this middle class economic disaster known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d Millions of Americans have either seen their health insurance cancelled, or gotten dramatic premium price increases. These were the angry, intense, motivated voters of the 2014 midterm elections. This was a vote to gain revenge on the man who promised \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Ebola. Obama\u2019s response to this potential deadly pandemic has ranged from inept and incompetent, to downright dangerous. Look no further than the new Ebol Czar, who has no medical background and who has never been seen again since the day his appointment was announced. Maybe he\u2019s in quarantine? Ebola made it clear to angry middle class Americans that our president is not keeping our children safe at night. I always believed that Ebola was simply \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d Ebola may have so far only killed one person in America, but it just killed the entire Democratic Party.\n\nBut the reality is elections aren\u2019t won or lost just based on issues. Elections are won based on \u201cthe ground game.\u201d It\u2019s not who supports a candidate or party that matters\u2026it\u2019s who brings the most voters to the polls. Back in 2012 Obama put together the most sophisticated \u201cground game\u201d to get out the Democratic vote in the history of American politics.\n\nThe GOP failed miserably at the same \u201cground game.\u201d The GOP actually had no ground game. Their new \u201cget out the vote\u201d system (named ORCA) bombed on the morning of the national election- meaning the GOP never turned out a single vote.\n\nThe failure of the GOP vote tracking system changed the outcome of the entire presidential election. Having no idea if your most loyal voters have gone to the polls or not, is like flying a plane blind.\n\nFast forward to today. Two crucial political developments have changed in favor of the GOP. These are the two concrete reasons for the GOP landslide:\n\nFirst, the GOP is now for the first time effectively competing with the Obama machine in the \u201cground game.\u201d The GOP turn-out-the-vote machine was so effective this time around that the GOP actually pulled even with Democrats or led in early voting in places where Republicans often lose by large percentages.\n\nThis is very good news. As a matter of fact it had never happened before. Republicans always lose the early voting, then desperately try to play \u201ccatch-up\u201d on Election Day. No more.\n\nSecond, there are now Voter ID laws in place in fifteen states where none existed in 2012. And in 22 states where none existed in 2010.\n\nNot only are Democrats great at getting out the vote, they are even better at getting out fraudulent voters. Voter ID prevents election fraud. That is very bad news for Obama and his allies moving forward.\n\nTuesday\u2019s \u201cmassive and historic\u201d GOP landslide will usher in a dramatic change in political power in Washington DC. The question is what will the GOP do with it?\n\nThe answers to that question will determine the future of the Republican Party\u2026American politics\u2026and America itself. There is so much to do.
