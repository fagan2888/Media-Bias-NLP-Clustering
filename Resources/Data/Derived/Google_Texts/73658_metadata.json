Burwell. They argue that the law only allows for subsidies when a state operates its own exchange.\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell sent approval letters to all three states on Monday detailing the timelines for implementing the marketplaces.\n\nArkansas aims to set up a state-based exchange for small businesses in 2016, with one for individual customers following in 2017. Delaware and Pennsylvania plan to establish state-based exchanges for both markets in 2016.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, as many as 55 percent of people in states that use HealthCare.gov said their local leaders should set up an Obamacare exchange if the Supreme Court rules that the federally administered subsidies are illegal.\n\n(Reporting by Kylie Gumpert;
