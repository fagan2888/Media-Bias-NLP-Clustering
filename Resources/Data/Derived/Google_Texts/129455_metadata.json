Across the nation, there must be countless tales of Americans who would be broke and broken were it not for Obamacare. They have to exist in all walks of life, in every state, of all political persuasions.\n\nAnd yet this week, as Monday\u2019s deadline approached for signing up for 2015 health plans, none of those people appeared as part of the pitch. The most frequently aired TV ad features a racially diverse cast of young people speaking in generalities about how their Obamacare plans provided \u201cpeace of mind\u201d at a surprisingly low, low price. These folks, none of whom seem to have been sick, gush about the heckuva deal they got and how happy it makes them.\n\nBut why? Why is America still being asked to take it on faith that the ACA is a social and moral good? Why does the Obama Administration continue, even after these many years of largely unanswered attacks by Republican opponents, with a failed marketing effort that amounts to, \u201cTrust us! You\u2019ll love it!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the ACA ad they should make: a grizzled, Duck Dynasty-like Alabaman stands outside a neonatal intensive care unit. \u201cI was against Obamacare,\u201d he tells the camera. \u201cI sure didn\u2019t vote for Obama, either. And, man, I liked my health plan, wanted to keep it. When I found out I couldn\u2019t, boy was I pissed.\u201d The camera pans to a wriggling baby, tubes everywhere, the man\u2019s wife gazing longingly into the incubator holding their child. \u201cThen my daughter was born, and she almost died,\u201d he says, choking up a little. \u201cMy old plan wouldn\u2019t have covered this. We would\u2019ve lost the house, probably would\u2019ve had to go bankrupt. It\u2019s all still pretty dang expensive, I can\u2019t lie. But my Obamacare coverage really saved us. Thanks, Obamacare!\u201d\n\nYou think that\u2019s some liberal, nanny-state fever dream? It\u2019s not. This is not conjecture; it is a statistical certainty based on all the data used by insurance carriers to set rates. A certain chunk of the 8 million people who signed on to Obamacare plans \u2013 or the millions more whose existing plans were bolstered to comply with the ACA \u2013 suffered health catastrophes in 2014. Many opposed the law and were angry when Obama\u2019s \u201clike it, keep it\u201d promise was broken. But without the reform that required comprehensive plans and eliminated rejections of coverage based on pre-existing conditions, many would have met the same fate of so many in recent decades.\n\nThat is, lest anyone forget, how it was. Obama, strangely, really never told those stories back then, either. In 2009, when he stood before a joint session of Congress to make his case for health insurance reform, the political genius who campaigned in 2008 with such art and eloquence failed to use the moment to introduce skeptics to a parade of average, hard-working Americans who endured the all-too-common financial devastation of a serious illness. Can\u2019t you see those people, their wheelchairs and colostomy bags and adorable kids, festooning the dais as Obama made his case? How could a purported Judeo-Christian nation see those faces and hear those stories and not agree that something had to change? Instead, the president gave a boring, wonky speech that nobody remembers, a teaser for the incompetent public relations effort to come.\n\nAnd there they go again. The current marketing effort also failed to appeal to anyone\u2019s emotions or sense of justice. Rather, it insisted that having good insurance makes you feel good about yourself the way, say, eating tofu or reading Tolstoy might. Perhaps Obama once had to rely on unproven predictions, but that ended on Jan. 1, 2014. Since then, ACA supporters have had their pick of uplifting stories of tragedy averted by this law.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., knows this. Last month, in a Chicago Sun-Times essay, she cited several specific cases of ACA success. Cancer-stricken David Price, for instance, saved $4,000 this year on his meds versus 2013. Gary Wood, bankrupted 18 years ago by the cost of care from a heart attack and then shut out of coverage ever since, underwent a life-saving quintuple bypass in 2014 paid for by the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. And so on. It\u2019s not hard to find these people. They\u2019re everywhere, even in the deepest red of states.\n\nThe gang behind this year\u2019s campaign offered up just one limp trick: rebranding. The TV ad, for instance, opens with a woman who says, \u201cHealthcare.gov allows me to continue on with my life.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not Obamacare. It\u2019s not even the ACA. It\u2019s now just \u201chealthcare-dot-gov,\u201d as if that\u2019s a policy or a government program rather than a place on the Internet. Given that the rollout of the website was among the biggest PR disasters of any sort in recent history, it\u2019s an odd and ineffectual choice.\n\nStop being so cute. This is really, really easy; just tell the story. It goes like this: Obamacare has successes. It has already saved many Americans from financial doom. It has improved the health care of millions. It has given many entrepreneurs the courage to quit jobs they hated and start new businesses. Here, meet some of these folks. They\u2019re just like you. You could be next.\n\nThe evidence is now on Obama\u2019s side. It is mystifying that he doesn\u2019t seem to know it.\n\nSteve Friess is an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based freelance writer and former senior writer covering technology for Politico.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The president's health care plan has saved many lives.
