Before Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to reveal her 2008 and 2012 presidential vote, there was the KYnect gaffe. Senator Mitch McConnell swore in front of every working microphone that a GOP Senate would remove the ACA "root and branch." Yet in Kentucky, Democratic Governor Steve Beshear had spearheaded the creation of KYnect, a state health care exchange that had been working perfectly well. When he was asked if Obamacare repeal would undo that, too, McConnell shrugged that there was "nothing wrong with a website," and the exchange could go right ahead so long as Obamacare was destroyed.

Reporters were baffled. Voters, less so, as exit polls from the race reveal:

McConnell narrowly beat Grimes among voters who thought KYnect was working "somewhat well," even though his official position would probably dismantle it.
