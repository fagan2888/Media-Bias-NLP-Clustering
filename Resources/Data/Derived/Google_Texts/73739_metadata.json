The move may be little more than a business calculation for the pharmacy chain. But it is one worth cheering: It makes the sale of cigarettes less ubiquitous, and it shows that, after decades of effort, smoking is getting the stigma it deserves.\n\nCVS wants to be known for more than running convenience stores: With demand for and spending on health care both rising, the company is aggressively expanding its prescription drug business and its \u201cminute clinic\u201d chain, offering basic health services such as flu shots and blood pressure readings. It plans to have 1,500 rudimentary clinics open in 2017. Ending cigarette sales will help rebrand the company and forge relationships with other players in the health-care industry.\n\nGive CVS credit. The company is forgoing some $2 billion in annual revenue to make its anti-tobacco play. Regardless of the motivation, the company will have washed its hands of a deadly, addictive social ill. Teenagers may have a harder time buying tobacco products. CVS\u2019s effort to increase the availability of basic health services is also welcome, particularly now that the Affordable Care Act is encouraging more people to use preventive health care rather than waiting for flare-ups and then visiting emergency rooms. Any company that takes a risk to stand on the right side of public health deserves congratulations. It will save lives.\n\nMore broadly, CVS\u2019s move says a lot about American society\u2019s relationship with tobacco. The company\u2019s conclusion that selling cigarettes fundamentally conflicts with the mission of advancing people\u2019s health caps a revolution in American thinking. Gone are the days when tobacco companies could successfully fog up the facts, sowing enough doubt about the deadliness of their products that they could minimize fear among potential or current addicts. After more than a half-century of effort by scientists, doctors and advocates to change attitudes, cigarette ads from years ago featuring doctors, dentists, singers and sports stars have become obviously perverse. They would be laughable if they didn\u2019t represent a concerted campaign to hook people on a cocktail of inhaled poisons.\n\nSmoking has proven a difficult addiction to eradicate, with roughly a fifth of American adults still lighting up. It remains the leading cause of preventable death in the country, and tobacco companies continue to hook new customers overseas. The Food and Drug Administration is still in the early stages of its effort to fully regulate the tobacco industry. Tobacco consumption won\u2019t end soon. But most Americans understand why that\u2019s a worthwhile goal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whatever its motive, CVS does the right thing by ending cigarette sales.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Whatever its motive, CVS does the right thing by ending cigarette sales.", "title": "Whatever its motive, CVS does the right thing by ending cigarette sales", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/whatever-its-motive-cvs-does-the-right-thing-by-ending-cigarette-sales/2014/09/11/7f544b8a-3842-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/03/National-Economy/Images/CVS_Name_Change-0201a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/whatever-its-motive-cvs-does-the-right-thing-by-ending-cigarette-sales/2014/09/11/7f544b8a-3842-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "cvs, cvs cigarettes, cvs clinics, cigarette addiction, tobacco use", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "news_keywords": "cvs, cvs cigarettes, cvs clinics, cigarette addiction, tobacco use", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "7f544b8a-3842-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf42a\"", "article_summary": "CVS STOPPED selling cigarettes last week.\nEnding cigarette sales will help rebrand the company and forge relationships with other players in the health-care industry.\nThe company\u2019s conclusion that selling cigarettes fundamentally conflicts with the mission of advancing people\u2019s health caps a revolution in American thinking.\nRegardless of the motivation, the company will have washed its hands of a deadly, addictive social ill.
