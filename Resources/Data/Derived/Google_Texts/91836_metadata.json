They held the very first GOP Debate for the 2016 race seven months ago in Cleveland, OH. There are only two scheduled debates left \u2013 the CNN hosts one before the Florida primary in Miami, FL on March 10 and a debate to be held on March 21 in Salt Lake City, UT.\n\n1. If you planned to learn about a candidate\u2019s ideas on an issue you were disappointed.\n\nDebates anymore, and it is especially true this cycle are no longer about issues, but how can we achieve ratings by getting the most fireworks. Mission accomplished. Part of that is the media\u2019s fault, but that\u2019s not helped by Donald Trump\u2019s presence during debates either. I will say having only four people on stage is far better than seven or eight.\n\n2. Trump is less effective when he\u2019s fighting a two-front war.\n\nIf Trump has to just deal with one candidate or two he\u2019s pretty effective at dealing with that. This debate and last Cruz and Rubio have drawn blood.\n\nTrump was forced to have to discuss Trump University and the lawsuit filed against him. He was made to look like he was hiding something by refusing to request that the New York Times release the audio of their off-the-record conversation. Also Cruz tied Trump\u2019s donations to Democrats to specific issues that were ushered in like Obamacare and the Gang of Eight bill. Some will say attacks like these won\u2019t work, I would disagree. Donald Trump was poised to do even better on Super Tuesday, but he underperformed his poll numbers in several states and lost four states. In terms of delegates he really didn\u2019t do much better than Ted Cruz. It could have been a lot worse. The attacks work.\n\n3. I didn\u2019t even miss Ben Carson.\n\nEnough said.\n\n4. I didn\u2019t miss John Kasich.\n\nWhen a candidate admits that his only conceivable pathway to the nomination is through a brokered convention I tune them out. Folks he\u2019s trailing in Ohio as well, that\u2019s a winner take-all state. Buh bye.\n\n5. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are better when not attacking each other.\n\nI think they need to form a unity ticket in order to defeat Trump, it\u2019s easier to do that when you are not sniping at one another. Their focus was where it needed to be \u2013 Donald Trump.\n\n6. Attacks can be a double-edged sword.\n\nBoth Cruz and Rubio needed to go after Donald Trump, they can\u2019t afford not to. I noticed this last time as well, Rubio can almost go too far. While interrupting Trump helps disrupt his train of thought, it also makes you bad. He and Trump devolved into some juvenile discourse during the first exchange. \u201cLittle Rubio\u201d and \u201cBig Trump\u201d really? He also can come across as cocky and I\u2019m not sure that plays well.\n\nAlso Rubio\u2019s jokes about Trump (\u201cyou know what they say about men with small hands\u201d) led him to defend the size of his penis during the opening remarks. I never in my wildest dreams thought I\u2019d hear a candidate talk about his genitals during a debate.\n\nCruz has a different debate style and he didn\u2019t engage in that the back and forth you saw with Rubio. He was strategic in what he drilled down with on Trump which I think was more effective. Rubio threw a number of things rapidly at Trump in hopes that it would get something to stick.\n\nAlso instead of interrupting Trump, Cruz corrected Trump when he did it and it worked. Trump stopped, and Cruz didn\u2019t have to sink to that level. Cruz was able to challenge Trump and still look presidential.\n\nUpdate: I neglected to mention it, but Frank Luntz tweeted out what I think was the best line of the debate.\n\n.@TedCruz rising above fray and simply asking \"is this what you want in these debates?\u201d totally crushed it. Hit 89% in my #GOPDebate group. \u2014 Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) March 4, 2016\n\nBonus thought: I\u2019ve seen this mentioned numerous times on Facebook tonight and I have to agree \u2013 the audience behavior was seriously atrocious.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/03/six-observations-fox-news-gop-debate-detroit/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/fox-news-gop-debate-in-detroit-1024x599.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2016-03-04T04:56:39+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "ben carson, donald trump, fox news, gop debate, john kasich, marco rubio, ted cruz, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Shane Vander Hart shares six observations about the last Fox News GOP Debate in Detroit with Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Shane Vander Hart shares six observations about the last Fox News GOP Debate in Detroit with Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich.", "title": "Six Observations From the Fox News GOP Debate in Detroit | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/fox-news-gop-debate-in-detroit-1024x599.png", "updated_time": "2016-03-03T23:39:51-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/03/six-observations-fox-news-gop-debate-detroit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shane Vander Hart shares six observations about the last Fox News GOP Debate in Detroit with Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/fox-news-gop-debate-in-detroit.png", "title": "Six Observations From the Fox News GOP Debate in Detroit | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2016-03-03T22:56:39-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2016-03-03T23:39:51-05:00", "tag": "Ted Cruz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Also instead of interrupting Trump, Cruz corrected Trump when he did it and it worked.\nFox News held its last Republican presidential debate in Detroit tonight.\nThey held the very first GOP Debate for the 2016 race seven months ago in Cleveland, OH.\nTheir focus was where it needed to be \u2013 Donald Trump.\nCruz has a different debate style and he didn\u2019t engage in that the back and forth you saw with Rubio."}
