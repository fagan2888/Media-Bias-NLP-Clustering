As always, the prizes were secondary to the irreverence.\n\nHere\u2019s the most memorable moments from the cable network\u2019s 24th annual celebration of movies:\n\n___\n\nTWERKING TATUM\n\nAfter the hunky cast of \u201cMagic Mike XXL\u201d presented Jennifer Lopez with a trophy for her \u201cscared-as-(expletive)\u201d performance in the thriller \u201cThe Boy Next Door,\u201d the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judge prodded the guys to show off their dance moves.

The star of the \u201cIron Man\u201d movies emerged on the cartoon-themed stage from inside what he called a \u201cmassive, trippy cat head.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCAT\u2019S MEOW\n\nThe unlikely trio of Charli XCX, Ty Dolla $ign and Tinashe managed to drag in the show\u2019s most energetic routine with their fresh pop-rap collaboration \u201cDrop That Kitty.\u201d From behind an oversized inflatable guitar, Charli kicked off the performance backed by her all-girl band on \u201cFamous\u201d before she was joined for \u201cDrop That Kitty\u201d by Ty, Tinashe and a chorus line of female dancers clad in tight pink jumpsuits and cat-inspired \u2018dos.
