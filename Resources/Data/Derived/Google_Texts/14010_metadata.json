But it isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress revealed in her op-ed in The New York Times that she took the drastic step so her children will never have to say, \u201cMom died of ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nJolie, whose mother died from the disease in 2007, said she underwent the surgery last week, two years after she underwent a double mastectomy because she carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. \u201cIt is not easy to make these decisions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue.\u201d\n\nOver 14,000 women in the U.S. alone died from ovarian cancer last year. Here\u2019s what to know to avoid being a statistic.\n\nWHAT IS THE BRCA GENE?\n\nThe BRCA gene, which both men and women have, fixes abnormal DNA in the body. But when the BRCA gene is mutated, \u201ca person is more likely to have abnormal DNA that leads to the development of cancer,\u201d says Dr. Marleen Meyers, the Medical Oncologist and Director of the Survivorship Program NYU's Perlmutter Cancer Center.\n\nIn general, women have an 8% chance of developing breast cancer by age 70, and 12% before age 85. However women who have a faulty BRCA gene have a higher risk, upwards of 60%.\n\nMen can also have the BRCA mutation, which means they are both at a greater risk of developing breast cancer and could pass it to their children.\n\nWHY JOLIE CHOSE SURGERY\n\nPatients who learn they have the BRCA mutation have three options: Surveillance (regular blood tests and sonograms), medical management (taking medication to ward off cancer) and surgery, says Dr. Susan Klugman, director of reproductive genetics at Montefiore Medical Center.\n\n\"But the best protection against ovarian cancer is the surgery (Jolie) had,\" Klugman says.\n\nHowever, a woman not ready to give up her reproductive capabilities may find that surveillance or medical management is a better alternative.\n\nUnfortunately, while doctors have excellent screening methods for breast cancer \u2014 including mammograms, ultrasounds, MRIs and more \u2014 there are limited resources for catching ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we generally encourage that after (women with cancer risk) finish childbearing they remove their ovaries and fallopian tubes,\u201d says Meyers.\n\n\u201cMy patients feel a tremendous sense of relief and are quite happy with their decision to remove their ovaries because they have seen what ovarian cancer looks like,\u201d says Dr. Jill Whyte, a gynecologic oncologist at the North Shore-LIJ Cancer Institute. \u201cThey know they have taken a huge step to prevent this disease.\u201d\n\nEARLY MENOPAUSE\n\nJolie, 39, is starting menopause 10 years younger than the average woman. The earlier a woman begins menopause, the more symptoms she\u2019ll likely have, says Meyers, adding that the average age is 51. Following the removal of her ovaries, Jolie can now expect hot flashes, night sweats, skin changes and sleep issues. While the hormone replacement regimen she\u2019s already begun can counterbalance those symptoms, it\u2019s not for everyone.\n\nJolie can have the replacement because her breasts have been removed; women who have their breasts and start hormone therapy have an increased risk of breast cancer because they\u2019re adding more estrogen to the body, which could increase their risk of cancer.\n\nTHE PROCEDURE IS COSTLY (BUT COMMON)\n\nThe laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy that Jolie had can cost up to $3,000, according to FairHealth Inc., which collects healthcare claims data. And that\u2019s not including the costs of anesthesia and the patient\u2019s stay at the hospital, which will vary per individual.\n\nBut most insurance companies will cover these costs once they find a patient has the faulty BRCA gene. And anyone without insurance can get coverage through the Affordable Care Act, says Dr. Carol Brown, a gynecologic oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cThanks to the Affordable Care Act, there really shouldn\u2019t be a situation where someone needs to pay out of pocket for this,\u201d she adds.\n\nA full genetic test can cost more than $3,000, while tests for specific mutations are usually a few hundred dollars, Whyte says. Some, but not all, insurance plans will cover this.\n\nBut don\u2019t be too quick to jump into blood tests. Concerned patients should first talk with their personal physician about their family history of cancer. They should then consult a genetic counselor who can talk them through the complicated and possibly pricey process.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel rushed into things,\u201d she says.\n\nWHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?\n\nThere isn\u2019t as much scientific research on the effectiveness of non-surgical preventive measures, says Dr. Mark Rosing, the director of the obstetrics and gynecology at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. However, they should still be considered.\n\nBirth control pills have been found to decrease a woman\u2019s risk of developing ovarian cancer, even if she has the BRCA mutation. But a woman needs to stay on the pill for at least five years to reap that benefit.\n\nSome women stick with the CA-125 blood test, which monitors ovarian cancer by looking for proteins in the blood. Jolie said she gets this test once a year. They can also get transvaginal ultrasounds to screen for ovarian cancer, Rosing says.\n\nTaking a natural approach is an option but not ideal, adds Meyers.\n\nThere are lifestyle changes a patient can make to mitigate their menopausal symptoms, however, like sticking to a Mediterranean diet and lowering their BMI if they are overweight since it\u2019s not just ovaries that are making estrogen. \u201cFat cells make estrogen and very often you can cut hot flashes if you decrease the body\u2019s fat level,\u201d Meyers says.\n\nShe adds that while some women opt for plant-based hormone therapy, it\u2019s not necessarily a safer option because it mimics estrogen and may have the same deleterious effects.\n\nJolie, 39, had a double mastectomy in 2013.
