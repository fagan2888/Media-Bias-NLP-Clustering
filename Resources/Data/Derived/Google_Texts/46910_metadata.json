By story's end, it's clear he doesn't believe that, either.\n\n\n\nBut in classic Comedy Central fashion Oliver\u2019s team previewed their tilt by releasing two YouTube videos mocking the Republican National Committee\u2019s \u201clatest outreach ad to young voters.\u201d It suggests that young Republicans wear stupid clothes (too-small leather jackets), ride tricycles, and engage in \u201cnon-vaginal intercourse with girls they met at Christian summer camp\" (video below):\n\n\u201cThe videos highlighted Oliver\u2019s immersion in popular culture, as well as his political worldview,\u201d Farhi wrote, as in socialist.\n\nDon\u2019t get him going on dull-but-important stuff like the federal estate tax; he thinks it\u2019s a bit hilarious, and emblematic of Americans\u2019 irrepressible optimism, that there\u2019s no groundswell to do away with a tax break that exempts up to $5 million of wealth upon a person\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe inherent hope in Americans is amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cThey think they\u2019re going to go out someday with a $300 million estate, and they don\u2019t want it taxed. That\u2019s probably not going to happen, but they believe. I come from a world that goes the other way.\u201d\n\nFarhi didn't ask him to express amazement liberals in their naivete still think Obamacare is about to gain broad national acceptance. He wasn't asked why the question-authority lefties at Comedy Central have serious mental reservations about satire targeting Obama. Oliver is not a hater, just a class-resenter:\n\nOliver acknowledges that his comic perspective has been influenced by Britain\u2019s well-honed class resentments. The son of school teachers, he attended \u201cquite a rough\u201d public school growing up in Bedford, an older industrial town about an hour north of London. He went on to graduate from Cambridge.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a kind of class anger that is really hard to shake,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember when I first came here and American friends would say, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you? Why do you get so gnarled up about this?\u2019 If I meet \u2014 and I still do this \u2014 if I meet English people here, I\u2019m instantly on the defensive if I hear something in their voice that suggests they went to private school. And I haven\u2019t lived in that country for nearly a decade. But it\u2019s so ingrained in me.\u201d\n\nOliver claims to hate the news media, which is why they design \"fake news\" to mock it. As if the real racket in journalistic sincerity today is to be utterly artificial. Like Jon Stewart, he claims the politicians and reporters are too close -- and then he mocks the Republicans and ignores Obama.
