Marco Rubio took issue with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s criticism of his immigration policy. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee declared he was still in the race despite poor poll results. Jeb Bush promoted his experience as Florida governor. Donald Trump declared he was the superior candidate. And Ben Carson said his rags-to-riches story made him the best fit for the job.\n\nThe comments came during the Sunshine Summit, hosted by the Republican Party of Florida to feature the presidential candidates.\n\nRubio advocated repeal of the Affordable Care Act and promoted a three-tier tax plan that includes more tax credits for parents with children. He also promised new policy that would use energy resources in the country.\n\n\u201cGod has blessed us with oil and other natural resources,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cLet\u2019s use them fully.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Cruz said Rubio\u2019s immigration plan was not as conservative as advertised. But Rubio challenged that Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m puzzled, quite frankly, and I\u2019m surprised by Ted\u2019s attacks since Ted\u2019s take on immigration policy is not much different from mine,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHe is a supporter of legalizing people who are in this country illegally and if he\u2019s changed that issue than he should be clear about that.\u201d\n\nBefore a jubilant crowd, many holding his campaign posters, Cruz told the audience that anyone who says Washington, D.C. is on the right path should be feared.\n\n\u201cIf anyone tells you they embrace Washington, run the other way,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cPeople up there fear me because I bring change.\u201d\n\nCruz called for a stronger military and the shrinking of government agencies that he said brought havoc on small business.\n\n\u201cWe have this alphabet soup of government agencies that have descended like locusts on small businesses,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz said he would offer a similar change brought by President Ronald Reagan. He said the two-term president\u2019s tax changes created a business-friendly environment that led to a solid economy.\n\nCruz said his tax plan, which is a flat 10-percent levy on every American, would create prosperity.\n\nHuckabee used his appearance at the summit to promise a federal government that would no longer strangle small business. He also vowed to have government leaders more accountable to the people they serve.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m in office, I would station the Department of Homeland Security in Laredo, Texas, and tell him to secure our border,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cThat will bring change fast.\u201d\n\nLike other candidates, Huckabee promised to increase funding to the military to fight radical Islamic jihadists.\n\n\u201cWe will have the best trained, best financed, best military in the world,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cIts strength will keep us at peace.\u201d\n\nThere were roughly 2,000 people ticketed to attend the summit at the Rosen Shingle Creek Resort, but not many had waited beyond Rubio and Cruz to hear Huckabee\u2019s speech.\n\nA confident Bush took the stage before a crowd dotted by state leaders supporting him, such as Sen. Joe Negron, the Republican from Stuart who is expected to become Senate president. He was joined by current Senate President Andy Gardiner from Orlando. Bush promoted his track record during his two terms as Florida governor, which he said included plenty of tax cuts and changes to the state education system.\n\nBush said his experience as governor primed him for the White House, experience that he said is superior to that of other candidates.\n\n\u201cIf you want a talker, maybe I\u2019m not your guy,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut if you want a doer, someone who\u2019s done it and been there, then I\u2019m your guy.\u201d\n\nBush criticized Obama for dividing groups in Washington, which he said helped lead to a Congressional stalemate. Pointing to his days as governor, Bush said he would rebuild bridges Obama tore down.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be a divider in chief, I wont be an agitator in chief,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI will be a commander in chief.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has been the target of Bush criticism in recent days, took the stage after making a grand entrance through one of the busiest hallways of the summit, where he shook hands and signed autographs on just about anything his fans could find. It was a unique entrance after other candidates chose more discreet paths.\n\nTrump stood behind a podium and declared the entire audience was there for him.\n\n\u201cI was watching the other candidates on TV and the room looked empty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow it\u2019s full.\u201d\n\nTrump discussed his plan to build a wall that he would name after himself. He also proposed changing policy that he said left the U.S. Border Patrol with no way to enforce law.\n\n\u201cThey people just walk by them and say, \u2018Hi,\u2019\u201d said Trump, referring to his account of border agents seeing undocumented immigrants. \u201cThey tell me there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d\n\nBen Carson, the last presidential candidate appearing Friday, reflected on his experience growing up poor in Detroit, and how his experience with children reminded him how children should come first.\n\n\u201cYou look at what\u2019s going on right now and you realize they\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d Carson said of children growing up in the U.S. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change.\u201d\n\nCarson said he wants to work to help people climb out of poverty, and said he doesn\u2019t want to eliminate any of the federal government\u2019s safety-net programs for the poor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a bunch of crap the left wing puts out to make me look bad,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIt\u2019s so a lot of poor people won\u2019t listen to what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\narek.sarkissian@naplesnews.com\n\n(850) 559-7620", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 14:17:31 -0400", "Description": "ORLANDO \u00ad\u2014 Thousands of Florida Republicans met six of the top contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination Friday, with candidates taking aim at President Barack Obama, clas", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "ORLANDO \u00ad\u2014 Thousands of Florida Republicans met six of the top contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination Friday, with candidates taking aim at President Barack Obama, clas", "title": "GOP contenders make their case at Florida forum", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/rubio-raps-opponents-says-time-is-now-20151113/", "image": {"width": 3948, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20151113/ARTICLE/151119621/EP/1/1/EP-151119621.jpg", "height": 2730}, "updated_time": "2015-11-14T08:25:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "ORLANDO \u00ad\u2014 Thousands of Florida Republicans met six of the top contenders for the party\u2019s presidential nomination Friday, with candidates taking aim at President Barack Obama, cl", "title": "GOP contenders make their case at Florida forum", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20151113/ARTICLE/151119621/AR/0/AR-151119621.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-11-13T14:17:31Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T08:25:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rubio advocated repeal of the Affordable Care Act and promoted a three-tier tax plan that includes more tax credits for parents with children.\nCruz said his tax plan, which is a flat 10-percent levy on every American, would create prosperity.\nThe comments came during the Sunshine Summit, hosted by the Republican Party of Florida to feature the presidential candidates.\nFlorida Sen.
