Analytics firm Zephyr Health, a San Francisco-based startup that bills itself as an "insights-as-a-service" company for the healthcare industry, closed on a $17.5 million third round of funding, led by Google Ventures.

Current investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Icon Ventures also participated in the round. Zephyr has received $33.5 million funding to date.

Google Ventures was founded in 2009. Among its 300 investments are Uber, Kabam, Flatiron Health, Cloudera and DocuSign.

On average it costs pharmaceutical companies between $1.5 and 2.4 billion to bring a new therapy to market, with only 33 percent of those products meeting their initial sales goals, Zephyr executives point out.

Zephyr Health customers include Fortune 100 Genentech, Gilead, Medtronic, Onyx and Amgen. They use the Zephyr's Illuminate technology to improve business results across the product lifecycle. The solution's proprietary algorithms link data from thousands of disconnected sources to generate predictive insights.
