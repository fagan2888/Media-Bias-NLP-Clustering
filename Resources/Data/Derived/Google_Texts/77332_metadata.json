With India\u2019s capital gripped by its annual hot season water shortage, the city\u2019s so-called tanker mafia is doing a roaring trade. An estimated 2,000 illegal tankers ply New Delhi\u2019s roads every day, lifelines to millions whose taps have run dry, and symptoms of a much bigger problem \u2014 the city\u2019s desperately dysfunctional water system.\n\nThe tankers don\u2019t come cheap. But some Delhi-ites have no choice.\n\n\u201cYou need water, you will pay anything, right?\u201d says Phakey, a marketing executive.\n\nShe is hardly alone. In a city known for its vertiginous inequalities, the shortage affects people from both upscale gated communities and dust-blown slums, as every day, the city\u2019s supply falls more than 160 million gallons short.\n\nMost residents have piped water for just a couple hours a day, and almost a quarter have none at all. With a leaky water infrastructure long overwhelmed by new arrivals, New Delhi is grappling with a dizzying social and environmental challenge, worsened by chaotic management. For many, it is a distressing reminder of a daily reality that lags behind India\u2019s superpower dreams.\n\nWhile New Delhi has had water troubles for decades, the shortage has become critical in recent years as the city\u2019s population has grown with little or no planning, rising from 9 million in 1991 to almost 17 million today.\n\nEven many of the wealthiest neighborhoods get water for just an hour in the morning, with residents rushing to turn on pumps and fill storage tanks when the municipal supply flows.\n\nThe most urgent problem, though, is getting water to the sprawling neighborhoods of illegally constructed buildings, home to 40 percent of the city\u2019s residents and largely without water lines. The city\u2019s water agency, the Delhi Jal Board, sends 900 tankers onto the crowded roads every day. In some neighborhoods, a tanker passes every few minutes, its load sloshing down its sides.\n\nBut it\u2019s nowhere near enough. Tankers usually stop for just 15 minutes, while dozens of people crowd around waving buckets and plastic tubes. Tempers flare in the fierce heat; fights are frequent. In some areas, people get just 3 liters (quarts).\n\nIn a slum in Vasant Kunj, a young woman, Fatima, keeps her entire week\u2019s supply in five 50-liter (13-gallon) plastic containers lined up next to her bed. They take up a third of the 3.5-meter (12-foot) metal box where she, her husband and child live.\n\n\u201cSometimes only one water tanker comes, sometimes they come after a day\u2019s gap,\u201d says Fatima, who uses only one name. \u201cWe are poor people. If we sit and wait like this for a whole day for the water tanker, when will we go out to earn our daily wage?\u201d\n\nNew Delhi\u2019s water authority downplays the problem.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a crisis,\u201d says Vijay Kumar, the agency\u2019s chief. \u201cIf you look at Delhi overall, certain pockets are water-scarce \u2014 not all.\u201d\n\nThose pockets, though, are home to roughly 3.5 million people.\n\nThe water board says it doesn\u2019t have enough water and largely blames neighboring states, which it says failed to deliver extra water to the city after a 2012 canal renovation.\n\n\u201cThat is our biggest constraint,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cOnce we are in position to commission the entire infrastructure, water will be more equitably distributed, more rationally managed. But what is crucial is that we should get more water.\u201d\n\nStill, critics say the city \u2014 which is close to two major rivers and has a significant water table \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be running short. In theory, as the World Bank noted, New Delhi should have more water available per capita than Paris.\n\nInstead, they say the water board has squandered its resources.\n\n\u201cDelhi is a very privileged city in terms of water availability. So Delhi seems to be a case of crisis of mismanagement,\u201d says Himanshu Thakkar, who runs the New Delhi-based South Asian Network for Dams, Rivers and People, a research and environmentalist organization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Water shortages lead to \u2018tanker mafia\u2019 in India", "title": "Water shortages lead to \u2018tanker mafia\u2019 in India", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Water shortages lead to \u2018tanker mafia\u2019 in India", "title": "Water shortages lead to \u2018tanker mafia\u2019 in India", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/water_shortages_lead_to_tanker_mafia_in_india/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/india-water-mafia.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Water shortages lead to \u2018tanker mafia\u2019 in India", "title": "Water shortages lead to \u2018tanker mafia\u2019 in India", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/india-water-mafia.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patrick Reevell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With India\u2019s capital gripped by its annual hot season water shortage, the city\u2019s so-called tanker mafia is doing a roaring trade.\n\u201cSometimes only one water tanker comes, sometimes they come after a day\u2019s gap,\u201d says Fatima, who uses only one name.\nIf we sit and wait like this for a whole day for the water tanker, when will we go out to earn our daily wage?\u201dNew Delhi\u2019s water authority downplays the problem.\nWithin an hour, a man in a tanker arrives, carrying a load of dubious water drawn illegally from the city\u2019s groundwater.\nThe city\u2019s water agency, the Delhi Jal Board, sends 900 tankers onto the crowded roads every day."}
