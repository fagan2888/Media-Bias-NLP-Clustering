Many had hoped the combination of the January jobs report and Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s semi-annual appearance before Congress next week would provide some hints about the central bank\u2019s intentions, but the numbers released Friday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics were a mixed bag.\n\nThe total jobs created, 151,000, came in considerably lower than expected, and the previous month\u2019s eye-popping 292,000 was revised down to 262,000. However, the report also found wages on the rise, more people entering (or re-entering) the labor force, and a decline in the unemployment rate from 5.0 percent to 4.9 percent \u2013 the lowest in eight years.\n\nRelated: Are Congress and the Fed Repeating the Mistakes of the Depression?\n\nEconomists say they don\u2019t have high hopes for any major revelations from Yellen next week. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics predicted the her appearance will be \u201conly slightly more enlightening than Martin Shkreli\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Shkreli, the reviled former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in an appearance before a House panel Thursday.)\n\nThe U.S. economics team at BNP Paribas called the report \u201csurprisingly positive,\u201d and noted that, among other things, the increase in the labor participation rate, which brought more prospective workers back into the labor force, actually prevented the nominal unemployment rate from falling even further, to 4.8 percent.\n\nAt UBS, economist Samuel Coffin pointed out that the weaker jobs number appeared to be limited to two sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe slowing did not appear to reflect weather but more generally appeared to reflect unsustainable swings in a few isolated areas,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA swing in educational services subtracted 49k; a swing in employment services subtracted 63k; together, those two fully accounted for the slowing in payrolls.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Unemployment System can\u2019t Handle Another Recession\n\nHowever, some economists, particularly on the liberal side of the policy spectrum, argued that the details of the report show an economy that is still in recovery mode and that needs to be nursed along by a continued application of low interest rates by the Federal Open Market Committee, lest gains be lost again.\n\n\u201cThe sharp slowing in job growth was to be expected, given the slow growth reported in the economy,\u201d wrote Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cThe labor market is still not tight enough to produce healthy wage growth. With many downside risks to growth, 2016 may not be a good year for workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWage growth of 2.5 percent is far from any reasonable target given the Federal Reserve\u2019s target inflation and trend productivity,\u201d wrote Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cTo keep moving us towards the goal of full employment \u2014 an economy where there is high demand for labor, and workers have more bargaining power to negotiate higher wages and get the hours they want \u2014 we need to keep our foot off the brakes and consider tapping on the gas. If the Federal Reserve hits the brakes by raising interest rates prematurely, the economy may never fully recover.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Glaring Problem with Obama\u2019s $10-a-Barrel Tax on Oil\n\nGould also updated her helpful chart reminding readers of just how many millions of Americans left the labor force prematurely during the Great Recession and its aftermath, and showing where the unemployment rate would be if they had all remained in the workforce.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Economists and market watchers hoping that the combination of Friday\u2019s jobs report and Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s semi-annual appearance before Congress next week would provide some clarity about the central bank\u2019s intentions with regard to interest rates are likely to be disappointed.", "title": "The Fed\u2019s Dilemma: Is the Economy Slowing or Surging?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/Fed-s-Dilemma-Economy-Slowing-or-Surging", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09022011_Jobs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/Fed-s-Dilemma-Economy-Slowing-or-Surging", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09022011_Jobs_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Economists and market watchers hoping that the combination of Friday\u2019s jobs report and Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s semi-annual appearance before Congress next week would provide some clarity about the central bank\u2019s intentions with regard to interest rates are likely to be disappointed.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2630\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe sharp slowing in job growth was to be expected, given the slow growth reported in the economy,\u201d wrote Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\u201cThe slowing did not appear to reflect weather but more generally appeared to reflect unsustainable swings in a few isolated areas,\u201d he wrote.\nAt UBS, economist Samuel Coffin pointed out that the weaker jobs number appeared to be limited to two sectors of the economy.\nThe total jobs created, 151,000, came in considerably lower than expected, and the previous month\u2019s eye-popping 292,000 was revised down to 262,000.\nEconomists and market watchers looking for clarity on interest rates will likely be disappointed."}
