With Democratic frontrunner Hilary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign struggling to gain traction in the face of her ongoing e-mail controversy, that\u2019s the question Democrats and political pundits keep asking about Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden has spoken openly about how the death of his son Beau a few months ago has affected him and left him unsure if he has the emotional capacity to run.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any man or woman should run for president unless, No. 1, they know exactly why they would want to be president, and 2, they can look at the folks out there and say, \u2018I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy and my passion to do this,\u2019\u201d Biden told Stephen Colbert last week. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be lying if I said that I knew I was there.\u201d\n\nRelated: Joe Biden: The Looming Threat to a Republican Presidency\n\nBiden has long been known for such straight talk \u2014 and, in some cases, for saying too much, or saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. In one of his more notable gaffes, Biden complimented Hilary Clinton in a way that could get brought up if he enters the race: \u201cShe\u2019s easily qualified to be vice president of the United States of America. Quite frankly, it might have been a better pick than me.\u201d\n\nAlthough Americans know Biden as the honest if blooper-prone vice president, there are still some facts about him that have gotten lost in all the speculation about 2016.\n\nWhen he was a child, Biden\u2019s classmates teased him for stuttering when he spoke. He overcame his speech impediment by himself, reading long poems out loud in front of a mirror.\n\nWhile Biden attended Syracuse University College of Law, he and his wife Neilia Hunter Biden purchased a puppy and named him \u201cSenator.\u201d\n\nIn his first ever Senate race in 1972, Biden beat Delaware\u2019s best-known politician, a well-funded, three-term incumbent Republican. He was 29 at the time he won the election, too young to be in Congress, but he turned 30 before being sworn into office.\n\nRelated: Why Every Passing Day Makes It Harder for Biden \u2014 Or Any Latecomer \u2014 To Run\n\nHe\u2019s endured many tragedies. His wife, Neilia, and his infant daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident while shopping for a Christmas tree in 1972. His two sons, Beau and Hunter, were in the car as well, but survived after suffering serious injuries.\n\nBiden, who had been elected just before the tragic accident, took the Senate oath of office at his sons\u2019 hospital bedsides. Committed to his sons, he commuted to Washington from Wilmington, Del. every day by train throughout his career in the Senate.\n\nBiden remarried schoolteacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in June 1977 and has a daughter, Ashley, with her.\n\nIn 1988, Biden had to have brain surgery after being diagnosed with two life-threatening cranial aneurysms. Before surgery, the surgeon told him that he had a 35 to 50 percent chance of living a normal life afterwards.\n\nBefore becoming vice president, Biden was Delaware\u2019s longest-serving senator, serving for six terms.\n\nLike Donald Trump, Biden does not drink alcohol. He has said that alcoholism runs in his family.\n\nBiden became the highest-ranking government official to endorse same-sex marriage in 2012 during an appearance on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Soon after, President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage as well.\n\nIf he does decide to run for president, this would be Biden\u2019s third try. He ran in 1987, but withdrew after he was accused of failing to credit a British politician, Neil Kinnock, for remarks he made in a speech. He also ran in 2008.\n\nBiden, the son of a car salesman, apparently does not own a 1981 Pontiac Trans Am, though he told Car and Driver that he has a 1967 Corvette that the Secret Service would not let him drive.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Will he or won\u2019t he?", "title": "13 Facts You Should Know About Joe Biden", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/16/13-Facts-You-Should-Know-About-Joe-Biden", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/090162015_Joe_Biden.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/16/13-Facts-You-Should-Know-About-Joe-Biden", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/090162015_Joe_Biden.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Will he or won\u2019t he?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d13\"", "article_summary": "Before becoming vice president, Biden was Delaware\u2019s longest-serving senator, serving for six terms.\nWith Democratic frontrunner Hilary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign struggling to gain traction in the face of her ongoing e-mail controversy, that\u2019s the question Democrats and political pundits keep asking about Vice President Joe Biden.\nLike Donald Trump, Biden does not drink alcohol.\nQuite frankly, it might have been a better pick than me.\u201dAlthough Americans know Biden as the honest if blooper-prone vice president, there are still some facts about him that have gotten lost in all the speculation about 2016.\nBiden, who had been elected just before the tragic accident, took the Senate oath of office at his sons\u2019 hospital bedsides."}
