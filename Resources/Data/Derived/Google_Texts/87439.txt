Police in Redford Township, Michigan, claim they spotted a suspect through a window in the home of Bianca Alakson and Ryan Showalter. The suspect was wanted for being in a fight, so they gave chase, entering the couple's fenced yard. Which has a "beware of dog" sign on it.

You know what's coming.

That's supposedly when Rock, a 10-month-old Labrador–pit bull mix, "charged" an officer. The cop shot him twice, killing him.

Showalter apparently got a little pissed that his beloved dog had been shot. (That's Rock pictured at right, with Alakson.) So they arrested him for "interfering with police." In his own backyard. After they shot his dog.

There's not much more to add—except that the department is getting hell from the community on its Facebook page.

Just remember, the only thing worse than having a dog so aggressive that it stays in its own yard is objecting when cops shoot it down.
