Hollywood made its share of propaganda during World War II, but there were times when it still tweaked The Man. Here's Woody Woodpecker in Ration Bored (1943):

The only concession to political propriety here is the "Buy More War Bonds for Victory" card after the story is over. Woody even gets to go to heaven after he diesâ€”and to keep tormenting cops when he gets there.

Bonus film: The draft board chases Daffy Duck to hell in Bob Clampett's Draftee Daffy (1945).
