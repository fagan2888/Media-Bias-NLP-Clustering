I am out of the prediction business. I am in the warning business.\n\nWhat I am saying is that if Trump completes his seizure of the Republican Party, the Democrats will be no more able to stop Trump in the general election than the Republicans were in the primaries. If Trump is then vanquished in the general election, it would be despite the Democrats, not because of the Democrats.\n\nTrump will have to be defeated by political forces separate and greater than the corrupt and failed two-party duopoly.\n\nTrump voters believe one thing fervently: Both parties are dirty.\n\nThe vast majority of voters agree completely. They differ on whom they dislike and mistrust more.\n\nThe crooked duopoly cannot be trusted to stop Trump because it delivered this plague upon us.\n\nRepublicans bear much more blame for Trumpism \u2014 moral blame. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\u2022 Since Richard Nixon and his henchmen launched the GOP \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in the 1960s, the party has used racist rhetoric and policies to attract lower- and working-class white voters. Trump has merely turned up the volume.\n\n\u2022 Republican policies and economic reality have left these same voters worse off than they were 30 years ago while the top of the money chain has flourished. Economic inequality is greater now than in the Roaring \u201920s.\n\n\u2022 The Republican leadership has empowered and bamboozled two far-right factions \u2014 religious archconservatives and small government zealots. The party has not been able to deliver what it promised to either of these loud constituencies, for obvious reasons: The vast majority of Americans, increasingly secular or unaffiliated with traditional religion, disagree with the religious conservatives; a substantially smaller government is not realistic for a diverse nation of 322 million people in a globalized economy.\n\n\u2022 Republicans in Congress adapted an unprecedented policy of legislative obstruction during the Obama administration, despite the severity of the Great Recession and national security challenges.\n\n\u2022 Republican legislation and jurisprudence have completely deregulated the finances of elections so that individuals with great wealth or fundraising capacity can bypass traditional political gatekeepers.\n\n\u2022 The unpopular and unsuccessful war in Iraq was the work of a Republican president, legitimized and marketed by the party\u2019s neoconservative intellectual elite.\n\n\u2022 Finally and simply, Republican powers and leaders did not even seriously try to stop Trump until after Super Tuesday. So far those efforts have been uncoordinated and half-baked.\n\nWith respect to Trump, the sins of the Democrats are more political than moral, though not exclusively so:\n\n\u2022 Democrats have had no more success than Republicans in addressing the stagnant plight of lower- and middle-income Americans; they have been just as attentive to the 1 percent as the Republicans. Obamacare was a huge and important exception.\n\n\u2022 With cowardice, Democrats were too quick to ditch President Obama when poll numbers went south.\n\n\u2022 The party failed to develop a next generation of national leaders and is about to nominate a badly beaten-up candidate, someone it is easy to imagine losing to Donald Trump.\n\nAll together, this adds up to an obvious truth: Only a nut would trust the discredited two-party duopoly to dump Trump.\n\nSo what is to be done? Republicans can\u2019t give up on the nomination, though time is about to run out.\n\nThe party needs to come to grips with the fact that a brokered convention is now the only way to stop Trump; no one else can get a majority of delegates. The party must figure out how to give John Kasich a win in Ohio and deny Trump a win in Florida. In some states, they will have to convince either Kasich or Cruz to bow out; in late states like New Jersey and California, they should recruit favorite son or daughter candidates.\n\nIf Trump gets the Republican nomination, one can only hope that there is a hidden reservoir of establishment power that can convince their super PACs and Koch brother networks to sit out the 2016 general instead of carpet-bombing Hillary Clinton. And one can only hope that there is a cadre of Republicans who will lead their own #NeverTrump campaign.\n\nThe Democrats will need that help and more. We all will.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I have bad news and I have bad news.
