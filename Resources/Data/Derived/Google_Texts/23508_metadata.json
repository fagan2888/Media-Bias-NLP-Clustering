The plan allocates a total of $10 billion over 10 years\u2014$7.5 billion will be funds to support new federal-state partnerships and $2.5 billion will go to expand existing block grants.\n\nThe money talk matters, experts say.\n\n\u201cThose are the numbers that have been missing in a lot of the policy debate so far,\u201d Daniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition, told me. \u201cWe know that we need to invest more in prevention, treatment, and harm reduction, but so far we\u2019ve been in a budget environment where Congress, at most, has committed to incremental increases that just aren\u2019t sufficient to tackle that scope of the problem.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, nearly 23 million Americans needed treatment for substance use, but less than 1 in 10 actually received care at a specialized facility, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nClinton\u2019s proposal, by focusing on expanding treatment options and getting specific about the money required to do it, could begin to address this gap, Raymond explained: \u201cA lot of what Clinton\u2019s proposing is consistent with what people in the field say is really needed.\u201d\n\nAnd part of what\u2019s needed is a robust healthcare system that can ensure people who need treatment receive care. The Affordable Care Act has extended health coverage to 16 million people, but millions of people are still shut out of accessing healthcare. And for those experiencing substance use disorders, jails and prisons have come to serve as a kind of repository for people who need treatment, a point Clinton noted in her op-ed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we recognize that our state and federal prisons, where 65 percent of inmates meet medical criteria for substance use disorders, are no substitute for proper treatment\u2014and reform our criminal justice system,\u201d Clinton wrote.\n\nThe Democratic frontrunner isn\u2019t the only candidate making this point. But the question of healthcare\u2014how it\u2019s delivered and what role the government should play in its delivery\u2014is a fracture line in the current bipartisan coalition backing criminal justice reform.\n\nAnd several Republicans leading the call to reform sentencing and revise how the system treats low-level drug offenses\u2014most notably Sen. Mike Lee of Utah\u2014are, at the same time, pushing to repeal the new healthcare law.\n\nRand Paul\u2014who has also made criminal justice reform a major issue this campaign and, like Clinton, supports an expansion of medication-assisted treatment as an alternative to incarceration\u2014joined a majority of those running in the GOP primary to denounce a June Supreme Court decision upholding the law and push for repeal.\n\n\u201cI would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our healthcare system,\u201d Paul said in a statement. \u201cAs a physician, I know Americans need a healthcare system that reconnects patients, families, and doctors, rather than growing government bureaucracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the proposals add up in terms of ensuring that we have expanded care,\u201d Raymond said of Republican opposition to Obamacare. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about block granting Medicaid [requiring states to rely on a fixed sum to administer the program], if you\u2019re talking about removing really critical protections, you\u2019re going to end up with a weaker healthcare infrastructure that won\u2019t be able to deliver the care that\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nA notable exception, he added, is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has defended his decision to expand Medicaid in his state by talking explicitly about the healthcare needs of his constituents.\n\n\u201cOhio was in the midst of an opioid and heroin crisis, and they needed those tools and resources,\u201d Raymond said.\n\nHe called Clinton\u2019s proposal promising, but said there\u2019s still more work to be done when it comes to getting people with substance use disorders the support they need and promoting community health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for a presidential candidate who will use the words \u2018harm reduction.\u2019 A lot of these proposals are consistent with harm reduction principles, but we\u2019re seeing, at the state and local level, harm reduction strategies like overdose prevention and syringe exchange become much more mainstream,\u201d Raymond explained. \u201cI would hope that other candidates, both Democrat and Republican, start to really flesh that out and acknowledge that we need a much bigger investment if we\u2019re going to get our hands around the opioid and heroin crisis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Hillary Clinton announced on Wednesday a proposal to address the \u201cquiet epidemic\u201d of heroin and prescription drug use by expanding treatment options and sentencing reform for low-level and non-violent drug offenses.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Hillary Clinton announced on Wednesday a proposal to address the \u201cquiet epidemic\u201d of heroin and prescription drug use by expanding treatment options and sentencing reform for low-level and non-violent drug offenses.", "title": "Why Every Candidate Campaigning on Criminal Justice Reform Needs to Be Talking About Addiction", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/192982/presidential-candidates-need-to-talk-about-addiction/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gettyimages-485304264.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton announced on Wednesday a proposal to address the \u201cquiet epidemic\u201d of heroin and prescription drug use by expanding treatment options and sentencing reform for low-level and", "title": "Why every candidate campaigning on criminal justice reform needs to be", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/192982/presidential-candidates-need-to-talk-about-addiction/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gettyimages-485304264.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Drugs,2016 Presidential Election"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9749\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our healthcare system,\u201d Paul said in a statement.\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for a presidential candidate who will use the words \u2018harm reduction.\u2019 A lot of these proposals are consistent with harm reduction principles, but we\u2019re seeing, at the state and local level, harm reduction strategies like overdose prevention and syringe exchange become much more mainstream,\u201d Raymond explained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we recognize that our state and federal prisons, where 65 percent of inmates meet medical criteria for substance use disorders, are no substitute for proper treatment\u2014and reform our criminal justice system,\u201d Clinton wrote.\n\u201cThose are the numbers that have been missing in a lot of the policy debate so far,\u201d Daniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition, told me.\nJohn Kasich, who has defended his decision to expand Medicaid in his state by talking explicitly about the healthcare needs of his constituents."}
