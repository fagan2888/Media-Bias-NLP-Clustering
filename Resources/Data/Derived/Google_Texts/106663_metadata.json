Now that 2016 is here, the CBO says that just 177 million people, on average, will have private health insurance in any given month of this year\u2014a shortfall of 24 million people. Indeed, based on the CBO\u2019s own numbers, it seems possible that Obamacare has actually reduced the number of people with private health insurance. In 2013, the CBO projected that, without Obamacare, 186 million people would be covered by private health insurance in 2016\u2014160 million on employer-based plans, 26 million on individually purchased plans. The CBO now says that, with Obamacare, 177 million people will be covered by private health insurance in 2016\u2014155 million on employer-based plans, 12 million on plans bought through Obamacare\u2019s government-run exchanges, and 9 million on other individually purchased plans (plus a rounding error of 1 million). In other words, it would appear that a net 9 million people have lost their private health plans, thanks to Obamacare\u2014with a net 5 million people having lost employer-based plans and a net 4 million people having lost individually purchased plans. None of this is to say that fewer people have \u201ccoverage\u201d under Obamacare\u2014it\u2019s just not private coverage. In 2013, the CBO projected that 34 million people would be on Medicaid or CHIP (the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) in 2016. The CBO now says that 68 million people will be on Medicaid or CHIP in 2016\u2014double its earlier estimate. It turns out that Obamacare is pretty much a giant Medicaid expansion.\n\nHow can anyone paper over a disaster of this magnitude? Easy \u2013 just magically rewrite the projections for the imaginary world in which ObamaCare didn\u2019t pass, then claim \u2013 without any substantiation whatsoever \u2013 that the number of people in that ObamaCare-free Earth-2 who have private insurance would be 20 million less than CBO projected in 2013, and they\u2019d all be on Medicaid instead.\n\nWhen the projections that were used to sell a massive government program are retroactively revised to make it look better, We the People can rest assured we are being ripped off. That\u2019s doubly true when the end result of the process is something America would have rebelled against, before they were \u201csocially engineered\u201d at their own expense.\n\nAmerican taxpayers were charged a staggering amount of money \u2013 and have lost countless man-hours grappling with ObamaCare\u2019s crashtastic website and gruesome bureaucracy \u2013 to get a stealth Medicaid expansion they never would have agreed to, if it had been presented to them honestly, beginning with the 2008 presidential election. A lot of people lost insurance plans they love, for no better reason than Democrats\u2019 lust for power, and their institutional refusal to be honest about their socialist plans.\n\nOf course, the same media that peddled Obama\u2019s phony statistics, phony doctors, and false promises to create the illusion of devastating health care crisis has absolutely zero interest in turning the spotlight on ObamaCare\u2019s many, many victims.\n\nSocialism cannot muster even the faintest pretense of compassion for its victims. Those who have been hosed by the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act are non-persons, expected to suffer in silence, their complaints as invalid and immoral as a billionaire who objects to a tax increase. Their complaints don\u2019t even matter when it\u2019s obvious they were made to suffer for no good reason at all.\n\nThe people who inflicted ObamaCare on America don\u2019t consider a hideously overpriced stealth Medicaid exemption to be \u201cfailure.\u201d Single-payer health care has been their not-so-secret agenda all along.\n\nPushing a huge number of Americans out of private insurance, and into Medicaid, is a major step toward that goal. (As Anderson points out, the nature of ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies, which are paid directly to insurers, also drags the American public closer to a \u201csingle-payer\u201d mindset.)\n\nDoctor\u2019s offices grow ever more distant from the free market. In a few more years, when people have started to forget the high quality and lower prices of insurance before ObamaCare came along, it will be time to take the next step. Resistance will be far more difficult when a growing percentage of the populace already thinks of health care as a \u201cfree\u201d benefit provided by their benevolent rulers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Goalposts Moved Again, As ObamaCare Comes Up 24 Million Enrollees Short", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Goalposts Moved Again, As ObamaCare Comes Up 24 Million Enrollees Short", "title": "Goalposts Moved Again, As ObamaCare Comes Up 24 Million Enrollees Short - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Obamacare-signup-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/29/goalposts-frantically-moved-as-obamacare-comes-up-24-million-enrollees-short/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Goalposts Moved Again, As ObamaCare Comes Up 24 Million Enrollees Short", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Obamacare-signup-Getty.jpg", "title": "Goalposts Moved Again, As ObamaCare Comes Up 24 Million Enrollees Short - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, congressional budget office, medicaid, obamacare, single-payer healthcare,Big Government, Obamacare,ObamaCare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "single-payer healthcare", "published_time": "2016-03-29T11:49:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In 2013, the CBO projected that, without Obamacare, 186 million people would be covered by private health insurance in 2016\u2014160 million on employer-based plans, 26 million on individually purchased plans.\nIndeed, based on the CBO\u2019s own numbers, it seems possible that Obamacare has actually reduced the number of people with private health insurance.\nNow that 2016 is here, the CBO says that just 177 million people, on average, will have private health insurance in any given month of this year\u2014a shortfall of 24 million people.\nA lot of people lost insurance plans they love, for no better reason than Democrats\u2019 lust for power, and their institutional refusal to be honest about their socialist plans.\nPushing a huge number of Americans out of private insurance, and into Medicaid, is a major step toward that goal."}
