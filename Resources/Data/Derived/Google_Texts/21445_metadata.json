The need for wellness programs has never been greater, and employers are uniquely positioned to improve population health by starting right in the workplace. Wellness should always be inclusive, voluntary, and should protect the privacy of the people it is aimed to serve.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the program has a concrete ROI when it comes to healthcare costs, McDonough said that in some cases it has \u2014 she shared a number of case studies in her written testimony \u2014 but in other cases, that\u2019s not yet what employers are looking for.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a value on investment, termed VOI, which includes productivity and absenteeism and things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployers are looking holistically across that. But there\u2019s not always an expectation for most employees that there\u2019s going to be a direct healthcare savings cost in the next year.\u201d\n\nThere was some discussion about what constitutes voluntary participation when premiums or payments are tied to an employee\u2019s decision to participate in a program. Sabrina Corlette, Senior Research Professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, argued that not only are those programs coercive, there\u2019s little evidence that they\u2019re effective.\n\n\u201cWellness programs that are tied to some premium-based financial incentive have really not been shown by themselves to change behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does seem to work are targeted disease management programs that really target people with diabetes or heart disease with direct, personal interventions. Also, frankly, changing the environment. Google is a great example of a company that has experimented with different wellness things, but one of the most effective things was, in their cafeteria, moving the healthy foods up front, reducing the sizes of plates and bowls.\u201d\n\nRather than incentivize participation monetarily, McDonough said that when Fitbit works with employers, the focus is on getting that voluntary opt-in by really working with employees.\n\n\u201cCommunication and transparency upfront is what leads to great participation rates,\u201d she said. \u201cA shared commitment to health, a culture of wellness, and really understanding what data\u2019s being shared, how it\u2019s being used, and how that\u2019s going to impact the culture within the organization.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Fitbit benefits from being a household consumer name that puts employees at ease.\n\n\u201cThe adoption rate can sometimes be a barrier, but what\u2019s great about consumer technology is you\u2019re able to capitalize on a movement that\u2019s already happening in the marketplace and being able to increase those participation rates,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing in a corporate marketplace, we\u2019re able to push back a lot of those objections.\u201d\n\nFinally, McDonough emphasized that getting employees to participate in a wellness program also meant assuring them of the privacy and safety of their data and securing employees\u2019 trust.\n\n\u201cThe privacy of our user data and the trust of our customers is paramount at Fitbit,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we have a clear easy to read, friendly, privacy policy. It\u2019s written in plain English so that they can understand it. When we work with an employer on an employer wellness program, they have to opt in and give explicit consent to share data with an employer and it\u2019s a subset of the data that\u2019s collected by Fitbit overall.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amy McDonough, Vice President and General Manager at Fitbit Wellness, testified before a congressional hearing last week in a session entitled \u201cInnovations in Health Care: Exploring Free-Market Solutions for a Healthy Workforce\u201d.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "MobiHealthNews", "description": "Amy McDonough, Vice President and General Manager at Fitbit Wellness, testified before a congressional hearing last week in a session entitled \u201cInnovations in Health Care: Exploring Free-Market Solutions for a Healthy Workforce\u201d.", "title": "Fitbit employee wellness chief talks privacy, adoption, ROI at congressional hearing", "url": "http://mobihealthnews.com/content/fitbit-employee-wellness-chief-talks-privacy-adoption-roi-congressional-hearing", "image": "http://mobihealthnews.com/sites/default/files/Amy%20McDonough%202_1.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-18T19:10:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mobihealthnews.com/content/fitbit-employee-wellness-chief-talks-privacy-adoption-roi-congressional-hearing", "image": {"src": "http://mobihealthnews.com/sites/default/files/Amy%20McDonough%202_1.png"}, "description": "Amy McDonough, Vice President and General Manager at Fitbit Wellness, testified before a congressional hearing last week in a session entitled \u201cInnovations in Health Care: Exploring Free-Market Solutions for a Healthy Workforce\u201d.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fitbit employee wellness chief talks privacy, adoption, ROI at congressional hearing"}, "keywords": "digital health news, mobile health news, health apps, medical apps, fitness apps", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-18T19:01:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T19:10:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe fundamental goal of any wellness program should be to provide opportunities for individuals to improve their health and wellness.\n\u201cWellness programs that are tied to some premium-based financial incentive have really not been shown by themselves to change behavior,\u201d she said.\nThe need for wellness programs has never been greater, and employers are uniquely positioned to improve population health by starting right in the workplace.\nAmy McDonough, Vice President and General Manager at Fitbit Wellness, testified before a congressional hearing last week in a session entitled \u201cInnovations in Health Care: Exploring Free-Market Solutions for a Healthy Workforce\u201d.\n\u201cThe privacy of our user data and the trust of our customers is paramount at Fitbit,\u201d she said."}
