At least that\u2019s what an ongoing revolt by researchers against one of Europe\u2019s most ambitious scientific projects appears to show.\n\nWith $1.6 billion in funding and hundreds of researchers from across the continent, the European Union\u2019s Human Brain Project (HBP) is attempting to simulate the workings of the human brain using big data systems. It represents the EU\u2019s grandest undertaking in science since the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed its search for the so-called \u201cGod particle.\u201d\n\nLike that experiment, which succeeded in 2013 \u2014 and the sequencing of the human genome a decade ago \u2014 the Human Brain Project is addressing one of the greatest challenges facing 21st century science. And it promises huge rewards.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nBut last month, more than 150 neuroscientists signed an open letter to the European Commission demanding a new, more transparent review of the project, suggesting it\u2019s \u201cnot on course\u201d and that its funding should be parceled out to smaller neuroscience projects as individual grants.\n\nSince the letter was published, the number of signatories has grown to more than 600.\n\nThey argue that autocratic leadership and flaws in the project\u2019s design have doomed it to failure, and they\u2019ve threatened a boycott if something doesn\u2019t change.\n\nIn an official response, the European Commission said that it welcomes debate, and some HBP members say they\u2019re open to discussions.\n\nLed by Zachary Mainen, director of the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme in Portugal, the dissenters say that\u2019s a promising sign.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more going on between people in the European Commission and the HBP than there was before all this,\u201d Mainen said in an interview.\n\nNevertheless, both sides have become increasingly entrenched since the squabble became public.\n\nThe HBP leadership points out that the project was selected only after a lengthy review process by a panel of 25 renowned experts in the field. Raising objections now, they say, is like complaining about a sports referee\u2019s credentials only after he\u2019s ruled against your side.\n\nThe dissenters insist that review process was meaningless because the panel\u2019s members are anonymous, their deliberations made behind closed doors. The protesters are unofficially calling for the project leader, Henry Markram \u2014 a professor of neuroscience based in Switzerland \u2014 to be replaced.\n\nIn a sign of how frayed tempers have become, the project\u2019s co-director Karlheinz Meier, a University of Heidelberg professor who specializes in computer modeling of neural circuits, says he resents the opposition\u2019s methods more than their arguments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this kind of Facebook style which has been chosen, to just click on the letter and say I like it or I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said of the open letter. \u201cThis is not the way science works.\u201d\n\nThere are real scientific differences, too.\n\nIn what Markram has described as \u201ca paradigm shift\u201d for neuroscience, he hopes to gather the vast amount of existing data about various neural structures in order to plug into a yet-to-be-developed supercomputer. It would run thousands of statistical simulations to determine the most likely connections and interactions between them.\n\nIf it works, the method could \u201creverse engineer\u201d a map of the brain\u2019s circuitry that would otherwise take millions of conventional experiments to achieve, he says.\n\nTo further that focus, the HBP in May slashed the arm of the project devoted to cognitive neuroscience \u2014 the more theoretical study of the connections between neurons and higher mental processes such as decision-making and memory. The open letter\u2019s signatories say that\u2019s turned the project into a computing exercise, drastically lowering its odds of teaching us much about the brain.\n\nThey argue that simulations alone will never be enough to provide an understanding of how the firing of neurons translates into thoughts and feelings. Instead, they advocate constant interplay between the theoreticians who look at brain function from the top down \u2014 from the perspective of behavior \u2014 and those who look at it from the bottom up, from the perspective of neurons.\n\nAlexandre Pouget, a neuroscientist from the University of Geneva, says without contributions from both sides, it would be astounding if the project achieves its goal of building an artificial human brain within ten years.\n\n\u201cI would be blown away and would probably retire,\u201d he said.\n\nMarkram and his supporters counter by saying that\u2019s exactly the same kind of nay-saying that was once leveled at the human genome project, the Hubble space telescope, the CERN supercollider and other successful scientific collaborations during their early stages.\n\nCo-director Meier says scientists already have plenty of theoretical understanding to get started on the project as it\u2019s currently envisioned.\n\n\u201cIf we would wait until we\u2019ve understood the brain, then we wouldn\u2019t have to simulate it anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether or not the European Commission agrees remains to be seen.\n\nThis article was published by Global Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dissenters are threatening to boycott a $1.6 billion attempt to simulate the brain\u2019s workings.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jason Berry", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Dissenters are threatening to boycott a $1.6 billion attempt to simulate the brain\u2019s workings.", "title": "Scientists Revolt Against One Of Europe\u2019s Most Ambitious Research Projects", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/scientists-revolt-one-europes-ambitious-research-projects/194819/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP354307990846.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-01T15:19:39-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dissenters are threatening to boycott a $1.6 billion attempt to simulate the brain\u2019s workings.", "title": "Scientists Revolt Against One Of Europe\u2019s Most Ambitious Research Projects", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP354307990846.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "science", "published_time": "2014-08-02T05:00:23-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T15:19:39-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5ff\"", "article_summary": "At least that\u2019s what an ongoing revolt by researchers against one of Europe\u2019s most ambitious scientific projects appears to show.\nScientists Revolt Against One Of Europe\u2019s Most Ambitious Research ProjectsDissenters are threatening to boycott a $1.6 billion attempt to simulate the brain\u2019s workings.\nWith $1.6 billion in funding and hundreds of researchers from across the continent, the European Union\u2019s Human Brain Project (HBP) is attempting to simulate the workings of the human brain using big data systems.\nLed by Zachary Mainen, director of the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme in Portugal, the dissenters say that\u2019s a promising sign.\nIn an official response, the European Commission said that it welcomes debate, and some HBP members say they\u2019re open to discussions."}
