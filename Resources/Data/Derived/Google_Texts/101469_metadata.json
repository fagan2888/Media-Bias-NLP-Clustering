Are you mad that the unemployment rate in this country is 4.9 percent? Are you mad that 14.5 million new jobs have been created? Are you mad that 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions now have health coverage? Are you mad that 20 million hard-working Americans now have health insurance coverage for the first time because of the Affordable Care Act, the deficit has been cut more than 50 percent and gasoline is only $2 per gallon.\n\nMe? I'm really mad that 25 percent of the American workforce only earns $7.25 per hour. I'm really mad that the budget President Obama submitted to Congress was met by my party saying it was dead on arrival. I'm really mad that the 2011 American Jobs Bill, that would have created 100,000s of new jobs was blocked. I'm really mad that the Iranian Nuclear pact was met with such furious negativism by my party, when anyone in there right mind knows that controls and limitations to contain nuclear production by Iran, a country who says Americans are the devil, is a great thing. Finally I'm furious that my party won't even give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing or an up and down vote.\n\nThis is not the Republican Party with the values and integrity that I know from 10 years ago, or 20 years ago. Ronald Reagan would be turning over in his grave. I'm voting for the only intelligent and qualified candidate around today. I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarold Buttitta, Boynton Beach", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "What are you mad about?", "Description": "I'm a Republican and I have been watching what has occurred in the last seven years and I'm wondering some things.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "author": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "I'm a Republican and I have been watching what has occurred in the last seven years and I'm wondering some things.", "title": "What are you mad about?", "url": "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/letters/fl-letter-party-0424-20160426-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57202a1c/turbine/fl-letter-party-0424-20160426", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.17", "twitter": {"site": "@sunsentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402230662, app-argument=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/deeplinkid/86862548", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 64829476886, "app_id": 728754867160252}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-26", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "I'm really mad that 25 percent of the American workforce only earns $7.25 per hour.\nI'm really mad that the 2011 American Jobs Bill, that would have created 100,000s of new jobs was blocked.\nI'm really mad that the budget President Obama submitted to Congress was met by my party saying it was dead on arrival.\nAre you mad that 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions now have health coverage?\nAre you mad that 14.5 million new jobs have been created?"}
