Attaching a sunset clause will require regulations and programs to be debated regularly by Congress, ensuring their relevance and efficiency and saving taxpayer dollars.\n\nFull Federal Audit\u2014Iowans deserve to know where their tax dollars are going. Every agency and program must be subject to public audit, increasing transparency and trust, while curbing costs from waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nGenerational Accounting\u2014Currently, the Congressional Budget Office only looks at the 10-year impact of legislation, allowing costly and fiscally irresponsible policy, like Obamacare, to slip through. Generational accounting will require Congress to be presented with the long-term impact of legislation on future generations before it\u2019s brought to vote.\n\nFlatter, Fairer, Simpler\u2014The current code is 73,000 pages, that is unacceptable. America needs a fairer, flatter and simpler, pro-growth tax code that is permanent and allows families to keep more of their hard earned money and businesses to be competitive and grow.\n\nBalanced Budget Amendment\u2014Thanks to years of deficit spending from both sides of the aisle, the national debt is $17 trillion, and still growing. 49 states require a balanced budget \u2013 it\u2019s time Iowans demand the same of Washington D.C.\n\nFull Repeal of Obamacare\u2014Drafted in haste, passed in the dark, and falling apart before the president\u2019s eyes, we need to defund, delay, repeal and rip out Obamacare once and for all, and replace it with free market principles that drive down costs and preserve the high quality of American medicine.\n\nDavid Young Is a Republican from Van Meter and former chief of staff for Senator Chuck Grassley, vying for the open U.S. Senate seat of retiring Senator Tom Harkin.
