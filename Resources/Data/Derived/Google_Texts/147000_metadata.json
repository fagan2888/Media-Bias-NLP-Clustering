It did not give details on the substance of the talks.\n\nThe $1 billion Kia project aims to build a plant with a production capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year. It will cater to demand from North America and South America.\n\n(Writing by Dave Graham; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The government in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, led by independent Jaime Rodriguez", "title": "Mexican state government eyes deal with Kia to end plant dispute", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Mexican-state-government-eyes-deal-Kia-end-plant-dispute", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-business_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Mexican-state-government-eyes-deal-Kia-end-plant-dispute", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-business_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The government in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, led by independent Jaime Rodriguez", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "No comment was immediately available from the South Korean delegation.\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye was visiting Mexico on Monday and the Nuevo Leon government said state officials held a productive meeting with members of the South Korean delegation to seek a resolution to the impasse.\nThe $1 billion Kia project aims to build a plant with a production capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year.\nThe government in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, led by independent Jaime Rodriguez, has been demanding that Kia renegotiate some of the incentives pledged in an accord struck in 2014 under the previous state administration.\nNuevo Leon's government said it hoped it would have a response from Kia in a week about what had been proposed on Monday."}
