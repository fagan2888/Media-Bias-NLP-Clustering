They\u2019re typically 6-foot-2 or taller and possess among the best vision and most athleticism on the team. Positioning and determination to stay within strict boundaries defines their strength.\n\nFor shooters, a highlight-reel shot or a fortunate bounce often is the only avenue to score.\n\n\u201cAll the goalies are so good, you have to beat them on perfect shots or rebounds. That\u2019s the only way,\u201d Avalanche forward Matt Duchene said with slight exaggeration.\n\nThe goaltenders\u2019 value has increased despite the fact shooters have advanced equipment technology on their side. One-piece stick manufacturers continue to produce revolutionary products that put more whip and zip on shots. Never before have players shot the puck more quickly, faster or with more disguise, and pure skill is at an all-time high.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just looking at the stick and the curve,\u201d Avs goalie Semyon Varlamov said. \u201cAnd then I try to, before the shot, make good position, try to get set before the shot and try to stay on top of the crease. That\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cSome goalies say they usually are looking at the eyes or the body control position. I\u2019m always looking at the stick. If you\u2019re going to look at them in the eyes, they might look left and shoot to the right side. That\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nTracking the puck always will be a key component for any goalie. But in today\u2019s game, goalies don\u2019t often make the read until the puck has left the stick.\n\nIn the past, a closed (downward) stick blade on the puck would suggest a low shot, and an open (upward) stick blade would mean it\u2019s going high \u2014 particularly if the puck is on the heel of the stick.\n\nBut stick technology has aided in disguising shots.\n\n\u201cSome players have weird shots,\u201d Avs\u2019 second-string goalie Reto Berra said. \u201cEven if the puck is on the heel, it comes straight on the ice.\u201d\n\nBerra says the great puck stoppers such as the Rangers\u2019 Henrik Lundqvist have rare tracking abilities.\n\n\u201cYou see Lundqvist playing so deep because he tracks and reads the shots so good,\u201d Berra said. \u201cYou have to be really focused and sharp with your eyes to watch the puck on the blade, because at this level, it goes really fast.\u201d\n\nLundqvist is a relatively small goalie at 6-foot-1, the same listed height as Kings standout Jonathan Quick. They are the exceptions in a league trending toward 6-4 goalies such as Berra. The NHL\u2019s tallest goalie is 6-7 Ben Bishop of Tampa Bay. Minnesota Devan Dubnyk, Arizona\u2019s Anders Lindback and Scott Darling of Chicago are 6-5. The Coyotes\u2019 Mike Smith (6-4) and Lindback make up the league\u2019s tallest goaltending tandem.\n\nBig isn\u2019t always better. Shorter goalies such as Lundqvist, Quick and up-and-coming Avs 6-1 goalie Calvin Pickard might track the puck better because their eyes are closer to the ice, thus they can locate the puck\u2019s trajectory. Varlamov is 6-2.\n\nUniversity of Denver goalie Evan Cowley, a 6-5 draftee of the Florida Panthers, alternates starts with undrafted Tanner Jaillet, who is listed at 5-11 but probably is closer to 5-10. Cowley said he never has seen a goalie track the puck better than Jaillet.\n\nWhatever size of a goalie in net, he\u2019s focused on stopping a slap shot or snap shot. Wrist shots are a thing of the past, primarily because of stick technology that promotes heavy whip on a quick release.\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy, one of the greatest goalies ever, said in his career, he gave shooters more net to shoot at from his left.\n\n\u201cI always tried to give a bit more on the glove side than on the blocker,\u201d said Roy, who is 6-2. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I was cheating, but I felt that it was easier for me to make saves on my glove side than on my blocker side. I\u2019m not saying I was weaker on the blocker side than on the glove side, but I felt that it gave me a little bit of an idea where the players were going to shoot. This is how I was playing my angle. And then only on short side, I always tried to give the far side as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAvs forward Jarome Iginla, who is approaching 600 career goals, said disguising a shot is key to scoring in the NHL.\n\n\u201cIf you can come up with a little different release or shoot it through traffic or turn your blade over \u2014 anything to get them to try to move in a little bit different direction \u2014 you\u2019re trying it,\u201d he said.\n\nVersatility is also a must, which is why goalies typically don\u2019t study shooting habits from a particular player. Berra says he rarely anticipates what a shooter will do.\n\n\u201cMost goalies I talk to \u2014 especially about shootouts \u2014 they like to just react because they don\u2019t want to have something in their head before the guy does it,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cLet\u2019s say a guy has seen a lot of my shots go high and if he expects that and I throw one low or five-hole, he\u2019s screwed.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the same in games. If they see a guy scoring a lot of goals top-corner, they may know that\u2019s their favorite spot to shoot, but it\u2019s dangerous to anticipate that.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tracking key to NHL goalies\u2019 success against better shooting", "title": "Tracking key to NHL goalies\u2019 success against better shooting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/tracking-key-to-nhl-goalies-success-against-better-shooting/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__843c11b165c38a36890f6a706700123dp1.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__843c11b165c38a36890f6a706700123dp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T21:54:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:46:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Never before have players shot the puck more quickly, faster or with more disguise, and pure skill is at an all-time high.\n\u201cAll the goalies are so good, you have to beat them on perfect shots or rebounds.\nVersatility is also a must, which is why goalies typically don\u2019t study shooting habits from a particular player.\n\u201cAnd then I try to, before the shot, make good position, try to get set before the shot and try to stay on top of the crease.\nBut in today\u2019s game, goalies don\u2019t often make the read until the puck has left the stick."}
