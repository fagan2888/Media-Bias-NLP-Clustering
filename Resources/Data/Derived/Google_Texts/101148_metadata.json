This is a program that has the potential to save states a lot of money if it's done correctly.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute on Aging explains how seniors can continue to live at home.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/economic-status-health-news-224/home-delivered-meals-could-help-some-avoid-nursing-home-study-680963.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/elderly_59331.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Many states could save money by feeding seniors at home rather than paying for residential care", "title": "Home-Delivered Meals Could Help Some Avoid Nursing Home: Study"}, "description": "Many states could save money by feeding seniors at home rather than paying for residential care", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18b5\"", "article_summary": "This is a program that has the potential to save states a lot of money if it's done correctly.\"\nFRIDAY, Oct. 11, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Expanding programs that provide meals to seniors would help keep more of them out of nursing homes and save some states money, according to a new study.\nThe findings provide guidance for state policymakers as they consider the future of their home-delivered meals programs, said study lead author Kali Thomas, an assistant professor in the School of Public Health.\nResearchers found that if every state in the continental United States increased the number of seniors who received meals at home by just 1 percent, it would help keep 1,722 more Medicaid recipients out of nursing homes.\n\"We're not proposing that all states simply increase the proportion of age 65 plus receiving meals by 1 percent,\" she pointed out."}
