Most cases involved unvaccinated people, those exposed to foreign travellers or both.\n\nAustralia is not immune either, with several outbreaks recently in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nVictorian health authorities in August warned of a measles outbreak after 10 cases were diagnosed in three weeks.\n\nAustralian children receive the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination at 12 months and a secondary booster vaccine at 18 months.\n\nThe vaccine is free for all Australians as part of the National Immunisation Program.\n\nMeasles kills 160,000 people each year worldwide, but US vaccine programs - including a 1993 federal law establishing a public-private partnership with drug companies - have reduced the yearly national average to 60 cases. But there were 222 cases in 2011, and the CDC frets about a nascent trend.\n\nPfizer chief executive officer Ian Read said this week that he was concerned about a low level of public trust in drug companies. Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, confirmed when asked if she wanted drugmakers to speak differently to encourage vaccinations.\n\n\"There may be questions that the public has about their independence and why they are speaking,\" Dr Schuchat said.\n\n\"We know that we wouldn't have these vaccines if the manufacturers didn't produce them. But we also know that the public and parents in general want independent messaging about vaccinations.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "MOST health care professionals regret that some parents don't vaccinate children because of now-debunked reports of vaccines causing autism.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "MOST health care professionals regret that some parents don't vaccinate children because of now-debunked reports of vaccines causing autism.", "title": "No vaccination puts kids at 'extraordinary risk': researcher", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/researcher-says-not-to-vaccinate-is-nuts/story-fneuzlbd-1226719306839", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/09/15/1226695/871344-vaccine-vaccination-children.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/09/15/1226695/871344-vaccine-vaccination-children.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226719306839, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "keywords": "Vaccines, Measles, Emilio Emini, case, top vaccine, extraordinary risk, children", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Sep 14 23:59:00 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Sep 14 23:59:00 EST 2013", "author": "By David Sell, The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca03e\"", "article_summary": "The CDC said 2013 is one of the worst years in the past two decades, with 159 measles cases identified through August 21.\n\"They leave the children of others at extraordinary risk as well because vaccines often work by population-based immunity.\"\nAustralian children receive the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination at 12 months and a secondary booster vaccine at 18 months.\nMOST health care professionals regret that some parents don't vaccinate children because of now-debunked reports of vaccines causing autism.\nDrug companies supply vaccines, but their for-profit status makes part of the public suspicious and hampers the companies' role in promoting vaccinations."}
