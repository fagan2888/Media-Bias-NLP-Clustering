ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Americans, even Republicans, are willing witnesses for Sen. Bernie Sanders and his long-shot presidential bid. The hair, the gumption, the unapologetic ideology - all that could appeal to an audience trained to root for the underdog, just as they would a reality TV contestant determined to beat the odds. The Vermont Independent is a cultural force to be reckoned with. Will he also be a political force?

“Socialist elements of Sanders‘ ideology and policy positions will no doubt appeal to a segment of the Democratic base and the two-term senator’s colorful personality and high energy may lead to respectable enough fundraising numbers to sustain him well into the early contests,” says Eric Ostermeier, a University of Minnesota political professor who says Mr. Sanders has some history on his side.

Mr. Sanders is just the fifth presidential candidate to run for a major party nomination in Vermont history - and just the third to launch a bona fide campaign, the professor says. That small group includes former Governor Howard Dean.

“As for Sanders, his candidacy announcement should garner him enough attention to launch him into double-digits in nationwide polling for the Democratic nomination - something that has eluded him thus far in hypothetical horse race polls,” says Mr. Ostermeier. “Sanders should also see an uptick in support once pollsters finally agree to remove fellow Northeastern liberal Elizabeth Warren from their candidate lists.”
