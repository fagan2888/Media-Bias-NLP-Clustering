Mayor Vincent Gray has been playing defense in the news media against \u201cadvocates for workers\u201d who favor a \u201cliving wage bill.\u201d That\u2019s partly the result of shrewd marketing on the part of lawmakers who favor the legislation \u2013 who doesn\u2019t favor a \u201cliving wage?\u201d But it\u2019s also because reporters do not typically question self-described \u201cworker advocates\u201d about the economic realities attached to a higher minimum wage.\n\nWhen the government mandates a higher wage beyond what employers can afford to pay for unskilled labor, the result is higher unemployment. In other words, if the self-proclaimed \u201cadvocates\u201d of the working class had there way, the number of people with jobs would be smaller.\n\nAfter Mayor Gray vetoed a so-called \u201cliving wage\u201d bill in September, the Washington Post ran a series of reports that call out for additional investigation. The proposed legislation -- officially titled the \u201cLarge Retailer Accountability Act\u201d -- would have directed retailers with sales of at least $1 billion to pay employees a minimum of $12.50 an hour in combined wages and benefits up from the current minimum wage of $8.25 an hour. Union officials have a vested interest in the bill since it includes an exception for employers who collectively bargain with their workers. To its credit, the Washington Post makes it clear in a Sept. 12 report that the bill would put Wal-Mart at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cThe union exemption and square-footage requirement rankled Wal-Mart officials, who said those provisions created an uneven playing field \u2014 particularly with the unionized grocery chains they plan to compete with in the city,\u201d the report says. But that\u2019s not the full story. Contrary to what D.C. council members have been telling members of the press, the proposed \u201cliving wage\u201d would result in fewer opportunities for the newest and most needy members of the workforce. Yet, the Washington Post claims the \u201cbill would raise the annual earnings of a full-time employee making the lowest legal wage from about $17,000 to $26,000.\u201d That\u2019s assuming they are hired in the first place and that\u2019s assuming employers are willing to pay that wage.\n\nIf readers were better acquainted with what recent studies said about laws that raise the minimum wage, the political class would have a lot more to answer for in the press. Just last year, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity published a reporton teenage unemployment that deserves more attention.\n\nBy increasing the minimum wage from $6.75 to $7.40 in 2005, Rhode Island policymakers cost the state\u2019s teens 397 jobs in 2011, the study concluded. Out of that total, the study also said 306 were lost to those without high school diplomas.\n\n\u201cBecause of this minimum wage increase hundreds of Rhode Island teens are not going to have the chance to earn a paycheck, to learn important business skills and build their resumes,\u201d Mike Stenhouse, president and CEO of the Center, observed.\n\nThe Rhode Island think tank also inserts some national figures in its study that would greatly benefit the reporting that flows out of Washington D.C.\n\n\u201cOf the 24 states with unemployment over 8.0% for 2011, 11 had set their minimum wages above the federal $7.25 per hour,\u201d according to the study. \u201cOf the 26 states with 8.0% unemployment or lower, only six had elevated minimums. The average unemployment rate for the former was 9.0%, compared with 7.7% for those in which the federal rate applied.\u201d\n\nWhile the Post makes a sincere effort to balance out its ongoing coverage of Mayor Gray\u2019s veto by quoting him at length, it fails to highlight studies that bolster his arguments. That\u2019s unfortunate because the objective facts here make it clear that jobs are lost when government officials intervene into the free market with benign sounding terms like the \u201cliving wage\u201d that translate into lost work opportunities.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "For the past several weeks, Washington D.C.
