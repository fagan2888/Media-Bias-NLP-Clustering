Terry McAuliffe on Wednesday announced a sweeping plan to better train workers for skilled jobs and speed the employment of military veterans, a policy that Republican leaders \u2014 in a rare show of bipartisanship \u2014 said they could agree on.\n\nThe \u201cNew Virginia Economy Workforce Initiative\u201d is similar in scope to plans rolled out recently in Maryland and other states, said Andy Van Kleunen, executive director of the nonprofit National Skills Coalition. It focuses on \u201cmiddle-skills jobs,\u201d which require some training past high school but not necessarily a four-year degree, and are most in demand in Virginia and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart way to target investments and skills, and it\u2019s going to get more people to jobs more quickly,\u201d Kleunen said. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s brought part attention to these middle-skills jobs, I think that\u2019s going to pay off for Virginia down the road.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe (D), who likes to call himself the state\u2019s \u201cchief jobs creation officer,\u201d set a goal of graduating 50,000 Virginians from training programs in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and health fields \u2014 known as STEM-H \u2014 by the time he leaves office at the end of 2017.\n\nIn contrast to former governor Robert F. McDonnell\u2019s goal of awarding 100,000 associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees over 15 years, McAuliffe said he wants workers to earn \u201ccredentials, licenses, apprenticeships and associate degrees\u201d that translate directly to jobs.\n\nMcAuliffe unveiled the plan before an audience of community college educators, but did not provide details about who would fund the training or where it would take place. The proposal taps Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones and a list of existing state departments to devise strategies for implementing the policies and generate regular reports. Asked if the initiatives would have dedicated funding or staff, McAuliffe said he must first settle the state\u2019s impending budget crisis.\n\n\u201cI want to crush the other 49 states on job creation,\u201d he told the crowd at the Virginia Community College System Chancellor\u2019s Retreat. \u201cI can be the best salesman for our state and I think you all know I love being out there selling. But I need your help to sell Virginia\u2019s high-quality product workforce . . . This is a defining moment for Virginia\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nThe governor has spent much of his first year tangling with House Republicans over whether to expand Medicaid in Virginia through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an option rejected by lawmakers who oppose any increased reliance on federal money.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said that with regard to economic development, he shared the governor\u2019s overall goals.\n\n\u201cWe all recognize that creating good jobs and increasing opportunity for the people of Virginia is a bipartisan issue,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI agree with the governor that the Commonwealth cannot continue to rely on federal funds to drive our economy.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe said Virginia has lost billions due to cuts in U.S. Defense Department spending in the state. The state is facing a revenue shortfall of more than $1.5 billion over the next several years.\n\nOn Friday, McAuliffe will appear before a joint meeting of Senate and House Senate appropriation and finance committees, to unveil a new, downgraded revenue estimate. He noted that budget cuts are likely, but specifics have not been worked out yet.\n\n\u201cThe economy of the past, where we could simply rely on the economic benefits of federal dollars, is over,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cWe need to discard the mentality of entitlement and replace it with a mentality of enlightenment.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, McAuliffe has used his business and political network to attract investors to the state, including a deal for a paper plant in the Richmond suburbs that state officials called the largest ever between a Chinese investor and Virginia.\n\nHe said that as part of the new initiative, which was created by executive order, the state will develop an \u201conline dashboard\u201d to provide geographically specific data about what training programs, jobs and skills are needed, and what\u2019s already available.\n\nMcAuliffe said there are currently 30,000 tech vacancies in Northern Virginia. There and in other more urban parts of the state, vacancies for highly skilled and high-tech workers take, on average, more than a month to fill. At the same time, hundreds of people might apply for each job that opens up in rural Virginia.\n\nTurning to the state\u2019s military population, McAuliffe promised to double the number of veterans hired through the state\u2019s Virginia Values Veterans program, and said he will ask 10,000 businesses to sign pledges to hire veterans.\n\nFinally, McAuliffe said Virginia must diversify its economy with support for small businesses, start-ups, entrepreneurs and patent production.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that our sense of urgency is driven by those Virginians who struggle each and every day just to get by, but who dream of giving their children the opportunities that they never had,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, Terry McAuliffe, jobs, economic plan virginia, virginia military veterans, STEM-H, high-tech workers, vriginia general assembly, Virginia Community College System Chancellor\u2019s Retreat", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Executive order sets goals for training workers, hiring veterans, better matching workers and jobs.", "title": "Here\u2019s what Va.
