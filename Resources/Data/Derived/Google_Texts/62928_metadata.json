They were removed after several patrons complained.\n\nICTMN reported that Sonic\u2019s vice president of public relations, Patrick Lenow, said the remarks on the sign were \u201coffensive \u2026 unacceptable and just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nRELATED Sonic Sign in Missouri Declares \u2018KC Chiefs Will Scalp the Redskins\u2019\n\nRELATED Second Racist Sonic Sign: Scalp and 'Drain the Firewater' of Redskins\n\nBut the group, Eradicating Offensive Native Mascotry, says that an apology is not enough.\n\n\u201cWe feel the company must do something concrete to show that they do not share the views of their employee (who was not fired) at the Sonic Drive-in in Belton, Missouri,\u201d said Jacqueline Keeler, who helped found EONM, in a press release.\n\nThe group has also allied with the National Congress of American Indians in their efforts to hold Sonic accountable. They are calling on the restaurant and \u201cboth [NFL] teams (Washington Redsk*ns and the Kansas City Chiefs) featured in the racist sign to denounce the sign (they have not) and to stop using Native people as mascots.\u201d\n\nRELATED NCAI Report: Redskins Name Has \u201cUgly and Racist Legacy\u201d\n\nBrad Gee, the Chiefs\u2019 communications manager responded to the group\u2019s press release: \u201cThank you for passing this along. I will make sure it gets in the right hands. Just as a little bit of background, our mascot is actually a Wolf. KC Wolf was named after a group of fans at Municipal stadium called the \u2018Wolf Pack.\u2019 Our team name, the Chiefs, was actually created because it was the nickname of Kansas City\u2019s Mayor back in 1963 (Mayor H. Roe Bartle \u2013 \u2018The Chief\u2019), who helped convince our founder to move his Dallas Texans franchise to Kansas City.\u201d\n\nCharles Samuel, Black Creek/Cherokee, and one of more than 50 members on EONM\u2019s Facebook page, said in response to Gee\u2019s email that, \u201cI believe that the fans dressing in Native regalia with war paint and tomahawks etiology date back many years. This behavior is a product of a systematical [sic] dehumanization of America Indians.\u201d\n\nAnd Maggie Smith Hundley, also a member said on Facebook that, \u201cI'm sure most KC fans don't have any idea about their team namesake or even the wolf (as evidenced by fan behavior). I'm a football fan and had no clue about wolf. Anyway, again intent doesn't really matter if fans are dressing up as 'red Indians' aka misappropriating, mocking, which gives other racist behaviors safe harbor at games.\u201d\n\nIn its press release, the group listed three steps Sonic must take to \u201crestore a brand that they say has been \u2018trashed.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u25aa Sonic Corporation will put up a sign with an apology and request that the use of Native people as Mascots be ended. This sign can be at just the Sonic Drive-in in Belton, Missouri or at as many franchisees that are willing to and at the corporate offices. It should say: \"Sonic recognizes the harm Native Mascotry causes and wish that the Redsk*ns & KC Chiefs refrain from using Native people as Mascots.\"\n\n\u25aa If Sonic Corporation and not one of the more than 3,500 restaurants across the country will make such a statement how can Native people patronize them? Even a tribally owned one: the Sonic Drive-in owned by the Wyandotte tribe in Seneca, Missouri? A lack of action implies agreement with the racist sign or at the very least, an unwillingness to come down on the side of what is right in a public way--as public as the racist signs were.\n\n\u25aa We would also like to see Sonic Corporation to create a PSA working with the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and purchase ads educating the public about the harmful stereotypes Native Mascotry promotes.\n\nRELATED National Civil and Human Rights Coalition Calls on Snyder to Drop 'Redskins'\n\nThe organization, EONM, which came together organically, is primarily made up of concerned Native parents who met through their discussions online about the use of Native people as mascots. Their Facebook page was created for parents to share ideas and work collaboratively to stop the promotion of negative sports mascots.\n\nEONM also led the campaign that filed FCC Complaints against Sundays Redskins Chiefs game.\n\nRELATED Social Media Groups Rally for FCC Complaints of \u2018Redskins\u2019 Chiefs Broadcast\n\n\u201cBecause of this ideology the fans give no thought to their disrespectful characterization of a group of diverse people. Just as they can walk in a store and buy a costume of their favorite Disney character and wear it for Halloween, the same thought goes into buying fake Native regalia,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cTo change this culture ideology is going to take a major educational effort!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campaign to Educate Sonic and NFL About Offensive Mascots", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/13/campaign-educate-sonic-and-nfl-about-offensive-mascots-152710", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/sonic_sign_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Campaign to Educate Sonic and NFL About Offensive Mascots"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-13T15:46-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/13/campaign-educate-sonic-and-nfl-about-offensive-mascots-152710", "dc": {"title": "Campaign to Educate Sonic and NFL About Offensive Mascots"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Campaign to Educate Sonic and NFL About Offensive Mascots"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16e8\"", "article_summary": "An organization that called for an apology after a Sonic Drive-in posted two offensive signs is now leading a campaign calling on the Sonic Corporation to educate the public about how offensive Native mascots are.\nEONM also led the campaign that filed FCC Complaints against Sundays Redskins Chiefs game.\nIt should say: \"Sonic recognizes the harm Native Mascotry causes and wish that the Redsk*ns & KC Chiefs refrain from using Native people as Mascots.\"\nRELATED Social Media Groups Rally for FCC Complaints of \u2018Redskins\u2019 Chiefs Broadcast\u201cBecause of this ideology the fans give no thought to their disrespectful characterization of a group of diverse people.\nThe group has also allied with the National Congress of American Indians in their efforts to hold Sonic accountable."}
