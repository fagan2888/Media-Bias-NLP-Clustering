Counting fish. Taking an animal\u2019s temperature. Applying pesticides.\n\nWhen it comes to drones, \u201cyour imagination can go pretty wild in terms of what would be possible,\u201d says Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union.\n\nThis month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued the first permit for agricultural use of unmanned aerial vehicles. Steven Edgar, president and CEO of ADAVSO, says his Idaho-based business will use a lightweight, fixed-wing drone to survey fields of crops.\n\nDrone technology, already used in other countries, can make farmers more efficient by helping them locate problem spots in vast fields or ranchlands. Increased efficiency could mean lower costs for consumers and less impact on the environment if farmers used fewer chemicals because drones showed them exactly where to spray.\n\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group, says agriculture could account for 80 percent of all commercial drone use, once government regulations allow it. That could be a while. The Federal Aviation Administration has been working for years on rules that would balance the desire for commercial flights of small drones with the need to prevent collisions involving manned aircraft.\n\nFive ways drones could affect the food supply:\n\nSCOUTING FARMS\n\nThe first agriculture drones are looking at massive fields of crops to scout out where crops are too wet, too dry, too diseased or too infested with pests. They can help farmers count plants or measure their height. Farmers can now use satellite technology, but it\u2019s slower and less detailed than images from low-flying drone.\n\n\u201cThis is about getting the most productivity from every square inch of a farm,\u201d says ADAVSO\u2019s Edgar.\n\nAlabama farmer Don Glenn said he would buy a drone or use a service that provides drone surveillance on his farm of corn, wheat, soybeans and canola. It\u2019s hard to survey corn fields when they are 8 feet to 10 feet tall, he says.\n\nDrones can carry different tools, including high-resolution cameras, infrared sensors and thermal sensors. Ground-penetrating radar could even measure soil conditions.\n\n___\n\nAPPLYING CHEMICALS\n\nOnce the land is surveyed, farmers could use that data to narrow the areas that need treatment. If a plot of farmland is infested with weeds, for example, a farmer could spray a small amount of herbicide just in that area, instead of an entire field, to kill them. Farmers hope that they eventually could use drones to do the spraying.", "article_metadata": {"description": "5 ways unmanned drones could affect the American food supply", "author": "Mary Clare Jalonick", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "5 ways unmanned drones could affect the American food supply", "title": "5 ways unmanned drones could affect the American food supply", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/25/5_ways_unmanned_drones_could_affect_the_american_food_supply/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/drones-agriculture-5-things.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "5 ways unmanned drones could affect the American food supply", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/drones-agriculture-5-things.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "5 ways unmanned drones could affect the American food supply", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 ways unmanned drones could affect the American food supply", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb0b\"", "article_summary": "Steven Edgar, president and CEO of ADAVSO, says his Idaho-based business will use a lightweight, fixed-wing drone to survey fields of crops.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has been working for years on rules that would balance the desire for commercial flights of small drones with the need to prevent collisions involving manned aircraft.\nIncreased efficiency could mean lower costs for consumers and less impact on the environment if farmers used fewer chemicals because drones showed them exactly where to spray.\nDrone technology, already used in other countries, can make farmers more efficient by helping them locate problem spots in vast fields or ranchlands.\nFive ways drones could affect the food supply:SCOUTING FARMSThe first agriculture drones are looking at massive fields of crops to scout out where crops are too wet, too dry, too diseased or too infested with pests."}
