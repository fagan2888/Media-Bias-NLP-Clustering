The speakers at Tuesday\u2019s event echoed legislative Republicans and Gov. Paul LePage, saying the federal government couldn\u2019t be trusted to provide the funds it promises, and that Maine could not afford its share.\n\nCarol Weston, a former lawmaker and executive director of Americans for Prosperity\u2019s Maine chapter, compared Medicaid spending to Pacman, saying it was eating up everything in its path.\n\nBrian Powers, a school committee member from Hope, lamented the state\u2019s failure to meet its statutory obligation to fund 55 percent of the total cost of public K-12 education in Maine. \u201cYet we\u2019re talking about expansion of a program that encourages people to be dependent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to fund everything out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Legislature needs to realize we can\u2019t be all things to all people.\u201d\n\nEach side has its own set of numbers and studies backing up its point.\n\nRepublicans and other opponents of expansion have cited figures from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, which say the plan would cost more than $70 million in the first biennium after federal funding levels drop from 100 percent, and more than $250 million in the ensuing two budget cycles. A report by the conservative Alexander Group of Rhode Island said expansion would cost Maine more than $800 million over 10 years.\n\nDemocrats point to figures by the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review that indicate expansion would save the state $8.3 million in its first three years and leverage $1.1 billion in federal funds during that period. In the fourth year, the cost to the state would be about $5.2 million, according to OFPR, while the federal government would chip in nearly $349 million.\n\nAny costs associated with expansion will more than be covered by offsets and savings of the program, said House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, on Tuesday. Eves is a lead sponsor on one of two Medicaid expansion bills under consideration this session.\n\n\u201cWe know the federal government will pick up the tab for programs that the state is fully funding now,\u201d said Eves in a written statement. Eves went on to cite studies by the Kaiser Foundation, Harvard University and the Rand Corporation that show Maine could reap big savings if the state expands Medicaid eligibility.\n\n\u201cThe reality is the clock is ticking,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith each day that passes, Maine loses out on more than an additional $700,000 per day. We simply can not afford to turn down these dollars or the thousands of jobs they will create and the lives they will save.\u201d\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 A town official and a school board member on Tuesday spoke out against Medicaid expansion, which they say will make it harder for the state to pay for municipal revenue sharing and education.
