On Saturday, open enrollment for Obamacare plans opens up for the second year, and the brand-new Healthcare.gov Web site stands ready to serve America. Probably; no mention of Healthcare.gov can not be followed by some version of "assuming it works."

But it's not just bad code that could make Healthcare.gov unsuccessful, it's also a failure to target web visitors by demographic. This is the web, guys! You can serve up whatever page you want to whoever visits, splinter your audiences, social your viral -- all that stuff. I mean, here's the current Healthcare.gov website:

As far as government websites go, it's nice. Good colors, a diverse group of people, clear buttons, and so on. But is this really going to get people who are hostile to Obama or the Affordable Care Act to sign up (which might actually be a problem)? Not likely -- or, at least, not without a lot of resentment.

So we propose a variety of different "looks" for the site to appeal to the most people possible.

Like: conservatives. (Click images to see larger versions.)

Or liberals.

Tech-addled urbanites.

Incoherent millennials.

All of which could make a big difference. Or, if you really want this thing to take off, what could be better than leveraging one of the year's hottest memes?

Good luck with your enrollment, guys. But if it doesn't work out, don't tell us we didn't try to help.
