While most of the world’s attention is focused on the push to reduce fossil fuels’ contribution to climate change, Newsweek reports, an international team of scientists has focused its efforts on a different source of greenhouse gases: cows. More specifically, the methane-laden burps and farts that, combined with the “emissions” of other ruminants, contribute an estimated 4 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Here’s the pitch:

Ruminants all have lots of microscopic organisms living in their digestive tract that help them digest cellulose—a component of the cell wall of green plants. It’s a huge boon for these animals, giving them the ability to get energy from pretty much any plant that grows on Earth. Cows can’t digest grass without these microorganisms. The catch is that when the organisms digest the cellulose, they create carbon dioxide and methane gas, which the host animal has to get rid of. All ruminants excrete methane, but cows are by far the most prolific emitters.

…Enter DSM, a former state coal mining company that has undergone an unlikely evolution into a global material and life-sciences conglomerate with operations on five continents and annual revenues of 9.1 billion euros ($12.43 billion). The company directly employs a number of scientists who work alongside DSM-funded academic researchers such as [Karen]mBeauchemin to solve the cow dilemma. And they think they’ve done it.

The team now has a powder that cows can eat with their daily feed. “It interferes with the animal’s biological mechanisms,” Beauchemin says. “That stops the microorganisms in the animal’s stomach from doing what they’re doing.”

“In trials we’ve managed to reduce methane emissions by up to 60 percent,” says Petra Simic, a biochemist who directs DSM’s cow-methane efforts. “We have solid proof of concept that our compound does what it’s supposed to do. What we’re working on now is figuring out the best way of mixing it into the cow’s feed.”
