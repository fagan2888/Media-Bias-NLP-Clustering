A 19-year-old Longmont man was hospitalized after thieves broke into his home early Sunday and beat him with a fire poker.

The home invasion assault and robbery happened at about 5 a.m. in the 1200 block of Atwood Street, said Longmont Police spokesman Jeff Satur.

Two men wearing ski masks and dressed entirely in black entered the home and “beat him and stole some money and marijuana. I don’t know if he was in the business, but he had marijuana growing at his home,” Satur said.

The suspects also stole a 2001 red Jeep Cherokee, Colorado license, 917 YYH, and a 1997 Ford Econoline van. Police found the van in the 1700 block of Antero Drive Sunday afternoon, Satur said.

The victim went to the emergency room at Longmont United Hospital where he was treated for serious bodily injuries. He had facial fractures and lacerations to his head.

“We don’t think this was random,” Satur said.
