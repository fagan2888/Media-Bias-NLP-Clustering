A company profile of Allen said he was a competitive aerobatics pilot.\n\nA person who answered the company\u2019s phone Sunday declined to comment.\n\nA search for the aircraft began when it was reported overdue.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said the plane was a Piper PA-28.\n\nJim Linville, Routt County Search and Rescue incident commander, says at least two other planes have crashed in the same area in the past 10 years.\n\nThe plane is registered to VSP Aviators LLC in Broomfield, according to an FAA database of tail numbers. The aircraft is advertised on a website for Journeys Aviation, which says it offers flight training and aircraft rentals.\n\nThe Harrison drainage is in the Rabbit Ears Pass area, according to Linville.\n\n\u201cPlanes leaving Steamboat don\u2019t realize they have to gain more altitude before they go up that drainage, and that\u2019s where they end up. That has happened several times,\u201d Linville said.\n\nLinville said a Civil Air Patrol plane had picked up a signal from the downed aircraft.\n\nStaff writer Jesse Paul contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Two dead in Steamboat Springs airplane crash identified", "title": "Two dead in Steamboat Springs airplane crash identified", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/10/two-dead-in-steamboat-springs-airplane-crash-identified/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-10T17:33:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-10T17:33:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Broomfield flight instructor and his student died Saturday when the small plane they were flying crashed near Steamboat Springs.\nJim Linville, Routt County Search and Rescue incident commander, says at least two other planes have crashed in the same area in the past 10 years.\nRoutt County Coroner Rob Ryg identified the two as William Earl Allen, 62, and a flying student, Terry Lynn Stewart, 60, of Houston.\nRescue workers found the wreckage at about 2:30 a.m. Sunday, according to a Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office release.\nThe aircraft is advertised on a website for Journeys Aviation, which says it offers flight training and aircraft rentals."}
