He has a lovely wife and some adorable children, is fond of friendly sweaters and is famously into \u201cchillaxing.\u201d\n\nThat image stands in sharp contrast to the sheer insanity of one of the allegations leveled at Cameron in a new biography, \u201cCall Me Dave.\u201d\n\nThe book, which is being serialized in the Daily Mail, comes from Lord Michael Ashcroft, a very rich former Tory bigwig who had a massive falling-out with Cameron. (The Mail helpfully put the word \u201cREVENGE!\u201d in giant type on its front page.) \u201cCall Me Dave\u201d makes no secret of its trashiness. Ashcroft and his collaborator Isabel Oakeshott were out for dirt, and what dirt they uncovered. There are rather uninteresting stories about \u201cdope smoking\u201d and the like, but they pale in comparison to what has now been dubbed the world over as \u201cPiggate.\u201d It seems that Cameron got up to some decidedly un-kosher behavior when he was trying to join a fancy Oxford University dining club.\n\nLet\u2019s let Ashcroft tell it:\n\nA distinguished Oxford contemporary claims Cameron once took part in an outrageous initiation ceremony at a Piers Gaveston event, involving a dead pig. His extraordinary suggestion is that the future PM inserted a private part of his anatomy into the animal\u2019s mouth\u2026.the pig\u2019s head, he claimed, had been resting on the lap of a Piers Gaveston society member while Cameron performed the act.\n\nThe source also said there were pictures.\n\nThe best part of the whole thing may be the winking decorum that Ashcroft applies to such a squalid suggestion. We are left, somewhat ridiculously, to guess what \u201cprivate part of his anatomy\u201d Cameron may have stuck in this porcine corpse.
