Channeling the late Ted Kennedy\u2019s concession speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, Salmond asserted that \u201cfor Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.\u201d In case you missed it, \u201cthe dream\u201d is splitting from the United Kingdom, which Scottish voters decisively balked at in a referendum last week.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the issue is settled, not for the wily Salmond who, in the wake of defeat, coyly suggested that a referendum vote was \u201conly one of a number of routes\u201d by which to achieve a break \u2013 and was promptly accused of seeking to foment a \"coup\" by opponents \u2013 and certainly not for the thousands of new members who have reportedly flocked to his Scottish National Party in recent days, nor for the energetic Twitter campaign mobilized around variations of the #wearethe45 hashtag, a reference to the percentage of Scottish voters who wanted to sever the 307-year-old political union.\n\nBut in the aftermath of Salmond\u2019s resignation, the revolutionary likely to lead the charge to keep the \u201cdream\u201d alive will almost certainly wear heels. Today, Salmond\u2019s long-time deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, formally announced her bid to succeed him as party leader and first minister. (Though in doing so, she made it clear that such dreams will only be ushered in via the \u201cpolling booth.\u201d) With the backing of much of the Scottish cabinet already, she is expected to be easily elected at the party\u2019s conference in November, when Salmond will officially step aside.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nThe 44-year-old Sturgeon\u2019s likely elevation puts Scotland\u2019s female politicians in the global spotlight, marking yet another milestone for female politicos across the pond. Not only would Sturgeon be the first woman to hold the top spot in the Scottish Parliament, but she\u2019d also be the first woman to helm any of the U.K.\u2019s devolved parliaments or legislative assemblies, which, in addition to Scotland, also exist in Wales and Northern Ireland. Barring no further shakeups in Scotland\u2019s party leadership hierarchy between now and November, women \u2013 including Scottish Labour Party Leader Johann Lamont, who has dismissed rumors she might resign, and Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Leader Ruth Davidson \u2013 will lead the three largest parties in the Scottish Parliament. That\u2019s doubly important because the parliament\u2019s powers are poised to expand exponentially thanks to last-minute, pre-referendum promises of greater devolution by Westminster leaders.\n\nCrack, crack, goes the glass ceiling in Scotland.\n\nBut just because Sturgeon has pledged to work for the \u201ccommon cause,\u201d don\u2019t count on these women to agree. Sturgeon, whose opposition to the policies of pioneering first female British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher inspired her initial political activism, has in the past sharply clashed with Labour rival Lamont in what was described by one U.K. newspaper as a \u201cbad-tempered TV spat.\u201d\n\nIt should also be noted that the rising fortunes of Sturgeon stand in contrast to how many women actually felt about her party\u2019s independence drive \u2013 one poll showed the \u201cno\u201d camp with a 16-point advantage among female voters in the days just prior to the referendum. (This, despite the pro-union \u201cBetter Together\u201d campaign taking flak for an ad featuring a frazzled housewife that was \u201croundly criticized for being sexist and condescending,\u201d according to an article in Foreign Policy.)\n\n[READ: For Scotland, a Winning Loss]\n\nShe\u2019s also viewed as more progressive than Salmond. And while, in the past, she\u2019s defended his ties with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, she\u2019s struck a less effusive note in her assessment of the News Corp executive chairman, parrying questions over Salmond\u2019s willingness to lobby on Murdoch\u2019s behalf by saying, \u201cFirst Ministers have a job to do and that is to promote the economic interest of Scotland. You can\u2019t pick and choose about that on the basis of who you like and who you don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nThere's a distinctively American inflection to Sturgeon\u2019s coiffed and polished demeanor \u2013 a relatively recent transformation, according to British news accounts, which have pointed out her erstwhile reputation as a \u201cnippy sweetie\u201d (or, in non-Glaswegian terms, a bit of an uptight scold).\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the European Debt Crisis]\n\nSturgeon appears to have left those days in the dust. In her power red dress and blonde bob, she stands out against the usual sea of rumpled U.K. pols. She has an admitted and oft-stated \u201cweakness\u201d for heels and a talent for playfully provocative tweets. This week, she drove her followers wild after tweeting a pair of cartoonish women\u2019s footwear featuring Bambi-shaped heels under the caption: \u201cGuess which member of @scotgov Cabinet is wearing these shoes?\u201d For the record, it turned out to be colleague Angela Constance, Scotland\u2019s secretary for training, youth and women\u2019s employment.\n\nSo will Sturgeon \u2013 who has a telling interest in both the American Civil War and the popular TV drama \"Borgen,\" about the first female prime minister of Denmark \u2013 prove to be the independence movement\u2019s stealth weapon, helping usher in her own brand of Scottish secession via patience, political cunning and shrewd negotiation? Indeed, while she\u2019s expected to adopt a more cooperative approach with Westminster, she\u2019ll also likely push for additional powers for the Scottish Parliament, including control over tax and welfare policy, and hold leaders in London accountable for their \"home rule\" promises. Of course, she could also find herself presiding over a party whose raison d\u2019etre \u2013 independence \u2013 having been squarely defeated at the polls, soon loses its euphoric luster when it comes to the more pedestrian workings of ordinary democracy.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Nicola Sturgeon May Be Scotland's Secret Weapon After Salmond Steps Down", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her bid to succeed First Minister Alex Salmond, may be Scotland's secret weapon.", "title": "Scotland's Revolutionary in Heels", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/09/24/nicola-sturgeon-may-be-scotlands-secret-weapon-after-salmond-steps-down", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/bd/23/fe5d113f42b68322960c7c940296/140924-nicolasturgeon-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Nicola Sturgeon May Be Scotland's Secret Weapon After Salmond Steps Down", "description": "Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her bid to succeed First Minister Alex Salmond, may be Scotland's secret weapon.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Bree Hocking,Scotland,Great Britain,Cameron, David,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her bid to succeed First Minister Alex Salmond, may be Scotland's secret weapon."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec00\"", "article_summary": "In announcing his intent to resign as Scotland\u2019s first minister, Alex Salmond struck a less-than-defeated note.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]The 44-year-old Sturgeon\u2019s likely elevation puts Scotland\u2019s female politicians in the global spotlight, marking yet another milestone for female politicos across the pond.\nToday, Salmond\u2019s long-time deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, formally announced her bid to succeed him as party leader and first minister.\nBut just because Sturgeon has pledged to work for the \u201ccommon cause,\u201d don\u2019t count on these women to agree.\n[READ: For Scotland, a Winning Loss]She\u2019s also viewed as more progressive than Salmond."}
