Bush, Guantanamo, jack bauer, TomDispatch.com, Zero Dark Thirty, Politics News\n\nThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatch\n\nOnce upon a time, if a character on TV or in a movie tortured someone, it was a sure sign that he was a bad guy. Now, the torturers are the all-American heroes. From 24 to Zero Dark Thirty, it\u2019s been the good guys who wielded the pliers and the waterboards. We\u2019re not only living in a post-9/11 world, we\u2019re stuck with Jack Bauer in the 25th hour.\n\nIn 2002, Cofer Black, the former Director of the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center, told a Senate committee, \u201cAll I want to say is that there was \u2018before\u2019 9/11 and \u2018after\u2019 9/11. After 9/11 the gloves come off.\u201d He wanted them to understand that Americans now live in a changed world, where, from the point of view of the national security state, anything goes. It was, as he and various top officials in the Bush administration saw it, a dangerous place in which terrorists might be lurking in any airport security line and who knew where else.\n\nDark-skinned foreigners promoting disturbing religions were driven to destroy us because, as President George W. Bush said more than once, \u201cthey hate our freedoms.\u201d It was \u201cthem or us.\u201d In such a frightening new world, we were assured, our survival depended in part on brave men and women willing to break precedent and torture some of our enemies for information that would save civilization itself. As part of a new American creed, we learned that torture was the price of security.\n\nThese were the ruling fantasies of the era, onscreen and off. But didn\u2019t that sorry phase of our national life end when Bush and his vice president Dick Cheney departed? Wasn\u2019t it over once Barack Obama entered the Oval Office and issued an executive order closing the CIA black sites that the Bush administration had set up across the planet, forbidding what had euphemistically come to be called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques?\u201d As it happens, no. Though it\u2019s seldom commented upon, the infrastructure for, the capacity for, and the personnel to staff a system of institutionalized state torture remain in place, ready to bloom like a desert plant in a rain shower the next time fear shakes the United States.\n\nThere are several important reasons why the resurgence of torture remains a possibility in post-Bush America:\n\n* Torture did not necessarily end when Obama took office.\n\n* We have never had a full accounting of all the torture programs in the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d\n\n* Not one of the senior government officials responsible for activities that amounted to war crimes has been held accountable, nor were any of the actual torturers ever brought to court.\n\nTorture Did Not Necessarily End When Obama Took Office\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order directed the CIA to close its detention centers \u201cas expeditiously as possible\u201d and not to open any new ones. No such orders were given, however, to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), a clandestine force composed of elite fighters from several branches of the U.S. armed forces. JSOC had run its own secret detention centers in Iraq. At Camp Nama, interrogations took place in the ominously named \u201cBlack Room.\u201dAccording to the New York Times, the camp\u2019s chilling motto was \u201cno blood, no foul.\u201d JSOC is presently deployed on several continents, including Africa, where gathering \u201cintelligence\u201d forms an important part of its duties.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order still permits \u201crendition\u201d \u2014 the transfer of a terror suspect to another country for interrogation, which in the Bush years meant to the prisons of regimes notorious for torture. It does, however, impose some constraints on the practice. Such \u201ctransfers\u201d must be approved by a special committee composed of the director of national intelligence, the secretary of defense, the secretary of state, the secretary of homeland security, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is to be chaired by the attorney general. The committee must not \u201ctransfer\u2026 individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.\u201d\n\nThis last constraint, however, has been in place at least since 1994, when the Senate ratified the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment. That did not prevent the rendition of people like Maher Arar, an innocent Canadian citizen sent by the United States to Syria, where he endured 10 months of torture in an underground cell. Nor did it save Binyam Mohammed, whose Moroccan jailers sliced his chest and penis with a scalpel \u2014 once a month for 18 months, according to British human rights lawyer Andy Worthington.\n\nNor has the CIA itself been prepared to end all its torture programs. In his confirmation hearings, Obama\u2019s first CIA director Leon Panetta told members of Congress that \u201cif the approved techniques were \u2018not sufficient\u2019 to get a detainee to divulge details he was suspected of knowing about an imminent attack, he would ask for \u2018additional authority\u2019 to use other methods.\u201d It is, however, unlikely that such \u201cother methods\u201d could be brought to bear on the spur of the moment. To do so, you need an infrastructure and trained personnel. You need to be ready, with skills honed.\n\nTorture, though by another name, still goes on in the American prison complex at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. President Obama came into office promising to close Guant\u00e1namo within a year. It\u2019s a promise he repeats occasionally, but the prison is still open, and some detainees are still being held indefinitely. Those who use the only instrument they have to resist their hellish limbo \u2014 a hunger strike \u2014 are strapped into chairs and force-fed. In case you think such \u201cfeeding\u201d is a humanitarian act, Guant\u00e1namo prisoner Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel described the experience in a New York Times op-ed in April 2013:\n\n\u201cI will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose. I can\u2019t describe how painful it is to be force-fed this way. As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn\u2019t. There was agony in my chest, throat, and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has a long history of involvement with torture \u2014 from its war in the Philippines at the dawn of the twentieth century on. It has also, as in Latin America in the 1960s, trained torturers serving other regimes. But until 9/11 top officials in this country had never publicly approved of torture. Whatever might happen behind closed doors (or in training sessions provided by the School of the Americas, for example), in public, everyone \u2014 government officials, the press, and the public \u2014 agreed that torture was wrong.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six years into Obama's presidency, no one has been forced to answer for Bush's illegal war on terror.
