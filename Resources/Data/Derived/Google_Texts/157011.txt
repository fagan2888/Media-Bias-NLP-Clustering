For this team who've tasted second and third, but never first, this moment is pretty sweet

"We had third place this year in Mobile," said Steve Brown, the angler who reeled in the marlin. "We had third place in Mississippi Gulf Coast. We've never been the one to put up the winning fish. We just had our fingers crossed, holding our breath, all those things. But I guarantee you, after this is over with, if this fish holds up, there's gonna be some kind of party on A Dock, right down there. You're all invited."

Brown and the "Reel Worthless" team should pocket a ballpark payout of somewhere close to $495,000.
