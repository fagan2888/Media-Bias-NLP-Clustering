Union workers across New England went on strike against the telecommunications firm on October 17 after the company imposed higher health insurance premiums, according to a release from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents many of the FairPoint employees.

Some have been following carefully every guidance issued, while others didn\u2019t know what counted as a large business, Mahoney said.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s one of the more challenging things I see and one of the more concerning things as we approach some of these penalties and deadlines,\u201d she said.\n\nMahoney said she doesn\u2019t know if the federal government will offer any additional leniency as some of the mandates are implemented. The U.S. chamber has asked for an approach where the federal government helps those trying to comply instead of penalizing them, she said, but so far there\u2019s been some leniency exceptions only for specific situations.\n\nMahoney said small-business owners should be connecting with advisers such as accountants or insurance brokers to help them understand the law.\n\n\u201cTheir job is to follow this stuff, because it\u2019s ever-changing and very, very complicated,\u201d she said.\n\nPaul Koenig \u2014 621-5663\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @paul_koenig", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Maine State Chamber of Commerce held a forum Tuesday in Augusta for businesses to learn about what to expect from the Affordable Care Act in 2015.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The Maine State Chamber of Commerce held a forum Tuesday in Augusta for businesses to learn about what to expect from the Affordable Care Act in 2015.", "title": "Maine companies unsure of Obamacare effect as some mandates approach - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/347667_457204-20141202-Chamber-F31.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2014-12-02T18:34:19-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/12/02/maine-companies-unsure-of-obamacare-effect-as-some-mandates-approach/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/347667_457204-20141202-Chamber-F31.jpg", "description": "The Maine State Chamber of Commerce held a forum Tuesday in Augusta for businesses to learn about what to expect from the Affordable Care Act in 2015.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Maine companies unsure of Obamacare effect as some mandates approach - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Healthcare", "published_time": "2014-12-02T18:32:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-02T18:34:19-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re creating an atmosphere that makes it much more difficult to make difficult decisions for everyone\u2019s health insurance,\u201d she said.\nStaff photo by Andy Molloy Cassie Babb smiles Tuesday at the health care forum hosted by the Maine Chamber of Commerce in Augusta.\nBabb said her company has been working with its health insurance broker from Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to understand the law and what the company\u2019s options are for dealing with upcoming requirements.\nAdditional Images Krista MacKay of South Gardiner, right, holds a sign while picketing Tuesday outside a health care conference in Augusta sponsored in part by FairPoint Communications.\nAUGUSTA \u2014 The federal government delayed multiple Affordable Care Act mandates for businesses over the last two years, but some business leaders in Maine say they remain uncertain about how the 2010 federal health care overhaul will affect companies here."}
