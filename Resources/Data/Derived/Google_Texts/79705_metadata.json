Now, energy utilities and governments are reaching into your own home, through fast-tracked \u201csmart\u201d meters and spy-ready technology. But what if you have a choice? At stake is in-home surveillance, increased bills, emerging health risks and more hacking vulnerabilities.\n\nSeveral weeks ago the occasion arose to view the screening of Josh del Sol\u2019s powerful and gripping award-winning documentary, \u201cTake Back Your Power.\u201d View here the official trailer of \u201cTake Back Your Power ,\u201d winner of the 2013 Aware Guide Transformational Film of the Year and the IndieFest Annual Humanitarian Award.\n\nDefining the issue: A \u201cSmart Grid\u201d is an electricity distribution network that utilizes \u201cSmart Meters\u201d. A \u201cSmart Meter\u201d is a wireless or hard-wired two-way communication device that connects your home or business and broadcasts your personal information and energy use habits to the electric grid company. Current analog meters have been safely used for decades and they still work.\n\n\u201cSmart,\u201d a buzz word for something good or superior, as in \u201csmart\u201d meters, are being installed all around the world to implement the smart grid for UN Agenda 21, even though electromagnetic radiation is a killer. Check out this video explaining the dangers of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nIn 2009 millions of households across America were taking a first step into the world of the \u201csmart grid,\u201d as their power companies installed meters that can tell them how much electricity they are using hour by hour \u2014 and sometimes, appliance by appliance.\n\nBut not everyone was happy about it. In California many customers were in open revolt back, as they remain today, when Pacific Gas & Electric, which distributes power to Northern and Central California, installed four million meters in households and businesses. Since 2009 six million more have been installed.\n\nPower companies claim the meters will allow utilities to vary the price charged to their customers by the hour to correspond to what those utilities are paying for energy in the wholesale market, resulting in consumers saving money. Not so according to California Pacific Gas & Electric customers who complained their meters were running too fast and were charging them for energy they hadn\u2019t used. Many customers also found it unfair they had to begin paying immediately for the new meters through higher rates. Meters cost the utility roughly $220 apiece, including installation, savings that could be years away for customers.\n\nComEd Accelerating Smart Meter Deployment in Illinois\n\nComEd, although lagging behind other states, is accelerating the deployment of Smart Meters here in Illinois even while the largest Massachusetts electric utility has declared Smart Meters as \u201cirrational.\u201d ComEd is presently beginning the process of installing digital electric meters throughout its northern Illinois service territory. Thorner has been informed that a ComEd representative will be meeting with the Village Manager in Lake Bluff during the coming week.\n\nThe Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2011, enacted over Gov. Pat Quinn\u2019s veto, handed ComEd annual rate hikes over a decade in return for a $2.6 billion initiative to modernize its local grid and install a smart meter system. Accordingly, Com Ed will be installing smart meters for all customers over a 10-year period, even though provisions within the federal 2005 Energy Policy Act state that: \u201cEach electric utility\u2026shall provide each customer requesting a time-based rate with a time-based meter\u2026\u201d The implication being is that Smart Meters are not required for all!\n\nIn accordance with the 2011 state law, per a February, 2014 decision made by the Illinois Commerce Commission, ComEd customers might shortly expect the following (In actuality, ComEd ratepayers have been paying for smart meters since January, 2013.):\n\nCustomers who refuse to have smart meters installed will be charged $21.53 a month.\n\nIf customers make the decision to refuse a (smart) meter now and incur monthly charges associated with this choice, it should be with full knowledge that this refusal is simply deferring the inevitable.\n\nEMF Exposure\n\nCommon sources of electromagnetic or EMF exposure \u2014 called today\u2019s new pollution \u2014 include smart meters, cell and cordless phones, cell towers, wi-fi, indoor wiring, CFL\u2019s, overhead power lines, and more. Smart meters have been designated as the most recent danger. The smart meter ComEd is installing here in Illinois are similar to those already installed in other states. The installation of a so-called \u2018smart grid\u2019 allows a ComEd smart meter to transmit data on your household energy usage wirelessly to ComEd. Eventually this might result in the expansion of installing smart meters on each household appliance within your home, to individually transmit the usage data to the smart meter.\n\nDocumented here is a Powercor Smart Meter being checked in Australia on Sept. 17, 2013, which spikes off the scale of what is safe for humans to be exposed to.\n\nSmart meters: Health and Fire/Explosion Complaints\n\nAlready seen is a direct correlation between increasing health complaints in neighborhoods where smart meters have been installed, not only in this nation, but all over the world. If you care about your health you must watch this insightful interview with Dr. Dietreich Klinghardt, MD from \u201cTake Back Your Power.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) classifies wireless radiation as a 2B carcinogen, based on studies liking wireless radiation to brain tumors. The list of symptoms related by those having smart meter are numerous. Several include: Sleep problems; Stress, agitation, anxiety, irritability; Headaches, sharp pain or pressure in the head; and ringing in the ears, ear pain, high pitched ringing.\n\nOne of the most striking observations in viewing Josh del Sol\u2019s \u201cTake Back your Power\u201d was a live blood analysis where observable effects could be seen after exposure to smart meters, even among those who had no symptoms to speak of.\n\nIf you are still not convinced that the Telecom industry has been given full authority to deploy wireless technologies that damage our DNA, hopefully this account of a mother, Virginia Farver, who lost her son from GBM-Glioblastoma Multiforme Brain Cancer on October 11, 2008 to microwave frequencies received while a graduate student at San Diego State University, will dispel your skepticism. Ms. Farver, in looking into the death of her son, found there were two sites on the SDSU Campus where HPWREN Networks (High Performance Wireless Research and Educational Network) were located.\n\nThese Grids are located on many college campuses across the US and other Countries, forming a World Grid. One of the HPWREN towers was on top of the Communications Building which towers above Nasatir Hall, and the other on top of the KPBS News Station on campus. Both were within 1/4 mile of each other, with locations on the highest points on campus. Professors told Ms. Farver that her son would spend long hours in Nasatir Hall, Room 131. As a TA he would meet students, grade papers, and be in this room on weekends studying. There were five other brain cancer death victims besides Rick Farver, four having resided in Nasatir Hall, either in Room 131 or in an adjoining room that faced the HPWREN cell tower. It would seem irrational to call these brain cancer cluster deaths on the SDSU Campus a coincidental happening.\n\nBesides documented health problems, there are also numerous accounts of smart meter fires and explosions. The following is a compilation of reports from the US, Australia and Canada about fires, explosions or burned out appliances due to Smart Meter installations. The US Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) is a federal agency that will take complaints on utility smart meters from all US states. Among the many accounts: On 2/7/2014 thirty residents were displaced by an electrical fire in Bensalem, Pa. In Lakeland, Florida smart meters overheat, catch fire and melt as related in the following article on Jan. 15, 2004.\n\nMore About Smart Meter\n\nFor the most up-to-date information about Smart Meters and the Smart Grid in Illinois, visit Naperville Smart Meter Awareness.\n\nSmart Grid planning is behind schedule. Why? Because Ameren needs rate hikes. Read more HERE. The Smart Grid was NOT supposed to lead to rate hikes, but when smart meters were installed in the Naperville area, utility bills did increase.\n\nHere is a partial list of Illinois General Assembly politicians who were paid by Com-Ed or Ameren prior to passing SB 1652 & HB 3036 to raise energy rates and revamp the grid. These so-called monetary \u201cbribes\u201d possibly account for the lack of response from Illinois legislators when alerting them to smart meters and the well documented dangers they present to Illinois\u2019 rate payers. ComEd, based in Chicago, is a powerful and politically connected company and knows how to get what it wants.\n\nWays to \u201cTake Back Your Power\u201d\n\nPost signs on your analog meter and on your front door: ATTENTION: DO NOT INSTALL SMART METER\n\nIf at home and an installer arrives, firmly tell him/her that you do not want a smart meter and instruct him/her to leave your property.\n\nAlert your neighborhood if you see an installer in your area.\n\nCall ComEd\u2019s deployment department at 866-368-8326, telling them you do not consent to having your analog meter replaced by a Smart Meter, nor will you pay the refusal fee of $21.53 per month.\n\nFollow up with a certified letter to Mr. Tom Przytulski, Commonwealth Edison, 3 Lincoln Center, Oak Brook Terrace, Illinois 60181, and copy your city manager or mayor.\n\nCall your state and Federal Representatives to protest ComEd\u2019s installation of Smart Meters.\n\nComEd plans to install 4 million smart meters across northern Illinois according to the following deployment schedule.\n\nWe the people have to take a stand together, Say NO to ComEd. Do not sucker for costly \u201cOpt-Out\u201d programs. IT\u2019S EXTORTION! Utility companies have blind-sided their customers with digital meters that are harmful, dangerous, invasive and unlawful. What\u2019s at stake is our basic right to life, health, choice and freedom itself.\n\n[First posted at Illinois Review.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/smart-meters-violate-our-basic-rights/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/smart-meter.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Smart Meters Violate Our Basic Rights"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbbd\"", "article_summary": "More About Smart MeterFor the most up-to-date information about Smart Meters and the Smart Grid in Illinois, visit Naperville Smart Meter Awareness.\nDefining the issue: A \u201cSmart Grid\u201d is an electricity distribution network that utilizes \u201cSmart Meters\u201d.\nSmart meters: Health and Fire/Explosion ComplaintsAlready seen is a direct correlation between increasing health complaints in neighborhoods where smart meters have been installed, not only in this nation, but all over the world.\nEventually this might result in the expansion of installing smart meters on each household appliance within your home, to individually transmit the usage data to the smart meter.\nThe Smart Grid was NOT supposed to lead to rate hikes, but when smart meters were installed in the Naperville area, utility bills did increase."}
