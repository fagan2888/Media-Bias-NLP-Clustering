So many people have different ways of ending up at the White House and doing what they love, but at the White House. You don\u2019t necessarily have to be doing policy work or political science. They have photographers, people who put together video campaigns \u2014 there are so many different things in the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvice for future interns: \u201cIf you even have the remotest interest, apply! What I\u2019ve gotten out of working there and working with all the people there is that there are so many types of people who work at the White House. You don\u2019t have to be a political science major. They\u2019re looking to enter new realms \u2014 go for it!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSean Foley, College senior\n\nFoley worked for Vice President Joseph Biden this summer, who grew up in the same town as him, Scranton, P.A., and went to the same grade school.\n\nWhite House Office: Office of the Vice President, Communications Staff\n\nResponsibilities: Drafting a daily news card to brief the office and the vice president, press, media and social media account monitoring.\n\nTop moments: Seeing Vice President Biden, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama speaking and going to the press briefing with Secretary of the Press Josh Earnest on the day the Affordable Care Act was upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat he learned: \"The main thing you learn is how to handle yourself in a high stakes professional environment. Obviously it\u2019s very serious work that people are doing and you have to rise to that level \u2026 The people are very laid back, which was interesting \u2014 I did not expect that. All very nice, down-to-earth people, which I think is a reflection of the vice president\u2019s personality also.\"\n\nAdvice for future interns: \"Everyone says keep your head down and work, which is true, but it\u2019s also stupid advice. I would say take advantage of every opportunity \u2014 the people around you are some of the most accomplished people, they\u2019re intelligent and have a lot of insight. Get to talk to people about their experiences. Relish being there \u2014 I will really miss walking in the gates everyday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Levy, College junior\n\nLevy brought his Class Board experience to the White House and learned that he wants to enter a career in politics.\n\nWhite House Office: Office of Public Engagement\n\nResponsibilities: Worked on a portfolio of the progressive community and organized the White House Conference on Aging, which takes place once every 10 years.\n\nTop moments: Staffed Obama\u2019s speech about the Iran nuclear deal at American University and saw the President speak at the Conference on Aging.\n\nWhat he learned: \u201cThis was very confirming that that world is somewhere I want to be. One thing I was impressed and surprised about was how little there was of those \"House of Cards\" political, scheme-y people. Our office was really all about the team mentality of the work needs to get done and it\u2019s only going to get done if we all really see that our goal is the mission of the president \u2014 you just put your head down and you work \u2026 it was a very positive environment.\u201d\n\nAdvice for future interns: \u201cTake advantage of your time there \u2014 you\u2019re working at the best place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Meyer, College senior\n\nMeyer, a former DP business staff member, has been a big supporter of President Obama ever since 2008. One of her favorite Penn memories was viewing the elections results when he was re-elected for his second term as president.\n\nWhite House Office: Office of Communications\n\nResponsibilities: Fact-checking for the communications research department and updating White House officials on the latest news.\n\nTop moments: \u201cI was allowed to go into the Rose Garden and see the president deliver his remarks [on marriage equality], which was an incredible moment. Being in the Rose Garden, even without the president, is so cool. And then being there when the president is delivering his speech is amazing, and then when he is delivering a speech on such a historic momentous decision \u2014 it\u2019s unreal.\u201d\n\nWhat she learned: \u201cOne of the things I learned in the internship is that hard work is noticed and pays off, at least that was my experience in my office. I felt like a full member of the team \u2014 I didn\u2019t necessarily feel like an intern who was ignored half the time, I felt like a true member of the communications team and of the research team. I put hard work in, and that was recognized.\u201d\n\nAdvice for future interns: \u201cTake advantage of all the opportunities given to you. They do a great job at the White House of providing structured opportunities to learn more about many different aspects of the White House, so they have speaker series \u2014 even if I\u2019m a communications intern, I can go talk to someone about the foreign policy side of things. There will probably be very few other opportunities in your life when you\u2019re basically handed these opportunities to learn on a silver platter.\u201d\n\nNicolas Garcia, College senior\n\nGarcia said that his internship inspired him to want to run for office back home one day.\n\nWhite House Office: Office of Presidential Personnel\n\nResponsibilities: Interviewed candidates for political appointments for the Obama administration and wrote memos on potential candidates.\n\nTop Moments: Celebrating with White House staffers on the week the Supreme Court voted in favor of marriage equality and upheld the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat he learned: \"My time in the White House taught me that while the president has incredible power, those who work in the agencies and are implementing policy can be just as influential. It is something that I will consider when thinking about who I want to be the next president of the United States \u2014 I'm not only voting for a single person's ideology, but what the team that comes with them also cares about.\"\n\nAdvice for future interns: \"White House staffers are some of the most genuine and thoughtful people I have ever met. I would encourage any future intern to get to know their fellow interns, but to also develop real friendships with staffers, some who have been in your shoes. They have committed themselves to a life of public service and are very open to helping interns in developing their own paths down that route.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The political debates may be in full swing, but the presidential candidates aren\u2019t the only ones who have their eyes on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Take a look at Penn\u2019s summer 2015 White House interns", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/08/penn-students-intern-at-the-white-house", "image": "http://d1q35ni5859stt.cloudfront.net/20160226Xkg5f5RbLb/dist/img/fb-hidden-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "The political debates may be in full swing, but the presidential candidates aren\u2019t the only ones who have their eyes on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Take a look at Penn\u2019s summer 2015 White House interns", "title": "From College Green to the White House lawn: Penn students intern at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6356558804}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "White House Office: Office of CommunicationsResponsibilities: Fact-checking for the communications research department and updating White House officials on the latest news.\nSo many people have different ways of ending up at the White House and doing what they love, but at the White House.\nWhite House Office: Office of Public EngagementResponsibilities: Worked on a portfolio of the progressive community and organized the White House Conference on Aging, which takes place once every 10 years.\nWhite House Office: Office of Presidential PersonnelResponsibilities: Interviewed candidates for political appointments for the Obama administration and wrote memos on potential candidates.\nAdvice for future interns: \"White House staffers are some of the most genuine and thoughtful people I have ever met."}
