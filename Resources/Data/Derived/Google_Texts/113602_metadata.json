In that quake, a 50-foot section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck.\n\nAlbany resident Heather MacClelland was on the bridge that day \u2014 and even all these years later, her story gives me chills. I invited her to take her first ride over the new bridge Tuesday and share her 24-year-old account.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 1989, MacClelland wanted to return a dress at Macy\u2019s. And since the World Series was going on (remember that: Giants vs. A\u2019s?), she figured there wouldn\u2019t be much traffic. She was on the incline section of the bridge, heading toward San Francisco, when she felt some shaking. She didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\n\u201cI thought my car was out of alignment, because I\u2019d just had some tires replaced, and I thought they did something wrong,\u201d she recalls. Some people pulled over, but she still didn\u2019t think much of it. Apparently plenty of other people didn\u2019t either, because \u201ca pack of cars\u201d also kept going. Then \u201cfor some reason we all slowed down as a group, until we came to a stop,\u201d she said, \u201cbut none of us knew why. It was almost more instinct than anything else.\u201d\n\nPeople started getting out of their cars. \u201cWhat was really strange was how quiet it was. There was just this silence that you don\u2019t hear in the city,\u201d MacClelland said.\n\nShe said people were trying to get radio news, but all they heard was static, until MacClelland\u2019s car radio finally tuned in a station.\n\nThe first thing they heard \u201cwas a woman screaming, \u2018The Bay Bridge has collapsed! The Bay Bridge has collapsed!\u2019 and we all started laughing because we were standing on it.\u201d Then the radio announcer said the caller\u2019s report was unconfirmed, but did state there had been an earthquake.\n\n\u201cAnd we all started looking at each other. \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what the shaking was.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen the woman screams at him, \u2018I\u2019m watching it on TV, the Bay Bridge has collapsed!\u2019 \u201d MacClelland said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s eyes got huge\u201d as the reality sank in. \u201cBut the scary part was, we didn\u2019t know which way to go. If (the bridge) had collapsed which direction do we go? So we all started looking at each other, like, what do we do next? And then headlights started coming back to us and we thought, OK, we go the other way.\u201d\n\nMacClelland was on the westbound section of the incline, but before the 50 foot section of upper-deck roadway had collapsed.\n\nMacClelland said no one panicked. They all got turned around, then were heading back toward Oakland. What was also scary, she said, is that no cars were coming toward them.\n\n\u201cThe Cypress (structure) had collapsed,\u201d she recalled, referring to the double-decker freeway section that had collapsed onto itself. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that, and I was expecting when I turned around that I was going to have to dodge cars coming toward me, but there weren\u2019t any cars coming toward us. \u2026 It had this very eerie feeling. I knew something really horrible had happened; I just didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange to be on the freeway backwards,\u201d she continued. \u201cI had to exit backwards off an entrance to get off the freeway. I got off as soon as I could because I didn\u2019t know if people would come towards me or not.\u201d\n\nOnce off the freeway, she went straight to a friend\u2019s house. Just before heading for San Francisco, she had dropped off her friend, and she knew the woman would be worried. MacClelland\u2019s friend burst into tears when MacClelland found her.\n\nMacClelland said she feels safer on the new bridge and she likes the \u201cclean and sleek\u201d look of the new tower. But she likes the old bridge, too. \u201cI\u2019m going to be one of those old people going, \u2018I remember when the bridge used to look like an erector set.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKatrina Schwartz contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Albany woman on Bay Bridge during 1989 Loma Prieta quake remembers that afternoon 24 years ago.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Looking Back at Loma Prieta From Someone Who Was on the Bay Bridge\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2013\\/09\\/03\\/looking-back-at-loma-prieta-from-someone-who-was-on-the-bay-bridge\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-04 08:29:02\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-09-05 12:08:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":109768,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Bay Bridge\"],\"categories\":[\"Transportation\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2013\\/09\\/52015705-e1378251919397.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "Albany woman on Bay Bridge during 1989 Loma Prieta quake remembers that afternoon 24 years ago.", "title": "Looking Back at Loma Prieta From Someone Who Was on the Bay Bridge", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2013/09/03/looking-back-at-loma-prieta-from-someone-who-was-on-the-bay-bridge/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2013/09/52015705-1024x648.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "bay bridge", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1823\"", "article_summary": "Looking Back at Loma Prieta From Someone Who Was on the Bay BridgeIn the midst of all the hoopla about the new Bay Bridge, let\u2019s take a moment to remember why it was built in the first place: the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which revealed just how seismically unstable the former span was.\n\u2018Oh, that\u2019s what the shaking was.\u2019\u201cThen the woman screams at him, \u2018I\u2019m watching it on TV, the Bay Bridge has collapsed!\u2019 \u201d MacClelland said.\nThe first thing they heard \u201cwas a woman screaming, \u2018The Bay Bridge has collapsed!\n\u201cBut the scary part was, we didn\u2019t know which way to go.\nAlbany resident Heather MacClelland was on the bridge that day \u2014 and even all these years later, her story gives me chills."}
