The movie is a belated extension of the old Jurassic Park franchise, which was launched by Steven Spielberg in 1993. Spielberg\u2019s first film, which heralded a new age in computer animation, was an enormous hit. It was followed by two sequels of slightly diminishing box-office returns, the last of them released 14 years ago. In that time, the art of digital effects has advanced into astonishing new realms. Surely, it must have been thought, a high-tech return to the Jurassic well would yield a slam-dunk summer blockbuster, and, not inconsequentially, a merchandising money-gush of t-shirts, backpacks, action figures and other kiddy-world impedimenta.\n\nThis is undoubtedly correct. Jurassic World is as close to a guaranteed smash as any movie might likely come. And it does offer a lot to look at, most of it scaly and snarling. The dinosaurs on view have the illusionary weight and detail of real creatures, and they move through the film\u2019s physical environments at a new level of precision complexity. What\u2019s missing, though, is the Spielberg touch (although he\u2019s onboard here as an executive producer). In Jurassic Park, the director was careful to pause for moments of wonder, showing us, for example, a long-necked brachiosaur gracefully nibbling leaves at the top of a very tall tree. New director Colin Trevorrow, whose one previous feature was the 2012 Sundance hit Safety Not Guaranteed, is more committed to raging spectacle. This would be okay, but all of the digital expertise that has been lavished on this picture is subverted by its script, which is thuddingly analog.\n\nThe movie ignores the previous Jurassic sequels and takes us straight back to the tropical island of Isla Nublar, where the original Park came to such an unpleasant end. This time we\u2019re in the company of two brothers, little Gray (Ty Simpkins), who\u2019s on hand to provide occasional dinosaur exposition, and teenage Zach (Nick Robinson), who\u2019s mainly into girls and would rather be anywhere else. The boys have been dispatched to the island by their parents, who are on the verge of divorce, and I won\u2019t go into that\u2014although the movie does, at unnecessary length\u2014because it\u2019s too boring.\n\nJurassic World is a new commercial enterprise erected on the ruins of the old park. It\u2019s a mash-up of Disneyland, Sea World, and tourist hell, packed with herds of visitors writhing in the tropical heat. The attractions include dinosaur holograms, a mini-dino petting zoo, an aqua show, and a monorail that carries the customers out into the electronically-fenced outback where the coolest dinosaurs, all cooked up in the JW lab, are on free-range display.\n\nThe story is shouldered by a core of skimpily written characters who are barely up to the job. Bryce Dallas Howard has the thankless task of playing Claire, the resort\u2019s operational manager. Claire is a feminist nightmare, running through the jungle in high heels and being told, when danger erupts, to \u201cstay in the car!\u201d She has no boyfriend, naturally, although she did once have a date with Owen (Chris Pratt), now employed as the resident raptor trainer (or something). Pratt, such a quick-witted screen presence in Guardians of the Galaxy, is given virtually no good lines here\u2014he\u2019s a standard-issue hunkosaur, which is too bad, because his interactions with Howard are entirely sparkless.\n\nClaire has been charged by Jurassic World owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan) with devising a new attraction, and working with staff geneticist Dr. Wu (BD Wong, back from the first Jurassic film), she has succeeded. \u201cNo one\u2019s impressed by a dinosaur anymore,\u201d she explains at one point. \u201cConsumers want them bigger, louder, more teeth.\u201d The solution is a freshly brewed Indominus rex\u2014a really, really big dinosaur that towers over the previously formidable Tyrannosaurus rex of the earlier films. You can imagine how dangerous such a creature might be if it ever got loose, but nobody else here can. Well, maybe the sneering security chief, Hoskins (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio), who believes Indominus could be turned to military purposes and made into an excellent weapon. Don\u2019t think too hard about this.\n\nThe blithe lack of concern on the part of Jurassic World executives about the inadvisability of creating a new species of monster lizard is part of the movie\u2019s rote anti-corporate stance, which sits oddly in a film brought to us by a company the size of Universal Pictures. And it\u2019s a ridiculous message to peddle amid all the rampant product placement (Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Verizon Wireless, Mercedes-Benz) that assaults us at just about every turn. On the other hand, while I found this sort of thing annoying, I know if I were 12 years old, I wouldn\u2019t care at all.\n\nIf you\u2019ll permit me a spoiler here: Indominus rex gets loose. Soon Owen and Claire and the two boys are running for their lives, which of course is what the movie is really about. There are some wonderfully wild action scenes. In one of them, young Zach and Gray, perambulating around the dino grounds in a see-through gyro-car, encounter a gigantic beastie and find themselves being kicked about like a soccer ball. There\u2019s also a hair-raising attack by a squadron of screeching Pterodactyls (well, Pteranodons, I guess\u2014in any case, you can almost hear the tourists screeching for their refunds). And in one of the movie\u2019s most excitingly staged scenes, a truck bearing Claire and the two kids careens down a road pursued by roaring dinosaurs they can\u2019t seem to outpace.\n\nThis is pretty great stuff. It\u2019s all that the movie really promises, and it delivers. Will anyone in the target audience care that the story is wholly predictable, and that the characters are limp and depthless? Does it matter that the digital creatures that swarm forth here no longer pack the revolutionary punch of Spielberg\u2019s original creations? Lemme think.
