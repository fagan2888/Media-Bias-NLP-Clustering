(AP) - Wal-Mart is passing the chairmanship of the world\u2019s largest retailer from the eldest son of late founder Sam Walton to a third generation.\n\nThe company said that board Chairman Rob Walton will step down and be succeeded by Vice Chairman Greg Penner, who is his son-in-law.\n\nThe change took effect at the end of the company\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting Friday and came despite pressures from labor-backed worker groups to name an independent chairman. The calls for independent leadership mounted in the wake of allegations of bribery in Mexico and other countries Wal-Mart operates in that came to surface in spring 2012.\n\nWalton, son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, has been chairman since 1992. The company says the 70-year-old will continue to serve as a director. Jim Walton, another son of the late founder, also remains on the board.\n\nPenner, whose background is in technology and finance, will be the company\u2019s third chairman in the company\u2019s 53-year history. Rob Walton took over as chair upon the death of his father in 1992. The announcement comes Wal-Mart is facing challenges on all fronts, from how it runs its operations to how it treats its workers.\n\nPenner, 45, joined Wal-Mart as a management trainee and held a number of positions including senior vice president of finance and strategy for Walmart.com and chief financial officer for the Japan unit. He had been a general partner of Madrone Capital Partners, an investment management firm since 2005. He joined Wal-Mart\u2019s board in 2008. Rob Walton noted on stage at the meeting that Penner is married to his daughter.\n\nPenner had been the chairman of the company\u2019s technology and e-commerce committee since it was formed in 2011 and has been instrumental in guiding the company on the technology front.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a great mentor. No one can fill your shoes,\u201d said Penner, referring to Walton. Penner joined Walton on stage as well as Doug McMillon, the company\u2019s CEO, and former CEO David Glass who served at the helm from 1988 to 2000.\n\nWalton said that Penner \u201cbrings an ideal blend of finance, technology, and international business expertise - as well as a deep knowledge and love of Wal-Mart - to this role.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was not a surprise after Walton named Penner as vice chairman at last year\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting. The Walton family controls about 50 percent of the company\u2019s shares.\n\nKeeping with Wal-Mart\u2019s practice of showcasing celebrities at the annual event, the meeting was being hosted by actress Reese Witherspoon. Singers Brian McKnight, Rod Stewart and Ricky Martin also performed on stage. Entertainer Carol Burnett was on stage, too, and did her trademark Tarzan call.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in the South. It\u2019s nice to be back in the South,\u201d said Witherspoon. \u201cI can get my y\u2019alls out.\u201d She said she grew up shopping at Wal-Mart.\n\nThe meeting, held at Bud Walton Arena at the University of Arkansas., 30 miles away from the company\u2019s headquarters in Bentonville, was packed with 14,000 workers from all over the world.\n\nDespite all the hoopla, the company is under a microscope. Revenue at U.S. Wal-Mart stores open at least a year have risen for three straight quarters, but that came after seven straight declines. And the recent increases have been small.\n\nLike many retailers catering to lower-income shoppers, Wal-Mart has been hurt by an uneven economy that hasn\u2019t buoyed its customers financially. Meanwhile, shoppers are increasingly researching and buying online, and the company faces intensifying competition from dollar stores and Amazon.com.\n\nTo counter that pressure, Wal-Mart is accelerating the rollout of smaller stores and also investing in technology, like online grocery services. It just launched a subscription service for online shoppers with an annual fee of $50.\n\nBut the company, which is also under pressure from labor-backed groups to treat its workers better, is also investing in its workers. The company announced earlier this year $1 billion in wage increases and improved training that includes raising the minimum hourly pay for its U.S workers to $9 in April. By next February, Wal-Mart will raise that minimum to $10.\n\nThe company is also relaxing the dress code for the 1.2 million workers at its namesake U.S. stores, piping music to its stores and adjusting the temperatures so workers are not too cold or hot.\n\nThe changes have not quieted labor groups, which say workers are still struggling. They are pushing for wages of $15 per hour. Among the proposals by shareholders was a call for an independent chairman who doesn\u2019t serve as an executive at Wal-Mart. The proposal and four other shareholder proposals were voted down by a majority of votes, according to a preliminary tally because of the Walton family\u2019s control.\n\nWal-Mart is expected to file the final tally of proxy votes next week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nDuring the meeting, McMillon, who succeeded Mike Duke to the top position in February 2014, called on workers to fight complacency to serve customers better.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re threatened much more by the things we control than those outside our influence,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cOur real villains are things like bureaucracy, complacency, a lack of speed or a lack of passion. Let\u2019s fight those villains together.\u201d\n\nVenanzi Luna, a worker in the Pico Rivera, California, Wal-Mart store that was closed in April, also addressed shareholders Friday. Company officials said the store had to close temporarily because of plumbing issues. But Luna and other workers said it was because it was the site of political activism and the move was in retaliation against the workers.\n\n\u201cOur managers say our stores closed for \u2018plumbing problems,\u2019 but the real reason is that my store had been speaking out for change at Wal-Mart,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur board of directors needs an independent chair committed to the highest standards of integrity.\u201d\n\nMarc Goumbri, a spokesman at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said that making Penner chairman further cements the family\u2019s power over the board and company.\n\n\u201cInstead of listening to and respecting Wal-Mart worker shareholders who have been calling on Wal-Mart empire to implement a new policy establishing an independent chairperson, Wal-Mart and the Waltons have once again decided to elevate family members to powerful positions,\u201d he said.\n\nA government investigation is still ongoing regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials.\n\nIts shares fell $1.09, or 1.5 percent, to close at $73.06 on Friday. Its shares have fallen 5.5 percent over the past year.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press Business Writer Candice Choi contributed to this report from New York.\n\n____\n\nThis story has been corrected to say the year allegations of bribery surfaced were 2012, not 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wal-Mart is passing the chairmanship of the world's largest retailer from the eldest son of late founder Sam Walton to a third generation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wal-Mart is passing the chairmanship of the world\u2019s largest retailer from the eldest son of late founder Sam Walton to a third generation.", "title": "Wal-Mart keeps it all in the family, chair passed to Penner", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/5/wal-mart-names-new-board-chairman-keeps-job-in-fam/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/08276c201e198619780f6a706700858f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/08276c201e198619780f6a706700858f.jpg", "description": "Wal-Mart is passing the chairmanship of the world's largest retailer from the eldest son of late founder Sam Walton to a third generation.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wal-Mart keeps it all in the family, chair passed to Penner"}, "Author": "ANNE D'INNOCENZIO and CANDICE CHOI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf004\"", "article_summary": "Revenue at U.S. Wal-Mart stores open at least a year have risen for three straight quarters, but that came after seven straight declines.\nPenner, whose background is in technology and finance, will be the company\u2019s third chairman in the company\u2019s 53-year history.\nThe company said that board Chairman Rob Walton will step down and be succeeded by Vice Chairman Greg Penner, who is his son-in-law.\nWalton, son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, has been chairman since 1992.\nRob Walton noted on stage at the meeting that Penner is married to his daughter."}
