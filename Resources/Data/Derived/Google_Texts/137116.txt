“The primary reason for leaving our guidance unchanged is driven by some economic uncertainties surrounding the exchange plans of the [Affordable Care Act],” Javier J. Rodriguez – Chief Executive Officer, of Davita Kidney Care said during an earnings call.

“… The regulatory environment around exchanges is still being built, Rodriguez said. “While many payers are living up to the spirit of the ACA, others are changing their fine print in their plan designs to avoid paying for expensive chronic diseases either by cost shifting to the patient or by making the plans unattractive for the expense of chronically ill in other ways … This is a complicated issue which will require regulatory environment. As you know, it happens to be a tough year because of the election and many are distracted. Therefore, the dynamics around enforcement are hard for us to predict.”
