But it has been made a little less unruly. To be precise: Spending is regularly falling below projections, creating the prospect of hundreds of billions of savings over decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big deal,\u201d says Tricia Neuman of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-care think tank, \u201cbecause the slowdown has been sustained year after year.\u201d\n\nHere are the startling numbers. In 2014, average spending per Medicare recipient is expected to be $1,048 lower than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in 2010, says Neuman. With today\u2019s trends, the gap widens to $2,369 in 2019. The cumulative savings are impressive. For 2011 to 2020, CBO thinks Medicare spending will total $715 billion less than reckoned in 2010.\n\nThis has prompted some loud applause. \u201cMedicare: Not Such a Budget-Buster Anymore,\u201d headlined a New York Times story. The savings in 2019, it said, would be \u201cgreater than what the government is expected to spend that year on unemployment insurance, welfare and Amtrak \u2014 combined. . . . Widely discussed policy changes, such as raising the estate tax, would generate just a tiny fraction\u201d of Medicare\u2019s savings.\n\nLet\u2019s not get carried away.\n\nTrue, the savings are significant. Still, they don\u2019t alter the nation\u2019s central budget problem: Rising spending on the elderly is dictating government\u2019s priorities. It\u2019s squeezing other programs \u2014 from defense to medical research \u2014 while feeding big deficits and creating pressure for higher taxes.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the numbers.\n\nEven after the savings, average Medicare spending per recipient is estimated at $11,328 in 2014 and $12,545 in 2019. The CBO projects spending on Medicare \u2014 health insurance for the population 65 and older \u2014 at $8.2 trillion from 2015 to 2024. That\u2019s about 17 percent of estimated federal spending of $47.4 trillion over the same period. Social Security adds another $9.9 trillion, 21 percent of total spending. Budget deficits are projected to total $7.2 trillion for these years.\n\nOne reason that the slowdown in Medicare spending per recipient doesn\u2019t have a bigger effect is that there will simply be more elderly people. Between now and 2039, slightly more than half (55 percent) of the rising cost of Social Security and federal health programs reflects an aging population, estimates the CBO.\n\nWhat also counsels caution is this: No one truly grasps why Medicare spending has slowed so abruptly. A detailed CBO study threw cold water on many plausible explanations. What we don\u2019t understand could easily reverse.\n\nOne theory is that Medicare\u2019s slowdown is part of the larger slowdown in health spending, which is widely \u2014 though not universally \u2014 attributed to the Great Recession. People lost insurance or couldn\u2019t pay higher deductibles and copayments. So they went to doctors less often. Health spending weakened. Since 2009, it has increased at a 3.7 percent average annual rate, a big drop from the 1990-2008 average of 7.2 percent, according to government figures.\n\nThe trouble is that it\u2019s hard to see how this argument applies to Medicare. People didn\u2019t lose coverage. Medigap insurance \u2014 which pays for many expenses not covered by Medicare \u2014 didn\u2019t shrink dramatically, the CBO found. So how did the Great Recession depress spending? Not clear.\n\nAnother theory credits the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), because it imposed limits on Medicare\u2019s reimbursement of hospitals and other health-care providers. Maybe. But there\u2019s a big problem of timing. Congress didn\u2019t pass the ACA until 2010, and the Medicare slowdown started earlier. From 2000 to 2005, Medicare\u2019s growth averaged 7.1 percent annually, the CBO reported; from 2007 to 2010, the average was 3.8 percent. This suggests that larger forces than the ACA\u2019s rules were at work.\n\nOne possibility is the incipient influx of baby boomers into Medicare. Paradoxically, they reduce Medicare\u2019s average costs, because younger retirees are healthier and have lower spending than older retirees. But this has long been known; earlier projections took it into account.\n\nAssuming that the quality of health care hasn\u2019t been compromised (another big unknown), the Medicare savings are good news. But they\u2019re no panacea. The sensible response is to cheer \u2014 and then to curb your enthusiasm.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Robert Samuelson, medicare, medicare spending, medicare savings, CBO, congressional budget office, Tricia Neuman, Kaiser Faimly Foundation", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "They don\u2019t alter a central budget problem: Rising spending on the elderly is dictating our priorities.", "title": "Curb your enthusiasm about those Medicare savings", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-curb-your-enthusiasm-about-those-medicare-savings/2014/09/10/61fee81c-3903-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/10/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Doctor_House_Call-0f097-4203.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-curb-your-enthusiasm-about-those-medicare-savings/2014/09/10/61fee81c-3903-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Robert Samuelson, medicare, medicare spending, medicare savings, CBO, congressional budget office, Tricia Neuman, Kaiser Faimly Foundation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "61fee81c-3903-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "They don\u2019t alter a central budget problem: Rising spending on the elderly is dictating our priorities."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce551\"", "article_summary": "Even after the savings, average Medicare spending per recipient is estimated at $11,328 in 2014 and $12,545 in 2019.\nAssuming that the quality of health care hasn\u2019t been compromised (another big unknown), the Medicare savings are good news.\nWidely discussed policy changes, such as raising the estate tax, would generate just a tiny fraction\u201d of Medicare\u2019s savings.\nFor 2011 to 2020, CBO thinks Medicare spending will total $715 billion less than reckoned in 2010.\nWhat also counsels caution is this: No one truly grasps why Medicare spending has slowed so abruptly."}
