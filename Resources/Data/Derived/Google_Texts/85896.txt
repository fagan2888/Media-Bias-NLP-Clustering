Enough with the terrorism references already.

Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) excoriated House Republicans Wednesday evening, including fellow Californian Rep. Tom McClintock, for waging a ‘jihad’ against American citizens for voting to defund Obamacare in the opening rounds of the fight to extend government spending. The outrageous remark was in the context of a House debate over a Republican-backed ‘piecemeal’ measure to fund the National Park Service, among other programs — McClintock had expressed concerns about the effects of a government shutdown on addressing an ongoing wildfire in Yosemite National Park.

“The gentleman from California came and said the towns around Yosemite — was he thinking about that when he voted originally to shut down the government?” Miller asked. “He was prepared to sacrifice the local economy, he was prepared to sacrifice the towns around Yosemite, when he was on the ‘jihad’ against American citizens getting access to health care. He was fully prepared to sacrifice the parks, and the economy, and fire recovery.”

Miller’s combative tone escalated throughout the brief rant.

Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), the sponsor of the legislation, condemned Miller in response.

“Mr. Speaker, I am disgusted that the gentleman from California would actually use the word ‘jihad’ on the floor of the House. We should all reject his comments, and he should be censored, but I won’t call for it.”

Simpson’s bill passed 252-173, with the aid of 23 Democrat yes votes.
