Michael Rairdon of the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nHer alleged accomplices included her brother, Therion Carter, 30, and his wife, Lakaiya Saunders, 29. They are being held in the same jail for investigation of first-degree burglary and second-degree assault, Rairdon said. Saunders also faces a theft allegation.\n\nThe assault victims, including a 40-year-old man and his 34-year-old wife, have not been identified. They were treated for assault injuries, Rairdon said.\n\nThe couple were staying in Carter\u2019s home until Thursday afternoon, when Carter crashed a gray Chevrolet Tahoe that belonged to the female victim into two parked cars on the 8300 block of 3rd Street and was arrested, Rairdon said. The female victim was a passenger in the SUV at the time. One of the cars was occupied by two children.\n\nAfter the crash, the victims left Saunders\u2019 house and went to a home in Wellington to stay.\n\nCarter was released on bond at 10:16 p.m., Rairdon said.\n\nAt 10:41 p.m. someone called 911 reporting the bat attack at the Wellington home on the 4000 block of Garfield Avenue.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fort Collins woman arrested 25 minutes after being bailed out of jail", "title": "Fort Collins woman arrested 25 minutes after being bailed out of jail", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/04/fort-collins-woman-arrested-25-minutes-after-being-bailed-out-of-jail/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704__burglary3p1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704__burglary3p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T15:24:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:04:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0de8\"", "article_summary": "They are being held in the same jail for investigation of first-degree burglary and second-degree assault, Rairdon said.\nThe assault victims, including a 40-year-old man and his 34-year-old wife, have not been identified.\nHer alleged accomplices included her brother, Therion Carter, 30, and his wife, Lakaiya Saunders, 29.\nAfter the crash, the victims left Saunders\u2019 house and went to a home in Wellington to stay.\nAt 10:41 p.m. someone called 911 reporting the bat attack at the Wellington home on the 4000 block of Garfield Avenue."}
