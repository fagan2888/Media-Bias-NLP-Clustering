There\u2019s reason to be skeptical. A lot of other so-called reforms haven\u2019t benefited important segments of the disability community.\u201d\n\nMost experience disability sometime\n\nWhile many of them reject the term, people with disabilities have been called the nation\u2019s largest minority. Some 57 million Americans have a disability, by the U.S. Census\u2019 definition. More to the point, said Kennedy, \u201cDisability affects nearly all of us at some point in our lives, usually towards the end but often earlier.\u201d\n\nMore than 18 million working-age Americans have health conditions that limit or prevent them from working, cutting them off from employer-based health insurance. Before the ACA, high costs, exclusions for pre-existing conditions and other barriers made the individual private insurance market inaccessible, forcing many people onto public health insurance like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn a long-running Catch 22, those programs have in turn kept many from returning to work, said Kennedy.\n\nHe noted that a lack of health insurance threatens the mental, physical and economic well-being of all Americans. But the problem is worse for adults with disabilities, he said. They have more limited resources and higher healthcare needs.\n\nTwo out of three lacking insurance routinely put off getting medical care to save money, worsening their health. Nearly 3 million people with disabilities were uninsured in 2013, the year before the ACA was fully implemented.\n\nBetter access but choices are complex\n\nIn a 2012 perspective article for the New England Journal of Medicine, Kennedy and Elizabeth Blodgett, a WSU research scientist, said the act has several reforms that could help. Extending parents\u2019 health insurance coverage to children up to age 26 could encourage young adults to enter the workforce.\n\nEliminating lifetime caps on insurance payouts could make private insurance more attractive, and removing exclusions for pre-existing conditions could open the private market to many with chronic illness and disability.\n\nBut Kennedy also sees possible problems, like the effect of cost-containment on essential services and support to help people make choices. People with cognitive issues could have difficulty making decisions on plans, costs and coverage. Preliminary findings show insurance rates have dropped in the wake of the act, but it\u2019s unclear if they have dropped for people with disabilities as well, he said.\n\nAssistance and autonomy\n\nKennedy will serve as the principal investigator of the five-year project, which is funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He and Blodgett will work with researchers at the University of Kansas, George Mason University and the Independent Living Research Utilization program at TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital to track changes in health insurance coverage, health care access, use and cost for working-age adults with disabilities.\n\nKennedy has been involved with disability issues since the late 1980s when he answered a newspaper ad for a job at the World Institute on Disability.\n\n\u201cIn the first interview, I was the only person who wasn\u2019t in a wheelchair,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was hired by two of the institute\u2019s co-founders, Judy Heumann and Ed Roberts. The first student with severe disabilities to attend the University of California, Berkeley, Roberts went on to launch the Independent Living movement, which fights to give people with disabilities the life choices they have been denied by employers, government agencies, health care providers and society at large.\n\n\u201cThe disability movement is saying, \u2018You work for us, you doctors, you nurses, you rehabilitation counselors,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201c\u2018You are trying to help us live our lives to the best of our abilities but you\u2019re not in charge of it. You can\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do.\u2019\u201d\n\nContact:\n\nJae Kennedy, WSU Department of Health Policy and Administration, 509-368-6971, jjkennedy@wsu.edu", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPOKANE, Wash. - A WSU researcher will lead a $2.5 million examination of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on people with disabilities.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "WSU News", "description": "SPOKANE, Wash. - A Washington State University researcher will lead a $2.5 million examination of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on what may be the largest group in need of its services: people with disabilities.", "title": "Study to examine Affordable Care Act, those with disabilities | WSU News | Washington State University", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://news.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/609/2014/10/Jae-Kennedy-80.jpg", "url": "https://news.wsu.edu/2015/11/03/study-to-examine-affordable-care-act-those-with-disabilities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SPOKANE, Wash. - A WSU researcher will lead a $2.5 million examination of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on people with disabilities.", "creator": "@WSUNews", "image": "https://news.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/609/2014/10/Jae-Kennedy-80.jpg", "title": "Study to examine Affordable Care Act, those with disabilities | WSU News | Washington State University", "site": "@WSUNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "wdSEjuSaP8OrY5P53F31YPX8Y_nbetjQgzqmFkdTurE", "msvalidate.01": "BE07B72295823A461232C309434DF691", "article": {"section": "All Posts", "tag": "health care", "published_time": "2015-11-03T10:30:05-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Extending parents\u2019 health insurance coverage to children up to age 26 could encourage young adults to enter the workforce.\nHe noted that a lack of health insurance threatens the mental, physical and economic well-being of all Americans.\nYou can\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do.\u2019\u201dContact:Jae Kennedy, WSU Department of Health Policy and Administration, 509-368-6971, jjkennedy@wsu.edu\nBefore the ACA, high costs, exclusions for pre-existing conditions and other barriers made the individual private insurance market inaccessible, forcing many people onto public health insurance like Medicare and Medicaid.\nNearly 3 million people with disabilities were uninsured in 2013, the year before the ACA was fully implemented."}
