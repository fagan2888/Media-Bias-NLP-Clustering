And it is not the first company to drop or hike prices for retiree health care.\n\nKramarczuk\u2019s was once an \u201cimmigrant\u201d business\n\nNick Kramarczuk, grandson of the Ukranian couple who founded the namesake meat market and restaurant on East Hennepin Avenue in 1954, knows something about immigrant businesses.\n\nKramarczuk, 32, who started helping out at the family business when he was 12, visited Edison High School last week to talk to Shirley Poelstra\u2019s class about small businesses during Junior Achievement Entrepreneurship Week. Poelstra has sent a few of her J.A. business teams from Edison to the national competition. Those teams, like the school, are disproportionately working-poor kids of color and immigrants.\n\nWorking menial jobs for his dad, Orest, the current owner, taught him the value of hard, unglamorous work, Nick Kramarczuk told the students.\n\nHe went to college to purse a degree in marine geology and was working for a Florida engineering firm when he decided to rejoin the family business several years ago.\n\nKramarczuk, who greets customers, makes sausage, clears tables, gets involved in business decisions and more, discussed the joys and pitfalls of a family-owned small business, and the history of the iconic Nordeast destination.\n\n\u201cAre you hiring?\u201d asked one of the students.\n\nIn fact, Kramarczuk\u2019s, which employs 45 full-time and 5 part-time employees, probably will add a few workers over the upcoming holidays.\n\n\u201cI was struck by the diversity of the students and that they were so attentive,\u201d said Kramarczuk. \u201cI live right down the street from Edison, but I haven\u2019t been in a high school for 20 years. I really appreciate our Minneapolis diversity.\u201d\n\nAnd those kids are the future customers and employees at their own businesses and Kramarczuk\u2019s.\n\nFewer oil trains through downtown Minneapolis\n\nBNSF Railway is sending fewer Bakken oil trains through west metro suburbs and downtown Minneapolis.\n\nAbout two to eight oil trains pass through there each week, according to a BNSF report to the Minnesota Public Safety Department. Western suburbs and downtown Minneapolis had been seeing 11 to 23 weekly oil trains, each carrying at least 1 million gallons of crude oil.\n\nNow, more oil trains are running on the usual BNSF route through Moorhead, St. Cloud, Anoka and northeast Minneapolis. Oil trains then pass through St. Paul, along the Mississippi River and into Wisconsin, heading east.\n\nBNSF shifted routes during $326 million in upgrades to its Minnesota system. Since July, more oil trains have gone from Moorhead to Willmar to Minneapolis on tracks that also pass Target Field.\n\nBNSF said it always intended to shift traffic back to the Moorhead-St. Cloud-Minneapolis route as construction wound down for winter. Downtown oil traffic still isn\u2019t back to the previous level of zero to three trains per week, however.\n\nDAVID SHAFFER\n\nBroin returns as CEO of ethanol maker Poet Inc.\n\nThe founder of ethanol producer Poet Inc. is back in the job of chief executive.\n\nJeff Broin, whose experiments with ethanol production began on his family\u2019s Wanamingo, Minn., farm in the early 1980s, had led the company during years of rapid growth until 2012, when he became Poet\u2019s executive chairman.\n\nSince then, Broin said he has worked on industry issues, set up a foundation and supported Third World causes, but was drawn back to the CEO job because \u201cmy heart has always been in this company,\u201d according to a company statement. Jeff Lautt, who has been CEO, will manage day-to-day operations as president and chief operating officer.\n\nPoet, based in Sioux Falls, S.D., operates 28 ethanol plants, most of them partly owned by farmers, including four in Minnesota.\n\nDAVID SHAFFER\n\nSales exec Konrath joins St. Kate\u2019s\n\nJill Konrath, a veteran sales strategist, consultant and author, has been appointed the first sales executive in residence at the Center for Sales Innovation at St. Catherine University. The center\u2019s sales degree programs are offered within the business school at St. Kate\u2019s.
