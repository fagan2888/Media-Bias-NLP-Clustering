The interview lacked the humor of last week\u2019s \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d interview with Zach Galifianakis, but it was part of the same concerted strategy: to use pop culture venues to push the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe president began this strategy last summer, months before the problematic launch of the health care enrollment website. In July 2013, he brought celebrities like Jennifer Hudson, Amy Poehler, Michael Cera, and Kal Penn to the White House, asking them to help promote the ACA. In addition to those celebrities, apparently busier stars like Jon Bon Jovi, Alicia Keys, and Oprah Winfrey sent their \u201crepresentatives\u201d to attend the meeting. Sarah Kliff and Ezra Klein, then of The Washington Post, reported that the president viewed the push to implement the ACA as his \u201clast campaign.\u201d\n\nThe phraseology is apt, as the White House is clearly aiming to replicate its 2012 re-election strategy to sell the health care law. During the campaign, the Obama team used a combination of pop culture venues and celebrity backers to make the argument, raise the funds, and get out the voters to secure a second term.\n\nObama appeared in \u201csoft\u201d media venues more than two dozen times in the run-up to the election. He \u201cslow jammed\u201d the news on \u201cLate Night With Jimmy Fallon.\u201d Fallon, for his part, called Obama \u201cthe Barackness Monster.\u201d The president even appeared on an Albuquerque radio show to tell the \u201cMorning Mayhem\u201d crew that he prefers green chili over red, and that he likes working out to Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s \u201cCall Me Maybe.\u201d\n\nThis strategy was not one of avoidance but of engagement. The venues and the messages were carefully thought out. Richard Wolffe\u2019s recent book, \u201cThe Message,\u201d reveals that Obama did not go on these pop culture venues to avoid tough questions, as some in the White House press corps appeared to think, but that the Obama team \u201cpreferred interviews with entertainment shows for their reach among infrequent and uninformed voters.\"\n\nObama found a number of advantages from working with celebrities as well. First, they help him appear glamorous and cool. More practically, they can be prodigious fundraisers. George Clooney was known as \u201cMr. Obama\u2019s biggest bankroller.\u201d \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Eva Longoria co-chaired his 2012 campaign. Obama was not shy about his reliance on celebrities. In a February 2012 Hollywood fundraiser, he told the crowd, \u201cI\u2019m going to need you. You\u2019re going to carry this thing like you did in 2008.\u201d\n\nThe ACA campaign does not need fundraising, but instead Obama is using the celebrities as validators. The Galifianakis interview was clearly aimed at young voters. White House press secretary Jay Carney seemed practically giddy about the number of views the interview received, telling reporters, \u201cI can assure you that the Funny or Die video will be one of the reasons we get young Americans to HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nAs for Obama\u2019s \u201cEllen\u201d appearance, that too was targeted towards a specific audience: moms. Recognizing that young people tend not to watch the show, he tailored his comments specifically to mothers of the \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d healthy young adults who often choose not to buy coverage. Another difference is that he made fewer, and lamer, jokes: \u201cI have to tell you, Ellen, there\u2019s not much dancing in the Situation Room.\u201d\n\nFor all of the pop culture strategy\u2019s advantages, it presents challenges as well. The entertainment community can be a two-edged sword. While Ellen DeGeneres and Zach Galifianakis are eager to help out, the ACA\u2019s poor rollout brought about negative attention from the pop culture world as well. Carrie Underwood did an Obamacare parody song, \u201cObamacare by Morning,\u201d and \u201cSouth Park\u201d also mocked the ACA website. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d even had an impersonator of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius offering dated goodies like free AOL Online hours and Encarta as incentives for signing up.\n\nReprising the pop culture strategy for the ACA resembles the White House team\u2019s first-term use of Obama speechifying to confront issues. Obama\u2019s speaking ability was seen as a tremendous asset in the 2008 campaign. Post-election, the White House seemed to look at presidential speeches as answers to numerous challenges, from health care to the controversy over the mistaken arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates. In the second term, the White House now appears eager to go back to the 2012 campaign playbook of pop culture outreach to sell its signature domestic program. It\u2019s not clear if it will work, but presidential appearances on shows like \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d do prove one thing. As the New York Times\u2019 Michael Shear wrote last week, \"There appears to be no place Mr. Obama is unwilling to go in his search for young people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama recently went on the \u201cEllen\u201d TV show to encourage people to sign up for health insurance at HealthCare.gov.
