Any franchise would need the support of three-quarters of the league\u2019s 32 owners to move to the nation\u2019s second-largest market, which hasn\u2019t had an NFL franchise since 1994.\n\nRenderings for the privately funded venue show a light metallic, wave-shaped structure featuring a roof that encompasses the stadium and a surrounding plaza. The roof has metal borders, but the area over the playing field is made of a transparent material called ETFE, which is as clear as a car windshield and strong enough to support the weight of a vehicle.\n\nWhile the roof of the stadium would be 275 feet above the playing field, the building would be set into the ground, giving it an above-ground profile of 175 feet, lower than most enclosed stadiums. The proposed venue conforms to the height restrictions imposed on buildings within close proximity to Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nThe Times said the roof gives Kroenke the ability to create a billboard visible to more than 35 million travelers who fly in and out of Los Angeles each year.\n\nLoading docks, mechanical yards and other infrastructure would be below ground and accessible via tunnels located near the stadium. Counting the underground and surface parking, 9,000 spaces would be dedicated to the stadium alone, with others in the nearby office and retail buildings.\n\nHKS, Kroenke\u2019s architectural firm and the designer of stadiums for the Dallas Cowboys and Indianapolis Colts, estimates the project would take fewer than three years to build.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Stan Kroenke\u2019s NFL stadium proposal for L.A. would house 2 teams", "title": "Stan Kroenke\u2019s NFL stadium proposal for L.A. would house 2 teams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/22/stan-kroenkes-nfl-stadium-proposal-for-l-a-would-house-2-teams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__kroenkep1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__kroenkep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T13:02:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T01:40:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ca7\"", "article_summary": "The proposed venue conforms to the height restrictions imposed on buildings within close proximity to Los Angeles International Airport.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 An NFL team owner has designed a Los Angeles-area stadium for two clubs \u2014 with two home locker rooms, identical sets of office space and two owners\u2019 suites.\nHis plan competes with one by the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders, who want to share a stadium in Carson.\nRenderings for the privately funded venue show a light metallic, wave-shaped structure featuring a roof that encompasses the stadium and a surrounding plaza.\nLoading docks, mechanical yards and other infrastructure would be below ground and accessible via tunnels located near the stadium."}
