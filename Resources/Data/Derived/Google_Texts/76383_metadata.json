At Sheffield University in the UK, one student has been expelled after he voiced his opposition to gay marriage on his personal Facebook page.\n\nFelix Ngole, 38, was expelled from Sheffield University after faculty staff decided he \u2018may have caused offence to some individuals\u2019. The postgraduate father of four, who was studying to become a social worker, has been told his actions affect his fitness to practise and was ordered to hand back his student ID and library card. Mr Ngole was reported after using his private Facebook account to express support for Kim Davis, a county clerk from Kentucky, who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licences after the introduction of same-sex unions there last September. Mr Ngole argued that homosexual activity is against the teaching of the Bible, quoting a verse from Leviticus describing it as an \u2018abomination\u2019. Yesterday, he said he was appealing the university\u2019s decision because the case had wider consequences for the \u2018freedom of religion and freedom of expression\u2019.\n\n\n\nNgole says he was censored.\n\n\u201cThe university claims my views are discriminatory, but I am the one being discriminated against because of my expression of Christian beliefs,\u201d Ngole said, the Daily Mail reports. \u201cI wonder whether the university would have taken any action if a Muslim student who believes in Sharia law, with its teaching about women and homosexuality, had made moderate comments on his Facebook page. I don\u2019t think so.\u2019\n\nFollowing a disciplinary hearing, the student was told he had brought his profession \u2018into disrepute\u2019 and breached \u2018personal conduct\u2019 guidelines. A separate \u2018fitness to practise\u2019 panel later concluded that he was entitled to his opinion about gay marriage but may have \u2018caused offence to some individuals\u2019. They said his comment would affect his ability to operate in the social work profession even though he was not yet qualified.\n\nIf his appeal is unsuccessful, Ngole said he plans to take legal action against the university.\n\n\u201cMy beliefs about marriage and sexual ethics reflect mainstream, biblical understanding, shared by millions around the world,\u201d Ngole added. \u201cSimply expressing that understanding, in a personal capacity, on my Facebook page, cannot be allowed to become a bar to serving and helping others in a professional capacity as a social worker.\u201d\n\nAndrea Williams of the Christian Legal Center argued that since he\u2019s not in a public position he is allowed to express his opinions. Furthermore, she said, there\u2019s no proof Ngole\u2019s opinions affected his work.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is yet another case of Christians being \u2018neutered\u2019 in the public arena, and of censorship of views,\u201d she said.\n\nWelcome to college in the age of intolerance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Absurdity across the pond. .05/27/2016 8:36:19AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Absurdity across the pond.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - UK Student Kicked Out of College for Defending Traditional Marriage, Kim Davis", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/17/student-kicked-out-of-college-for-support-of-traditional-marriage-n2148832", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/41/62b6fc42-c03f-4c12-bf3d-32057ee574a9.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Absurdity across the pond.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - UK Student Kicked Out of College for Defending Traditional Marriage, Kim Davis", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/17/student-kicked-out-of-college-for-support-of-traditional-marriage-n2148832", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/41/62b6fc42-c03f-4c12-bf3d-32057ee574a9.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "UK Student Kicked Out of College for Defending Traditional Marriage, Kim Davis , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "America isn\u2019t the only Western country where expressing opposition to gay marriage will unleash serious backlash from progressives.\nAt Sheffield University in the UK, one student has been expelled after he voiced his opposition to gay marriage on his personal Facebook page.\nA separate \u2018fitness to practise\u2019 panel later concluded that he was entitled to his opinion about gay marriage but may have \u2018caused offence to some individuals\u2019.\nFelix Ngole, 38, was expelled from Sheffield University after faculty staff decided he \u2018may have caused offence to some individuals\u2019.\n\u201cMy beliefs about marriage and sexual ethics reflect mainstream, biblical understanding, shared by millions around the world,\u201d Ngole added."}
