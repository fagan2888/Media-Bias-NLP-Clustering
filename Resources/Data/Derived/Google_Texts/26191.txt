House Speaker Paul Ryan said it is "wrong to assume that Paris is a one-time event," adding that "people are very worried about the ... immediate future, for lots of reasons."

Just short of one week after ISIL launched attacks in Paris, Ryan told a group of Capitol Hill reporters Thursday that "common sense and prudence dictate that we be on higher alert."

"We cannot assume that Paris was a one-and-done event," Ryan added. "And I think most members are taking their jobs very seriously, and trying to act as responsibly as possible."

The comments came as the House was preparing to vote on stepping up background checks for refugees from Syria and Iraq. That bill was expected to pass with significant Democratic support.

Ryan (R-Wis.), just three weeks into his speakership, said he spoke to President Barack Obama when he was considering moving a bill to the floor. Ryan added that he was "surprised [the White House] took such a strident position" on the legislation by threatening a veto.

The House Republican Conference, Ryan said, is trying to act responsibly, and in a bipartisan fashion.

"I think people want to see that their leaders are taking this situation seriously," Ryan said. "I think that they see there are gaps that need to be dealt with. And we're trying to act responsibly in this."

The Obama administration has also been saying the event shouldn't be treated as if it is a one-time occurrence.
