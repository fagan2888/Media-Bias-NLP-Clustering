The parent companies of the facilities released more information Tuesday concerning ongoing negotiations.\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s has been a mission of the Catholic-based Pallottine Missionary Sisters for nearly a century but the organization recently decided to go a different direction.\n\n\u201cThe Pallottine Sisters have worked for 90 years to make St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center what it is today,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s CEO Michael Sellards said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cHowever, healthcare reform has caused hospitals throughout the nation to look at ways to meet the future challenge of healthcare. In addition, with the changing climate of healthcare and fewer Sisters to oversee our healthcare ministries, the Pallottine Missionary Sisters made the decision to end their sponsorship of St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center.\u201d\n\nSellards said his hospital is excited about a possible partnership with Cabell Huntington and Cabell Huntington\u2019s CEO Brent Marsteller agreed.\n\n\u201cCabell Huntington Hospital continuously seeks strategic partnerships and collaborations with providers and entities to prepare for population health management, increase access and manage the cost of health care,\u201d Marsteller said in a released statement. \u201cWe are extremely excited about the potential of a close working relationship with St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center as we see this as critical to delivering the highest quality care in the most cost effective and efficient manner. In the meantime, we will continue to operate both hospitals independently.\u201d\n\nThe potential agreement is in its initial stages according to both hospitals. Joining the two would make a hospital system with more than 700 beds and nearly 5,000 workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "St. Mary's loses sponsorship with changing healthcare landscape.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "St. Mary\u2019s loses sponsorship with changing healthcare landscape.", "title": "Cabell Huntington-St Mary\u2019s release more on possible acquisition", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/08/05/cabell-huntington-st-marys-release-more-on-possible-acquisition/", "image": {"width": 330, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Cabell_Huntington_Hospital1.jpg", "height": 220}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T18:52:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-05T18:52:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f48\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Pallottine Sisters have worked for 90 years to make St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center what it is today,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s CEO Michael Sellards said in a Tuesday news release.\nBy MetroNews Staff in News | August 05, 2014 at 2:52PMHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 The Affordable Care Act is one of the factors that could lead to the acquisition of St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center in Huntington by Cabell Huntington Hospital.\nSt. Mary\u2019s has been a mission of the Catholic-based Pallottine Missionary Sisters for nearly a century but the organization recently decided to go a different direction.\n\u201cWe are extremely excited about the potential of a close working relationship with St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center as we see this as critical to delivering the highest quality care in the most cost effective and efficient manner.\n\u201cCabell Huntington Hospital continuously seeks strategic partnerships and collaborations with providers and entities to prepare for population health management, increase access and manage the cost of health care,\u201d Marsteller said in a released statement."}
