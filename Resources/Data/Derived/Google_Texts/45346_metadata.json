On Friday, FBI Director James Comey professed himself at least open to believing that the phenomenon\u2014the idea that scrutiny of police since the death of Michael Brown in August 2014 has emboldened criminals and made police reluctant to effectively fight crime\u2014is real. While there are plenty of experts who disagree, what makes Comey\u2019s comments so rattling is that if there is an observable Ferguson effect, it may suggest that many law-enforcement agencies have come to rely on abusive or questionable practices, rather than developing other crime-control strategies that could be successful even under public scrutiny. \u201cThe question that has been asked of me, is whether these kinds of things are changing police behavior all over the country,\u201d Comey said during a speech at the University of Chicago Law School. \u201cAnd the answer is, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know whether this explains it entirely, but I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement over the last year. And that wind is surely changing behavior.\u201d\n\nAs Comey acknowledged, there\u2019s no clear proof of a connection. There have been anecdotal stories that argue that criminals are getting bolder\u2014in Baltimore, for example, where violent crime spiked after Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody in April\u2014but as Ta-Nehisi Coates has pointed out, most arguments for the Ferguson effect come down to coincidence and hand-waving. Here\u2019s what Comey said Friday: I\u2019ve been part of a lot of thoughtful conversations with law enforcement, elected officials, academics, and community members in recent weeks. I\u2019ve heard a lot of theories\u2014reasonable theories. Maybe it\u2019s the return of violent offenders after serving jail terms. Maybe it\u2019s cheap heroin or synthetic drugs. Maybe after we busted up the large gangs, smaller groups are now fighting for turf. Maybe it\u2019s a change in the justice system\u2019s approach to bail or charging or sentencing. Maybe something has changed with respect to the availability of guns. These are all useful suggestions, but to my mind none of them explain both the map and the calendar in disparate cities over the last 10 months. A major obstacle to assessing the recent spike is that social scientists struggle to explain fluctuations in the crime rate even when there is copious data to work with. As Inimai Chettiar explained in a deep dive in February, the huge downward trend in crime in the U.S. in the last two decades remains largely unexplained. There\u2019s a raft of theories, none of which effectively explains the drop by itself, and all of which in aggregate still leave most of the decline unaccounted for. Any explanation for the recent rise is likely to be even more speculative, but giving credence to the Ferguson effect risks cutting the police-reform push off at the knees. Comey has not been blind to the importance of scrutinizing the police. During a speech in February, he called for better collection of data about police use of force, angrily denouncing the lack so far. He again spoke of the need for some scrutiny on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David A.
