He \u201chas always hated personal attacks in politics,\u201d writes Suzy Khimm in the New Republic. Now, faced with plateauing poll numbers, Sanders seems to be increasingly willing to go after her record.\n\n\n\nThe Candidates Agree on Syrian Refugees\n\nWhen moderator John Dickerson questioned the candidates about the number of Syrian refugees they would welcome into the United States, especially in light of the November 13 Paris attacks, Sanders declined picking a \u201cmagic number,\u201d saying that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to give a proper number\u201d of refugees. Sanders did, however, appeal to the \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d of the United States\u2014along with European and Gulf countries\u2014to secure refugee resettlement. \u201cWhen people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back, then of course we reach out.\u201d\n\nBoth O\u2019Malley and Clinton stuck to their previous commitment of accepting 65,000 Syrians into the country, a high bump from Obama\u2019s promise of only 10,000. Clinton cautioned that we should use whatever resources it takes to carefully screen all refugees entering the country. \u201cI do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people that wish us harm to come into this country,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic position is likely to be highlighted by Republicans, who are already pointing to the Paris attacks as evidence that more refugees should not be let in.\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley Calls Donald Trump a Carnival Barker\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley had a punchy line about immigration midway through the debate. \u201cNet immigration from Mexico last year was zero,\u201d he said, when asked whether he would compromise on comprehensive reform for border security. \u201cIf we want wages to go up, we\u2019ve got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of the...off the book shadow economy and into the full light of an American economy.\u201d\n\nHe also took aim at Donald Trump, who he called an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d\n\nClinton quickly chimed in with a line about letting immigrants \u201ccome out of the shadows,\u201d demonstrating that the Democrats largely support comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Nonetheless, O\u2019Malley may succeed in setting himself apart from his rivals. As Steven Cohen wrote in the New Republic this week, \u201cThere are meaningful contrasts to draw between him and the other candidates on immigration.\u201d That, he writes, \u201cmay just be enough to rouse the Democrats from their creeping sense of complacency on the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders on Clinton\u2019s Position on Financial Reform: \u201cNot Good Enough\u201d\n\nIn response to a question about whether she is too close to Wall Street, Clinton said her actions and policies have showed her independence from the banking industry, despite the fact that many of her campaign contributions come from the world of finance. \u201cI\u2019ve laid out a very aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I went further than that. \u2026 My proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that has been put forth.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders took the opportunity to pump his anti-big money platform. Dickerson asked the senator: \u201cYou\u2019ve said that donations to Secretary Clinton are compromising, so what do you think of her answer?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Sanders responded.\n\nBernie Sanders has great comic timing. What do you think of Hilary's answer? \"Not good enough!\" \u2014 Laura Marsh (@lmlauramarsh) November 15, 2015\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not be na\u00efve about it. Why over her political career has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t complicated.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn ending his response, Sanders called for reestablishing the Glass-Steagall Act, which prevented commercial banks from participating in investment banking.\n\nBernie and Hillary Tussle Over Universal Health Care\n\nWhile the Republicans are launching a unified attack on Obamacare, the Democratic candidates have showed some division. The debate moderators asked Sanders about his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with universal health care, which he acknowledged is a lofty goal: \u201cIt will not happen tomorrow but when millions of people stand up. ... It will happen, and I will lead that effort.\u201d\n\nBut Clinton disapproved of Sanders\u2019s position. \u201cWe now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think we should have to be defending it against Democrats.\u201d Clinton also criticized Sanders\u2019s plan for handing the administration of health care over to the states. \u201cI have to tell you, I would not want, if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care,\u201d she said. According to the Des Moines Register, Democrats in Iowa have accused the Republican governor of \u201crushing to turn over Iowa\u2019s $4 billion Medicaid program to private companies.\u201d\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders Calls Dwight Eisenhower a Socialist\n\nAsked how high he would raise the corporate tax rate, Sanders said it would be less than 90 percent, the level it was during the Eisenhower administration. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist as Eisenhower,\u201d he said.\n\nJeet Heer, writing for the New Republic tonight, called Dwight Eisenhower \u201cthe dead POTUS with the biggest shadow in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump justified his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants by citing (although not naming) the example of \u2018Operation Wetback,\u2019 an Eisenhower policy that led to the deportation of nearly a million Mexican immigrants in the 1950s,\u201d Heer wrote.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "On Saturday, candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O\u2019Malley met in Des Moines, Iowa, for the second Democratic presidential debate.
