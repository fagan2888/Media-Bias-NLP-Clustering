HHS has issued monthly enrollment reports on Obamacare exchanges, but it's been harder to capture data on enrollment outside of the public exchanges.\n\nEHealth, a national online insurance broker predating the health care law, operates similar to the Obamacare exchanges, offering customers a selection of health plans from competing insurers. However, shoppers on eHealth's website can\u2019t access federal subsidies to help purchase insurance, though the company says it has helped people enroll in subsidy-eligible plans by telephone.\n\nSince Jan. 1, about 45 percent of those picking new health plans through eHealth were between 18 and 34 years old, the company says. By comparison, the all-important demographic accounted for 27 percent of signups on Obamacare exchanges the past couple of months. EHealth says its rate of youth enrollment has increased from 39 percent of signups between October and December.\n\nEHealth said it couldn\u2019t provide numbers on actual enrollments because it\u2019s a publicly traded company and is still in the middle of an active quarter. It also didn\u2019t an offer an explanation for why it\u2019s enrolling young adults at a higher rate than Obamacare exchanges, but it could show that youth enrollment may be ticking up in public exchanges this month.\n\nThe rate of eHealth customers who identified themselves as previously uninsured has also increased since the first three months of the enrollment, the company says. Since January, 51 percent of the website\u2019s shoppers say they were previously uninsured, up from 34 percent between October and December.\n\nThe online broker also reports a higher rate of people purchasing catastrophic and bronze-level plans, which feature cheaper premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs. While catastrophic plans account for about 1 percent of plan selection on Obamacare exchanges, about 14 percent of eHealth customers have purchased the skimpier plans. About 43 percent selected bronze plans through eHealth, while 18 percent picked bronze plans in the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe greater enrollment in plans with cheaper premiums could reflect customers\u2019 price sensitivity, since eHealth customers largely aren\u2019t getting federal subsidies for purchasing insurance. What\u2019s not known from the eHealth data is how many people purchasing plans on their website were under 400 percent of the federal poverty level and therefore could have qualified for federal insurance subsidies.\n\nUpdate (7:20p.m.): An administration official points out that insurers have to consider exchange and off-exchange enrollment in ACA-compliant plans as part of the same risk pool. So, if more young people are going off the exchanges to sign up in new plans, the administration is just fine with that.\n\n\"When insurance companies consider the 'mix' they are required to look at who enrolled in ACA-compliant plans both inside and outside the Marketplace,\" the administration official said. \"In other words, evaluating the risk pool requires counting everyone in ACA-compliant plans, whether on or off-Marketplace.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The enrollment data provides a snapshot of how some customers are shopping for insurance away from Obamacare exchanges.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The enrollment data provides a snapshot of how some customers are shopping for insurance away from Obamacare exchanges.", "title": "Young adults signing up at higher rates off Obamacare exchanges", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/25/young-adults-signing-up-at-higher-rates-off-obamacare-exchanges/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/wonk1028.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jasonmillman"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/25/young-adults-signing-up-at-higher-rates-off-obamacare-exchanges/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "HHS has issued monthly enrollment reports on Obamacare exchanges, but it's been harder to capture data on enrollment outside of the public exchanges.\nBy comparison, the all-important demographic accounted for 27 percent of signups on Obamacare exchanges the past couple of months.\nIt also didn\u2019t an offer an explanation for why it\u2019s enrolling young adults at a higher rate than Obamacare exchanges, but it could show that youth enrollment may be ticking up in public exchanges this month.\nAbout 43 percent selected bronze plans through eHealth, while 18 percent picked bronze plans in the Obamacare exchanges.\nThe online broker also reports a higher rate of people purchasing catastrophic and bronze-level plans, which feature cheaper premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs."}
