Bush, CIA officials and contractors carried out once unimaginable techniques in order to gain confessions and intelligence from terrorism suspects or enemy combatants in the chaos that followed September 11, 2001.\n\nRelated: CIA Deceived White House, Public Over 'Brutal' interrogations: Report\n\nThere is no question that some of the methods used were brutal. Detainees were subjected to waterboarding, chained and hung by their arms, deprived of sleep, beaten and tortured and even subjected to \u201crectal hydration,\u201d a treatment meant to humiliate and subjugate prisoners.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nThere is renewed focus on the costs of operating GITMO, where some of the most notorious terrorists and suspects are held. It\u2019s especially important since America is at war against ISIS, an offshoot of al-Qaeda.\n\nGeorge W. Bush said during his presidency that the detention and interrogation program was humane and legal, and that the intelligence extracted was critical to breaking up terrorism plots and capturing senior al-Qaeda figures. But the committee\u2019s report, prepared by the Democratic majority staff, says the CIA was not forthcoming to the Bush administration or to the public about many details of the program, which President Obama cancelled after taking office.\n\nThe report released Tuesday also maintained that little of value was gained by the techniques.\n\nSeveral former CIA directors, however, broadly challenged that assertion in a Wall Street Journal piece published Tuesday. George J. Tenet, Porter J. Goss and others said the torture program, despite its flaws, led to the capture of senior al-Qaeda operatives, helped disrupt terrorist plots and prevent further mass attacks against America and its allies, and provided critical information about the al-Qaeda organization.\n\nRelated: The $443M GITMO Fight Could Lead to Another Executive Order\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody, those who were subjected to interrogation and those who were not, was essential to bringing bin Laden to justice,\u201d the former CIA executives also noted. \u201cThe CIA never would have focused on the individual who turned out to be bin Laden\u2019s personal courier without the detention and interrogation program.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cblack site\u201d program spanned four years, between 2002 and 2006, when Bush finally ordered all 119 detainees, including 26 who had been wrongfully held, to be sent to one of the most notorious and costly prisons in the world \u2013 the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nGitmo, established after 9/11, will cost the U.S. government $443 million this year alone. The military prison within Guantanamo Bay Naval Base began holding and interrogating dangerous people captured as part of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d in January 2002. Some interrogations led to prosecutions of those deemed to have committed war crimes.\n\nMore than a dozen years after the Bush administration sent the first prisoners to Guantanamo \u2013 from Eastern Europe, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere \u2013 there are mounting questions as to whether President Obama will be able to fulfill his promise to close the costly facility.\n\nA 2005 Amnesty International report called the facility the \u201cGulag of our time.\u201d A recent United Nations report found serious problems still exist at Gitmo, including abuse and force feedings.\n\nRelated: Six Guantanamo Prisoners Fly to Uruguay for Resettlement\n\nThe Obama administration has succeeded in releasing roughly a dozen prisoners this year. Last weekend, six detainees were flown to Uruguay for resettlement. Seven other prisoners have been transferred since early November, including three to Georgia, two to Slovakia, one to Saudi Arabia and one to Kuwait, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe prison population now stands at 136, including dozens of low-level prisoners. The administration has repeatedly struck out in trying to convince Congress to remove its ban on transferring the remaining 70 higher-level detainees to a prison in the U.S.\n\nGen. John F. Kelly, leader of the United States Southern Command, which oversees the prison facility, has said the Gitmo complex is a long way from being closed without a dramatic turnabout in the thinking of lawmakers.\n\nAs Congress rushes to complete spending bills for the rest of the fiscal year, the administration has begun stressing another argument: The prison is becoming preposterously expensive to operate in perpetuity.\n\nRelated: $904,000 a Year Per Inmate: Guantanamo by the Numbers\n\nCliff Sloan, the State Department\u2019s special envoy on detainee transfers, said the mounting cost is likely to get the attention of budget-conscious lawmakers. \u201cIn addition to the other powerful and compelling reasons for closure, one very important point is the wildly exorbitant drain on federal resources,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cGuantanamo just doesn\u2019t make sense as a fiscal matter.\u201d\n\nThe disparity in the costs of operating GITMO and most other prisons largely has to do with its isolated location adjoining Cuba. The U.S. and Cuba are longstanding adversaries with no formal diplomatic relations; the U.S. has also long imposed economic and trade sanctions on Cuba.\n\nSo the U.S. military cannot use domestic labor, cannot purchase domestic materials and supplies, must generate its own electricity, and must operate two hospitals \u2013 one for detainees, one for U.S. military and staff. Supplies, material and personnel must be flown in, pushing up costs substantially.\n\nThe facility that holds the most notorious detainees \u2013 including Khalid Shaik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks \u2013 was built on unstable terrain and must be replaced for long-term use. Last year, the Southern Command wanted $200 million to rebuild the structure and upgrade housing for the 2,000 members of the prison taskforce, but the Pentagon rejected it.\n\nIf all else fails, Obama may try again to circumvent Congress with an executive order to shutter the facility. The White House was drafting options, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.\n\nRelated: Iran Sanctions: Another Cuban Missile Crisis?\n\nRepublicans said Obama\u2019s threat of moving suspected terrorists to the U.S. could endanger Americans.\n\n\u201cEven as Islamic jihadists are beheading Americans, the White House is so eager to bring these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. that it is examining ways to thwart Congress,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said in a recent statement. \u201cNot only is this scheme dangerous, it is yet another example of what will be this administration\u2019s legacy of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A long-anticipated and highly controversial", "title": "CIA Torture Report Casts New Light on Gitmo Prisoners", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/10/CIA-Torture-Report-Casts-New-Light-Gitmo-Prisoners", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022013_Guantanamo_Prisoner_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/10/CIA-Torture-Report-Casts-New-Light-Gitmo-Prisoners", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05022013_Guantanamo_Prisoner_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A long-anticipated and highly controversial", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8d3\"", "article_summary": "Related: Six Guantanamo Prisoners Fly to Uruguay for ResettlementThe Obama administration has succeeded in releasing roughly a dozen prisoners this year.\nA 2005 Amnesty International report called the facility the \u201cGulag of our time.\u201d A recent United Nations report found serious problems still exist at Gitmo, including abuse and force feedings.\nRelated: CIA Deceived White House, Public Over 'Brutal' interrogations: ReportThere is no question that some of the methods used were brutal.\nWHY THIS MATTERSThere is renewed focus on the costs of operating GITMO, where some of the most notorious terrorists and suspects are held.\nSeveral former CIA directors, however, broadly challenged that assertion in a Wall Street Journal piece published Tuesday."}
