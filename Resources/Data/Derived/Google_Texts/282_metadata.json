But as the Oct 1. launch date of Obamacare\u2019s health insurance marketplaces looms, Funny or Die has upped its efforts, developing close to 20 projects to promote the Affordable Care Act, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n\n\nIn order for Obamacare to maintain its low-cost-premiums promise, 2.7 million young Americans between the ages of 18 and 35 must enroll in the law\u2019s exchanges. But the White House has struggled to reach Millennials, combatting efforts by the GOP to defund the law and groups like Generation Opportunity, which plans to convince young people not to enroll in the marketplaces through a college bus tour and series of short videos. And that\u2019s where \u201cFunny or Die\u201d comes in.\n\n\u201cThe simplest way to put it was, they had spent all this time and energy and money on the biggest movie of their lives and had no marketing budget in which to promote it. I just thought that was the craziest thing I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d Mike Farah, the site\u2019s president of production, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nFunny or Die signed up to help the White House, he said, because he knew \u201cwe\u2019d do the work.\u201d\n\nThe first of Farah and his team\u2019s projects plans to go live Sept. 30, the day before Obamacare\u2019s exchanges open for business. And though Farah did not divulge which celebrities Funny or Die teamed up with to promote the law, he did show the Los Angeles Times one video, which encourages young people to sign up for health insurance by featuring a series of ouch-worthy moments: a little girl\u2019s tumble off a rocking horse, a skateboarder\u2019s not-so-perfectly-executed trick and a boy\u2019s failed attempted at a jump on his bike, which left him with his crashing to the asphalt.\n\n\u201cValerie Jarrett loved this video,\u201d Farah said.\n\nBut Farah and his Hollywood pals have their work cut out for them.\n\nAccording to a new Rasmussen poll, 51 percent of likely voters would rather see the government shut down than keep Obamcare funded at current levels. And a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 44 percent of Americans think the law is a bad idea.\n\nCouple negative polling with efforts from Generation Opportunity and right-leaning groups like Americans for Prosperity \u2014 which hosted telephone forums and town-hall meetings to block the healthcare law \u2014 and support for Obamacare is dwindling.\n\nBut the Obama administration isn\u2019t lessening their efforts to reach out to young people. The Department of Health and Human Services launched a \u201cHealthy Young America\u201d video contest to encourage young people to enroll in exchanges, complete with more than $20,000 in prizes. And celebrities like Katy Perry and Jason DeRulo used their influence on Twitter to promote the Affordable Care Act, directing their more than 45 million combined followers to seek coverage.\n\nStill, the true test will come in just seven short days, when Funny or Die will see just how far their influence reaches.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Funny or Die takes comedy to a new level, but the satirical website will get a crash course in healthcare as it gears up to promote the Affordable Care Act, serving as the White House's mouth piece to convince young Americans to sign up for the law's health insurance marketplaces.", "title": "Funny or Die gears up to help promote Obamacare - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/07/Funny-or-Die-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/09/23/funny-or-die-gears-up-to-help-promote-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "will-ferrell", "published_time": "2013-09-23T12:22:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T12:34:03+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93a0\"", "article_summary": "In order for Obamacare to maintain its low-cost-premiums promise, 2.7 million young Americans between the ages of 18 and 35 must enroll in the law\u2019s exchanges.\nStill, the true test will come in just seven short days, when Funny or Die will see just how far their influence reaches.\nAnd that\u2019s where \u201cFunny or Die\u201d comes in.\nBut as the Oct 1. launch date of Obamacare\u2019s health insurance marketplaces looms, Funny or Die has upped its efforts, developing close to 20 projects to promote the Affordable Care Act, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nAnd a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 44 percent of Americans think the law is a bad idea."}
