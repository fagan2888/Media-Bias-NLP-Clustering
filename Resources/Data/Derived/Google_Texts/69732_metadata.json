William Owens leads CAAP, was the scheduled speaker at this smaller March for Marriage in support of traditional marriage sponsored by the Russellville Tea Party.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOwens, a licensed Church of God in Christ (COGIC) evangelist and missionary, told Breitbart News between 60-70 counter-protesters appeared at the event and at least three LGBT activists ran up onto the stage with her as she was speaking, attempting to disrupt her address by shouting out questions to her, trying to intimidate her.\n\n\u201cI asked the police to remove him,\u201d Owens said, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t and I continued speaking, ignoring the interruptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe group of mostly young people continued harassing our group, and were trying to talk over me and bully me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nOwens said after she got through her speech, she tried to engage the LGBT activists, and told them they were disrespectful. She said she pointed out that her group respected their right to protest as well and that the March for Marriage activists had no intention of interrupting the counter protest.\n\nThe Courier News reports that when the counter-protesters intruded upon the March for Marriage, arguments broke out. When appeals were made to police for assistance, the officers responded, \u201cThey are allowed to yell.\u201d\n\nIn her address, Owens thanked all who came out for the March to \u201cstand for God\u2019s design for marriage: one man, one woman, period!\u201d\n\nObserving to the crowd that blacks and whites were joining together in support of traditional marriage, Owens said, \u201cYes, we have problems with race in America, but let\u2019s not put all white people or all black people in the same category\u2026I see some unity here today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you love God, you don\u2019t see race,\u201d she continued.\n\nOwens said she was at the March \u201cbecause I am tired of some politicians and activist judges making decision for We the People that goes against what We the People already decided when we voted to protect marriage in 31 states around the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd federal judges voided our votes to satisfy the will of a few same-gender couples who want to marry,\u201d she continued, adding that Christians have been \u201csleeping,\u201d and are not wary as their Christian rights are being taken away from them.\n\n\u201cWe the People are being silenced\u2026intimidated\u2026bullied,\u201d Owens asserted, and \u201care in danger of persecution for believing in God\u2019s design for marriage.\u201d\n\nObserving the upcoming Supreme Court decision on the question of marriage in the United States, Owens said Christians must \u201cprotect the sacred institution of marriage which God established \u2013 not government \u2013 thousands of years ago.\u201d\n\nOwens pointed out that the marriage equality movement is backed by large corporations, Hollywood, and many in the media.\n\n\u201cPoliticians on both sides have endorsed same-sex marriage because they want to be politically correct,\u201d she said. \u201cSimply put, they want money and votes.\u201d\n\nOwens noted the clever strategy of the militant LGBT community.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in gay marriage you are a bigot and a hater,\u201d she paraphrased the theme of gay activists, adding:\n\nThe LGBT community even goes so far as to equate their so-called struggle to the civil rights struggle of the 50s and 60s\u2026The civil rights struggle was for blacks to be seen as humans\u2026The civil rights movement didn\u2019t infringe on anyone else\u2019s right. It didn\u2019t seek to take anyone\u2019s rights away\u2026 But same-sex marriage advocates don\u2019t only want the right to marry \u2013 they want to take away our rights in the process\u2026They stand proudly for same-sex marriage, but dare anyone to disagree. If you believe in traditional marriage then they want to fine you, jail you, and taunt you.\n\nOwens said people of faith must rise up to form their own Christian Rights Movement and to defend their cherished values.\n\n\u201cBlacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians, people of faith who believe in God\u2019s design for marriage need to let their collective voices be heard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for We the People to rise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LGBT Activists Rush Onto Stage To Disrupt March for Marriage Rally", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "LGBT Activists Rush Onto Stage To Disrupt March for Marriage Rally", "title": "LGBT Activists Rush Onto Stage To Disrupt March for Marriage Rally - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rainbow-Flag_reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/26/lgbt-activists-rush-onto-stage-to-disrupt-march-for-marriage-rally/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LGBT Activists Rush Onto Stage To Disrupt March for Marriage Rally", "title": "LGBT Activists Rush Onto Stage To Disrupt March for Marriage Rally - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Rainbow-Flag_reuters.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Christian persecution, Coalition of African-American Pastors, Dr. Deborah Owens, LGBT agenda, LGBT Rights, March for Marriage, Religious freedom, religious liberty, same-sex marriage, Traditional Marriage,Big Government, Faith, Marriage,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Traditional Marriage", "published_time": "2015-04-26T07:31:33-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Faith,Marriage"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd5be\"", "article_summary": "William Owens leads CAAP, was the scheduled speaker at this smaller March for Marriage in support of traditional marriage sponsored by the Russellville Tea Party.\n\u201cPoliticians on both sides have endorsed same-sex marriage because they want to be politically correct,\u201d she said.\nIf you believe in traditional marriage then they want to fine you, jail you, and taunt you.\n\u201cI have never seen anything like it.\u201dOwens said after she got through her speech, she tried to engage the LGBT activists, and told them they were disrespectful.\nOwens said people of faith must rise up to form their own Christian Rights Movement and to defend their cherished values."}
