It\u2019s what you do it for,\u201d Zayat said before his champion was paraded around Churchill Downs to the cheers of 30,000 last weekend. \u201cBut again, it\u2019s all about American Pharoah. He is one hell of a horse.\u201d\n\nThe biggest questions surrounding the colt stem from what\u2019s next. The Haskell? Jim Dandy? Pacific Classic? The owner insists his Triple Crown winner will race again, and Baffert will make the decision on when and where.\n\nThree more starts before retirement is the plan, with the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky, on Oct. 31 the goal for his finale. The $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in New Jersey on Aug. 2 is the favorite for his next appearance; Baffert has won the race seven times, there\u2019s lots of bonus money waiting for the owner, trainer and jockey, and Zayat lives in New Jersey.\n\nThe Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga in New York is Aug. 1, and while it could be an option, it\u2019s doubtful the New York Racing Association would consider offering incentives.\n\nDel Mar, meanwhile, is considering a $5 million bonus to keep American Pharoah in California. A horse would have to win the Pacific Classic on Aug. 22, another race at Del Mar \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 likely the Awesome Again \u2014 and then the BC Classic to cash in. Parx Racing is making a pitch for American Pharoah to run in the Pennsylvania Derby on Sept. 19.\n\nThen, it\u2019s down the road to the breeding shed at Coolmore\u2019s Ashford Stud \u2014 but any training setback could send American Pharoah immediately into retirement.\n\nDespite winning three races in five weeks at three different tracks, the champ is still on the move. After the Belmont Stakes on June 6, he returned to Baffert\u2019s barn at Churchill Downs, with police escort from airport to stable. He posed for photos with fans, went for a jog or two around the track, was feted at a \u201cPharoah Fest\u201d at the track \u2014 and strutted his stuff for a photo shoot by Vogue.\n\nOn Thursday, he was back on a plane \u2014 dubbed Air Horse One \u2014 to Santa Anita. A hero\u2019s welcome followed, with a police escort and huge horse trailer decked out with American Pharoah signage (on the roof, too, so helicopters could spot it) taking him to the barn. He was met by Baffert and family, a slew of media \u2014 and actress Julia Roberts. A Saturday celebration is planned at the track, and then American Pharoah resumes training.\n\nThe horse isn\u2019t the only one being feted. Jockey Victor Espinoza has shown up on \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d \u201dToday\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d and did interviews with Charlie Rose, Geraldo Rivera and Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nHe also took a trip to Nashville, Tennessee, where he appeared on the CMT Music Awards show and posed for a photo with Carrie Underwood, and threw out ceremonial first pitches at Yankee Stadium and at Citi Field.\n\nEspinoza showed up at Churchill Downs on June 13 for a celebration that drew 30,000 cheering fans as American Pharoah was paraded on the track. After returning home to California, he popped up at a Los Angeles Angels game, then jumped back in the saddle on Thursday after a 12-day break and won two races.\n\nOn Monday, he\u2019s visiting patients at the City of Hope hospital in Duarte, California, where he\u2019s donating his earnings from the Belmont Stakes \u2014 about $90,000. He\u2019ll be at Santa Anita on Saturday when American Pharoah is paraded in front of another large crowd. On July 4, he\u2019ll be riding in a VIP car at a parade in Sierra Madre. Agent Brian Beach says the jockey has offers ranging from speaking at a business conference in Mexico City to riding at a track in Turkey.\n\nAs for Baffert, if there\u2019s ever been a happier trainer \u2026 well, there isn\u2019t, is there? Never more gracious in a Hall-of-Fame career that has drawn as much criticism as praise, Baffert wants everyone to share in his good fortune. He\u2019s allowed fans, media and just about everyone else access to his horse.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was going to be this big,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trainer has made his share of appearances \u2014 a victory lap and ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium on June 9 for one \u2014 but his focus is on his stable of stars and deciding American Pharoah\u2019s next move. He also donated $50,000 to each of four racing charities.\n\nZayat, of course, has been all over business TV shows, including \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d \u201dMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cSecret Lives Of The Super Rich.\u201d His Zayat Stables own 143 horses other than American Pharoah, and he has another business that frequently takes him to Europe, where he jetted off to a few days ago.\n\n\u201cThis sport without any stars is not good,\u201d The 52-year-old Egyptian said. \u201cIt is a dying sport and we really needed this and wanted that. This is our horse, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s horse. Everybody needs to see him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first Triple Crown winner in 37 years has been feted all over the country -- as have his owner, trainer and jockey.
