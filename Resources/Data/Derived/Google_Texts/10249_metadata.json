ACOs are often among the most advanced and integrated primary care delivery systems, offering sophisticated population health management services founded on a platform of big data analytics.\n\nLavizzo-Mourey envisions that ACOs will continue down the path of becoming community epicenters for health and wellness that go far beyond providing the basics of preventative care and chronic disease management. \u201c[ACOs] can be accountable not just for improving the health of their patients, but for improving the health of their entire community, by collaborating with local nonprofits and government entities to address such social determinants of health as housing, poverty, and unsafe neighborhoods,\u201d she asserts.\n\nTo do this \u2013 and to meet the principles of the Triple Aim, which include lowering healthcare costs, improving the patient experience, and raising the level of population health \u2013 ACOs must continue to accept responsibility for the whole health of patients, even among groups that traditionally pose numerous challenges, such as Medicaid populations.\n\n\u201cNot only are Medicaid patients reimbursed at a lower rate than privately insured patients, but they are often sicker than the general population, and have complex unmet social and economic needs that directly impact health,\u201d Lavizzo-Mourey acknowledges. \u201cConsequently, safety net ACOs are leading the way in addressing the issues that can impact health once a patient exits from the hospital or clinic, back into the community.\u201d\n\nWhether ACOs partner with their local hospitals to improve care coordination or rely on a patient-centered medical home approach, like the network of Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) showing such promise in Oregon, the tenants of accountable care are starting to move the needle on population health management in a measurable way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all that easy to make such drastic changes in care provision. Safety net ACOs and CCOs deal with many patients who have very complex psychological, medical, and social issues that are costly and complicated to address,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n\u201cStill, these ACOs are innovating, trying new ways to improve the health of the people and communities they serve. This is a big change, and it isn\u2019t going to happen in a year or two. But Dr. Martin Luther King taught us that \u2018Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability.\u2019 If we want to reform health in America, we must commit to the long haul.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Accountable care organizations are expanding the principles of population health management to new communities at a rapid rate, the RWJ Foundation says.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/acos-increasingly-assuming-population-health-management-duties", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/risa-lavizzo-mourey_416x416.jpg", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "title": "ACOs Increasingly Assuming Population Health Management Duties"}, "twitter": {"description": "Accountable care organizations are expanding the principles of population health management to new communities at a rapid rate, the RWJ Foundation says.", "title": "ACOs Increasingly Assuming Population Health Management Duties", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/risa-lavizzo-mourey_416x416.jpg"}, "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAs recently as 2012, accountable care organizations (ACOs) were often described as \u2018mythical unicorn creatures,\u201d Lavizzo-Mourey writes.\nACOs are often among the most advanced and integrated primary care delivery systems, offering sophisticated population health management services founded on a platform of big data analytics.\nAccountable care organizations (ACOs) have exploded in popularity over the past three or four years as value-based reimbursement takes hold in the healthcare industry, and their work has rapidly built momentum towards bringing population health management to hundreds of communities.\n\u201cStill, these ACOs are innovating, trying new ways to improve the health of the people and communities they serve.\nLavizzo-Mourey envisions that ACOs will continue down the path of becoming community epicenters for health and wellness that go far beyond providing the basics of preventative care and chronic disease management."}
