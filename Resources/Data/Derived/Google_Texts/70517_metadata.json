Ted Cruz denounced the Supreme Court in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday, announcing that he would fight to undermine the court after its decisions regarding marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve introduced a constitutional amendment that would protect the authority of state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. We should pass that amendment,\u201d Cruz told Hannity. \u201cI\u2019ve also introduced legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assault on marriage.\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party presidential candidate also revisited his argument that Congress has the power to strip the high court of jurisdiction, after opening the interview by referring to the two rulings as \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say it more eloquently,\u201d replied Hannity, who earlier this week argued that rap music is as worthy of being banned as the Confederate battle flag.\n\nCruz then attempted to distance himself from other party members, saying they were \u201ccrying crocodile tears\u201d because they were secretly gratified by the high court\u2019s rulings.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thrilled, number one, that the court didn\u2019t throw Obamacare back in the laps of Congress,\u201d Cruz argued. \u201cThat they don\u2019t want to actually stand up and do anything to stop it, and they were overjoyed at the marriage decision because they don\u2019t want to defend marriage and they are running away from it. And it is fundamentally dishonest and corrupt.\u201d\n\nUpdate, 9:17 p.m. EST: Cruz also proposed a Constitutional amendment that would subject Justices to retention elections every eight years in an op-ed for the National Review. Each Justice, he said, would be up for election after the second presidential election following their appointment to the high court.\n\n\u201cThose justices deemed unfit for retention by both a majority of the American people as a whole and by majorities of the electorates in at least half of the 50 states will be removed from office and disqualified from future service on the Court,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIf such an amendment is not passed, he said, he would support a states\u2019 convention after Article V of the Constitution to propose them directly, arguing that the document itself is \u201csustained attack from an arrogant judicial elite.\u201d\n\nRead more at: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/420409/ted-cruz-supreme-court-constitutional-amendment.\n\nListen to the interview, as posted by Media Matters on Friday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ted-cruz-gage-skidmore-flickr-2-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "UPDATED: Ted Cruz wants to add same-sex marriage bans, Supreme Court elections to Constitution"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaded\"", "article_summary": "Each Justice, he said, would be up for election after the second presidential election following their appointment to the high court.\nWe should pass that amendment,\u201d Cruz told Hannity.\n\u201cThey\u2019re thrilled, number one, that the court didn\u2019t throw Obamacare back in the laps of Congress,\u201d Cruz argued.\n\u201cI\u2019ve introduced a constitutional amendment that would protect the authority of state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\nTexas Sen.
