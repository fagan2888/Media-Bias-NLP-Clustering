Anya Chavez, 11-year-old sixth-grader at Jarrow Montessori School

Anya was the sixth-grade winner in the StoryMakers state-wide competition for creative writing.

What did you write about for the contest?

I wrote a thousand-word story about a girl living in Sri Lanka who is setting up for a parade. She doesn't have all the jewelry and dresses because she's just helping. She finds out the elephants in the parade are very mistreated and helps one escape.

How did you come up with that topic?

I went to Sri Lanka with my family last summer and got to see a parade on the last night. We could see the elephants had chains.

What do you like about writing?

There's always a lot going on in my head. It's really to put my thoughts down on paper. I write in a personal journal. It's really nice to turn it into something that I can look back on.

What do you like about Jarrow?

I can learn about things visually. It's really helpful. I can see why an answer comes out the way it comes out.

What's your advice for other writers?

Just don't worry about what others are going to think of your writing. Write about whatever you want to. Don't let other people get in your way.

What other activities do you enjoy?

I have danced since I was 5. I do hip hop and jazz and some ballet. I take voice lessons and enjoy playing the guitar. I like to sing and perform a lot. I write music, too.

What's your dream job?

I want to be an author and a singer and maybe be on a dance team.
