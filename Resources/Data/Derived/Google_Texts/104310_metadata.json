Four hundred and fifty three of those children die at the hospital.\u201d\n\nWhat she failed to mention, however, is that those deaths include \u201cchildren\u201d up to the age of 20, and the overwhelming majority of them were crime-related and not accidents in the home.\n\nEmily Miller, The Washington Times\u2019 senior opinion editor and author of \u201cEmily Gets Her Gun,\u201d found a better way to spend her time Friday night instead of watching the \u201c20/20\u201d segment:\n\nI\u2019m NOT watching Diane Sawyer\u2019s anti-gun propaganda #YoungGuns2020.
