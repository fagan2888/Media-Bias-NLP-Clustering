'Last Comic' still standing at Pabst

Given its shaky history, it's surprising that the stand-up competition series "Last Comic Standing" has stuck around for as long as it has.

It started on NBC in 2003, but ratings fell so dramatically in 2004 that the final episode aired on Comedy Central. The show came back in 2006, disappeared in 2008, returned in 2010, disappeared, then returned this year.

Through the years, some future comedy stars got their first screen time, including Amy Schumer, Gabriel Iglesias, Kathleen Madigan and Ralphie May. Perhaps Rod Man,Nikki Car,Lachlan Patterson,Joe Machi or Rocky LaPorte will have similar fates. The five finalists from the show's most recent season are touring together, with a stop Friday at the Pabst Theater.

Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $35.50 at the box office, (414) 286-3663 and pabsttheater.org.
