His first guest was actress Kerry Washington of Scandal, which will premiere this week. Also, later in the show, Fallon played Box of Lies with Kerry. His second guest was The Voice host, Carson Daly and his musical guest was Julian Casablancas and The Voidz.\n\nHere were a few of the jokes from Jimmy Fallon\u2019s monologue: Talking about the security risks at the White House, Fallon said \u201cThe White House said \u2018from now on we\u2019ll be locking the doors.\u2019 Biden said \u2018I\u2019ll just use the doggie door.'\u201d\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin will not be there in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. Not with all of those other countries left unattended,\u201d Fallon continued.\n\nThen, Fallon told monologue jokes specifically for the U.N. General Assembly. He used some difficult-to-pronounce names in the jokes, but also made references to shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\n\u201cIn a new interview, Bill Clinton hinted that his daughter, Chelsea, would be due in October. when asked if it would be a boy or a girl, Hillary Clinton said \u2018I haven\u2019t decided yet; I haven\u2019t decided yet!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week marks the 20th anniversary since the premiere of Friends. It\u2019s also the 20 anniversary of when America used to think apartments in New York were that huge.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaula Dean Announced her new Lifestyles Network,\u201d Fallon said. Steve Higgins, the announcer, imitated Paul\u2019s voice as \u201cshe\u201d announced funny shows on the network, like America\u2019s Got Lard.\n\n\u201cFrom the hit TV series, Scandal, the lovely, talented Kerry Washington is here and we\u2019re going to play the game Box of Lies. Also, host of The Voice, Carson Daly, is here! The musical guest will be Julian Casablancas and The Voidz!\u201d\n\n\u201cTime for Pros & Cons \u2014 here we go,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at the Pros & Cons of having 120-pound-scrotum removed. Pro: Opting to get the surgery was an easy decision. Con: But it took a lot of balls. Pro: No longer being annoyed at people\u2019s stares. Con: But still getting a little testy. Pro: Your wife said the surgery will change your life forever. Con: Your dog says \u2018been there, done that.\u2019 Pro: It\u2019s easier to enjoy playtime with your kids. Con: You no longer have a built-in Hippity-Hop.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur first guest is the Emmy-winning actress who stars in the hit, hit, hit TV series Scandal, ladies and gentlemen, Kerry Washington!\u201d Fallon said, also telling Kerry that \u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to clean up for you,\u201d Kerry replied.\n\nFallon told her congratulations on her baby. They talked about how hard it was to keep it a secret that she was pregnant when she was on the show last.\n\n\u201cCongrats on Scandal! It\u2019s a giant, giant show. What are your fans called?\u201d Fallon asked.\n\n\u201cWhat are our fans called? Gladiators!\u201d Kerry said. She added there is a whole line of clothing based on what she wears as Olivia Pope on Scandal.\n\nShe talked with Jimmy about having loved the movie, Splash. She said \u201cI knew that I was a mermaid \u2014 knew it. I was allergic to fish. I had the theory that it was because I couldn\u2019t eat my brethren. Black people swim \u2014 that\u2019s my PSA for tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time you come, we could get a tank and swim around together,\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer synchronized swimming,\u201d she told him.\n\nThen, Kerry and Jimmy talked about their favorite TV shows. Kerry told him one of her parents\u2019 favorite was Game of Thrones and she started watching it and it became her favorite, too.\n\n\u201cI cooked my mom a Game of Thrones Thanksgiving dinner last year,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cwith giant turkey legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere on Earth is Olivia Pope?\u201d Jimmy Fallon asked her.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you but you will know immediately in the season premiere,\u201d she answered him.\n\n\u201cDo you feel like playing a game with us?\u201d Fallon asked her.\n\n\u201cSure \u2014 if you feel like losing,\u201d Washington replied. So, after a commercial break, they will be playing Box of Lies.\n\nIt is an easy game, really. a person chooses a box and gets out what is in the box and gives the other player hints. If the eventual guess is incorrect, the other player gets a point. If it is a lie, and the person guessing says it is a lie, then the person guessing gets a point. The first object was a pumpkin with spaghetti in it. Kerry said that is what it actually is, and Fallon said he thought it was a lie. So, Kerry got the point.\n\nThen, Kerry said there was \u201can iPhone 6 in my box,\u201d and he described it further, but Kerry said \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d She was correct, what Fallon had said was a lie, so she got a second point and won the Box of Lies game. Fallon said that Carson Daly would be the next guest after another commercial break.\n\nBack from another commercial break, Jimmy Fallon introduced the producer and host of The Voice, saying \u201cLadies and gentlemen, here\u2019s Carson Daly!\u201d He and his wife brought their baby, London Rose, with him. She was in a baby carrier.\n\n\u201cOh, my God \u2014 she\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cThe whole family\u2019s backstage,\u201d Carson told Jimmy.\n\nThey both talked about having kids and babies. \u201cEveryone around you is having babies,\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cYes, Christina Aguilera had a baby. Shakira had a baby and set up an entire zoo with petting animals backstage,\u201d Carson told Jimmy.\n\nFallon congratulated Carson on having been with the Today Show for one year now. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be there, Carson humbly said.\n\n\u201cThe Voice \u2014 it couldn\u2019t be better this year,\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cThis particular group of coaches is just fantastic,\u201d Carson said.\n\n\u201cYou have big mentors this year,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cStevie Nicks, Little Big Town\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we couldn\u2019t be happier with them,\u201d Carson said.\n\nThen, Jimmy Fallon announced that when the Tonight Show returns, the musical guests Julian Casablancas and The Voidz will perform. They performed a song from their Tyranny album, called Where No Eagles Fly. Slate calls the Tyranny album \u201csprawling and unruly.\u201d The band played a sort of punk or New Wave-ish style of music, loud, raucous, but pretty good. They rocked the place with their song and the audience applauded enthusiastically at the end.\n\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon had on some excellent guests tonight. Scandal star, actress Kerry Washington, was Jimmy\u2019s first guest of the evening. She talked about her show, her childhood, and more and they played the game Box of Lies, which Kerry easily won. Then, the second guest was The Voice producer and host, Carson Daly. Jimmy Fallon and Carson talked about their families and a bit about the new season of The Voice. Ending the Tonight Show was the powerful and energetic music of Fallon\u2019s musical guests Julian Casablancas and The Voidz.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nJimmy Fallon and Kerry Washington Play Box of Lies\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nNBC Universal Media Village\n\nSlate\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Jimmy Fallon has some great guests on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon tonight!
