And on this day, there was traffic.\n\nBashaud Breeland remembers it clearly. He remembers getting that first call on the morning of June 15, 2013, and soon making another, to inform Clemson coaches that he wouldn\u2019t be at practice that afternoon. He remembers hitting the road, nine days earlier than expected, speeding toward the hospital and fatherhood and a terrifying but exciting future.\n\nAnd then he remembers slowing to a stop, though that did not bother him.\n\nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Relationships at Redskins Park will make for a very messy divorce\n\n\u201cI was too excited to worry about anything,\u201d he says, smiling and leaning forward as he speaks. \u201cI was waiting for this day for a long time.\u201d\n\nJaelle Nicole Breeland was born that night at around 10. \u201cTwo hours before Father\u2019s Day,\u201d her father adds with a grin.\n\nIn the nearly 18 months since, Jaelle has been Breeland\u2019s motivation and pride, the fuel behind his superb junior season at Clemson and the main reason he decided to leave school early to pursue a career in the NFL.\n\nIn his rookie season with the Washington Redskins, Breeland has been thrust into a starting role and emerged as one of the team\u2019s most promising young players. He\u2019s recorded 46 tackles, two forced fumbles and one interception in 13 games. But away from football, he has been thrust into a far more important and challenging role: that of a 22-year-old father, trying to give his daughter some of the things he never had.\n\nBalancing the roles is not difficult, he says. It doesn\u2019t take much to turn Breeland, the physical Redskins cornerback, into Breeland, the beaming dad, laughing and scrolling through dozens of photos of Jaelle on his phone because he just can\u2019t decide which one he likes best.\n\n\u201cNo matter how my day\u2019s going,\u201d Breeland says, \u201cshe always lifts me up.\u201d\n\nAnother drive\n\nThree days after Jaelle was born, Breeland returned to Clemson, walked into the locker room and saw a pile of Pampers and toys at his locker.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it hit me,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, I\u2019m a father.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, Jaelle stayed at home with her mother, Ashley Baldwin, while Breeland resumed summer workouts with the Tigers. Entering his junior season, he found himself rising to a new level of play on the practice field. The workouts were easier now, his focus heightened.\n\n\u201cIt was like I had another drive,\u201d Breeland said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing it for me no more. I was doing it for her.\u201d\n\nAt 21, Breeland now had to balance school, college football and fatherhood during his junior year. He and Baldwin, a fellow student at Clemson, typically dropped off Jaelle at an on-campus daycare center in the morning and picked her up in the evening, spending nights together at one of their apartments.\n\nBreeland didn\u2019t have much money at the time. Then again, he never really did. He grew up in Allendale, S.C., where more than one in three residents currently live below the poverty line. And when Clemson coach Dabo Swinney came to visit during his recruitment process, Breeland hoped they could meet at the school rather than his house.\n\n\u201cHe came from a humble background. Very humble,\u201d said Wayne Farmer, Breeland\u2019s high school football coach and mentor. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t have a lot.\u201d\n\nThat financial reality weighed on Breeland throughout his junior season at Clemson. He already believed he was one of the best defensive backs in the country, but with no income and a family to support, he had to make an immediate splash to prove himself worthy of an NFL contract.\n\n\u201cNot only did his play affect him, but it also affected his family,\u201d Clemson defensive backs coach Mike Reed said. \u201cAs a coach, you\u2019re always trying to find a way that you can get your kid to play above and beyond the call of duty. And when he knew this directly affects his child, he came to play.\u201d\n\nA family decision\n\nWith Jaelle on his mind, Breeland recorded 74 tackles and broke up a team-best 13 pass attempts in 13 games during his junior season, receiving second-team all-ACC honors in the process. In the Orange Bowl on Jan. 3, he forced a fumble in the fourth quarter to help the Tigers beat No. 6 Ohio State. He made his decision to turn pro after the game.\n\n\u201cI thought about it for the whole year,\u201d Breeland explained. \u201cAnd by the end of the year, whatever my heart told me to do, I was going to do it.\u201d\n\nThe move went against the advice of both Clemson coaches, who believed Breeland would improve his draft stock with another year in college, and Farmer, who wanted to see him complete his degree in community recreation, sport and camp management. It also surprised Baldwin, who added that she would have been supportive of whatever decision he made.\n\nBreeland, however, felt he was ready for the challenges of the NFL. He was ready to support Jaelle. It was a decision only he could make.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have much when I was in school,\u201d Breeland said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of money, and I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to support her off no stipend at Clemson University. So it was either drop out of school, get a job and take care of her, or try my chances playing professional football.\u201d\n\nBreeland entered the draft as a projected second- or third-round pick who, by some estimates, could have been selected in the first round had he stayed in school another year. Instead, he slipped to the Redskins early in the fourth, the 10th cornerback off the board with the 102nd overall pick.\n\nLess than four months after his 22nd birthday, Breeland signed a four-year, $2.71 million contract with Washington, including a $486,000 signing bonus.\n\n\u201cAs a coach, I would love to have him for another year,\u201d said Reed, who also coached Redskins cornerback David Amerson at North Carolina State. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to take care of family first. \u2026 You commend a man who wants to take responsibility and make things happen. And he did.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like she\u2019s a mom\u2019\n\nLove and instability filled Breeland\u2019s life growing up.\n\nBreeland\u2019s parents divorced when he was young. His mother, Tanya Jordan, eventually moved to Columbia, S.C., and now works for Walmart. His father, Darren Breeland, is paralyzed on the left side of his body \u2014 the result of a childhood car accident \u2014 and is receiving disability benefits.\n\nBreeland\u2019s father didn\u2019t have a large presence in his life, those close to him say, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why Breeland has made every effort to spend time with his daughter. He and Baldwin, who have been together on-and-off for nearly five years, live with Jaelle in a two-story townhouse in Northern Virginia.\n\nJaelle never ceases to amaze Breeland, who returns home after a long day of practice or a recent Redskins loss and finds his daughter\u2019s laughter contagious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s a mom,\u201d he said. \u201cShe takes care of me sometimes. That\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d\n\nNot yet 18 months old, Jaelle is already walking and talking. She says \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBye.\u201d \u201cHi.\u201d She sings and dances in the living room. She climbs the stairs to find her mother. She is shy around certain people, but otherwise outgoing. She loves hide-and-seek. She\u2019s playful and smart and smiling, always smiling.\n\n\u201cA bundle of energy,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nSometimes, Jaelle scurries into her room, where rows of children\u2019s books rest on a bookshelf. She hides for several minutes, then runs back out with one of four books in hand, looking for a lap to sit on and Breeland or Baldwin to be the storyteller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like four books that she\u2019ll always pick,\u201d Breeland said. \u201cThose four books, every time.\u201d\n\nHis eyes brightened with every word.\n\n\u201cJae has him wrapped around her finger,\u201d said Baldwin, who recently graduated with a mathematical sciences degree. \u201cShe loves him, he loves her. They\u2019re cute together.\u201d\n\nFatherhood and football\n\nBreeland\u2019s first major headline with the Redskins came when he was cited for marijuana possession at a Richmond gas station near the end of training camp. He filmed a public service announcement for the city last month as restitution, and said he has learned from his mistake.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden called Breeland\u2019s citation a \u201clittle hiccup\u201d in an otherwise strong camp. And in the months since, Breeland has strived to be a better role model for his daughter.\n\nIt\u2019s a maturation process that many young fathers must go through, veteran wide receiver Santana Moss said.\n\n\u201cWhen you get them kids, man \u2026 you kind of just look back and say, \u2018Hey, something\u2019s got to stop.\u2019 You just look at the big picture,\u201d said Moss, now a father of four. \u201cYou want to be able to lay a foundation for them to be able to have a sense of [how] they need to lay theirs, when they have that day and they have somebody that they need to take care of.\u201d\n\nBreeland is one of several young Redskins who have recently become fathers. Running back Silas Redd\u2019s son, Nico, celebrated his first birthday last month. Roy Helu III, son of another running back, is four months old. And offensive tackle Morgan Moses\u2019 son, Isaiah, was born Oct. 21, two days after Washington beat Tennessee.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re no longer playing for yourself,\u201d Moses said. \u201cYou have somebody watching you all the time, no matter what you do \u2014 in the house, outside the house. You become a role model for somebody.\u201d\n\nBreeland\u2019s former coaches say Jaelle has not only transformed the cornerback\u2019s life but also improved his production on the field. Reed said off-field happiness can have a carryover effect for any player, while Farmer senses that something has changed in Breeland, whom he has known for more than 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe way he\u2019s playing, with the confidence he has \u2014 I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s his little girl, his daughter, has settled him down,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that drive and focus in his play, that maturity.\u201d\n\nJaelle watches every Redskins game, either in-person at FedEx Field or at home on TV, though Baldwin says she can never sit still. She doesn\u2019t understand what her father does on the football field, or why, but some day she will.\n\nSome day, she\u2019ll understand that he does it all for her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jaelle Nicole Breeland is her father's motivation and pride, one of the reasons he decided to leave Clemson early and one of the reasons he has matured in his first season with the Redskins, both on and off the field.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jaelle Nicole Breeland is her father\u2019s motivation and pride, one of the reasons he decided to leave Clemson early and one of the reasons he has matured in his first season with the Redskins, both on and off the field.", "title": "Bashaud Breeland leans on his 17-month-old daughter, Jaelle, in rookie season with Redskins", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/9/bashaud-breeland-leans-his-17-month-old-daughter-j/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/09/ap467194759620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/09/ap467194759620.jpg", "description": "Jaelle Nicole Breeland is her father's motivation and pride, one of the reasons he decided to leave Clemson early and one of the reasons he has matured in his first season with the Redskins, both on a", "card": "summary", "title": "Bashaud Breeland leans on his 17-month-old daughter, Jaelle, in rookie"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jaelle Nicole Breeland, Nicole Breeland, Ashley Baldwin, Football"}, "article_summary": "In his rookie season with the Washington Redskins, Breeland has been thrust into a starting role and emerged as one of the team\u2019s most promising young players.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have much when I was in school,\u201d Breeland said.\n\u201cLike, I\u2019m a father.\u201dFor the next month, Jaelle stayed at home with her mother, Ashley Baldwin, while Breeland resumed summer workouts with the Tigers.\n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t have a lot.\u201dThat financial reality weighed on Breeland throughout his junior season at Clemson.\nAnd in the months since, Breeland has strived to be a better role model for his daughter."}
