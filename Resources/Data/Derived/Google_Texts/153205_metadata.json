(AP) - Jim Shaffer has rough hands blackened by nearly seven decades of broom making, but they\u2019re as deft as the day he started.\n\nShaffer, 85, has cobbled together hundreds of thousands of brooms during his 68-year career. While each broom has been made to the same specifications, Shaffer said imperfections are what make his craft an art form.\n\n\u201cNo one broom is the same,\u201d he said.\n\nShaffer is the owner of Charleston Broom Company, which maintains a small workshop near Kanawha State Forest. Having worked for the company since he was 17, Shafer has seen it through good and bad times.\n\nFor decades, the 20-employee shop produced about 3,500 brooms every week in a factory located on the East End where Laidley Field now stands. After moving and years of declining sales, the company was downsized to a one-man operation when Shaffer took over in the 1980s.\n\nShaffer is West Virginia\u2019s only remaining broom manufacturer.\n\nDespite cramped quarters and no other help, Shaffer still manages to make several hundred brooms each week. He also maintains business with local hardware stores and organizations that have been loyal customers for years.\n\nWhile his shop is cold in the winters and a little disorganized, Shaffer is right at home.\n\nEach day, Shaffer makes brooms on the same equipment he has for the past 60 years. Shaffer said the machines should have broken down ages ago, but he has kept them in good working condition.\n\nShaffer starts the broom making process by feeding a pine handle into a tying machine he operates with a foot pedal. The machine threads wire from a spool around the handle\u2019s base as Shaffer adds bundles of straw. While the machine spins the handle and tightens wire around the straw, Shaffer quickly shapes the broom into a recognizable shape.\n\nOnce the straw is secured, Shaffer affixes two more bundles of straw to form shoulders that give the broom more body.\n\nOnce the base has taken shape, Shaffer cleans it and trims stray bristles before he takes it to an industrial sewing machine that pushes red or blue thread through the straw to hold it together.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple process that only takes a few minutes, but Shaffer takes great pride in the work.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t make them like this anymore,\u201d he said, inspecting one of his brooms.\n\nThere are days when Shaffer doesn\u2019t have many orders to fill, but he said he always finds something to do. When the shop is quiet, Shaffer keeps busy by chopping firewood, filing paperwork and finishing any other tasks.\n\nOne thing Shaffer doesn\u2019t do during idle moments is use his brooms to sweep the floor.\n\n\u201cI only do that when kids or reporters come by,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile business isn\u2019t what it once was, Shaffer still believes there is a market for hand-crafted brooms.\n\nThe industry\u2019s decline is owed in part to international trade agreements that allowed many products, like brooms, to be cheaply produced in Mexico where labor costs are low and materials are inexpensively harvested.\n\nShaffer also blames the emergence of big chain retailers in the \u201880s and \u201890s.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart and Kmart put us all out of business,\u201d he said.\n\nShaffer said chain retailers stock Mexican-made brooms because they are cheaper, an agreement he has nothing but contempt for.\n\n\u201cThose brooms are cheap for a reason,\u201d Shaffer said as he combed his fingers through the bristles of one of his brooms. \u201cThey fall apart.\u201d\n\nWhile big retailers have made business for Shaffer nearly unprofitable, he admits broom making has never been about the money.\n\n\u201cRoosevelt takes care of me,\u201d Shaffer said referring to President Franklin Roosevelt. \u201cHe sends me a check each month.\u201d\n\nFor years, Shaffer, who considers himself to be semi-retired, has lived off Social Security while supplementing that income with the money he makes from selling brooms.\n\n\u201cThis is my spending money,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile profits have dwindled, Shaffer has been able to make a few bucks over the years due to the frugality of his operations.\n\n\u201cI own the building, get my own firewood and catch rain for water,\u201d he said. Broom materials are his only expense.\n\nIf not for his stubborn personality, Shaffer said the company likely would have gone under years ago. Age also has caught up with him.\n\n\u201cI hate to admit it, but I\u2019m slowing down some,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nStubbornness persists though, because Shaffer has no intention of closing the shop any time soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll continue for as long as I have good health.\u201d\n\nShaffer\u2019s brooms can be purchased from the Lions Club, Pile Hardware in Charleston or directly from his Davis Creek workshop. Shaffer sells household brooms for $8 and charges $10 for a sturdier industrial broom. He also makes and sells mops.\n\nWhen asked why he has devoted an entire lifetime to broom making, Shaffer admitted he didn\u2019t know the reason for doing so but said it has been a relaxing and rewarding trade.\n\nThese days, broom making has become cathartic for Shaffer.\n\n\u201cWhen I get nervous and flustered, I come out here and make a few brooms,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, I\u2019m in a whole new world.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Charleston Daily Mail, http://www.charlestondailymail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Shaffer has rough hands blackened by nearly seven decades of broom making, but they're as deft as the day he started.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jim Shaffer has rough hands blackened by nearly seven decades of broom making, but they\u2019re as deft as the day he started.", "title": "W.Va. craftsman says making brooms an art form", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/1/wva-craftsman-says-making-brooms-an-art-form/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/01/17cffedfaf14a4046c0f6a706700bc46.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/01/17cffedfaf14a4046c0f6a706700bc46.jpg", "description": "Jim Shaffer has rough hands blackened by nearly seven decades of broom making, but they're as deft as the day he started.", "card": "summary", "title": "W.Va. craftsman says making brooms an art form"}, "Author": "SAMUEL SPECIALE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a simple process that only takes a few minutes, but Shaffer takes great pride in the work.\nShaffer is the owner of Charleston Broom Company, which maintains a small workshop near Kanawha State Forest.\nCHARLESTON, W.Va.
