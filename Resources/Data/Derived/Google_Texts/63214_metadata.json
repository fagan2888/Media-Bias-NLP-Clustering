Officials will meet with school staff, parents and students involved.\n\n\u201cAfter the session I think students will understand that bullying has to stop,\u201d Azar said, explaining that the administration prefers bullying to be resolved at the building level whenever possible, but will get the Vigo County Sheriff\u2019s Department involved if needed.\n\nBullying is prohibited in all schools. According to the policy, bullying is defined as \u201cany act that is repeated or chronic and of a threatening or intimidating nature with the intent to harass, ridicule, humiliate, intimidate or harm another student.\u201d The instances can pertain to technology, including cyber bullying, using social media and cell phones and computers.\n\nA recent study ranks Indiana third in the nation on bullying.The proposed updated policy is an effort for the district to meet state law requirements for tracking and investigating reported instances of each case within five days.\n\n\u201cHowever, some cases are so complex or the witnesses so many, that the timeline needs some flexibility and we tried to put some of that in the policy. In all cases we\u2019d expect a report in a five day period, but we may not have a resolution to the problem until later.\u201d\n\nEach elementary school participates in No Bullies Clubs and Azar noted that each school has its own \u201cBully Box\u201d in which anyone can report bullying at the building locations or on the school website. The reports are investigated at the building level.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you have heard about the HERO (Helping Everyone Respect Others) plan in our schools. It emphasizes good role models and involves students from kindergarten through high school,\u201d he said, adding that last year every student was given state mandated bullying lessons. VCSC Staff are required to complete in-services based on the state law.\n\nThe third and final reading of the anti-bullying policy will take place during the BOE meeting on Aug. 25.\n\nFor more information on bullying and how to report an instance, see vigoschools.org\n\nThe board took action on the following:\n\nThe board approved advertising for the 2015 General Fund, Debt Service Fund and School Transportation fund budgets and tax levies on Aug. 13 and Aug. 20 and to provide notice of a public hearing. The $113.2 million general fund budgeting reflects costs for the Affordable Care Act and a textbook rental fee shortfall of $380,000; Chief Financial Officer Donna Wilson said the transportation budget allows for replacing up to 17 buses. The budget will be available for review at the next BOE meeting.\n\nThe board approved personnel recommendations from Director of Human Resources Mick Newport; Approved employee benefits insurance proposals and PPO plan. The plans provide the same coverage and access to the same network, with two additional plans meeting the Affordable Care Act compliance guidelines.\n\nThe board approved appointing Kathryn Utley to the Vigo County Public Library Board.\n\nThe board approved elementary, middle and high school student handbooks updates.\n\nIn other meeting news:\n\nA spokesman from Citizens of Action (COA,) Rev.Dwayne Malone, said the organization is concerned about the \u201cresistance of this board and administration to collectively discuss the issues that plague our poor and minority students in the Vigo County School Corporation.\u201d\n\nMalone said he is concerned about the number of black students suspended and expelled at a higher rate than their peers. Also, he noted that the number of black students placed in Special Education classes who possibly have behavioral problems.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re seeking is information,\u201d Malone said.\n\nBoard member Mel Burks urged the administration to follow up with COA complaints. Superintendent Danny Tanoos agreed, indicating he\u2019d met in the past with individuals regarding similar issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ray Azar, director of student services, discussed enacting a tougher policy for the ongoing bullying problems during the Vigo County School Corporation board me", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/vigo-county-school-corporation-bashing-bullying", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/dc/38/dc388343bf17f01a22b750083eefcfdd.jpg?itok=RTKYRZtN", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "title": "Vigo County School Corporation bashing bullying"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/dc/38/dc388343bf17f01a22b750083eefcfdd.jpg?itok=RTKYRZtN", "title": "Vigo County School Corporation bashing bullying", "description": "Ray Azar, director of student services, discussed enacting a tougher policy for the ongoing bullying problems during the Vigo County School Corporation board meeting Monday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@examinercom"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-08-11T21:49:36-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Places & Faces, vigo county school corporation, Vigo County School Board of Trustees, Bullying Awareness & Prevention", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T21:49"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8e5\"", "article_summary": "Ray Azar, director of student services, discussed enacting a tougher policy for the ongoing bullying problems during the Vigo County School Corporation board meeting Monday.\nThe board approved appointing Kathryn Utley to the Vigo County Public Library Board.\nThe board approved personnel recommendations from Director of Human Resources Mick Newport; Approved employee benefits insurance proposals and PPO plan.\nThe board approved elementary, middle and high school student handbooks updates.\nA plan is put in place once the case is substantiated to stop the bullying, which is the responsive level."}
