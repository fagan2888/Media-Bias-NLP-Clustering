Public comments on the revised fiduciary rule are due by Tuesday. The DOL plans a three-day public hearing on the fiduciary rule Aug. 10-12.\n\n\u201cAs drafted, we see the regulation having a negative impact for specific companies, but only modestly negative for most,\u201d the Credit Suisse note said.\n\nAlthough considered a security, VAs have remained exempt for fiduciary standards via the 84-24 rule. The new DOL rules would revoke that exemption. Fixed-income annuities will retain the 84-24 exemption, but fixed index annuity (FIAs) sales will need to meet stepped-up \u201cimpartial conduct standards.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse predicts that FIAs will see little impact from the rule.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will be a relative positive for the product since brokers may not need to materially alter current business practices,\u201d the Credit Suisse report said.\n\nFinancial Services Institute officials disagree, noting the rule requires onerous disclosure contracts that could alienate small savers.\n\nFinancial services firms are likely to lose out on small savers who like to shop around before deciding where to place their money, said David Bellaire, FSI\u2019s executive vice president/general counsel, during a Monday conference call.\n\n\u201cThis proposal would have the advisor make them sign a contract virtually upon entering the office,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting the White House backing, Credit Suisse analysts predicted eventual passage of a fiduciary rule \u201cwithout much dilution\u201d to the proposal. The process could drag out, however, the report stated.\n\n\u201cWe are not changing 2016 earnings at this time,\" the analysts wrote, \"as we think it is possible that the timing will get pushed back until late 2016 (or) early 2017.\"\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Editor John Hilton has covered business and other beats in more than 20 years of daily journalism.
