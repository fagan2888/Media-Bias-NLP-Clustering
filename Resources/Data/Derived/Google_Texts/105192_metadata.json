Dave Brat is weaving his way through a crowd of businessmen and women at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, stopping to shake hands and say hello to nearly all of the 50 attendees who\u2019ve come to watch him speak.\n\nTo those observing the Republican congressman, it seems as if he knows nearly every person in the room. And he just may, as it wasn\u2019t long ago that Brat was knocking on doors across Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, asking voters for their support in the 2014 Republican primary.\n\nBrat, a former economics professor at nearby Randolph-Macon College, delivered a historic upset that year, defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. His victory shocked political watchers and left some declaring death to K Street and life to Main Street.\n\nReflecting on his win, Brat, who returned to his home in Glen Allen, Va., for his first month-long August recess as a congressman, said he owes the result to a culmination of missteps by the former majority leader.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect storm in terms of accessibility, off on major policy issues that mattered to the district, including immigration, and some aspects of crony capitalism,\u201d Brat told The Daily Signal during an interview in his district office.\n\n\u201cAnd then the grassroots felt that they were being dismissed in the political process instead of being valued members of the conservative big tent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the whole idea that leadership wasn\u2019t responsive even back then on major issues\u2014Obamacare and everything. There was always a promised fight, but nothing was changing.\u201d\n\nStill, over Brat\u2019s first year in Congress\u2014Cantor stepped down in August, allowing a special election to coincide with the 2014 November midterms\u2014not much has changed.\n\nCongress, just as in 2014, has a fast approaching deadline to fund the federal government and is likely to pass a short-term bill that funds the government at current levels until December.\n\nConservatives have outlined their priorities for this year\u2019s bill\u2014defund Planned Parenthood, keep the Export-Import Bank closed, and repeal Obamacare\u2014but just like last year, they fear that House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, will shun his Republican colleagues and pass a bill with assistance from House Democrats.\n\nAnd though Republicans have control of both the House and the Senate, conservatives still feel as if Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., is at the helm of the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the same position as last year,\u201d Brat said. \u201cThe American people see this degree of budget\u2014what?\u2014chaos year after year after year, and when we own both chambers and are responsible for an orderly process, I think everyone should be getting the memo when you see [Donald] Trump at 30 percent and Bernie [Sanders] at 30 percent, that the American people are catching on, and they do not like the D.C. process.\u201d\n\nDespite the gridlock and partisan politics, Brat has no qualms about leaving his \u201cdream job\u201d to go to Washington.\n\n\u2018Always Yakking\u2019\n\nLocated just 70 miles outside Washington, D.C., Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District stretches to just north of Fredericksburg and south of Richmond.\n\nIt\u2019s a place where it\u2019s easy to hide.\n\nBrat didn\u2019t ask for the limelight, but unseating a House majority leader\u2014the first time that\u2019s happened since the position was created in 1899\u2014will garner some attention.\n\nAfter Brat won last June, trucks from CNN and Fox News parked outside his Glen Allen home, he remembers. The scene was so chaotic, he said, Brat\u2019s two children, Jonathan and Sophia, couldn\u2019t even go outside.\n\nStill, making the transition from economics professor to member of Congress wasn\u2019t impossible.\n\n\u201cThe best analogy is like when your cable company service breaks down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like dealing with 100 of those problems at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that unexpected, it wasn\u2019t insurmountable, but it\u2019s just like 100 hassles where you\u2019ve got to go fix your cable service, then your phone service. It\u2019s just a bunch of routine issues that are just\u2014it\u2019s a hassle.\u201d\n\nAnd for his family, having dad in Congress just means he\u2019s always busy.\n\nAt the end of his work weeks, Brat points his wheels due south from Washington and heads home on a Friday, typically stopping at the more northern cities in his district\u2014Culpepper, Spotsylvania, and Orange.\n\nDuring the campaign, Brat vowed that as a congressman, he would visit all nine counties and the city of Richmond included in Virginia\u2019s 7th, and so far, he\u2019s made good on that promise.\n\nSaturdays are often spent at various events in the district, but Saturday nights are date nights for Brat and his wife, Laura. Sunday is family day, with church in the morning and Five Guys Burgers and Fries for lunch.\n\nFor his family, being out and about with Congressman Brat is hardly different from being out and about with \u201cdad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an extrovert,\u201d Brat said. \u201cI was always yakking with somebody. So now, they just make a joke out of it, except it\u2019s worse now. When we\u2019re out to eat, the family gets a kick out of it. [They know] Dad enjoys it.\u201d\n\nBreaking the Rules\n\nIn Washington, Brat associates himself with members like Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.\u2014conservative firebrands and fellow House Freedom Caucus members who don\u2019t shy away from challenging leadership.\n\nIn January, Brat joined 24 other Republicans in voting against Boehner\u2014he also vowed to support a challenge to the speaker should Boehner allow for Planned Parenthood to continue receiving federal dollars\u2014and breaks with party leadership when voting on procedural rules to advance legislation.\n\nDuring his address to business owners at the meeting with the Henrico Business Council of the Greater Richmond Chamber of Commerce, Brat recalled two pieces of advice leadership bestowed upon him when he first arrived in Washington: don\u2019t vote against the rule, and don\u2019t vote last.\n\nHe\u2019s already broken both.\n\nBrat recognizes that though Republicans won overwhelmingly in 2014, few seats were turned over, with his own seat being an obvious exception. He\u2019s frustrated that his colleagues in the Senate haven\u2019t done much to pass legislation with conservatives\u2019 backing.\n\n\u201cOur talking points on the Senate side\u2014I think it was [Sen. John] Thune who helped make the talking points as we went home, you can look them up,\u201d Brat said. \u201cThose talking points said, \u2018Remember, the Budget Committee voted to defund Obamacare and balance the budget within 10 years.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s our leadership talking points that they sent us home with,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd now, is that what we\u2019re going to do? I hope so, but it doesn\u2019t look like it. So they\u2019re sending us home to tell our constituents that we\u2019re going to balance the budget in 10 years? Well, then we ought to put in a budget that does that instead of doing a [continuing resolution] and not keeping our promise to our constituents.\u201d\n\nBrat boasts that he hits the gym with Democratic lawmakers and tries hard not to be overly partisan\u2014some of his constituents with the Henrico Business Council were, after all, Cantor backers.\n\n\u201cI was a supporter of Cantor from the beginning,\u201d Fatima Caldas, a small business who went to hear Brat speak, told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut things changed in Washington. Dave brought a new perspective to what needed to go on.\u201d\n\nCaldas\u2019s biggest concern is the national debt\u2014an issue Brat agrees needs to be addressed.\n\n\u201cDave\u2019s moving in the right direction, but he cannot do this by himself,\u201d Caldas said.\n\nKeeping Promises\n\nBrat\u2019s personal office in Glen Allen boasts bare walls, a small conference table, a sitting area, a desk, and a bookshelf. The former economics professor displays books that show his commitment to the Constitution and his commitment to economics\u2014\u201c1776\u201d and \u201cJohn Adams\u201d by David McCollough, \u201cThe Jefferson Bible,\u201d \u201cLife of Adam Smith,\u201d and \u201cFix It Now\u201d by Chip Maxwell are just a few of the titles lining the shelves.\n\nFlipping through a copy of The Richmond Times-Dispatch, he stops at an editorial on the Iran nuclear deal from a White Stone resident named Larry Jones.\n\nThe writer said the deal is the \u201cbest we can get.\u201d\n\nBrat disagrees.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t run into hardly anybody, constituent-wise, at town hall meetings\u2014everyone knows it\u2019s a bad deal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Virginia Republican believes that the agreement should be handled as a treaty, which requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to pass.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go down this road,\u201d Brat said regarding a resolution of disapproval, \u201cand so now we\u2019re going to have to pursue some other route if this deal goes through. But I think we have plenty of constitutional grounds to make a good case.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia Republican cites the Iran deal as one of a laundry list of issues that has Americans frustrated with Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cOn Iran, it looks like things are going the wrong way. On the debt, the deficit, the fiscal picture, we\u2019re going in the wrong way. On Planned Parenthood, we\u2019re going the wrong way. On unconstitutional amnesty, we\u2019re going the wrong way. On trade, we\u2019re going the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yeah, everybody\u2019s frustrated, and leadership is in charge of that agenda.\u201d\n\nDespite the anger Brat feels from his constituents, he said there is one constant: they admire him for keeping his word.\n\n\u201cThey all say, \u2018So proud of Dave for doing what he promised to do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most common\u2014\u2018Proud of you for being one of the few politicians who keeps their word. You made promises, and you\u2019re keeping them.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly a year after ousting House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Rep.
