It is a natural consequence of life. So why is it that too often the medical community \u2013 as well as patients themselves and their family members \u2013 spend so much time and money extending lives that are, for all intents and purposes, over? It\u2019s a question that doesn\u2019t get asked enough, but this week a British cardiologist did just that.\n\nIn a recent interview with BBC 4, James Beattie, of the East of England NHS Foundation Trust in Birmingham, argued against intervention and in favor of something unique in modern healthcare: a more natural way of dying. \u201cIf a person is in hospital, particularly an elderly person, with multiple comorbidities, if they have a cardiac arrest, it\u2019s a sign they are of decline,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s their act of dying and they should not be resuscitated, they should be allowed to die.\u201d\n\nBut allowing people to die is not the generally accepted protocol. In the U.S., end-of-life care accounts for a staggering proportion of our healthcare costs. And as Michael Bell noted in Forbes last year, \u201cA lot of the money being spent is not only not helping, it is making that patient endure more bad experiences on a daily basis.\u201d Part of the reason, James Beattie suggests, is that we have become a culture that simply doesn\u2019t have as much experience confronting death, thanks to longer life spans and medical advancements that are \u201cmaking dying more complicated.\u201d \u201cOur great-grandparents and to some extent our grandparents grew up with people dying before the days of antibiotics. That\u2019s denied these days,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople died at home. Death is now becoming something that largely in hospitals and care homes, somewhere removed from the family and the home. We need to make it a more natural expectation.\u201d\n\nWhen we do otherwise, when we cling to the illusion of life when life is essentially gone, we are not merely feeding into an expensive and overburdened system. We are increasing the suffering of patients, creating guilt over the vague concept of doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d while fueling the medical system\u2019s terror of lawsuits and, significantly, denying families the opportunity to grieve. Extending life is not in and of itself a noble or useful goal. We know this instinctively \u2013 a recent study of over a thousand doctors revealed that an impressive 88.3 percent would opt for a \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d plan if they had a terminal illness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A U.K. cardiologist speaks up for healthcare's last taboo", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A U.K. cardiologist speaks up for healthcare's last taboo", "title": "Let the dying die!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/01/let_the_dying_die/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/hospital_hold_hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A U.K. cardiologist speaks up for healthcare's last taboo", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/hospital_hold_hands.jpg", "title": "Let the dying die!", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Let the dying die!", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cancer, Death with Dignity, elder care, healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9315\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Cancer, Death with Dignity, elder care, healthcare, Life NewsDeath is not the loss of a battle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s their act of dying and they should not be resuscitated, they should be allowed to die.\u201dBut allowing people to die is not the generally accepted protocol.\nDeath is now becoming something that largely in hospitals and care homes, somewhere removed from the family and the home.\nIt\u2019s a question that doesn\u2019t get asked enough, but this week a British cardiologist did just that.\nIt is a natural consequence of life."}
