Remember the acrimonious debate about \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans?\n\nNamely, that should an employer offer such a plan to its employees, that it, not the insured will be penalized.\n\nWell, the chickens have come home to roost.\n\nIn the early days of the hectic White House/Congressional debates there was much contention over the nature and rules governing what would eventually become known as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne of those fights engendered unsuccessful public entity lobbying aimed at gaining an exemption from the penalty that was to be imposed upon top-tier (e.g., \u201cCadillac\u201d) health plans.\n\nUnder Obamacare regulations, employers may offer these so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans but, if they do, they will be stiffly penalized.\n\nBig money is involved:\n\nThe Board indicates that 94% of BREA members are currently \u201cenrolled in Aetna 10, the most expensive insurance plan,\u201d e.g., a \u2018Cadillac\u2019 plan and, \u201cIf that remains,\u201d the Board goes on to say, \u201cwe cannot afford to provide salary increases in year 3 [of the proposed contract]. It is simply too expensive.\u201d\n\nThe Board\u2019s release emphasizes that the Obamacare penalty, \u201cbeginning in 2018, the third year of this contract, the District will incur a tax penalty in excess of $1 million for these \u201cCadillac\u201d health insurance plans currently being offered to District employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing employees to continue enrolling in high-end health insurance plans is not financially sustainable,\u201d and we \u201cmust consider the impact on the overall budget that these insurance costs are causing.\u201d\n\nYesterday, the BREA issued a press release that, despite this seemingly intractable problem, \u201cwe are very close.\u201d\n\nTo help resolve this issue the Board \u201cwould like to offer all BREA members an information session with the insurance broker to answer any questions you may have, and, we hope that the BREA will meet with us to resolve.\u201d\n\nThe Board concludes its missive with \u201cWe leave that to you.\u201d\n\nFor an extensive discussion of Board alternatives concerning this issue, please review the Board\u2019s release in full. It was read to a packed house last night at the Wade Administration Building by Board President Ann Marie Mead.\n\nThanks for checking in and, as always, remember to take care of yourselves.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1iVTiID", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "For the first time in memory, the Board of Education for Bridgewater-Raritan Schools (the Board) has disclosed...", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "For the first time in memory, the Board of Education for Bridgewater-Raritan Schools (the Board) has disclosed...", "title": "Bridgewater-Raritan School Board Discloses Details of Teachers Union Salary Negotiations", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/view-from-bridgewater/2015/11/11/bridgewater-raritan-school-board-discloses-details-of-teachers-union-salary-negotiations/75628204/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the first time in memory, the Board of Education for Bridgewater-Raritan Schools (the Board) has disclosed...", "title": "Bridgewater-Raritan School Board Discloses Details of Teachers Union Salary Negotiations", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "However, since multi-year salary increases are compounded over time, the Board\u2019s actual three-year salary proposal to the BREA is 9.33%.\nSimilarly, the Somerset County salary increases for the same years of this agreement are also lower: 2.35%, 2.48%, and 2.58%.\nFor the first time in memory, the Board of Education for Bridgewater-Raritan Schools (the Board) has disclosed details of its ongoing salary and benefit negotiations with the teachers\u2019 union, the Bridgewater-Raritan Education Association (BREA).\nUnder Obamacare regulations, employers may offer these so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans but, if they do, they will be stiffly penalized.\nOne of those fights engendered unsuccessful public entity lobbying aimed at gaining an exemption from the penalty that was to be imposed upon top-tier (e.g., \u201cCadillac\u201d) health plans."}
