It focused on quality. And it kept good statistics to show that its support matters to kids.\n\nNow, those who run the non-profit are asking voters to continue the program past its initial five-year authorization, and slightly increase the sales tax supporting the program.\n\nWe have recommended Denver voters do so by voting \u201cyes\u201d on question 2A on their ballots. The measure would raise the preschool sales tax from 12 cents to 15 cents on every $100 purchase. The increase would support summer and extended-day programming.\n\nThe preschool program, which began in 2008, offers financial support on a sliding scale for 4-year-olds to attend preschool.\n\nOverall, a greater proportion of third-grade children who went through the Denver Preschool Program scored proficient or advanced on state tests than their peers who did not.\n\nDrilling down further, it turns out the program was particularly helpful to children in poverty and Hispanic kids.\n\nSometimes the gap between comparable subgroups was five or eight percentage points. That means, when comparing low-income kids, a greater share of those who went through the Denver Preschool scored proficient or advanced.\n\nSuch statistics suggest the program can make a dent in the achievement gap.\n\nThis is progress that Denvervoters should be proud of and willing to support.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Vote \u201cyes\u201d on 2A to support Denver Preschool Program", "title": "Vote \u201cyes\u201d on 2A to support Denver Preschool Program", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/24/vote-yes-on-2a-to-support-denver-preschool-program/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141024__OP26PRESCHOOLp1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141024__OP26PRESCHOOLp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-24T17:30:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T00:06:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Denver Preschool Program has done a lot of things right, and it shows.\nThe preschool program, which began in 2008, offers financial support on a sliding scale for 4-year-olds to attend preschool.\nWe have recommended Denver voters do so by voting \u201cyes\u201d on question 2A on their ballots.\nThat means, when comparing low-income kids, a greater share of those who went through the Denver Preschool scored proficient or advanced.\nOverall, a greater proportion of third-grade children who went through the Denver Preschool Program scored proficient or advanced on state tests than their peers who did not."}
