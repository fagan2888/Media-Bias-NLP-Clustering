Trappist beer has been uniquely brewed in Europe for more than a century by monks known as ‘Trappists’. The monks are Catholic Cistercians, and are renowned for making some of the best beer in the world.

Until now Trappist beer has been brewed in only eight monasteries worldwide; six in Belgium, one in Holland and one in Austria. Their beer is recognized by the International Trappist Association as authentic.

But, as with most things, America doesn’t want to get left behind – so as of today, 63 monks from St. Joseph’s Abbey in Boston are about to try their hand at brewing some of the amber nectar.

It will mark the first time Trappist beer has been officially brewed outside of Europe, and the Boston monks, among others, are very excited about the prospect.

A couple of years ago St. Joseph’s decided to sent a couple of monks on a scouting mission to the Belgian beer fest in Boston. Their fact-finding mission was met with much skepticism though by their European ‘brothers.’

Father Isaac Keeley said: “The original skepticism was because we were outside of Europe… and Americans. And the fear we would go too big too fast.”

Father Keeley, and another monk friend of his, decided to move to Belgium temporarily in order to find out out the Trappist beer was made.

The Europeans weren’t the only ones skeptical about the move to brew. At the time there was more than a little concern from the members of abbey who were worried about the massive initial outlay of funds to start brewing.

Nevertheless, as the monastery buildings aren’t cheap to maintain, an extra source of income, especially a lucrative one, was welcomed. The head of St Joseph’s Abbey, Father Damian Carr said:

“We see it as a 50-100 year project. (Just) as we’re standing on the shoulders of those who came before us and built these building and supported the way of life, hopefully future generations will be able to stand on our shoulders, what we are doing – and we see the brewery as part of that.”
