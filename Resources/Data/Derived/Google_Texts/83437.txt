Watertown, SD

Officials in Watertown are working quickly to prepare the eastern South Dakota city for President Barack Obama's first visit to the state next month.



Watertown Mayor Steve Thorson says the city is repainting streets, running their street sweepers 16 hours a day and synchronizing all of its emergency management personnel.



Obama on Monday announced that he will visit Watertown's Lake Area Technical Institute on May 8. South Dakota is the only state in the union that the president has not visited.



Thorson says he's also reaching out to other smaller cities that have hosted the president to ask for advice. He says he'll consider their tips as he and the city prepare for the president's arrival over the next three weeks.
