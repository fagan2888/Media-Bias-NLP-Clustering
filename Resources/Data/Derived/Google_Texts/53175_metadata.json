With less than a year left in the Obama administration, FDA watchers are expecting that sodium cuts will be one of the last items on the White House\u2019s nutrition agenda. For seven years, food companies and consumer groups have been waiting for the FDA to come up with voluntary sodium reduction targets \u2014 an issue that has sparked litigation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne former top FDA official said he believes a lawsuit brought by a consumer advocacy group will finally shake loose the voluntary targets that were completed two years ago but have never been released. The FDA agreed in February to respond by June 1 to the petition from the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nThat timetable \u201cis the reason for my optimism,\u201d said Michael Landa, former director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and an advocate of government action to reduce sodium.

Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host is among those delving into Beverly Cleary nostalgia as the author is set to turn 100 next week. \u201cRamona Quimby, Age 8\u201d was one of my favorite books growing up.

Follow the whole team @Morning_Ag.\n\nTHIS WEEK: IS THE SENATE READY TO TACKLE GMO LABELING?: After the failed effort to limit debate on Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts\u2019 voluntary GMO labeling bill last month, the Kansas Republican and other supporters vowed to try again when they returned from the two-week spring break. Now that they\u2019re back, can middle ground be found to lure enough farm-state Democrats and states'-rights Republicans to vote for the bill? Talks on how to move forward could start this week, especially given that there are fewer than 90 days before Vermont\u2019s mandatory GMO labeling law takes effect. Brush up on the fight here.\n\nMA also is keeping an eye on the Senate because it\u2019s been more than a month since the Agriculture Committee, in a bipartisan vote, approved a bill that would reauthorize child nutrition programs but the measure has yet to get floor time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agriculture Committee\u2019s panel on rural development and energy on Wednesday will hold a hearing on the economic impact of the Agriculture Department\u2019s rural development programs. The witness list includes representatives from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and wind turbine manufacturer Dakota Turbines, so renewable energy will likely be the topic du jour. Details here.\n\nThe other side of the Capitol building will stay quiet, as House lawmakers don\u2019t return until next week.\n\nAlso on the agenda: The National Food Policy Conference, hosted by Consumer Federation of America, will take place Wednesday and Thursday. Noteworthy keynote speakers include former Acting FDA Commissioner Stephen Ostroff, who in June will replace Michael Taylor as deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine; Kevin Concannon, USDA undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services; and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n\nTwo of your favorite MA hosts \u2014 Helena Bottemiller Evich and yours truly \u2014 will moderate panels on the presidential candidates\u2019 food policy positions and the role of small producers in ensuring food safety, respectively.\n\nVILSACK TRAVELS TO BERLIN, PARIS: Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack is in Berlin today to meet with his German counterpart, Christian Schmidt, and other government officials and farmers to discuss rural development opportunities and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Later in the week, Vilsack will co-chair the U.S. delegation to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agriculture ministers\u2019 meeting in Paris. Discussions are expected to focus on feeding a growing world population while managing natural resources and dealing with climate change, the USDA said in a statement.\n\nDELAURO: EXPAND ACTION LEVEL FOR ARSENIC IN RICE: FDA\u2019s draft guidance setting a new action level for arsenic in rice-based infant cereal at below 100 parts per billion doesn\u2019t go far enough to protect public health, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) says. After the FDA published the guidance Friday, DeLauro said in a statement that the move is a great first step, but the agency should expand the guidance to include action levels on all rice-based products. \u201cWhat about two-year-olds and three-year-olds? What about expectant mothers? This is about the health and well-being of our families,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nFDA\u2019s action follows years of pressure from consumer groups worried about exposure to inorganic arsenic, a naturally occurring carcinogen. The agency is not recommending all consumers change their rice consumption habits, but is giving more targeted advice to pregnant women to minimize exposure. The FDA recommends pregnant women eat a variety of grains, including wheat, oats and barley. The majority of rice cereals on the market already fall under the new action level, which is identical to the limit set by the European Union. Read the draft guidance here.

California is the U.S.\u2019s largest grower of produce and its labor force includes about 1.85 million undocumented immigrants, the second-highest statewide share (9.4 percent) in the nation after Nevada (10.2 percent), according to the Public Policy Institute.\n\nThe expansion is one of several measures Covered California is weighing for a so-called \"Section 1332 waiver,\" which allows states to change major pieces of the Affordable Care Act starting in 2017 as long as the reforms meet certain requirements. The state insurance program has a board meeting Thursday where it is set to act on initial waiver recommendations.\n\nBut Western Growers, the California and Arizona produce industry\u2019s trade group, isn\u2019t particularly excited about the Obamacare development. The association already has thousands of farmworkers enrolled in the Western Growers Assurance Trust, a health plan it created for its members in 1957, a spokesman tells Pro Agriculture. \u201cWe will continue to work with our members to offer affordable health benefits to farmworkers, irrespective of the state of California seeking a waiver to broaden eligibility for the exchange,\u201d the group says in a statement.

The existing proposed rule calls for new standards for heavy-duty vehicles that would ramp up to model year 2027 and lower fuel consumption by 24 percent; the group wants the standards to require a 40 percent reduction in fuel consumption in new trucks by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe have the technology needed to significantly cut fuel consumption and emissions from large trucks,\u201d the group says in its letter. \u201cAs compared to the proposed standards, a 40% reduction in fuel use would cut an additional 200,000 barrels of oil daily in 2035 and provide 33% more in fuel cost savings. ... Greenhouse gas rules for heavy trucks will provide a level playing field for companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprints.\u201d View the proposed rule here.\n\nAPRIL FOOLS, BROUGHT TO YOU BY FOOD AND AG: You\u2019re pretty funny, food and ag world.

Congress should act now to require mandatory, GMO labels on the package, not just high-tech gimmicks. Nine out of ten consumers want mandatory GMO labeling on the package \u2014 just like consumers in 64 other nations. Listen to the experts: the right-to-know is reason enough to require GMO labels. http://bit.ly/1W6njad **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Is the Senate ready to tackle GMO labeling? \u2014 DeLauro: expand action level for arsenic in rice", "title": "Will salt be Obama's last nutrition hurrah?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-agriculture/2016/04/will-salt-be-obamas-last-nutrition-hurrah-is-the-senate-ready-to-tackle-gmo-labeling-delauro-expand-action-level-for-arsenic-in-rice-213565", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Is the Senate ready to tackle GMO labeling? \u2014 DeLauro: expand action level for arsenic in rice", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With help from Jenny Hopkinson, Helena Bottemiller Evich and Jason HuffmanWILL SALT BE OBAMA\u2019S LAST NUTRITION HURRAH?\nWill salt be Obama's last nutrition hurrah?\nLater in the week, Vilsack will co-chair the U.S. delegation to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agriculture ministers\u2019 meeting in Paris.\nRead the full take on sodium, including the politics and the science, from Pro Agriculture's Helena Bottemiller Evich here.\nNine out of ten consumers want mandatory GMO labeling on the package \u2014 just like consumers in 64 other nations."}
