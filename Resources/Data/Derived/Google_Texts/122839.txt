Governor Bruce Rauner and the Service Employees International Union remain divided on a new contract for day care providers and home care workers that help disabled persons.

SEIU's Denise Gaines says the Republican governor is effectively trying to strip thousands of union members of their health care benefits.

"Our workers are low-income workers, so therefore the only option for them is to go on Obamacare. And the problem with Obamacare is that, since they have some type of employment, the rate that they would have to pay on Obamacare, would outprice our members."

Leaving them without coverage. Gaines says that would put SEIU's members in a compromising position because many don't have paid sick leave. Paid training is also under dispute.

Rauner's office declined comment. The administration recently reached agreements with a trio of unions, representing a small fraction of public workers like plumbers, machinists and engineers.

AFSCME, which represents the most state employees, is also still in talks with the governor on a contract.
