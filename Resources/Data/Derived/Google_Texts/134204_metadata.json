Threats of a protest against upcoming city council votes had local law enforcement on edge, anticipating it could reignite the city\u2019s simmering pro-Russian separatist movement. When the Soviet flag was unfurled, the police immediately responded. And after a few minutes of protest the three Communist party members relented peacefully and put the flag away.\n\n\u201cHiding the flag doesn\u2019t change the way we think,\u201d one said, while carefully folding the flag. \u201cWe are still Communists.\u201d They declined to give their names, but two claimed to be Red Army veterans.\n\nThere were a few scuffles between police and local agitators and at least one arrest, but no large-scale violence. By evening, the crowds and police had dispersed and the square outside city hall was once again filled with mothers pushing strollers and teenagers performing tricks on their BMX bikes. Life in this Black Sea port city and tourist destination, which is more than 380 miles from the front lines of the Ukraine conflict, appeared to be continuing on as normal. But many residents here worry that a pro-Russian uprising could erupt anytime, potentially spurring the approximately 2,500 Russian troops stationed in the nearby Moldovan breakaway region of Transnistria to invade.\n\n\u201cOnly about 20 percent of Odessa is pro-Russian,\u201d said a Right Sector soldier who went by the nom de guerre \u201cMaverick,\u201d standing guard in central Odessa last weekend. \u201cBut that\u2019s enough to cause serious problems.\u201d\n\nMajor combat in the Ukraine conflict has mostly been confined to cities and villages located in the \u201cDonbas\u201d\u2014 a pocket of territory on the Ukraine\u2019s southeastern border with Russia where, despite the Feb. 12 cease-fire, fighting continues daily.\n\nBut the year-old conflict has evolved, sparking a wave of terrorism and violence beyond the battlefields of the Donbas. The entire country is on edge, particularly in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa, (Ukraine\u2019s second, fourth and third largest cities respectively), all of which held off separatist uprisings last year.\n\nSome Ukrainian officials and media claim the wave of attacks is a Russian-backed operation to destabilize Ukraine\u2019s post-revolutionary government.\n\n\u201cThese three cities, especially Kharkiv and Odessa, are the most vulnerable,\u201d said Oleksiy Melnyk, director of foreign relations and international security at the Razumkov Centre, a Ukrainian think tank.\n\n\u201cIn almost every terrorist attack there is clear Russian involvement,\u201d he added. \u201cThe main goal of Russian Federation is to show to the international community and to their own public that Ukraine is a failed state, that the government is illegitimate and that most Ukrainians support a fascist ideology.\u201d\n\nMilitary checkpoints ring the three cities, and military assets are stationed throughout smaller towns and empty farmland in between to guard transportation routes and key positions such as bridges and public utilities.\n\nLocal officials and residents across the region say the separatist threat has not been defeated, but has been lying dormant. And as weapons and soldiers seep out of the conflict areas, and the grinding yearlong war deepens the ideological fervor of the pro-Russian separatists (many of whom now have combat experience as well as Russian military training and weapons), the threat of repeat uprisings and terrorist attacks is on the rise.\n\n\u201cWith Ukraine\u2019s economy reeling, the value of the hrvynia plummeting, and general malaise among citizens, terrorism is a new potent tool in the arsenal of Kremlin-backed groups,\u201d the Ukraine Crisis Media Center editorial board wrote Feb. 26. \u201cSmall, sporadic bombings throughout the country can achieve a sense of hopelessness and undermine faith in Ukraine\u2019s elected officials and their ability to bring stability and security far from the frontlines.\u201d\n\nIn Kharkiv (160 miles from the front lines), a new national law banning Nazi and Communist symbols, including statues of Soviet leaders such as Vladimir Lenin, has added to pre-existing tensions.\n\nA group calling itself the Kharkiv Partisans recently threatened to kill five Ukrainians for every Soviet monument taken down in the city. The city has been hit by a string of bombings this year, including one on Feb. 22 during a rally celebrating the one-year anniversary of Ukraine\u2019s revolution. Three people were killed, including a 15-year-old boy.\n\nThe city\u2019s physical proximity to the Russian border (about 20 miles) and the front lines has left it vulnerable to infiltration by pro-Russian separatists. But a separatist movement in the city crumpled last spring, and life in Kharkiv appears normal. Ukrainian flags fly from downtown flagpoles. The city center was shut down on April 11 for a running race. And on Orthodox Easter, families flocked to the city\u2019s zoo to take advantage of free admission for the holiday.\n\nBut, as in Odessa, there is an undercurrent of anxiety in Kharkiv. Security officials have arrested more than 700 people accused of supporting separatists. And law enforcement and intelligence officials have stepped up counterterrorism operations in the run up to the May 9 Victory Day celebrations, commemorating the surrender of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe security crackdown has taken its toll, eroding local faith in both national and local government.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t trust this government or this president,\u201d said a lawyer for the Kharkhiv district council, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. \u201cKharkiv is a very tactical, dangerous region in Ukraine, and people are afraid.\u201d\n\nIn Dnipropetrovsk (218 miles southwest of Kharkiv, 200 miles west of the front lines), the recent departure of the city\u2019s mayor, oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, has residents on edge.\n\nKolomoisky is credited by many with preventing a separatist takeover last year.\n\n\u201cWhen things started happening in the east, they tried it here,\u201d said Soslan Bekoev, 39, a lawyer in Dnipropetrovsk. \u201cThere were people in the streets waving Russian flags. But Kolomoisky blocked off the city, and the agitators couldn\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Kolomoisky stepped down from office on March 25 after he used his personal guards to take over the Kyiv offices of two companies in which he held interests as a protest against efforts by parliament to regulate his business affairs.\n\nSome residents claim his departure has left the city vulnerable to pro-Russian separatists, who might look to seize advantage of a power vacuum and divided loyalties in the local government.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared with Kolomoisky gone,\u201d Bekoev said. \u201cMany people think the new government won\u2019t be able to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nIn addition to keeping separatists out of Dnipropetrovsk, Kolomoisky also helped broker stability by implementing strict anti-corruption measures, which were an olive branch for those in the city advocating for drastic political change. With Kolomoisky gone, however, most of the anti-corruption campaigns have been put on hold.\n\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d said Vitaliy Dorokhin, 39, a lawyer from Dnipropetrovsk and military veteran. \u201cPeople are upset. After Kolomoisky left, they have no faith in the new government.\u201d\n\nIn Odessa, residents worry about May 2\u2014the upcoming first anniversary of a deadly failed takeover of the city last spring. On May 2, 2014, 48 people were killed during clashes between pro-Ukraine and pro-separatist camps, 32 of whom died when the Trade Union building within which separatists had hunkered down caught fire.\n\nThe city has suffered more bombings and separatist activity than any other outside the Donbas, with more than 10 in 2015. The SBU (Ukrainian equivalent of the FBI) recently launched the second phase of its crackdown on Odessa\u2019s pro-Russian militant groups this month, making dozens of arrests and uncovering stockpiles of explosives such as TNT, as well as small arms.\n\nA popular tourism destination, the violence has affected the city\u2019s economy, with tourism in 2014 only one tenth what it was the year before. Yet, looming beyond the threat of terrorism are the approximately 2,500 Russian troops stationed in the nearby Moldovan breakaway region of Transnistria, 60 miles away.\n\nResidents worry that another separatist uprising would be an excuse for the Russian troops massed across the border to invade. Adding to those fears, on April 9 Russian forces in Transnistria held a military exercise comprising 400 troops, who trained with armored personnel carriers and fired about 100,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nLuke Coffey, Margaret Thatcher fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a U.S. Army veteran, said Russia\u2019s presence in Transnistria and influence in the Moldovan region of Gagauzia pose a potential threat to Ukraine and the Odessa region.\n\n\u201cBringing this region under Russian influence would almost complete Moscow\u2019s control of Ukraine\u2019s western border,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cIt would also place Ukraine\u2019s Odesa Oblast under further threat from Russian aggression. This fits in line with Putin\u2019s imperial vision of the region and his designs on Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea last year nothing can be ruled out,\u201d he added.\n\nMelnyk said Russian intervention from Transnistria was possible, but less likely than one year ago due to Ukraine\u2019s improved military capabilities.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, the cost would be high for the Kremlin to take any actions from Transnistria like they did in Crimea or in the East,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk is low, but it can\u2019t be ruled out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Donbas", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "ODESSA, Ukraine\u2014Outside of the city administration building here on April 16, three older men who said they were from the local Communist party unfurled a...
