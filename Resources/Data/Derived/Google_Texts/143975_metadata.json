(Photo: Robert Steinau/The Courier-Journal )Buy Photo Story Highlights The first races at the 1.8-mile Fairgrounds track closed the Kentucky Derby Festival in May of 1957.\n\nThe $15.4 million \u201cKentucky State Fair and Exposition Center\u201d opened in 1956 near Phillips Lane.\n\nThe \u201cold\u201d Fairgrounds opened in 1908 on 150 acres at the end of Cecil Avenue in west Louisville.\n\nShortly after the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center opened in 1956, one of the big attractions was a 1.8-mile, asphalt sports car racetrack around the perimeter \u2014 with nine \u201ctreacherous\u201d turns.\n\nThe first races at the track capped off the Kentucky Derby Festival on May 5, 1957, showcasing \u201ctesty little sports cars\u201d that included Volkswagens, Ferraris, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, Mercedes, Jaguars and the winner, a Porsche Spyder, a Courier-Journal story said.\n\nThe event attracted 110 cars and was sponsored by the Kentucky Region Sports Car Club of America and the Advertising Club of Louisville.\n\nDormitories were set up at the Fairgrounds to house some racing visitors.\n\n1960s \u2018Bug\u2019 races\n\nIn 1960, 23-year-old race car driver Roger Penske of Richmond, Va. \u2014 heard of him? \u2014 took third place in his Porsche RSK in the fourth annual Whirlaway Cup, the featured race of National Road Races.\n\nThe winner was Robert Holbert, an auto dealer from suburban Philadelphia, in a $10,000 Porsche RS60.\n\nA photo page on the race titled \u201cThe \u2018Bug\u2019 Races\u201d \u2014 referring to the small size of the cars \u2014 said winning speeds averaged more than 70 mph.\n\nThe day\u2019s \u201cmost freakish occurrence\u201d happened when Dalton, Pa., driver Tim Mayer\u2019s Lotus 400 \u201cbolted off the course and came to a stop in one of the stalls of a horse show barn,\u201d a Louisville Times story said. Mayer suffered only minor injuries.\n\nThe crowd was estimated at 6,000, and profits were to go to the Kiwanis Club\u2019s fund for underprivileged children.\n\nHurricane Bay vs. Fairgrounds lake\n\nWhile under construction in 1955, the $15.4 million complex was expected to become \u201cthe most up-to-date fairgrounds and sports center in the nation,\u201d a C-J story said.\n\nThe same story contained a tantalizing reference to what might have been at the site: \u201cThere has been some discussion of a 5-acre lake for fishing or swimming.\u201d\n\nThe \u201chub\u201d of the complex was the spacious Fairgrounds Coliseum \u2014 soon to be named Freedom Hall \u2014 which would accommodate basketball, horse shows, boxing, ice shows, large variety shows, circuses, hockey and wrestling.\n\nOld Fairgrounds\n\nThe state General Assembly authorized a Kentucky State Fair in 1902, and the first one, held at Churchill Downs, drew about 75,000 people, the Encyclopedia of Louisville says. Lexington and Owensboro also were early sites.\n\nBut in 1907 the state bought 150 acres at the end of Cecil Avenue, west of 38th Street in western Louisville, and the fair was held there in 1908, using a new livestock pavilion that was the largest in the state.\n\nA Merchants and Manufacturers Building that opened in 1921 was touted as being larger than Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nIn 1956, when the new fairgrounds opened, the old fairgrounds site became Miles Park, a thoroughbred racetrack.\n\nAn existing racetrack had been enlarged at the site, after previously being used for harness racing. Called the Fairgrounds Speedway Trotting Track, it was owned by J. Fred Miles, an Ashland Oil Co. founder.\n\nMiles Park was sold and operated briefly as Commonwealth Race Course, before being bought in 1975 by Whayne Supply Co., a century-old heavy equipment vendor that operates there today.\n\nReporter Martha Elson can be reached at (502) 582-7061, melson@courier-journal.com and on Facebook.
