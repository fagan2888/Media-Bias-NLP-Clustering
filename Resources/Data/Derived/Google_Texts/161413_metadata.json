The Alliance is the coordinating organization of the 30-county area that is bordered by Tennessee, Alabama, Highway 82 and Interstate 55.\n\nThe Mississippi Hills is one of only 49 National Heritage Areas in the U.S., and one of three in the state.\n\nWilliams is the voice and face of the Alliance, with a goal to visit every community inside the Mississippi Hills footprint, to find out more about them and to see what the Alliance can do for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d she said. \u201cEven tough we\u2019re based in Tupelo, we cover all or part of 30 counties. \u2026 I\u2019m setting up downtown tours, cultural heritage area tours \u2026 and what I\u2019ve found is that so many people want to tell their stories. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re here to give them another outlet to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Mississippi Hill Heritage Alliance wasn\u2019t created to compete with or replace communities\u2019 convention and visitors bureaus. Rather, it was designed to serve as a clearinghouse of information and to complement their efforts. And in the case of smaller communities that may not have resources to have a full-time CVB, the Alliance can in many ways help them get their messages out to visitors and tourists.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to listen and see what we can do to benefit them and help the entire region,\u201d Williams said.\n\nEvery community has its own sense of pride and identity, but many don\u2019t know how or have the resources to share with others.\n\nThe Mississippi Hills National Heritage Area Alliance was created as a \u201ccooperative and collaborative National Heritage Area that promotes heritage and cultural tourism,\u201d Williams said.\n\nCultural and heritage tourism is a growing segment, and it is a lucrative one communities across the country are trying to tap into.\n\nAccording to Williams, \u201c78 percent of leisure travelers participate in cultural and heritage activities and these travelers spend more, stay longer and are more likely to take part in local activities \u2013 this is a growth market.\u201d\n\nAnd those leisure travelers are looking for places to visit. Larger communities with full-time staff can target those travelers far easier than smaller communities, which makes the grants even more important for them.\n\nThe grants naturally have garnered much interest from communities. For this year, $150,000 is available, but grant requests totaled more than $158,000.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get more dues-paying members to join the Alliance.\n\nWilliams and other tourism officials call it leveraging \u2013 combining federal funding with state and local funding to increase the pool of grant money available.\n\n\u201cThe membership dues are leveraged to produce maximum return on your investment by helping to match all federal funding made available,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFrom a community and economic development standpoint, National Heritage Areas leverage federal funds an average of $5.50 for every $1 of federal investment to create jobs, generate local revenue, and sustain local communities through revitalization and heritage tourism.\u201d\n\nWilliams wants the Hills to have its own strong identity, much like the Mississippi Delta and the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u201cWe need everyone\u2019s input to help with our branding efforts and to highlight our cultural assets,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Mississippi Hills National Heritage Alliance\u2019s goal is to create a sense of place and identity for our region, make sure our stories get told, and show visitors all the wonderful things we have to offer \u2013 art galleries, Elvis\u2019 birthplace, Rowan Oak, MSU\u2019s Mitchell Memorial Library which hosts the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library, Tishomingo State Park, Brice\u2019s Cross Roads \u2013 the list goes on and on. I think North Mississippi is the best kept secret, and I look forward to working with everyone to tell our stories.\u201d\n\nCivil rights, Civil War, Native American history and musical and cultural icons are the four main areas of emphasis the Alliance seeks to highlight, and the grant applications must fall within those categories. The grants are broken down into three grant categories, ranging from $1,000 to $25,000, with the larger amounts available to dues-paying members.\n\nThe grant winners will be announced March 15.\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Mary Cates Williams soon will award thousands of dollars in grants to communities in the Mississippi Hills National Heritage Area to help them tell their stories.
