A man accused of stalking his ex-girlfriend, damaging her vehicle and posting pictures of her on the internet to harass her has been charged.

The charges allege that Michael Clasen, 25, began stalking a 19-year-old woman during the last week of June after she broke up with him. They further allege that he damaged vehicles belonging to the woman and her mother and on July 1, posted intimate photos of the woman online, according to a news release by the Denver District Attorney.

Clasen is believed to be the first person charged with harassment under Colorado’s new “revenge porn” law, which went into effect on July 1.

In the past, posting images on the internet for revenge would be prosecuted as class-3 misdemeanor harassment, with penalties ranging from a minimum $50 fine to a maximum six months in jail and a $750 fine.

But under the new law, the violation is a class-1 misdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 18 months in jail and a $10,000 fine.

Clasen was arrested on Sunday and is being held at Denver Detention Center with his bond set at $50,000.

Clasen is scheduled to appear in court on Friday to be formally advised of the charges.
