DENVER -- "The Fisher King" was one of Robin Williams' many amazing film performances. On Saturday, a Williams movie marathon at the Alamo Drafthouse in Littleton will be held.

Three films -- "The Fisher King," "Popeye" and "One Hour Photo" -- will be shown. All proceeds from these screenings will go to the University of Colorado Depression Center.
