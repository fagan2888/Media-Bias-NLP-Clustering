Westar Energy crews have restored electricity following a large power outage Thursday morning in northwest Wichita.

The outage originally impacted more than 2,500 customers in the area of 29th Street and Ridge Road. By 3:30 p.m. there were no outages reported in that area.

Westar said a fire in an underground section of equipment caused the outage.
