The town hall was Kasich's 94th New Hampshire event. (John Tully for the Washington Post)\n\nJohn Kasich arrives at campaign events with a large electronic sign that ticks off the increasing national debt in milliseconds.\n\nHe does not care for the overtly religious tone of some of his Republican presidential rivals, saying that he does not want to combine God and politics, because \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable doing it.\u201d\n\nAnd while most of his rivals hurl insults at one another, Kasich repeatedly refuses to directly attack.\n\nIn a GOP presidential campaign dominated by anger over illegal immigration, distrust of establishment leaders, and aggressive courtship of evangelicals, the Ohio governor is trying to turn Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary into a test of whether his party has room for a throwback brand of Republicanism.\n\nMore than any of his GOP rivals, Kasich has bet everything on a strong finish here. He opted not to compete in the Iowa caucuses, which were heavily influenced by religious conservatives, and tells New Hampshire voters that he will drop out if he does poorly here.\n\nJohn Kasich, who has bet everything on Tuesday\u2019s primary in New Hampshire, addresses voters at an event at the Raymond VFW post. (John Tully for the Washington Post)\n\nAs he travels the state, Kasich is emphasizing fiscal policy and other issues that have long been important to Republicans but have not animated the party base in recent elections.\n\nHe boasts his centrist credentials, embracing his decision in Ohio to accept more Medicaid funds as part of President Obama\u2019s health-care law.\n\n[How Republican John Kasich spurned the party line on part of Obamacare]\n\n\u201cI guess sometimes when you talk about caring for people, sometimes it is not a tone we\u2019ve heard in the Republican Party for quite a while,\u201d he said in an interview with The Washington Post on his campaign bus.\n\nKasich\u2019s approach is an echo of what George W. Bush once called \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d with the Ohio governor arguing that the party cannot foment only anger and resentment.\n\nThe governor\u2019s style was apparent this week during an appearance at a VFW hall, when a questioner all but invited him to attack Donald Trump by inquiring about the Republican presidential front-runner\u2019s treatment of people with disabilities.\n\nKasich declined the opportunity. Then Kasich choked up, on the verge of tears. He motioned for the questioner to stand, reaching out his arms and embracing her in an unexpected hug. He struggled to regain his voice.\n\nThe battle continues in New Hampshire as candidates fight tooth and nail to take home the state. The Post\u2019s David Weigel walks through what it will take to win the New Hampshire primary. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nAsked later what prompted his emotional moment, Kasich said he was thinking about children with disabilities who need extra care, an issue he said he has seen firsthand many times as governor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to run over the weak,\u201d he said at a town-hall meeting in Durham. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\n\nKasich is convinced that he has struck political gold by carving out a niche in the crowded GOP field. Trump has drawn large crowds to his rallies, bashing rivals. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is seeking to capitalize on his Iowa caucus victory, leaning heavily on evangelical support. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are fighting for the GOP establishment vote.\n\nKasich likes to say he is in his \u201cown lane.\u201d Asked in the interview what that means, he said he is an \u201cinside-outside\u201d player. Although Kasich has been a House Budget Committee chairman and is a governor, he said in the interview that \u201cI\u2019ve never been in the establishment. I\u2019m not anti-establishment, but I can work with the establishment.\u201d He boasts of collaborating with liberal Democrats to pass legislation. He says he believes humans contribute to global warming. He is in favor of government support for those with disabilities.\n\nKasich summed up his view this way: \u201cIt is a twist and turn and a different definition of what is conservative and what it means to be a Republican.\u201d\n\nHe boasts of endorsements from the Boston Globe, the New York Times and a number of New Hampshire newspapers, rejecting suggestions that support from left-leaning and moderate editorialists could backfire. He cites polls that show him in second place, or statistically tied for that standing, behind Trump.\n\nAn average of recent New Hampshire polls, as analyzed by The Post, found that Trump leads with 35 percent, followed by three candidates who are statistically tied because of the margin of error: Cruz at 12 percent, Rubio at 11 percent and Kasich with 10 percent.\n\nAs he travels the state, Kasich shows allegiance to a classic New Hampshire strategy of interacting with smaller audiences. His stop at the VFW post on Wednesday was his 94th town-hall meeting in the state.\n\nHe is a happy wonk on the hustings, traveling with a handful of aides in a campaign bus fit for a rock star and stocked with plenty of snacks. Wearing a Kasich-themed fleece, he walks up to voters like a talk-show host and leans close to them when they ask questions. He veers between preachiness and corny jokes.\n\nWherever he goes, Kasich often seems to feel as though he is being goaded into attacking his opponents.\n\nAt a Wednesday breakfast with reporters, he was given the perfect opportunity to \u201cwin the morning,\u201d as the saying goes. Television cameras rolled at an event sponsored by Bloomberg Politics as he was pressed to go after his opponents. Reporters pounced when he said that \u201cI don\u2019t go out and try to win a vote by using God. I think that cheapens God.\u201d Whom was he talking about? He wouldn\u2019t say.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you figure it out?\u201d Kasich responded. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart guy.\u201d\n\nDid he agree with Christie\u2019s assessment of Rubio as being a boy in a bubble?\n\n\u201cPass.\u201d\n\nStill, Kasich sometimes does try to have it both ways. He lamented that a \u201cdark and negative message is coming from Cruz and Trump. You figure it out. I\u2019m not here to attack other candidates today. I\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m just not doing it.\u201d\n\nNever mind that it sounds as though he may have done just that by casting his opponents as being on the dark side. Moreover, a pro-Kasich super PAC, New Day for America, has attacked opponents such as Trump. That prompted rare attention from the real estate mogul, who tweeted, \u201cI want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don\u2019t want to waste my money.\u201d\n\nKasich, who doesn\u2019t control the super PAC, insists that he is walking on the \u201csunny side,\u201d declaring that \u201cI\u2019m not all that doctrinaire.\u201d\n\nInterviews with voters at his events found that many are drawn to him by the perception that he is a moderate. Fred Hochgraf, 83, a retiree from Durham, described himself as a moderate \u201cRockefeller Republican\u201d but said the party had walked away from him long ago. \u201cThis is the first breath of fresh air I\u2019ve had,\u201d he said after listening to Kasich. Similarly, Darlene Graczyk, a retiree from Atkinson, said she is \u201cdefinitely moderate\u201d and is considering voting for Kasich.\n\nKasich is betting his campaign on a strong showing in New Hampshire, which has a much smaller percentage of evangelicals than Iowa does and has a history supporting independent-minded candidates.\n\nIf he is \u201ctrounced\u201d here, Kasich said in the interview, he will head with no regrets back to Ohio, where he does, after all, have a job as governor and a family that includes 16-year-old twin daughters. So, he is asked, what is the definition of trounced?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all know if I\u2019m trounced,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s at the bottom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "kasich, john kasich, trump, new hampshire 2016, new hampshire GOP, new hampshire primary", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Ohio governor, saying he fills his \u201cown lane,\u201d will drop his White House bid if he is \u201ctrounced\u201d in Tuesday\u2019s primary.", "title": "Kasich lays off attack politics, lays it all on the line in New Hampshire", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kasich-sells-gop-something-different-in-new-hampshire/2016/02/04/9e95cfc8-cab3-11e5-88ff-e2d1b4289c2f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/03/Others/Images/2016-02-03/KASICH-20160203-Tully-0021454531826.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PostKranish"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kasich-sells-gop-something-different-in-new-hampshire/2016/02/04/9e95cfc8-cab3-11e5-88ff-e2d1b4289c2f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "kasich, john kasich, trump, new hampshire 2016, new hampshire GOP, new hampshire primary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9e95cfc8-cab3-11e5-88ff-e2d1b4289c2f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The Ohio governor, saying he fills his \u201cown lane,\u201d will drop his White House bid if he is \u201ctrounced\u201d in Tuesday\u2019s primary."}, "article_summary": "John Kasich, who has bet everything on Tuesday\u2019s primary in New Hampshire, addresses voters at an event at the Raymond VFW post.\nRepublican presidential candidate John Kasich exits his bus outside a VFW post in Raymond, N.H, on Wednesday.\nAs he travels the state, Kasich shows allegiance to a classic New Hampshire strategy of interacting with smaller audiences.\nSimilarly, Darlene Graczyk, a retiree from Atkinson, said she is \u201cdefinitely moderate\u201d and is considering voting for Kasich.\nThe battle continues in New Hampshire as candidates fight tooth and nail to take home the state."}
