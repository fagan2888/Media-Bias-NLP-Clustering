Washington politicians and bureaucrats believe they know better than us, and can tell us how to run our lives, from what health care each of us can have, to trying to dictate what every child in every school must learn,\u201d Mr. Pataki said.\n\nOn paper, Mr. Pataki is a strong candidate. He was able to defeat the late Mario Cuomo, a popular Democratic governor who was seeking a fourth term, and run a left-leaning state as a Republican for three terms. He\u2019s a moderate who\u2019s appealed to both sides of the aisle before. He ran New York but is from upstate, growing up on a farm. Both his sons served overseas in the armed forces. And yet, Mr. Pataki is considered among the longest of the long-shots in a crowded GOP field.\n\nGOP operative Rick Wilson recently told the Washington Post that Mr. Pataki winning would be \u201clike a monkey flying out of a unicorn\u2019s [posterior].\u201d\n\nIt may simply be that Mr. Pataki is not well-known. His big upset over the late Mr. Cuomo was more than 20 years ago. When most Americans think of an executive who presided over September 11, they remember Rudolph Giuliani, who made the experience a centerpiece of his own ill-fated bid for president. Mr. Pataki hasn\u2019t held political office since his term ended in January of 2007, though he\u2019s flirting with running for president twice.\n\nAmong big achievements of his days in New York, Mr. Pataki today pointed to reducing the size of state government, as opposed to big projects or moments people are likely to remember.\n\n\u201cIn 12 years New York went from a State with the highest tax burden, the lowest credit rating, and billions of dollars in deficits, to a State with $143 billion in lower taxes, billions in surplus, and its highest credit rating in generations,\u201d Mr. Pataki said today. \u201cAll it took was for me to get government out of the people\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Mr. Pataki said he\u2019d like to do in Washington\u2014promising to \u201cshrink the size of the federal work force,\u201d starting by giving pink slips to employees overseeing the Affordable Care Act and by firing \u201ccorrupt\u201d IRS employees.\n\nMr. Pataki also vowed today to ban former members of Congress from \u201cever lobbying,\u201d and to repeal Obamacare and end Common Core.\n\nOn foreign policy, Mr. Pataki spoke of his September 11 experience and has been more of a hawk than some hoping to earn his party\u2019s nomination. He vowed to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon and to provide \u201cwhatever aid necessary\u201d to those fighting ISIS.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, if necessary American force will be used to actually defeat and destroy ISIS, so they can pose no threat to us here,\u201d Mr. Pataki said. \u201cWe will not spend a trillion dollars or a decade nation building overseas. But, I will never forget the lesson of September 11th. We will destroy radical Islam\u2019s ability to attack us over there, before they have the chance to attack us here. \u201d\n\nThe former governor launched his bid from a historic town hall in Exeter, N.H.
