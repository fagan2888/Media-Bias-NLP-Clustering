It also launched a \u201cLatino Week of Action\u201d that targets the demographic for health care enrollment.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi insisted Thursday that Democrats are focused on American priorities and will be able to vanquish whoever Republicans choose as their nominee for president this year.\n\n\u201cWhoever they choose, we will be ready to make the contrast. Because it\u2019s not just about personalities, although that counts in a presidential,\u201d the California Democrat said at her weekly press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s about policy. And it\u2019s about how the American people identify with someone who identifies with their aspirations, who understand them, who knows them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday his chamber will be \"going on offense on ideas\" in 2016, offering voters a clear idea of what a Republican Congress could do with an ally in the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday his chamber will be \u201cgoing on offense on ideas\u201d in 2016, offering voters a clear idea of what a Republican Congress could do with an ally in the White House.", "title": "Paul Ryan says House will go \u2018on offense\u2019 in 2016", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/7/paul-ryan-says-house-will-go-offense-2016/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/07/Congress_Health_Repeal.JPEG-0cbbe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/07/Congress_Health_Repeal.JPEG-0cbbe.jpg", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday his chamber will be \"going on offense on ideas\" in 2016, offering voters a clear idea of what a Republican Congress could do with an ally in the White House.", "card": "summary", "title": "Paul Ryan says House will go \u2018on offense\u2019 in 2016"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday his chamber will be \u201cgoing on offense on ideas\u201d in 2016, offering voters a clear idea of what a Republican Congress could do with an ally in the White House.\nThat effort began this week with passage of the first Obamacare repeal bill to reach President Obama\u2019s desk, he said.\nAnd it\u2019s about how the American people identify with someone who identifies with their aspirations, who understand them, who knows them.\u201d\nBecause it\u2019s not just about personalities, although that counts in a presidential,\u201d the California Democrat said at her weekly press conference.\nIt also launched a \u201cLatino Week of Action\u201d that targets the demographic for health care enrollment."}
