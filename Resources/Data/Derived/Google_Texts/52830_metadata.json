Varney asked Leonard if the advertisements made him more likely to sign onto the exchanges.\n\n\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s gotten so much more expensive to get healthcare,\u201d he responded. \u201cIf you look at the plan they\u2019re really pushing for us \u2014 the catastrophic plan \u2014 even if it\u2019s free, we still have the $6,000 deductible to meet, so it really doesn\u2019t change the situation for any of us unless we get cancer or something crazy that puts us in a debt with a $20,000 medical bill.\u201d He later added that he\u2019s going from \u201csuch an inexpensive, decent plan to going to just a crazy, expensive plan that doesn\u2019t really meet my needs.\u201d\n\nWhalen ridiculed the White House\u2019s most recent ad, which features a hipster-looking young man in his PJs cradling a cup of cocoa. \u201cI saw that ad last night, the \u2018Pajama Boy\u2019 ad, and I laughed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd everyone I know laughed at it, and really proceeded to mock it.\u201d\n\nHow do you plan to spend the cold days of December? http://t.co/Rwf5AYc3bG #GetTalking pic.twitter.com/PBQ397yLf4 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 17, 2013\n\n\u201cWhat Andrew\u2019s going through is exactly what we\u2019re talking about at Generation Opportunity with our \u2018Opt Out of Obamacare\u2019 campaign,\u201d she added. \u201cMy peers are facing higher cost, less options under Obamacare. But what we want people to know is that there are options outside of the expensive Obamacare exchange that they can look into.\u201d\n\nObamacare will not survive without millions of young, healthy people subsidizing older, sicker individuals on the exchanges. Whalen said her organization is focused on what\u2019s best for young people, not on what\u2019s best for Obamacare. \u201cObamacare is actually a really bad deal for young people,\u201d she claimed. \u201cAt the end of the day, young people should do what\u2019s best for them.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama also met a group of mothers at the White House Wednesday, trying to convince them to urge their children to sign up for Obamacare. \u201cWell, you know, as much respect as I have for my mother, she doesn\u2019t tell me how to live my life,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI haven\u2019t lived under her rules for years now. She can give me some advice but, really, it\u2019s not going to help me make my decision.\n\n\u201cI imagine most of my peers are in the same situation,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe\u2019re adults, we\u2019re not children.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\n\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
