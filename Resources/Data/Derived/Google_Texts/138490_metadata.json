President Obama made celebratory remarks about the growing numbers.\n\nBeck's response on his Wednesday radio show was a rant in which he called Obama \"a full-fledged dictator\" without the military uniform, and members of the media \"rat bastards\" for covering the president's speech. As Salon reported, the radio host also said that if Obama were to wear a uniform, it would be one he designed himself.\n\nYelling in his microphone, Beck proceeded to invoke the Declaration of Independence:\n\nI\u2019m not going to waste. My. Life. I\u2019m going to do what I was born to do! All men were created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these are life, liberty AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS! I have a right to pursue my happiness! I have a right to do what I was born to do, not what they tell me what to do.
