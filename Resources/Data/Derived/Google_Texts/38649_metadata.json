It is a physician who writes the prescription. Patients do not go to the pharmacy and order the medication.\n\nAn endocrinologist should know to say, \u201cThat new diabetes pill is O.K. but costs $600 a month, and a number of generics do about the same job.\u201d A podiatrist should say, \u201cThose drops to put on your toenail fungus cost $400 a month and cure less than 20 percent, while a generic toenail polish has about the same results and costs $10 a month.\u201d\n\nPhysicians are too often obtuse about the cost of what they are prescribing, especially since they just had a nice dinner at the best local restaurant courtesy of the very same drug company, or they don\u2019t want to spend time defending the equal benefits of the generic.\n\nPatients may not like their TV-induced knowledge being questioned, and physicians may have to learn a little more and defend their actions with a brief talk (and even a reference to Internet use for more information). Physicians are not practicing good medicine if they cannot deal with misinformation in pharmaceutical advertising.\n\nLONNIE HANAUER\n\nWest Orange, N.J.\n\nThe writer is a rheumatologist.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nElisabeth Rosenthal raises important questions about advertising by private hospitals and drug companies and the mass manipulation of patients. All these should be rightly placed in their proper arena, as growing public health concerns. The mix of greed and the facade of medical legitimacy have congealed in the form of avaricious health care advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn our political climate, as Republicans promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and as Democrats debate the merits of a single-payer system versus an expanded version of Obamacare, it is discomforting to see that Big Pharma is keeping its watchful eye on the proverbial ball: manipulate public opinion, misinform patients about alternatives, drive up prices and privatize well-being through fear.\n\nIt\u2019s been a winning formula so far. How about just being honest with people about options in their most vulnerable of times, when they are ill?\n\nTALIA LUSTIGER-THALER\n\nBrooklyn\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nDoes it escape notice that these ads have the same characteristic attributes \u2014 rapidly spoken disclaimers and unreadable fine print \u2014 as used car ads do?\n\nWhy are members of the medical profession not profoundly ashamed that they have allowed this second-rate hucksterism to dominate the media? Money, of course.\n\nMedicine was a profession; now it\u2019s a business. May the new generation coming into medicine lead it back to higher ground.\n\nTHOMAS H. WRIGHT\n\nVieques, P.R.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWe greatly enjoy the drug ads. Amid the chaos and violence of TV, these ads are often lovely visuals of couples walking on the beach, boating on the lake, exploring the village arts fair and other pleasant idylls.\n\nOf course, we have no idea what medication is being touted. Our TV remote control has this \u201cmute button.\u201d We recommend its use for fast relief from chronic A.T.C. (annoying TV commercials).\n\nPerhaps we need more ads urging people to \u201cask your doctor if diet and exercise are right for you.\u201d (Disclaimer: Diet and exercise may not be covered by all insurance plans.)\n\nJAMES HOGG\n\nNew York", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160307032104, "twitter": {"description": "Readers note that expensive options are often not needed.", "title": "Medical Ads Here, There, Everywhere", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/opinion/medical-ads-here-there-everywhere.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004240968"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/07/opinion/07LdocsWeb/07LdocsWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/opinion/medical-ads-here-there-everywhere.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004240968", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/opinion/medical-ads-here-there-everywhere.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Medical Ads Here, There, Everywhere", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 7, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Advertising and Marketing", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/07/opinion/07LdocsWeb/07LdocsWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers note that expensive options are often not needed.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/07/opinion/07LdocsWeb/07LdocsWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Readers note that expensive options are often not needed.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 7, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-03-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Advertising and Marketing", "published": "2016-03-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "07Ldocs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160307032706, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/opinion/medical-ads-here-there-everywhere.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/07/opinion/07LdocsWeb/07LdocsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers note that expensive options are often not needed.", "title": "Medical Ads Here, There, Everywhere"}, "pdate": 20160307, "des": "Advertising and Marketing", "articleid": 100000004240968, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Medical Ads Here, There, Everywhere", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "To the Editor:We greatly enjoy the drug ads.\nTALIA LUSTIGER-THALERBrooklynTo the Editor:Does it escape notice that these ads have the same characteristic attributes \u2014 rapidly spoken disclaimers and unreadable fine print \u2014 as used car ads do?\nWhy are members of the medical profession not profoundly ashamed that they have allowed this second-rate hucksterism to dominate the media?\nThe mix of greed and the facade of medical legitimacy have congealed in the form of avaricious health care advertising campaigns.\nAmid the chaos and violence of TV, these ads are often lovely visuals of couples walking on the beach, boating on the lake, exploring the village arts fair and other pleasant idylls."}
