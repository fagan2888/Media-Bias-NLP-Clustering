However, the occupant was unconscious. He was able to hand over the victim to some officers on shore who immediately performed CPR until rescue arrived,\" said Lt. R. A. Norse.\n\nThe man, identified as Thomas Wester, was transported to Baptist Medical Center, where he died.\n\n\"Over an abundance of caution, we called the dive team to search the water to make sure there was no additional occupants,\" said Norse.\n\nNo additional bodies were found. Police believe Wester was the only person in the minivan when it was fully submerged into the river.\n\n\"It's a a boat ramp and there's three pylons that are on the walkway, and it was between them. I believe it was probably 25 to 35 feet into the water,\" Norse said.\n\nPolice said there is no indication that alcohol was involved.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
