However, here\u2019s what I hate about May \u2013 my company\u2019s health insurance plan comes up for renewal.\n\nI cower when I see the email from our health insurance broker, cheerfully writing to schedule our annual plan review and a discussion of the increase for the coming year. I say increase because we have never seen a decrease in the 10 years of such meetings. Having heard in the media recently that health insurance plans were seeing dramatic price jumps, I didn\u2019t even ask our agent, Bob, what the increase was in advance, because I didn\u2019t want to extend my inevitable agony.\n\nSince our financial services firm\u2019s inception in 2005, we have had a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) plan fully funded by the partnership. Some of us had prior nightmarish experiences with HMOs and we wanted to avoid the gatekeeper process for referrals. Despite switching a couple of times among the few insurers in Massachusetts, we have stayed at the high end of the spectrum; this past year, across our 29 covered lives, that plan cost us $1546 a month per family and $581 per individual.\n\nWhen Bob came to the office to meet with three of us who serve as the unofficial \u201chealth insurance committee,\u201d the first words out of his mouth were, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good.\u201d He then proceeded to tell us the news: a 34.9% price increase! Bob can be a master of understatement. I was expecting bad, but this was insane. All I could say was, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t. He explained that for decades, the financial services industry has enjoyed a relatively low cost of insurance compared with other Massachusetts industries (could have fooled me), since their members and families use far less medical care than some other industries, such as construction and manufacturing, whose premiums were historically greater, reflecting their higher per-capita use. Unbelievably, it turns out that our $18,552 per family per year was really a bargain compared to a moving company! And also under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can no longer discriminate by sector, and companies with less than 50 employees, such as ours, cannot band together to negotiate lower rates.\n\nWe asked Bob what we could do. He mentioned a very similar plan offered by another carrier that would \u201conly\u201d cost 11% more than our current plan. (What\u2019s the inflation rate again?)\n\nWhile this option seemed the clear winner if we wanted to continue to fully underwrite the best package, I wondered if perhaps it was time to rethink our strategy of fully funding employees\u2019 PPO plans. Do employees really value this benefit, and if not, should we consider alternative approaches? Maybe we should start only covering a portion of the plan (as many other employers do) or offering a stipend that could be applied to a few different insurance plans.\n\nTo explore where employees rate their health insurance benefits among other job benefits, I surveyed over 50 people and asked them to simply list the top five aspects of their job in order of preference, without offering any choices so I would not \u201clead the witness.\u201d Because I assumed higher-level executives would be less likely to describe health benefits as a top-five attribute, I surveyed a wide ranging group of workers within different organizational structures, but all were white-collar office workers.\n\nNot one person listed health insurance within their top five. Intellectual challenge was the most cited first choice, with colleagues and salary tied for second place. Several people mentioned the length of their commute or their offices.\n\nI then asked if people liked their health insurance and what percent their employer paid. Everyone said they were pleased with their plan, even though several did not know what percent their company paid. Those who did reported that their companies contributed 75-80% of the premium. Despite the relatively small sample size, it seemed clear that a fully funded health plan was not top-of-mind for people considering their favorite elements of their jobs.\n\nWhat, then, were the options I could offer my colleagues? We could keep the existing plan but not cover the price hike. We could keep it and pay a portion of the increase, requiring employees to contribute the remainder. Or we could switch to another, similar plan and either absorb or share the increase. Discussions with my partners on the subject contained a certain friction, as people are always anxious and suspicious about issues that involve change, money, and trust. I also worried about seeming uncaring and motivated by other concerns than the welfare of our staff.\n\nWe recalled that two years ago, facing an increase in the 20% range, we moved to a plan just below the most expensive offering. The plan we chose then had a $500 deductible for the first surgical procedure. Since the switch would save us many thousands in premiums, we told our staff that the company would cover the deductible for the first surgery within any family. Since then, we have saved close to $30,000 in premiums, while only spending $2,000 in reimbursing deductibles for four surgeries.\n\nSo last month, we decided to pursue a similar approach. We switched to the alternate plan \u2013 the one with the 11% increase per capita \u2014 and we will provide $500 per person toward the $1,000 cumulative family deductible for surgeries, diagnostic tests, or in-patient stays. Next year, depending on the level of price increase, we may look into offering a few options with some employee responsibility, but this market is changing so fast, it\u2019s hard to even imagine the landscape 12 months from now.\n\nBy then, there may be some valuable data from the experience of the Affordable Care Act to help enterprises struggling with these decisions. In the meantime, I will be curious to see if anyone at our company notices that they have an incremental increase of $500 per family deductible.", "article_metadata": {"page-category-name": "Health", "msapplication-config": "none", "viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width", "description": "It required creative problem-solving.", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Business Review", "description": "It required creative problem-solving.", "title": "A Small Firm\u2019s Response to Higher Health Care Costs", "url": "https://hbr.org/2014/06/a-small-firms-response-to-higher-health-care-costs", "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/hbr_opengraph_940x490.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2014/06/20140612_4.jpg", "site": "@harvardbiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvardbiz"}, "ox-group": 537063787, "item-name": "A Small Firm\u2019s Response to Higher Health Care Costs", "page-id": 300, "article-content-type": "Digital Article", "rr-placements": "item_page.articles,item_page.top_right,item_page.bottom,item_page.red_strip,item_page.subscribe_now,item_page.topbar_subscribe,item_page.mag_cover,item_page.subscribe,item_page.article_slider,item_page.exit_popup_slider", "page-category-id": 3982, "shopper-attributes": "state:guest", "sid": "AA7F08B4B8A4284DB0375A0882FB77DE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HBR", "published_time": "2014-06-11T15:00:03Z", "author": "Karen Firestone", "section": "Health", "modified_time": "2014-11-02T01:24:51Z", "tag": "Health"}, "page-type": "ITEM", "item-id": "tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.39921", "uid": "f6cccb69365aa56fae552704b6048205"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda685\"", "article_summary": "However, here\u2019s what I hate about May \u2013 my company\u2019s health insurance plan comes up for renewal.\nSince our financial services firm\u2019s inception in 2005, we have had a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) plan fully funded by the partnership.\nI then asked if people liked their health insurance and what percent their employer paid.\nDespite the relatively small sample size, it seemed clear that a fully funded health plan was not top-of-mind for people considering their favorite elements of their jobs.\nNot one person listed health insurance within their top five."}
