For the first time, health care prices are public.\n\nIt\u2019s a seismic event. Ten years ago, I filed Freedom of Information Act requests to get cost information in Massachusetts\u2014nothing. Occasionally over the years, I\u2019d receive manila envelopes with no return address, or secure .zip files with pricing spreadsheets from one hospital or another.\n\nThen two years ago, Massachusetts passed a law that pushed health insurers and hospitals to start making this once-vigorously guarded information more public. Now as of Oct. 1, Massachusetts is the first state to require that insurers offer real-time prices by provider in consumer-friendly formats.\n\n\u201cThis is a very big deal,\u201d said Undersecretary for Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation Barbara Anthony. \u201cLet the light shine in on health care prices.\u201d\n\nThere are caveats.\n\n1.) Prices are not standard, they vary from one insurer and provider to the next. I shopped for a bone density test. The low price was $16 at Tufts Health Plan, $87 on the Harvard-Pilgrim Health Care site and $190 at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. Why? Insurers negotiate their own rates with physicians and hospitals, and these vary too. Some of the prices include all charges related to your test, others don\u2019t (see No. 2).\n\n2.) Posted prices may or may not include all charges, for example the cost of reading a test or a facility fee. Each insurer is defining \u201cprice\u201d as it sees fit. Read the fine print.\n\n3.) Prices seem to change frequently. The first time I shopped for a bone density test at Blue Cross, the low price was $120. Five days later it had gone up to $190.\n\n4.) There is no standard list of priced tests and procedures. I found the price of an MRI for the upper back through Harvard Pilgrim\u2019s Now iKnow tool. That test is \u201cnot found\u201d through the Blue Cross \u201cFind a Doc\u201d tool.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Price Tags On Health Care?
