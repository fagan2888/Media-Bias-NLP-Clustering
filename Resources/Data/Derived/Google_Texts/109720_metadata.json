But this year, maybe it\u2019s time instead to examine Christmas\u2019s war on Americans. For centuries, the holiday has served as a flashpoint between competing religious ideas. When the Puritans of New England famously made Christmas illegal during their first decades on this side of the Atlantic, it was not because they were killjoys\u2014or at least, not only because they were killjoys. Christmas was an existential threat to orderly society, a shorthand for the spiritual risks they encountered every day in the New World. The era\u2019s leading preacher, Cotton Mather, even continued to rail against the \u201cheathen feast\u201d after the laws prohibiting Christmas were repealed. \u201cCan you in your Conscience think, that our Holy Savior is honoured,\u201d he wrote, \u201cby Mad Mirth, by long Eating, by hard Drinking, by lewd Gaming, by rude Revelling; by a Mass fit for none but a Saturn, or a Bacchus, or the Night of a Mahometan Ramadam?\u201d Mather\u2019s invocation of a bevy of supposedly infidel enjoyments was not incidental: \u201cThere are Plantations within this Province, which ly in horrid Paganism and Atheism,\u201d Mather wrote. This tension between doctrinal discouragement of the holiday and its stubborn persistence underscored just how shaky the hold of Calvinist theocracy was on these precarious outposts chinked from the wilderness.\n\nMeanwhile, inside their own households, the Puritans tried hard to convert their slaves, who had been torn from their homelands but who rarely left their beliefs behind. Mather himself had an African-born servant living in close quarters with his family, but try as he might, Mather was never able to convert him. Perhaps if Mather had embraced the joys of a heathen Christmas, he would have been more successful. For, as the Puritan influence waned, the holiday gained ground. Had Mather lived longer, he would have found that the most powerful tool in the transformation of the beliefs of the enslaved may have been Christmas itself. Efforts increased to Christianize the non-Christian population upon whose labor the season\u2019s leisure depended. During a period of enforced joviality\u2014described without irony in 1860 as \u201cthat great time of freedom from restraint among our slaves\u201d\u2014the very holiday vices Mather bemoaned became mandatory. \u201cThe slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord,\u201d the former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass recalled, \u201cbut will adopt various plans to make him drunk.\u201d If there is a war on Christmas, then Christmas is winning it. For those slaves who didn\u2019t take to conversion, Christmas proved essential to the suppression of their own long-held beliefs, including Islam, Yoruba, and a variety of other African traditions. Before the Civil War, slave owners safeguarded their sense of control by imposing Christian traditions on slaves. Unsurprisingly, this did not always have the intended religious effects. During visits to plantations in the 1830s that led him to write The Religious Instruction of Negroes in the United States, the missionary Charles Colock Jones noticed that those who were aware of the Gospel story often came to their own conclusions about its significance. Many of the enslaved, Jones noted, \u201chave been known to accommodate Christianity to Mohammedanism. God, say they, is Allah, and Jesus Christ is Mohammed\u2014the religion is the same, but different countries have different names.\u201d Still, the insinuation of Christmas was moving forward apace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The persistence and power of the December holiday over generations of Americans\u2014whether they liked it or not", "author": "Peter Manseau", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The persistence and power of the December holiday over generations of Americans\u2014whether they liked it or not", "title": "How Christmas Made America", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/AP_428182809778/facebook.jpg?1450961161", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/war-on-christmas-history-immigrants/421863/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27cf\"", "article_summary": "Before the Civil War, slave owners safeguarded their sense of control by imposing Christian traditions on slaves.\nBut this year, maybe it\u2019s time instead to examine Christmas\u2019s war on Americans.\nThe era\u2019s leading preacher, Cotton Mather, even continued to rail against the \u201cheathen feast\u201d after the laws prohibiting Christmas were repealed.\nChristmas was an existential threat to orderly society, a shorthand for the spiritual risks they encountered every day in the New World.\nFor centuries, the holiday has served as a flashpoint between competing religious ideas."}
