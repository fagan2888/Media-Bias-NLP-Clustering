This is an opportunity for us to intervene by offering alternatives.\"\n\nAround Boulder, groups are hosting events centering on Ki Aikido, a defensive martial art focused on peaceful ways of dealing with adversity, conflict and aggression.\n\nMerlyn Holmes, communications coordinator for CU's Graduate School, will help lead the Ki Aikido workshop at CU on Friday.\n\nShe said the one-day event gives people a way to talk and think about a negative topic in a positive and constructive way.\n\n\"The minute you mention the movement to end violence against women and girls, you kind of see people pale and take a step back,\" she said. \"This gives them a way where they can do work in this area, without just being totally depressed and pulling a blanket over their head. The minute you talk about doing a flash mob or a read-in to end violence and these other programs, something about it gives people ways of taking baby steps that they may need in order to get closer to this very serious issue.\"\n\nLast week, Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum signed a declaration showing the city's support of the One Billion Rising campaign and day of events.\n\nCarmen Atilano, Boulder community relations and human rights manager, said the One Billion Rising campaign fits into the city's long-standing goal of being welcoming to everyone.\n\nShe said the city is glad for a chance to collaborate with other groups on a cause such as ending violence.\n\n\"There's numerous events happening throughout the year (in Boulder) all within that same scope of inclusiveness and diversity and respect,\" Atilano said. \"It's the joint value of health and safety for every member of our community and also finding new ways to reduce and eliminate violence and disrespectful behaviors.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Sarah Kuta at kutas@dailycamera.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url":
