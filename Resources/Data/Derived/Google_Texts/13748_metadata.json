However it had probably been here for decades, and now hope is fading for eradication.\n\n\u201cNinety-nine percent of the ashes in North America are probably going to die,\u201d U.S. Forest Service research entomologist Andrew M. Liebhold told the newspaper.\n\nThe danger changes among the four ash tree species, with black ash and green ash the worst off, and blue and white ash faring a bit better\u2014the borers kill 60 to 70 percent of blue ash trees and slightly more among white ash, The New York Times reported, citing Forest Service research ecologist Kathleen Knight. Before the scourge, there were eight billion trees.\n\n\"Still, the losses are bound to have severe consequences,\" the newspaper said. \"When ash trees die, they leave gaps in the leaf canopy that allow sunlight to reach parts of the forest floor that were previously shaded. Dr. Knight, of the Forest Service, has found that those gaps provide an opportunity for invasive honeysuckle bushes to grow unchecked.\"\n\nThis creates dense shrubbery on the forest floor.\n\n\u201cIn the worst-case scenario, it becomes a dense, impenetrable thicket of shrubs in the understory,\u201d Knight told The Times.\n\nThe beetles\u2019 proliferation is especially troubling to the St. Regis Mohawk, who rely on the black ash tree for their livelihood in making baskets and other products. Known for its basketry and other artisan work that is derived from the black ash\u2019s bark and wood, the tribe in 2011 received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEH) to both help combat the insect and preserve records of the basket-making craft.\n\nThe trees\u2019 bark is the substance of baskets whose sales help sustain the tribe, and the wood is used to make other objects whose workmanship is fine enough to have earned it spots in museums and collections, including the Smithsonian.\n\nRELATED: St. Regis Mohawks Battle Emerald Ash Borer\n\nSeveral regions have joined forces to try and hold the invasion in check.
