The company prides itself on its easy-to-navigate website, www.hioscar.com. Something ailing you but have no time to wait for an appointment? Stand by for a call from an MD for a \u201ctele-visit.\u201d Can\u2019t remember what you were prescribed the last time you had a sinus infection? Login to your account at HiOscar.com and see your medical \u201ctimeline.\"\n\nOscar wants to be the search engine for health care consumers \u2013 the place its members start with to manage their health, and to find a doctor and compare prices said co-founder Mario Schlosser, a computer scientist who has worked in the gaming industry.\n\n\u201cIf we can build tools that teach people how to manage their health in smart ways, that are engaging and easy to use, we will do something that hasn\u2019t been in the healthcare system before,\u201d Schlosser said from his Manhattan office.\n\nOscar\u2019s 30-plus reviews on Yelp, the go-to consumer site for the digital generation, are decidedly mixed. Fans praise the customer service and online tools; critics bemoan the lack of physicians and the sticker shock when they realize what isn\u2019t covered.\n\nJoel Cantor, director of the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, said \u201cnarrow\u201d physician networks are a fact of life in any plan sold on the exchange. Only one of the five companies selling on New Jersey\u2019s exchange, AmeriHealth, even offers an out-of-network option, he said.\n\n\u201cAll of the things you hear about Oscar you can fill in the blanks with most other plans in most other states,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cIt\u2019s their way of keeping the costs in check. And there are only so many tools available for doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh out-of-pocket cost sharing is a long-term trend, and the reason it is making news now is because more people are looking at coverage,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s a trend that is here to stay.\u201d\n\nComputer scientist, Harvard Business School grad and one of Oscar\u2019s three co-founders, Schlosser describes the company\u2019s philosophy, its inaugural year in New York and what New Jersey consumers can expect should they choose his company when open enrollment on the health exchange \u2014 healthcare.gov \u2014 begins Nov. 15. The company also has its own website and will offer coverage to all N.J. consumers.\n\nQ: How did your first year go?\n\nA: I think it\u2019s going incredibly well. We have about 17,000 consumers in New York. We were an unknown insurance company when we opened last Oct 1...Over time, we have built up much trust with members, so much so that at the end of open enrollment we were grabbing about a 10 percent share of the new people coming into the markets in New York City. Moreover, when we asked people how they heard about us, 40 percent said I heard about you from a friend or a family member. I think we take this as words of comfort that we are doing something right.\n\nOur projections were 7,500 (members). So we came out at 15,000 at the end of open enrollment and now we are at 17,000, so we have had a little bit of growth there. We can\u2019t wait for open enrollment to open again in New York and now New Jersey.\n\nQ: How have you laid the groundwork for coming to New Jersey? Who will provide the health care?\n\nA: We decided to go with QualCare. They have a fantastic network \u2014 24,000 providers overall, 100 facilities overall, with 69 hospitals, mental health facilities and substance abuse clinics across the state. We are also talking to various physician practices and accountable care organizations.\n\nWe have staff in-house, nurses and MDs, who can help members find providers for certain complicated conditions, getting second opinions from other providers, and developing a care plan\u2026Ideally, we like to link that back to the providers on the ground, with the hospitals and the physicians in the state, so we are talking to organizations in New Jersey to actually make that happen in a more efficient way.\n\nQ: People can call Oscar and speak with a physician or a nurse?\n\nA: They can speak with a nurse. With a physician, generally we like to connect them back with their physician to treat them directly where they are.\n\nWe are the first insurance company to build tele-visits into the plan. If you have an issue where the physician can help you over the phone. Generally it is for a lot of the little stuff you go to the primary care physician for \u2014 the flu for example, common colds, stomach pain.\n\nOver the phone is completely free for Oscar members; there is no limit on that. It\u2019s a virtual lifesaver for our family. My wife freaks out when the kids eat something strange.\n\nQ: Do tele-visits save money?\n\nA: Yeah, but we don\u2019t look at anything as just saving costs. That would be very short sighted. In the short term as the insurer, you may think it may save some money here but in most cases in will come back because you may not have solved the person\u2019s issue. Generally we say, whatever we do, does it contribute to a quality outcome? Does it contribute to (containing) the overall cost of are? And does it contribute to member happiness and satisfaction? All three of them are equally important\u2026If members don\u2019t agree with the guidance, you will have problems with compliance.\n\nSusan K. Livio may be reached at slivio@njadvancemedia.com.
