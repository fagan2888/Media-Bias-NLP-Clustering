He dishes to The Daily Beast about Hillary, Aaron Schock, outing himself, and more.\n\nBarney Frank has a new memoir, Frank: A Life in Politics From the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage. In the book, which was published this week, he writes about his 40-year career in politics and the societal changes that allowed him to survive and eventually thrive as a gay man.\n\nEleanor Clift interviewed him in Washington this week. He spoke candidly about Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in the 2016 presidential race, the resignation of Representative Aaron Schock over ethics charges and amid rumors that he is gay, and reflected on the sex scandal that resulted in Congress reprimanding him in 1987, killing his chances of ever becoming the first Jewish Speaker of the House.\n\nQ: In your book, you write about the fear of exposure [as a formerly closeted gay man]. We have a current example with Representative Aaron Schock\u2014there seems to be a lot of vitriol against him in the gay community.\n\nA: Here\u2019s the deal, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gay or not, but I admit I did say if he\u2019s not gay he spends an awful lot of time in the gym. I don\u2019t know a lot of straight guys who go to the gym and parade around with their shirts off. Generally gay men do that to attract other men. There is a principle that I take credit for enunciating a long time ago: There is a right to privacy but not a right to hypocrisy. You have every right to privacy but you do not have a right to go into public office or any other office and enforce rules that are against your own behavior. During Prohibition the media would hide the fact that prohibitioners were drinkers. What I would say to people is, if a leading anti-abortionist had an abortion, you\u2019d write about it. If Sarah Brady owned an Uzi, you\u2019d write about it\u2014especially now. Maybe 40 years ago\u2014coming out, what a terrible thing. But there is no justification now if you\u2019re gay punishing other gay people for what you\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t know if he is, but that\u2019s the basis for the anger.\n\nAll the clues you look for in guessing whether someone is gay\u2014press accounts noted he flew his photographer to India, It\u2019s kind of the modern version of the confirmed bachelor.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: Your horror is based on the idea that being gay is so horrible, you can\u2019t mention it. Let\u2019s stop treating gay as though we\u2019re accusing him of being a mass murderer.\n\nWhat\u2019s so odd is, he\u2019s a young man\u2014millenials and gen-exers don\u2019t see any big deal about this.\n\nThe only problem he\u2019s got\u2014if he\u2019s gay\u2014is that in the Republican Party you get punished. Even Jim Kolbe, an honorable guy\u2014Jim retired from Congress at 62 well before he would have wanted to because he had a tough primary fight every year. He\u2019s chairman of an appropriations subcommittee and he\u2019s fighting off primaries where they\u2019re getting 40 percent and more against him. Being an openly gay politician in the Republican Party is still very, very difficult.\n\nSchock fancied himself having a significant political career. He talked about becoming Speaker, running for governor.\n\nWhich makes his indulgence all the weirder.\n\nWhy do you think Shock resigned? Is it the ethical issues?\n\nWell, the money is a part of it. It seems like the whole picture made him look odd, ridiculous. It does look like there was some misspending of public money, and it\u2019s true that once you resign, the ethics committee has no further jurisdiction. So it\u2019s either a criminal prosecution or nothing. He\u2019s now avoided any possibility that he will be reprimanded or censured.\n\nThere\u2019s some analogy to your experience\u2014Tip O\u2019Neill thought you would be the first Jewish Speaker of the House, and you worried for many years about the impact on your political career.\n\nWhen I first thought about politics in 1954, being gay was so universally despised, it was something I was going to have to try to repress. As I went forward, I discovered that repression actually worked and I got into a couple jobs, chief assistant to the mayor and then the legislature. I did make this conscious choice: I won\u2019t be honest. I want very much to be in politics. I\u2019ll have to not act on being gay, I would have to keep it quiet. But I will always be an advocate. I may be a coward, but I will always be a supporter. And because nobody else wanted to do it, I wound up being a primary supporter of the gay rights bill, not something I wanted, but I could not walk away from that.\n\nThen things have moved in this country much more rapidly on gay issues than anybody thought, and it became clear that I could come out and have a very good career. I would have been a Harvard Law School graduate who\u2019d had 10 years in the state legislature, which would have made me as a political gay man pretty high up in the experience thing. So I started coming out to Ann and my other siblings, and other people, and then the Pope said Father Drinan couldn\u2019t be a congressman. So I slammed the door on that, because if I came out I never would have been elected to Congress\u2014and reelected. Once in 1983, I think about coming out, and the next thing that happens, Gary Studds gets into trouble with the page. So Gary\u2019s got to defend that. He\u2019s much more honest. Every other gay man who had gotten in trouble who was a congressman denied it or said, I was too drunk to know what I was doing. I always said, you know what, if you\u2019re too drunk to know what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re not doing anything because you\u2019re too drunk.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

I had met him in 1985 when I was still closeted\u2014that was a function of my still being closeted. When I came out, I said this is not the kind of life I want. He was furious at me and thought of what he could do\u2014he couldn\u2019t do anything because I had outed myself. My problem was, he made up all this weird stuff about the House gym, which the ethics committee repudiated. The ethics committee found that I lied to a probation officer when I said I met him at a party; I met him through a sex ad\u2014and I let him use my car to avoid parking tickets. I think once people knew it was just prostitution\u2014David Vitter of Louisiana survived it, got reelected despite being involved in a prostitution ring.\n\nBut that was men and women.\n\nI understand that, but today the gay part is not any problem at all. In 2012, the year Jim and I got married, when I was still in Congress, a poll in my district gave me a much higher approval rating for being married than for passing a major bill out of the House Financial Services Committee, which I chaired. So I think the fact that it was same sex today would have no impact.\n\nI was with Newsweek and I did an interview with you where you came out, and they put it on the cover, and you were very angry with me. Why did that upset you so much?\n\nBecause it enhanced the importance of it. It was not world-shaking news. It literally blew it out of proportion.\n\nYour belief in working within the system comes through in your book. And your belief that if you\u2019re having too much fun, you\u2019re not helping.\n\nWe\u2019re fighting to repeal the ban against gays in the military, and a lot of the guys who\u2019ve been kicked out, and they\u2019re lined up behind the stage and some photographer is going to take their picture doing a Rockettes-type kick line. What a terrible way to make our point\u2014that these are soldiers\u2014and to stir up prejudice. It just would have been the wrong image. And then there was the comedienne on stage saying wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a First Lady to fuck. Can you imagine if Redd Foxx had said that about Jackie Kennedy, what would have happened to him? Many people in the LGBT movement like to say, we\u2019re like the African Americans, but they were much more disciplined and much more strategic. \u2026 Standing up to your enemies brings in campaign contributions; the test of integrity in politics is when you stand up to your friends.\n\nYou\u2019ve taken on your own community while you\u2019ve been advocating. I think some of the readers of this book will be surprised to learn that you you worked on behalf of DADT (Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell).\n\nI wanted a compromise. Les Aspin tried to sell a better compromise that was better than Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. Colin Powell said, I\u2019ll support it if I can get one other of the Joint Chiefs, and he couldn\u2019t get one, so that did it. I was prepared to take some kind of compromise. The first lawsuits the NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought were not to get rid of segregation, but OK, you say separate but equal, then make it equal. Because they knew that would undermine it.\n\nWhat were the markers along the way that signaled the change in attitudes?\n\nThe big one to me was in 1981 when the District of Columbia repealed its sodomy statute. And at that point either house of Congress could veto a change in the District\u2019s criminal law. The House voted 300 and something to 100 and something to cancel that. Sodomy, private consenting sex, you have to be pretty bigoted to do that. Then there was a series of votes on AIDs-related issues with anti-gay amendments that said basically if you accept any money under this program for research or for care, you must agree that you will not promote homosexuality. We called them the no-promo-homo amendments, and we had to beat those because they would have been terrible, they would have stopped the money from being spent.\n\nAnd those were the first votes we won. This was not some unenforced sodomy statute; this was people\u2019s lives. Because the stakes in the AIDS voting were so high, people gritted their teeth and they voted against anti-gay amendments. That was the first sign that the public was moving.\n\nThe other marker for me was when Tom Kiley and John Marttila did a poll after I came out. It turns out twice as many people thought I would be hurt than were angry themselves, and the people who were angry themselves\u201422 percent\u2014they wouldn\u2019t vote for me no matter what, so I could ignore them.\n\nYou write about how the growing acceptance of the gay community parallels the growing distrust of government. Do they ever intersect, and does one have anything to do with the other?\n\nNo, they really have not. Two groups of white men are left voting Democratic: gays and Jews. God knows what\u2019s going to happen after the Netanyahu thing, what a disaster. On the gay thing, what gays wanted from the government was to be left alone, we wanted the government to enforce that we would not be discriminated against. What white guys want is some active intervention on their behalf economically, which I\u2019m all for, but it\u2019s a different kind of thing.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think Thomas Frank turned out to be wrong. It\u2019s not God, it\u2019s not gays, it is guns a little bit. On abortion, I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s been beaten because they\u2019re pro-choice; there is a friction on some environmental issues, like Keystone, but I think it\u2019s fundamentally that white guys\u2014these are the guys who think Franklin Roosevelt was a great guy, Harry Truman was a great guy, Kennedy, Johnson\u2014why? Because they stood up for the working guy and helped us, and since then the liberals aren\u2019t doing anything and we\u2019re getting pounded. They\u2019re too busy with women and gays and blacks.\n\nThat\u2019s the same challenge Clinton had in \u201992.\n\nClinton, and Carter somewhat. Clinton was the first Democratic president and Obama is the second to take office when those negative economic trends were fully set. From 1945 to 1975, America dominated the world. In the \u201970s, with OPEC, that\u2019s when things start to change, when the rest of the world starts to catch up with us. Thomas Piketty\u2019s book about capitalism talks a lot about l\u2019d\u00e9tente glorieaux\u2014the glorious 30 years\u2014it was just beginning to happen under Carter, but by the time Clinton came to power, the position of the white working middle class had eroded. And they\u2019re angry at that. They\u2019re not angry at government because they think government is inherently bad, but they think government could help if they wanted to. Remember the song from our youth\u2014most young people haven\u2019t heard it\u2014\u201cWinchester Cathedral, you\u2019re letting me down. You didn\u2019t do nothing when my baby left town. You could have done something, you didn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d You could have stopped this erosion, and you didn\u2019t do it.\n\nThe middle-class tax cut was Clinton\u2019s big thing. You were at odds with Clinton\u2019s statement that \u201cthe era of big government is over,\u201d but then you were a strong defender during impeachment. What is the impact on trust in government of their return\u2014Hillary\u2019s return\u2014to power\u2014good, bad, indifferent?\n\nIndifferent. It depends on whether or not she can produce results. What we\u2019re really seeing is a reaction to reality. It\u2019s the economy, stupid. Trust in government among the people we\u2019re talking about will come back once they see government helping them go to college and helping with jobs.\n\nDo you have any confidence Hillary Clinton is going to be able to find this formula, or vision?\n\nI\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m trying to sell it. It begins with a substantial reduction in the military budget. Because if you don\u2019t have the resources, there are things you can do to make people happy, but you need the resources. Legalize drugs and cut the military, and you can expand public construction, and you can provide better child care for working families, and subsidize their health care costs.\n\nIs the core of the trust issue this failure to deliver on substantive issues?\n\nYes, which is why the only way it can be resolved is if we make people happy with what government is doing.\n\nClinton tried to do it with investments in programs; Obama tried to do it with Obamacare.\n\nProblem with Obamacare is this: They were in a situation where there was not enough money to expand health care without finding savings in the system. And the problem both Clinton and Obama faced\u2014and I\u2019m glad you linked them\u2014Clinton raised taxes and put it all into deficit reduction; Obama couldn\u2019t raise taxes at all. They had to expand health care to citizens without it, and the average Joe figured that was coming at his or her expense. That was a problem. If either Clinton or Obama had $50 million to throw into the system, it could have been very popular\u2014we can expand this, and you\u2019re not going to lose anything.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t keep the promise that you can keep your own doctor.\n\nThat made me angry. He never should have said that. They had to know better. That bothered me.\n\nOn the question of Obama and a post-partisan administration\u2014\n\nHe said in his campaign he was going to govern in a post-partisan way, and he kind of used that to criticize the Clintons. He was going to be above the battle. I said it gave me post-partisan depression. I resented the argument that with the Clintons it was kind of a two-way squabble. I was on the House impeachment committee, and I got to ask two great questions when Ken Starr appeared after the congressional election, and he presented his report. Before the election, he said Clinton should be impeached. After the election, he said, Oh, by the way, there was nothing bad in Whitewater or Filegate or the travel office, nothing bad happened in all those. And I said, why\u2019d you wait until after the election to tell us that? He gave us the bad news before, and there was nothing\u2014one oral sex act. Ken Starr\u2019s 11 articles of impeachment were 11 different ways of saying blow job. They were after Clinton; Clinton did not pick that fight. They decided they were going to drive him out of office because they wanted the presidency back.\n\nLooking back at that episode, it looks like the country lost its mind.\n\nTemporarily, but you know what? It got it back. I chronicle that in my book. If you look at the votes\u2014when he had to go on television in August and admit they had oral sex, guys were saying he\u2019s gone\u2014350 to 60\u2014he kept California, Massachusetts, and blacks. Even Gephardt and Bonior voted against him. Then what happened, the country shifted. I remember the day his grand jury testimony was released, I was home and I was checking with my office. The calls were, is that all this is about? The public basically said to the pollsters, you\u2019re going to turn the government over because of consensual sex? I mean, the country shifted, and the Republican Congress was caught in a time warp.\n\nOne other substantive issue: the banks. The left thinks Obama betrayed them; the bankers think he\u2019s one step short of being a socialist. Which is it? You negotiated the legislation, you dealt with the administration directly, where is Obama on this?\n\nPeople who say Obama is much closer to the right don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Elizabeth Warren lobbied for the bill. When Russell Feingold said he would vote against the bill because it didn\u2019t go far enough, Elizabeth got very angry and called him up. There is more she would have liked to have gotten done, but it\u2019s a more than significant improvement over where we were. Some people on the left didn\u2019t understand it very well. The left did better on that bill than the bankers.\n\nOne other thing I\u2019ve heard you say about the left hankering for a serious primary challenge to Hillary.\n\nThey want to do to Hillary Clinton what happened to Romney, there\u2019s no point to that.\n\nIn the book, you have nice things to say about a number of Republicans, and people looking for you to dish will be disappointed.\n\nRead the blurbs: Elizabeth Warren, Hank Paulson\u2014when\u2019s the last time you saw the two of them together?\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten good reviews, except Frank Bruni wants you to bare your soul.\n\nHe wants me to bare my genitals.\n\nHe says he wanted to know if you were getting sex.\n\nAnd if I wanted more. The point is whether he was getting sex or not, did he want more? Who doesn\u2019t want more? I was just appalled by that. Bruni is a Republican, and as a gay man he\u2019s conflicted that way. To come out and say I didn\u2019t talk about the sex I was having in a book about politics \u2026\n\nI think you\u2019re pretty candid about the shame you felt.\n\nThe book is called Frank. He thought the title was too short, it should have been 50 Shades of Frank.\n\nI still have my tape recorder on, but I probably shouldn\u2019t use that\u2026", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "LGBT Issues, Barney Frank, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201503190915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The former Massachusetts congressman didn\u2019t call his new memoir \u2018Frank\u2019 for nothing.
