But with no major changes to the health care system until the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the number of patients who couldn\u2019t afford a doctor held steady.\n\nDr. Frank Kleeman, founder of the Biddeford Free Clinic, goes over paperwork as he prepares for the clinic\u2019s closure in September after 22 years.

As many as 700 people showed up each year to see a doctor and pick up medication they otherwise would go without.\n\nIn the past year, the clinic has reduced its hours to one night a week and the number of patients has fallen off dramatically as they buy insurance available through the ACA marketplace. The clinic now has fewer than 75 active patients and will close for good on Sept. 23.\n\nClinic volunteers have helped 100 patients determine if they were eligible for health insurance subsidies and connected them with navigators to help them sign up for insurance. They also are helping the remaining patients apply for free or reduced medical care through Southern Maine Health Care.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great. We\u2019ve done what we set out to do,\u201d Kleeman said of the clinic. \u201cWe saw a need, we filled it and now it\u2019s time to go because that need doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nFor clinic director Joan Gordon, the closure is bittersweet.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s time to go, but it\u2019s hard to go,\u201d she said.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR PLAN\n\nThe idea for the free clinic came about over Thanksgiving 1992 as Kleeman and his children sat around the dinner table. President Bill Clinton had recently been elected and he had talked a lot about implementing universal health care during his campaign.\n\n\u201cMy kids said to me, \u2018All you doctors are lazy because you don\u2019t provide care to people without insurance,'\u201d said Kleeman, who was a practicing urologist when the clinic opened but is retired now . \u201cI told them if you really think there are so many people without insurance, find out if that\u2019s true. We found out there really was a need.\u201d\n\nAfter learning that 92,000 Maine residents \u2013 out of a population of 1.1 million \u2013 didn\u2019t have insurance in 1987, Kleeman asked local health officials if a free clinic would ease the burden in Biddeford.\n\nThey told him it would, but it wouldn\u2019t be easy to make it work.\n\nKleeman\u2019s children, Mike, Chris and Julie, helped their father secure rent-free space in a community center in Biddeford, raise money and gather donated medication. Dozens of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical technicians, medical students and administrative personnel signed up to volunteer.\n\n\u201cMy expectation was we\u2019d be open five years,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea how long it would be.\u201d\n\nFILLING A NEED\n\nWhen the clinic first opened, about 700 patients came through its doors each year. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for doctors to see a dozen patients and for pharmacists to fill as many as 70 prescriptions each night.\n\nNow, the pharmacy fills about 25 prescriptions each week and there are weeks when only four or five patients need to see a doctor.\n\nIn 2013, the clinic treated 392 patients, mostly from Biddeford, Saco and other York County towns. The Dental Wellness Center saw 95 patients, according to the clinic\u2019s most recent annual report.\n\n\u201cAt this point, people have other avenues to get their health care,\u201d said Denise Doyon, a clinic board member and volunteer pharmacist. \u201cI think it\u2019s been very helpful for those people in the middle who weren\u2019t poor enough to qualify for assistance but didn\u2019t have a good enough job to have benefits.\u201d\n\nSince 1993, the clinic has provided $6.5 million worth of medical and dental services.\n\nFrom the beginning, it has relied on grants and donations from organizations like the United Way, local businesses and private residents. Local communities provided additional funding.\n\nIn 2013, the clinic spent about $192,000 of its $194,000 income, mostly on operating costs and medication. The clinic has two part-time employees.\n\n\u201cIt has been a wonderful resource for people,\u201d said Eric Allen, a volunteer nurse from Kennebunk. \u201cIt gives people a direction to seek health care and has opened a door that was otherwise shut.\u201d\n\nWINDING DOWN\n\nKleeman arrived early at the clinic last Wednesday, a couple of hours before the other volunteers would show up and he would begin seeing patients.\n\nNow 81, Kleeman moves swiftly through the clinic with the energy of a much younger man. He\u2019s there almost whenever the clinic is open, greeting patients, filling in when there is no volunteer doctor or doing whatever else needs to get done.\n\n\u201cHe is the heart and soul of this organization,\u201d said Gordon, who has worked there since the beginning. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone like him in the world. This wouldn\u2019t have happened without him.\u201d\n\nTerry Lebrun sat on a couch in the hallway as she waited to see Kleeman and a nurse last week. She started coming to the clinic in 2011 because she was having trouble with her hands. She has since been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re excellent here. They get me all of my medications,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nLebrun is hoping to get insurance through the ACA in November. In the meantime, she has applied for reduced care through the hospital.\n\nNearby, Daniel Michaud and his wife filled out forms to apply for assistance at the hospital. Michaud, 54, of Biddeford has been coming to the clinic off and on for eight years to help handle his diabetes, high blood pressure and the lingering effects of an accident. He is applying for disability, but has no insurance and can\u2019t afford to pay for his medication.\n\nMichaud said the clinic volunteers have helped him learn to care for himself and manage his illnesses better.\n\n\u201cEvery time I needed medication, I\u2019d come here and get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate to see this place go. If it wasn\u2019t for this place, I can only imagine where I\u2019d be today.\u201d\n\nWhen Michaud was done filling out his forms, he gave them to a group of volunteers to review. The goal, Gordon said, is to make sure no patients go without medical care after the clinic closes because they didn\u2019t properly apply for assistance.\n\nKleeman said the decision to close was a gradual one, but he\u2019s more focused on the next few months, rather than the actual end. The clinic is working to set up a program through the hospital that will provide free medication to people in the community who can\u2019t afford it. That program will be funded with the clinic\u2019s remaining money.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s equipment will be donated to Partners for World Health in South Portland.\n\nKleeman said there also are plans underway for an open house to thank everyone who helped the clinic help so many people.\n\n\u201cI think people have gotten better health care because we\u2019ve been here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve saved some lives and saved people from discomfort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state's first free health care clinic started 22 years ago over Thanksgiving dinner.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The state's first free health care clinic started 22 years ago over Thanksgiving dinner.", "title": "Biddeford Free Clinic will close its doors in September - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/669744_789650-20150701_FreeClini6.jpg", "height": 591}, "updated_time": "2015-07-04T11:14:17-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/07/04/biddeford-free-clinic-will-close-its-doors-in-september/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state's first free health care clinic started 22 years ago over Thanksgiving dinner.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/669744_789650-20150701_FreeClini6.jpg", "title": "Biddeford Free Clinic will close its doors in September - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2015-07-04T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-04T11:14:17-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7915\"", "article_summary": "BIDDEFORD \u2014 Dr. Frank Kleeman has waited a long time to close the doors of the Biddeford Free Clinic.\nDr. Frank Kleeman, founder of the Biddeford Free Clinic, goes over paperwork as he prepares for the clinic\u2019s closure in September after 22 years.\nThey also are helping the remaining patients apply for free or reduced medical care through Southern Maine Health Care.\nTHE FIVE-YEAR PLANThe idea for the free clinic came about over Thanksgiving 1992 as Kleeman and his children sat around the dinner table.\nWhen he first opened it 22 years ago, he thought for sure there would only be a need to provide free medical care for uninsured Mainers for a few years."}
