The travails of HealthCare.gov, the murderous attacks in Benghazi and the actions taken by the IRS against conservative groups chewed up 9 minutes and 45 seconds of the 10-minute sitdown.\n\nWe all know that those topics are nothing but chum for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s anti-Obama audience. But the president successfully avoided the rhetorical traps set by the ambassador from \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d And he respectfully stood up to the disrespect demanded by said audience by giving as good as he got.\n\nThe conversation about the failure of the HealthCare.gov launch focused on what did the president know and when did he know it. O\u2019Reilly spun his tires trying to get Obama to explain why Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius hasn\u2019t been fired. And the newsman tried get the president to admit that \u201cbiggest mistake of your presidency [was] to tell the nation over and over, if you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, the rollout of the Obamacare Web site was a disaster. But the president said exactly what he should have said.\n\nOBAMA: \u2014 what \u2014 what we\u2019ve ended up doing is we\u2019ve got three million people signed up so far. We\u2019re about a month behind of where we anticipated we wanted to be. We\u2019ve got over six million people who have signed up for Medicaid. O\u2019REILLY: Yes. OBAMA: We\u2019ve got three million young people under the age of 26 who have signed up on their parents\u2019 plan. And so what we\u2019re constantly figuring out is how do we continue to improve it, how do we make sure that the folks who don\u2019t have health insurance can get health insurance\u2026\n\nThen O\u2019Reilly moved on to Benghazi. It was as if O\u2019Reilly was trying to relitigate Mitt Romney\u2019s big stumble from the second presidential debate. Over and over again, O\u2019Reilly and Obama talked over each other as the former tried to get the latter to admit that he was told by then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta that what went down in Benghazi \u201cwas a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nOBAMA: You know, in \u2014 in the heat of the moment, Bill, what folks are focused on is what\u2019s happening on the ground, do we have eyes on it, how can we make sure our folks are secure\u2026 O\u2019REILLY: Because I just want to get this on the record\u2026 OBAMA: So, I\u2026 O\u2019REILLY: \u2014 did he tell you it was a terror attack? OBAMA: Bill \u2014 and what I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m answering your question. What he said to me was, we\u2019ve got an attack on our compound. We don\u2019t know yet\u2026 O\u2019REILLY: No terror attack? OBAMA: \u2014 we don\u2019t know yet who\u2019s doing it. Understand, by definition, Bill, when somebody is attacking our compound\u2026 O\u2019REILLY: Yes? OBAMA: \u2014 that\u2019s an act of terror, which is how I characterized it the day after it happened. So the \u2014 so the question ends up being who, in fact, was attacking us?\n\nPresident Obama (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nAnd that waste of time was followed up by an obsessive focus on meetings with Douglas Shulman, the former head of the IRS. \u201cHe was cleared into the White House 157 times, more than any of your Cabinet members, more than any other IRS guy in the history, by far,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cOkay, why was Douglas Shulman here 157 times?\u201d Obama explained that Shulman came to the White House for routine meetings centered around financial reform and the IRS\u2019s role in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMore crosstalk ensued when O\u2019Reilly desperately tried to draw a link between Obama and Shulman to somehow prove there was White House involvement in the extra scrutiny given to conservative groups during the 2012 presidential election. More than once, the president told O\u2019Reilly his he was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d to insist that all isn\u2019t known about what happened with the IRS. And then Obama lowered the boom.\n\nBill, we do \u2014 that\u2019s not what happened. They \u2014 folks have, again, had multiple hearings on this. I mean these kinds of things keep on surfacing, in part because you and your TV station will promote them.\n\nIt\u2019s always difficult to tell whether the tail is wagging the dog over there at Fox, but I would argue that the IRS conspiracy theories and others are in large part due to O\u2019Reilly and Fox. Neither the station nor its anchor has shown Obama or his office the respect both deserve. And that 10-minute interview was a perfect illustration of it.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neither the station nor its anchor has shown Obama or his office the respect both deserve.
