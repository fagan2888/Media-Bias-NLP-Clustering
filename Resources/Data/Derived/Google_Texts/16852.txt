At 3 p.m. Saturday, the scheduled start of the U.S. Navy Blue Angels performance at Milwaukee's lakefront, the only booming noise one could hear was from the harbor's fog horn.

Fog has led to the cancellation shortly after 3 p.m. of Saturday's air show, which had been scheduled to start at 10 a.m. The air show's Twitter account announced that those with tickets to Saturday's show should get a hand stamp, and those stamps will be honored on Sunday.

The forecast for Sunday calls for rain.
