(Thomas R. Cordova / Staff Photographer)\n\nWILMINGTON >> The CEO of Molina Healthcare said he expects the number of people to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s state-run insurance exchange programs to increase as the end of the initial enrollment period draws closer.\n\n\u201cEnrollments have been slow so far. I think a lot of it has a lot to do with the negative publicity of the website not working,\u201d Molina Healthcare CEO Mario Molina said Wednesday night at the Molina Medical Group clinic in Wilmington.\n\n\u201cIn the last week, we have seen traffic to our website increase fivefold.\u201d\n\nMolina declined to discuss enrollment figures at the event, saying those numbers will probably not be released until the end of the enrollment period.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s deadline is Dec. 23 for enrollees to receive care through a government-managed exchange that will go into effect with the new year. The final deadline to get coverage through an exchange is March 31.\n\nMolina Healthcare, based in Long Beach, is among the 13 insurers providing coverage through Covered California, the state-run exchange that offers subsidized health insurance to people whose incomes meet eligibility requirements. Individuals with an annual income of $28,725 or less or a family of four with an income at or below $58,875 may be able to receive premium assistance if they enroll for health insurance through the exchange.\n\nThe exchanges are a key part of the Affordable Care Act, the law that many opponents dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d before the term was taken up by supporters including its namesake, President Barack Obama, who signed it into law in 2010. The health care law, which requires Americans to obtain health insurance for 2014 or face a tax penalty, has been the subject of numerous criticisms.\n\nNotable objections, as of late, include the prospect of individual plan holders being unable to retain insurance plans that do not meet the ACA\u2019s minimum requirements. Republican critics have said those cancellations have made a lie out of the president\u2019s previous pledge that those who liked their existing health insurance could keep their plans as the ACA goes into effect.\n\nThat controversy is in addition to the much-publicized problems that have afflicted Healthcare.gov, the federal government\u2019s website for those considering applying for health insurance through the ACA.\n\nCovered California has its own website, and the state\u2019s exchange reports that as of today, more than 431,000 applications for health insurance have been initiated.\n\nAt Molina\u2019s event in Wilmington, visitors were welcomed in English and Spanish before receiving one-on-one counseling from Molina employees on which plans that they may be eligible for. About 10 people visited the clinic when the evening session began and the counseling included walk-throughs on different levels of coverage and the various deductibles and co-pays involved with each plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmalia Esparza, one of the people who attended the night event, said in Spanish after the counseling she was undecided whether to seek insurance through Covered California or through plans offered via her husband\u2019s employer.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to go back home and talk to her husband,\u201d said Miriam Esparza, Amalia\u2019s daughter and a Molina medical assistant who interpreted her mother\u2019s remarks.\n\nMolina Healthcare specializes in providing health coverage to patients who are seniors eligible for Medicare or low-income earners who can receive Medicaid. The ACA also expands Medicaid, administered as Medi-Cal in this state, and Molina said the company has hired some 4,000 people this year while anticipating an increase in business.\n\nAlthough the ACA remains controversial, Molina said he expects the law to remain in place for the long term.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I think it\u2019s going to be hard to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be harder to do as people get coverage.\u201d\n\nContact Andrew Edwards at 562-499-1305.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WILMINGTON >> The CEO of Molina Healthcare said he expects the number of people to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s state-run insurance exchange programs to increase as the end of the initial enrollment period draws", "title": "Molina Healthcare seeks Covered California enrollees at Wilmington clinic", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/LI/20131205/NEWS/131209652", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20131205/NEWS/131209652/AR/0/AR-131209652.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "832px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Molina Healthcare seeks Covered California enrollees at Wilmington clinic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "WILMINGTON >> The CEO of Molina Healthcare said he expects the number of people to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s state-run insurance exchange programs to increase as the end of the initial enrollment period draws", "title": "Molina Healthcare seeks Covered California enrollees at Wilmington clinic", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/LI/20131205/NEWS/131209652", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20131205/NEWS/131209652/AR/0/AR-131209652.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Access to health care, Access to health care news, Torrance Access to health care news, CA Access to health care news, US Access to health care news, world Access to health care news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Access to health care, Access to health care news, Torrance Access to health care news, CA Access to health care news, US Access to health care news, world Access to health care news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde955\"", "article_summary": "Esmeralda Hernandez of Molina Healthcare goes through the health plan options with Amalia Esparza as Molina Medical hosts an enrollment event for Covered California enrollees in Wilmington, CA., on Wednesda,y December 4, 2013.\nI think a lot of it has a lot to do with the negative publicity of the website not working,\u201d Molina Healthcare CEO Mario Molina said Wednesday night at the Molina Medical Group clinic in Wilmington.\nThe health care law, which requires Americans to obtain health insurance for 2014 or face a tax penalty, has been the subject of numerous criticisms.\nMolina Healthcare specializes in providing health coverage to patients who are seniors eligible for Medicare or low-income earners who can receive Medicaid.\nMolina Healthcare, based in Long Beach, is among the 13 insurers providing coverage through Covered California, the state-run exchange that offers subsidized health insurance to people whose incomes meet eligibility requirements."}
