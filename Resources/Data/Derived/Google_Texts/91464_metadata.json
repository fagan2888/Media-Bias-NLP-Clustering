MasterCard covets another site for Americans to swipe credit cards. Marriott sees beachfront property that needs hotels.\n\nAnd outside Orlando, Florida, Danny Howell just knows there would be demand for his classic Chevrolet parts.\n\nAmerican businesses have begun imagining ways to capitalize on last week\u2019s announcement that the United States will restore diplomatic ties with Cuba and ease curbs on trade with one of the last surviving Communist regimes.\n\nTheir more ambitious plans would require that Congress lift the U.S. embargo on most exports to Cuba. Given sharp resistance from some in Congress, that might not happen soon. But many analysts think Congress will repeal the embargo eventually.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news \u2014 it\u2019s a totally untapped market,\u201d said Seth Kaplowitz, a lawyer and lecturer in finance at San Diego State University.\n\nAll that said, Cuba experts have a message for any business that might be envisioning easy riches:\n\nBe patient.\n\nAfter years of rigid market planning in Cuba and the half-century-old U.S. embargo, restoring economic ties to something close to normal is likely to be complex and time-consuming. The United States must change laws and regulations, and Cuba must build an economy more hospitable to foreign investment.\n\n\u201cThe Cuban government has a long way to go and a lot more to do,\u201d said Jodi Bond, vice president of the Americas at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think any businesses are under the illusion that this is going to be an easy transition or the floodgates will open.\u201d\n\nStill, the prospects are tantalizing.\n\nEconomists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate that the export of U.S. goods to Cuba could eventually reach $4.3 billion annually, up from just $360 million in 2013. And Cuban exports of goods to the United States could reach $5.8 billion, from zero now.\n\nA full lifting of the U.S. trade embargo could benefit, among others, U.S. farmers, auto and tractor makers, airline and hotel companies and telecom equipment makers. The United States now sells Cuba about $350 million a year in farm products, including rice corn, soybeans and frozen chicken parts, according to the American Farm Bureau. A 2000 law relaxed restrictions on food and medical exports.\n\nThose exports could surge once the United States eases restrictions on financial transactions, which could happen soon. Cuban buyers of U.S. agricultural goods are required to pay up front, though international trade is usually done on credit.\n\n\u201cWe have been pretty much hamstrung by the financial constraints,\u201d said Devry Boughner Vorwerk, a vice president at Cargill, the agriculture giant. She called the U.S. move \u201ca great first step.\u201d\n\nU.S.-based travel companies have been eager to embrace the Caribbean island, just an hour\u2019s flight from Miami. Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Hilton Worldwide, Marriott International and the Carnival Corp. all expressed interest last week, though most of their plans would have to await a repeal of the embargo.\n\nCEO Arne Sorenson said in a statement that Marriott looks \u201cforward to opening hotels in Cuba, as companies from other countries have done already.\u201d\n\nApple Leisure Group, which books 2 million vacation packages to the Caribbean a year and is about to open its 38th hotel in the region, is developing a plan for Cuba.\n\n\u201cWe could very rapidly put charters onto the island\u201d or buy a hotel and convert it into one of its Sunscape brand resorts, CEO Alex Zozaya said. He envisions a market for the company\u2019s higher-end hotels, like Secrets and Dreams.\n\nEventually, that is.\n\n\u201cCuba does not have the right infrastructure yet to satisfy the mid-to-high-end market,\u201d Zozaya said.\n\nCuba, which can appear stuck in a 1950s time warp, desperately needs investment. The island lags far behind its neighbors Haiti and the Dominican Republic in the proportion of its economic output that goes into public infrastructure like roads, factories and housing. In fact, Cuba has one of the lowest investment rates in the world, according to the World Bank.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US companies eager to embrace Cuba face hurdles", "author": "Paul Wiseman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US companies eager to embrace Cuba face hurdles", "title": "US companies eager to embrace Cuba face hurdles", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/21/us_companies_eager_to_embrace_cuba_face_hurdles/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/us-cuba-trade.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US companies eager to embrace Cuba face hurdles", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/us-cuba-trade.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "US companies eager to embrace Cuba face hurdles", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "US companies eager to embrace Cuba face hurdles", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf40f\"", "article_summary": "Cuban buyers of U.S. agricultural goods are required to pay up front, though international trade is usually done on credit.\nThe United States must change laws and regulations, and Cuba must build an economy more hospitable to foreign investment.\nA full lifting of the U.S. trade embargo could benefit, among others, U.S. farmers, auto and tractor makers, airline and hotel companies and telecom equipment makers.\nThose exports could surge once the United States eases restrictions on financial transactions, which could happen soon.\nAnd Cuban exports of goods to the United States could reach $5.8 billion, from zero now."}
