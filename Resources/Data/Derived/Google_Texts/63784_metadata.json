But there\u2019s some good news, too.\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news for people who wish to honor a secessionist army that killed and died for the right to own other human beings: The South Carolina House voted early Thursday morning to remove the Confederate battle flag from South Carolina State House grounds. Republican Gov. Nikki Haley has promised to sign the bill.\n\nBut there\u2019s also good news for Americans who wish to remember traitorous champions of slavery: There are still 10 US Army bases in the United States named for Confederate generals, and military officials have no plans to change the names.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s momentous decision to remove the Confederate flag came three weeks after Dylann Roof, a young white supremacist who appeared in several photographs holding the Confederate flag, shot and killed 9 African American parishioners at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Many people were outraged when a photograph taken at the state house showed the American flag flying at half-staff in mourning while the Confederate flag continued to fly at full-staff.\n\nThe mass shooting led to an aggressive and effective backlash against the continued presence of Confederate battle flags in American society. Major retailers \u2014 including Wal-Mart, Amazon, eBay, and Sears \u2014 announced they\u2019d stop selling the flags. Officials in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee promised it would no longer be allowed on license plates.\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Turns out people get angry when you say white Americans are terrorists, too\n\nOther symbols of the Confederacy are also being targeted. Alaska just changed a census area named for a Confederate general and plantation owner. In Tennessee there\u2019s been a bipartisan call to remove from the state house a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and leading figure in the Ku Klux Klan. And folks are beginning to talk about the fact that the US Capitol\u2019s National Statuary Hall Collection features many Confederate leaders, including President of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a national conversation happening around symbols of the Confederacy.\n\nThe Pentagon is staying out of it.\n\nWhile the Confederate flag is falling in South Carolina \u2014 an act whose symbolic importance can\u2019t be overstated \u2014 US Army soldiers continue to train at bases named for Confederate leaders that waged civil war against the Union Army, which, you\u2019ll recall, included the US Army:\n\nFort Lee (Virginia)\n\nFort Hood\n\nFort Benning (Georgia)\n\nFort Gordon (Georgia)\n\nFort Bragg (North Carolina)\n\nFort Polk (Louisiana)\n\nFort Pickett (Virginia)\n\nFort A.P.
