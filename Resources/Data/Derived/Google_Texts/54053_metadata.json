This tax provides about $1.8 million a year for energy efficiency programs and renewable energy incentives. The tax is assessed at different rates for residential, commercial and industrial customers. Residential customers pay about $21 a year, while commercial customers pay about $94 a year and industrial customers pay about $9,600 a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat supporters say: The Climate Action Plan tax is essential to Boulder continuing to make progress on its greenhouse gas reduction goals. It pays for residential and commercial EnergySmart programs that help residents and business owners identify energy efficiency measures and available private and public rebates, as well as the SmartRegs program that requires landlords to meet energy efficiency standards. The Climate Action Plan tax also has paid for pilot programs that encourage innovation, including the Boulder Energy Challenge and the development of a rooftop solar tool. The program has produced real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhat opponents say: There is no organized opposition to this measure.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948177/boulder-question-2p-climate-action-plan-tax-extension", "sailthru.author": "Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28948177:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T18:18:11-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What it asks: \"Without raising additional taxes, shall the existing climate action plan excise tax be extended for five years for the purpose of continuing to provide incentives, services, and other assistance to Boulder residents and businesses to improve energy efficiency, expand the use of renewable energy, and take other necessary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at the current rate of $0.", "title": "Boulder Question 2P: Climate Action Plan tax extension", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948177/boulder-question-2p-climate-action-plan-tax-extension", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-10-10T18:18:15-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-09T18:29:11-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "Camera staff", "pubDate": "2015-10-10T18:19:09-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T18:18:11-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Question 2P: Climate Action Plan tax extension", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Election", "description": "What it asks: \"Without raising additional taxes, shall the existing climate action plan excise tax be extended for five years for the purpose of continuing to provide incentives, services, and other assistance to Boulder residents and businesses to improve energy efficiency, expand the use of renewable energy, and take other necessary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at the current rate of $0.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948177/boulder-question-2p-climate-action-plan-tax-extension", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "What it asks: \"Without raising additional taxes, shall the existing climate action plan excise tax be extended for five years for the purpose of continuing to provide incentives, services, and other assistance to Boulder residents and businesses to improve energy efficiency, expand the use of renewable energy, and take other necessary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, at the current rate of $0.", "title": "Boulder Question 2P: Climate Action Plan tax extension"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb79\"", "article_summary": "What it means: Should the Climate Action Plan tax on utility bills be extended through March, 31, 2023?\nAdvertisementWhat supporters say: The Climate Action Plan tax is essential to Boulder continuing to make progress on its greenhouse gas reduction goals.\nThe Climate Action Plan tax also has paid for pilot programs that encourage innovation, including the Boulder Energy Challenge and the development of a rooftop solar tool.\nResidential customers pay about $21 a year, while commercial customers pay about $94 a year and industrial customers pay about $9,600 a year.\nThis tax provides about $1.8 million a year for energy efficiency programs and renewable energy incentives."}
