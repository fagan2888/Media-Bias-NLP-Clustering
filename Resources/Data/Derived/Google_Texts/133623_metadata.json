The leave would be available if they or a family member becomes ill. When it takes effect in July, it\u2019s expected to affect 6.5 million workers.\n\nOther locations that require paid sick leave include Connecticut as well as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Seattle, New York City, Portland, Ore., and Newark, N.J., according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n\nIn addition, voters in Massachusetts, Montclair and Trenton, N.J., and Oakland, Calif., will consider ballot measures this fall requiring paid sick leave, says Vicki Shabo, a vice president at the National Partnership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only economically developed country in the world that doesn\u2019t have paid sick days,\u201d she says.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 private sector workers lack paid sick leave, and low-wage workers make up a disproportionate share. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 2014 National Compensation Survey, only 30 percent of the workers whose earnings are in the bottom quarter nationally had access to paid sick time compared with 84 percent of workers in the highest quartile.\n\nThe problem hits women especially hard. Women make up two-thirds of low-wage workers and are more likely to be the family caregivers, says Liz Watson, senior counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center and director of its Workplace Justice for Women.\n\n\u201cTheir ability to take paid sick leave or paid medical leave is crucial to being able to hold onto their jobs,\u201d Watson says.\n\nFederal legislation that would require paid sick leave has been introduced several times but never passed. The Healthy Families Act, introduced by Rep. Rosa Delauro, D-Conn., in 2013, would allow workers at companies with at least 15 employees to accrue up to seven days paid sick leave annually.\n\nNoting that it took many attempts to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for their own or a family member\u2019s medical needs, Watson says, \u201cI think we will see this legislation pass, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
