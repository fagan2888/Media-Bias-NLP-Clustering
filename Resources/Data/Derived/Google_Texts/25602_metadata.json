(It\u2019s a hard case: I can see both sides. It seems to me like an issue the Supreme Court ought to ultimately decide.) And they\u2019re just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Rebecca Smith observes on CNN:\n\nMajor corporations are increasingly using subcontracting structures, like outsourcing jobs, hiring workers through staffing agencies, and franchising \u2026 Hundreds of thousands of people work days-long or hours-long \u201cgigs\u201d \u2026 PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated last summer that the sharing economy as a whole, valued at $15 billion in 2013, could reach $335 billion globally by 2025. It\u2019s not hard to see who wins and who loses in this scenario.\n\n\u2026Or is it?\n\nI see her point: the gig economy tends to reduce workers to fungible, replaceable cogs. Workers devalued in that way inevitably make less money and receive fewer benefits. When you can be more easily replaced, you become, pretty much by definition, less valuable; and technology is making the process of replacing one laborer with another increasingly frictionless.\n\nThis isn\u2019t restricted to Uber and Lyft drivers. Consider the increasing proportion of university faculty who are part-time lecturers, who \u201ccan also be hired quickly to teach just one class, if that\u2019s what\u2019s needed.\u201d Consider the booming growth in temp jobs.\n\nAnd consider jobs that haven\u2019t traditionally been gigs. Tech makes it easier to onboard new people, too. It\u2019s easy to imagine retail businesses, or restaurants/bars/cafes, hiring additional staff on-demand, on a shift-by-shift basis, through some Uber-like app for small businesses; replacing employees with interchangeable cashiers and baristas who move from store to store and restaurant to restaurant, one shift at a time, dependent on high ratings from each proprietor.\n\nImagine this process multiplied by a thousand during the next decade, across businesses large and small; imagine the atomization of large swathes of the economy into work done by increasingly replaceable human cogs.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nSignificant portions of the economy already work that way today \u2014 to the benefit of the cogs in question. I\u2019m thinking of registered nurses and software engineers. Today\u2019s nurse shortage is expected to expand across the US until 2030. The leverage that good software engineers have in today\u2019s tech market is sufficiently well-documented that I won\u2019t bother belaboring the point.\n\nAnd yet, in principle, both nurses and engineers are reasonably fungible. Short-term nursing contracts are plentiful, as are short-term engineering projects. One good iOS developer can easily replace another; good developers write code that\u2019s easy for others to understand, maintain and expand. (One resulting irony is that sometimes a bad developer can be harder to replace than a good one.)\n\nIt seems like half the coders I know, or work with in my day job, are short-term contractors \u2014 often with their own startup fermenting on the side. What\u2019s more, they do this by choice; they could easily get full-time work with benefits, but they prefer the flexibility of contracting. As do many nurses, as I understand it.\n\nMy point is that it\u2019s not the gig and/or \u201csharing\u201d economy, in and of itself, which undercuts workers\u2019 pay, benefits, and (arguably) rights. It\u2019s something far more classic; an excess of supply relative to demand. Professions where supply is low and demand is high frequently disdain full-time employment and voluntarily choose contract employment instead.\n\nThe troubles that overstressed, dehumanized gig-economy workers face are very real, but they\u2019re not caused by the so-called sharing economy. All that it\u2019s doing is spreading work more evenly among those who want it. The real problem is that there isn\u2019t enough demand for all the work that all those people want to do \u2014 and so it, and they, are devalued.\n\nTech arguably plays a role there as well. And it will play a much larger one, if it\u2019s true that technology is destroying jobs faster than it creates them, as many people (including me) have predicted. But let\u2019s not blame the \u201csharing economy.\u201d It\u2019s just a symptom, not the problem.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TechCrunch", "sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/jon-evans/\" title=\"Posts by Jon Evans\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Jon Evans</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rezendi\" rel=\"external\">@rezendi</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Few subjects elicit more skepticism than the so-called \u201csharing economy.\u201d Kevin Roose argues: \u201cThe Sharing Economy Isn\u2019t About Trust, It\u2019s About Desperation.\u201d\u2026", "title": "A Farewell To Jobs | TechCrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/28/a-farewell-to-jobs/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/farewell-arms.jpg?w=700&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "Few subjects elicit more skepticism than the so-called \u201csharing economy.\u201d Kevin Roose argues: \u201cThe Sharing Economy Isn\u2019t About Trust, It\u2019s About Desperation.\u201d Catherine Rampell warns: \u201cthere\u2019s a dark side to these work arrangements \u2026 the shifting of risk off corporate balance sheets and onto the shoulders of individual Americans.\u201d", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "tag": "pricewaterhousecoopers", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/28/a-farewell-to-jobs/", "sailthru.tags": "peak jobs, Uber, pricewaterhousecoopers", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://techcrunch.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d9ea925a71f82f06a1e6224298f7fe80?s=16", "category": "TC", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Jon Evans", "sailthru.date": "2015-03-28 06:00:27", "sailthru.title": "A Farewell To\u00a0Jobs", "content": "Few subjects elicit more skepticism than the so-called \"sharing economy.\" Kevin Roose argues: \"The Sharing Economy Isn\u2019t About Trust, It\u2019s About Desperation.\" Catherine Rampell warns: \"there\u2019s a dark side to these work arrangements ... the shifting of risk off corporate balance sheets and onto the shoulders of individual Americans.\" US courts are wrestling with whether Uber and Lyft drivers are contractors or should be considered employees.
