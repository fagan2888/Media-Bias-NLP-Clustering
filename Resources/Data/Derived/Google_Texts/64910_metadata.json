The organization has advocated for a number of liberal initiatives, including strongly supporting the passage of Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe group has also been supportive of the Obama administration\u2019s failed push for expanding gun control laws in 2013. It successfully fought a proposed Florida law that would have prevented doctors from including in a person\u2019s medical file whether they are a gun owner. Doctors for America has referred to guns as a public health threat, and circulated a petition to pressure Congress to pass stricter gun laws.\n\n\u201cThis is so big we are scoring it,\u201d National Rifle Association spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen told TheBlaze regarding the vote on the surgeon general nomination. \u201cWe sent out notifications to our 5 million members asking them to contact their senator to vote against this nomination.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted 13-9 last month to send Murthy\u2019s nomination to the Senate floor.\n\nThe surgeon general does not have a major policymaking role, but rather has a megaphone to speak about public health issues.\n\nBut the person in that position must be someone the public can trust, Mortensen said.\n\n\u201cThe surgeon general has the important task of providing information to people to help them make better decisions about health care. It\u2019s a position that requires trust and leadership,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cThe American people need to know they can look to that person who is independent and not with a political agenda. The American people deserve to have confidence in their surgeon general.\u201d\n\nNRA Executive Director Chris Cox sent a letter to members of the Senate denouncing Murthy\u2019s long advocacy of gun control.\n\nThe NRA takes particular exception to a letter from the organization on Jan. 14, 2013 supporting licensing of guns, limits on ammunition purchase, and a mandatory 48-hour waiting period. The letter further asks for removing \u201cprovision in the Affordable Care Act and other federal policies that prohibit physicians from documenting gun ownership.\u201d\n\nThe NRA letter also quotes a Murthy tweet from Oct. 16, 2012 that \u201cguns are a health care issue.\u201d\n\nInvestors Business Daily reported on Murthy\u2019s anti-gun tweets, including, \u201cTired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they\u2019re scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue,\u201d during the 2012 presidential elections, and in December 2012 in the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre: \u201cNRA press conference disappointing but predictable \u2014 blame everything in the world except guns for the Newtown tragedy. #wakeup.\u201d\n\nA Doctors for America spokesperson did not immediately respond to inquiries from TheBlaze on Monday.\n\nBeyond his political activity, Murthy has been an attending physician and medical instructor at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital since 2006. He co-founded VISIONS Worldwide in 1995, a nonprofit organization focused on HIV/AIDS education in India and the United States, where he served as president from 1995 to 2000 and chairman of the board from 2000 to 2003.\n\nEven before Obama began advocating for more gun control laws in early 2013, Doctors for America touted itself in its \u201cDocs vs. Glocks Campaign\u201d in summer 2011 in Florida, gaining 200 signatures on a petition regarding including firearms ownership in medical information.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Second Amendment advocates are worried about President Barack Obama's nominee for surgeon general, a political ally of the president and strong proponent of gun restrictions.
