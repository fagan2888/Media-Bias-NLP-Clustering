It was excruciating, he said.\n\n\u201cI lived a life of depression, suicidality. I couldn\u2019t even explain to myself, let alone others, what the barriers were,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cOne lives a life of never having access to the core self.\u201d\n\nWhen Wilson began hormone therapy to transition into becoming a man, everything changed.\n\n\u201cThe third day on testosterone for me was the first un-depressed day of my life,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo, while life suddenly became more difficult, and access to care became more difficult--I could face that because I suddenly had a self.\n\nThat feeling of severe discomfort with one\u2019s biological sex is called \"gender dysphoria\" by physicians. The treatment is often gender reassignment therapies or surgeries. But in many cases, the treatments are not considered medically necessary by health insurance plans and are therefore not covered, leaving people to pay the bills out-of-pocket.\n\nToday, Wilson is a consultant and lobbyist for transgender-inclusive health insurance based in Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nAlthough plans that cover gender reassignment are not overly plentiful, advocates have had some victories in recent months, including the repeal of a 1981 rule forbidding Medicare to cover the surgeries.\n\nHowever, for plans that do not include gender reassignment, Wilson said the definition of what is covered is sometimes broadly interpreted. As a result, they deny reimbursement to transgendered individuals for care that is completely unrelated to their gender transition.\n\n\u201cBlood transfusions, broken wrists \u2026 the list is really quite endless. Routine health exams that are denied because the person is transgender, and transgender related care is excluded under the plan,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nSome large employers in St. Louis do offer transgender-inclusive health insurance, including Monsanto and Boeing. Washington University added gender reassignment surgery coverage to employee plans this year, and is holding a series of seminars on transgender-inclusive care on Nov. 13 and 14.\n\nSeminar organizer Peter Jones said it took a year of dialogue with Washington University officials before a group of employees were able to secure the inclusion for the 2015 health plans. A cost-benefit analysis showed the change to plan prices would be minimal.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons Washington University is able to do this, is that they\u2019re self-insured. They\u2019re able to sit down with an insurance company and say, 'We want these things covered,' and they pay the cost directly to the insurance company,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of employers that are like Washington University and are about the same size. I don\u2019t think anything stands in their way to making their care trans-inclusive.\u201d\n\nFollow Durrie on Twitter: @DurrieB", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "Andre Wilson lived as a woman for the first 43 years of his life.
