Smoking an e-cigarette (called \u201cvaping\"), gives users a nicotine hit without exposing them \u2014 or those around them \u2014 to tobacco smoke. The lack of odor is one of the biggest selling points.\n\nThough e-cigarette makers do not make health claims, many users assume that eliminating the smoke of burning tobacco also eliminates the harm.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that e-cigarettes deliver fewer toxic substances than conventional cigarettes, but the question of how much less is still not clear,\u201d says Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California at San Francisco. Though sales of e-cigarettes are expected to reach $1 billion this year, vaping is new enough that there haven\u2019t been many studies done yet.\n\nThe ingredients can vary greatly from product to product, says behavioral scientist Alexander Prokhorov at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cThe companies improvise to come up with new flavorings and every time they introduce a new flavor, you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in it,\u201d he says.\n\nAn analysis by researchers at the FDA found very low levels of nitrosamines, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol \u2014 chemicals associated with cancer and other health risks \u2014 in some products, but the levels were a tiny fraction of what a smoker would get from a tobacco cigarette.\n\nSome e-cigarettes allow users to adjust the amount of nicotine they\u2019re getting, even down to zero over time, and it seems plausible that they could help people cut their dependence, Prokhorov says. However, right now there aren\u2019t good studies to show that they outperform existing nicotine cessation products, nor are they FDA-approved for this purpose.\n\nLauren Odum, a pharmacist at the University of Missouri who works at a smoking cessation clinic, says patients have told her that e-cigarettes helped them quit or cut back on regular cigarettes.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons that people like them is that they don\u2019t have to stop the smoking habit,\u201d she says. \u201cThey still get the hand-to-mouth motion and they still get the nicotine.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone who uses e-cigarettes stops smoking \u2014 most also use tobacco cigarettes \u2014 and some public health researchers worry that vaping may actually prevent some people from kicking their nicotine habit if it allows them to get their fix in circumstances where they can\u2019t smoke.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Studies differ on benefits, drawbacks of e-cigarettes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac5f\"", "article_summary": "Smoking an e-cigarette (called \u201cvaping\"), gives users a nicotine hit without exposing them \u2014 or those around them \u2014 to tobacco smoke.\nCHRISTIE ASCHWANDENThe Washington PostQ: Am I better off switching to e-cigarettes than sticking with my smoking habit?\n\u201cOne of the reasons that people like them is that they don\u2019t have to stop the smoking habit,\u201d she says.\nThough e-cigarette makers do not make health claims, many users assume that eliminating the smoke of burning tobacco also eliminates the harm.\nA: Electronic cigarettes come in a variety of shapes and models, but most consist of a battery, a heating element, and a liquid that contains nicotine, propylene glycol and flavorings."}
