Some states running their own exchanges have different deadlines.\n\nThe health-care law offers subsidized private insurance to people who can\u2019t get coverage through their jobs, Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nConsumers who missed the deadline may still be able to sign up for health insurance for 2015 under some circumstances. Certain life events \u2014 such as getting married, getting divorced, having a baby, losing job-based coverage \u2014 can make someone eligible for a special enrollment period. If they qualify, consumers generally have 60 days from the date of the event to sign up for coverage through the health insurance exchanges.\n\nIf consumers do not have health coverage in 2015, they will have to pay a penalty when filing their 2015 federal income tax returns in 2016. The penalty for 2015 is 2 percent of the annual household income, or $325 per person for the year, whichever is higher.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Certain life events will allow people to sign up through exchanges.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Certain life events will allow people to sign up through exchanges.", "title": "Consumers who missed deadline for insurance enrollment may still qualify", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/consumers-who-missed-deadline-for-insurance-enrollment-may-still-qualify/2015/02/16/2353668c-b555-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bylenasun"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/consumers-who-missed-deadline-for-insurance-enrollment-may-still-qualify/2015/02/16/2353668c-b555-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, health care, obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance, insurance marketplaces, insurance deadline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90"}, "eomportal-uuid": "2353668c-b555-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health, health care, obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance, insurance marketplaces, insurance deadline"}, "article_summary": "Consumers who missed the deadline may still be able to sign up for health insurance for 2015 under some circumstances.\nIf they qualify, consumers generally have 60 days from the date of the event to sign up for coverage through the health insurance exchanges.\nSunday was the last full day for people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act in the current open-enrollment season.\nIf consumers do not have health coverage in 2015, they will have to pay a penalty when filing their 2015 federal income tax returns in 2016.\nCertain life events \u2014 such as getting married, getting divorced, having a baby, losing job-based coverage \u2014 can make someone eligible for a special enrollment period."}
