Angry mobs have roiled more than three dozen American campuses in recent weeks, disrupting student life with long lists of demands — with no end in sight.

Indeed, it’s sure to keep up as long as cowardly university “leaders” keep kowtowing to the campus fascists.

At Missouri, mobs alleging insufficient attention to supposed racial incidents forced the resignations of the school’s president and chancellor. The protesters are now demanding racial hiring quotas and — surprise — more funding.

Yale President Peter Salovey, saying student protests had left him “moved, challenged and encouraged,” announced the creation of a new center for “exciting scholarship” on “race, ethnicity and other aspects of society” and pledged $50 million to “enhance campus diversity.”

Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber, also caving to mob demands, agreed to begin a process to consider removing former President Woodrow Wilson’s name from campus and to enhance cultural sensitivity training for faculty.

A student gang rampaged through the Dartmouth library, disrupting studies and shouting expletive-laced racial insults. The vice provost for student affairs apologized — to the protesters, for the “conservative world out there that’s not being very nice.”

Time after time, university officials moved to appease the extremists — giving in to demands and refusing to even condemn the radicals’ attempts to suppress opposing views.

Sorely lacking being heard are voices like Purdue’s Mitch Daniels, a campus president who reaffirmed a commitment to “academic freedom and individual liberty” and drew a sharp contrast to Yale and Missouri.

Cravenly placating fascist mobs who shout down any effort at genuine dialogue will itself degrade campus life.

And without buying even temporary peace. The appeasement is guaranteed to encourage more protests — and increasingly extreme demands.
