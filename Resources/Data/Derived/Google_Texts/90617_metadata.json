But unlike the times that the smartest man to ever put up his feet on the table in the Oval Office thought that Austrian was a language or that the United States had 57 states, he wasn't misspeaking.\n\n44, as Politico likes to call him, was doing what 1 wouldn't do after he chopped down a cherry tree. And to call a lie, misspeaking, is itself a lie.\n\nRob Ford didn't misspeak when he claimed not to be on crack, despite being on crack. Barack Obama didn't misspeak when he promised to let you keep your health plan, when he had no intention of letting you do any such thing. And the New York Times didn't misspeak when it tried to pass that lie off as a mere slip of the tongue.\n\nThe New York Times, which never hesitated to call George W. Bush a liar, switched up its euphemisms and began calling Obama's lie an \"incorrect promise\". NBC News called it a \"promise they couldn't keep.\" The Associated Press called it an \"inflated promise.\"\n\nA few of their more honestly dishonest colleagues in the media argued that Obama did the right thing because he could never have pried the health plans of Americans out of their grubby little hands if he hadn't promised them that his government takeover of healthcare wouldn\u2019t affect them. Some of the pundits making that argument included those on Obama's regular reading list.\n\nThe excuse that Obama lied blatantly about the impact of a law he wanted to pass in order to pass it will no doubt be a great comfort to those gun owners who were willing to trust that his crusade against gun rights would stop where he told them it would and those Republican supporters of amnesty for illegal aliens who believed that he really would secure the borders once he got his millions of newly minted Democratic Party voters.\n\nIf Obama lied to pass one law, what sensible argument can any of his supporters make for believing him the next time he promises, \u201cIf you like your guns, you can keep your guns\u201d or \u201cIf you like your borders, you can keep your borders\u201d?\n\nObama wasn't the first politician to lie. He won't be the last. But most politicians who lie don't have an army of reporters swarming around them to explain that they didn't lie, but just inflated their misspeaking. One man did not get up in front of the microphones and cameras and lie over and over again. The entire liberal establishment lied. And it's still lying.\n\nThe media\u2019s lies and excuses, even more than the original Obama lie, reveal why liberals can never be trusted.\n\nIf Obama had only lied about being on crack or with an intern, that might be an impeachable act, but an understandable human failing. But he wasn't lying to cover up something shameful that he did. He lied because he didn\u2019t think Americans deserved to keep their health plans\u2026 or the truth.\n\nObama lied because he is a liberal.\n\nThat Obama would lie was an inevitable as the sun rising in the morning and the taxman coming in the spring. The lie was baked into the nature of the progressive movement that he identified with and its social experiments with human lives for the greater good that he participated in.\n\nLying isn't incidental to a liberal. Liberal is another word for liar. Someone who believes, as Obama and his media cronies do, that Americans are too stupid and ignorant to be trusted to choose their own health care, isn't about to trust them with the truth.\n\nLiberals don't believe that the people they lie to are their equals. If they did, not only wouldn't they lie to them, but they wouldn't subscribe to a skewed leftist take on liberalism that compels them to take away choices from people for their own good.\n\nYou don't take away someone's right to choose unless you think that they are inferior to you.\n\nIf you think that the next person over can run his life just as well as you run yours, then there's no reason to take over his life and to lie to him about it. But if you think that he\u2019s probably a racist moron who worships the flag and clings to his gun and bible and can't be trusted to buy a car, raise his kids, drink a large soda and see a doctor; then you're probably a liberal.\n\nAnd a liar.\n\nThat's the difference between liberals and conservatives. Conservatives respect people's choices. Liberals don't. And if you don't respect someone's choices; you don't respect them.\n\nIf you think that the average person is a moron, then the only answer is to set up to a totalitarian system to nudge the marching morons into the death panels for their own greater good while lying to them that the death panelists are really the judges for the next hot talent competition.\n\nIf ordinary people don't deserve the basic decency of being allowed to make decisions about their own health care, then they also don't deserve the basic decency of not being lied to their faces about those decisions being taken away from them.\n\nIf Obama had trusted and respected Americans, he wouldn't have lied to them about ObamaCare. But if he had really trusted and respected them, he wouldn't have inflicted ObamaCare on them.\n\nObama's crime isn't the lie. The lie is the cover-up of the crime. The crime is that Obama packaged a tax, a welfare program and a government takeover of health care together and called it reform.\n\nThe media has shown that Obama's lie was no isolated incident by lying about the lie for the same reason that he told the lie. The health plan lie wasn't the lie of one politician protecting his reputation; it was the big lie of a liberal establishment protecting its agenda.\n\nThe liberal media manipulates its readers, listeners and viewers the same way that liberal governments manipulate their citizens. Unlike Clinton's lie, Obama's lie was not one man's mistake, but a movement's arrogance. And not only hasn't Obama stopped lying about his lie, but the media and the rest of his movement haven't stopped lying about his lie.\n\nObama\u2019s big health care lie shows why liberals can't be trusted. Any movement that believes its members are superior to ordinary people cannot be trusted to represent them or to tell them the truth.\n\n*\n\nDon't miss Jamie Glazov's video interview with Daniel Greenfield about Obama's Destructive Agenda, his Muslim Brotherhood Romance, the Anthony Weiner-Huma Abedin saga, and much, much more:\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "How Obama\u2019s lie proves liberals can\u2019t be trusted.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "How Obama\u2019s lie proves liberals can\u2019t be trusted.", "title": "Lying Liberal Liars", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/211148/lying-liberal-liars-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:21-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/211148/lying-liberal-liars-daniel-greenfield", "description": "How Obama\u2019s lie proves liberals can\u2019t be trusted.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lying Liberal Liars"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T19:35:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2e6\"", "article_summary": "The liberal media manipulates its readers, listeners and viewers the same way that liberal governments manipulate their citizens.\nUnlike Clinton's lie, Obama's lie was not one man's mistake, but a movement's arrogance.\nAnd not only hasn't Obama stopped lying about his lie, but the media and the rest of his movement haven't stopped lying about his lie.\nThe media has shown that Obama's lie was no isolated incident by lying about the lie for the same reason that he told the lie.\nThe New York Times, which never hesitated to call George W.
