The not\u00adable ex\u00adcep\u00adtion, however, is North Car\u00ado\u00adlina, where Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan state Sen. Bob Rucho wrote a law two years ago to move his state up and is now lead\u00ading a charge to keep it there\u201d\u201din vi\u00adol\u00ada\u00adtion of party rules de\u00adsigned to pre\u00adserve the early states\u2019 prestige.\n\nRucho\u2019s le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion in 2013 tethered North Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s primary date to South Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s in or\u00adder to give his state more in\u00adflu\u00adence in se\u00adlect\u00ading pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial nom\u00adin\u00adees. Since South Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s 2016 primary is ex\u00adpec\u00adted to take place on Feb. 20, North Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s would be on Feb. 23 un\u00adder that law.\n\nBut last year, the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee passed new rules that would strip del\u00adeg\u00adates from non\u00adtra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal states, like North Car\u00ado\u00adlina, that held too-early primar\u00adies. If North Car\u00ado\u00adlina holds its primary in Feb\u00adru\u00adary, it could lose at least two-thirds of its del\u00adeg\u00adates, mak\u00ading the state less im\u00adport\u00adant for can\u00addid\u00adates, not more.\n\nGOP Gov. Pat Mc\u00adCrory and the state Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party sup\u00adport mov\u00ading the primary back. Last week, Dav\u00adid Lewis, a state rep\u00adres\u00adent\u00adat\u00adive and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee\u00adman, in\u00adtro\u00adduced a bill that would es\u00adsen\u00adtially bump North Car\u00ado\u00adlina from Feb\u00adru\u00adary to March, cor\u00adrect\u00ading the con\u00adflict.\n\nBut the out\u00adspoken Rucho co\u00adchairs the le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive com\u00admit\u00adtee that over\u00adsees state elec\u00adtions, and he has al\u00adlies in the Sen\u00adate who op\u00adpose a later primary, mean\u00ading the meas\u00adure is un\u00adlikely to make any pro\u00adgress any\u00adtime soon. That puts them at odds with the state and na\u00adtion\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adment, who want the primary moved.\n\n\u201cSen\u00adat\u00ador Rucho is kind of a le\u00adgend here for be\u00ading one of the most can\u00adtan\u00adker\u00adous and hard-to-get-along-with sen\u00adat\u00adors,\u201d said Nath\u00adan Bab\u00adcock, the polit\u00adic\u00adal dir\u00adect\u00ador at the North Car\u00ado\u00adlina Cham\u00adber of Com\u00admerce. \u201cHe\u2019s not a \u2018go along to get along\u2019 type per\u00adson.\u201d\n\nSome North Car\u00ado\u00adlina GOP op\u00ader\u00adat\u00adives think those op\u00adposed to a March primary will ul\u00adti\u00admately give in and real\u00adize that the down\u00adsides of an earli\u00ader primary would out\u00adweigh the be\u00adne\u00adfits. But they know that, above all, Rucho is the one who needs to be con\u00advinced.\n\n\u201cOth\u00aders have told me be\u00adhind the scenes, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re go\u00ading to move it,\u2019\u201d one seni\u00ador North Car\u00ado\u00adlina Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan of\u00adfi\u00adcial said, re\u00adfer\u00adring to the state sen\u00adat\u00adors who sup\u00adport a Feb\u00adru\u00adary primary. \u201cBut Rucho\u2019s nev\u00ader cracked. He\u2019s al\u00adways said we\u2019re not go\u00ading to move it un\u00adless we get something out of it.\u201d\n\nThe way Rucho sees it, North Car\u00ado\u00adlina, where Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have had a great deal of elect\u00ador\u00adal suc\u00adcess in re\u00adcent years, de\u00adserves to have an early, po\u00adten\u00adtially mo\u00admentum-swinging role in pick\u00ading his party\u2019s pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial nom\u00adin\u00adee. Plus, he feels the state shouldn\u2019t be pen\u00adal\u00adized be\u00adcause its law was en\u00adacted well be\u00adfore the RNC\u2019s reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions were put in place.\n\n\u201cWe abided by their con\u00adcerns, and then all of a sud\u00adden a new ar\u00adbit\u00adrary rule said you can\u2019t come in earli\u00ader,\u201d Rucho said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know why they\u2019re tak\u00ading that ar\u00adbit\u00adrary ac\u00adtion and dis\u00aden\u00adfran\u00adchising North Car\u00ado\u00adlina voters since we abided by what their main con\u00adcern was in not in\u00adter\u00adfer\u00ading with the first four primar\u00adies.\u201d\n\nRucho said he has yet to have the op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to meet with the RNC to dis\u00adcuss his con\u00adcerns, and un\u00adtil he does, the Sen\u00adate isn\u2019t likely to take ac\u00adtion on Lewis\u2019s bill.\n\nIt\u2019s been clear for some time now that the tim\u00ading of North Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s primary would likely vi\u00adol\u00adate RNC rules, but the is\u00adsue had re\u00admained on the back burn\u00ader for the state le\u00adgis\u00adlature. Now, the pres\u00adsure to move the elec\u00adtion date is ratchet\u00ading up.\n\nIn late March, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Lt. Gov. Dan Forest called for a March 22 primary in 2016. Lewis, the au\u00adthor of the new House bill, said he\u2019s re\u00adceived \u201csev\u00ader\u00adal phone calls\u201d from RNC chair\u00adman Re\u00adince Priebus about the mat\u00adter.\n\n\u201cWe are con\u00adfid\u00adent that all states will be in com\u00adpli\u00adance with RNC rules,\u201d RNC spokes\u00adwo\u00adman Al\u00adlis\u00adon Moore said.\n\nLewis\u2019s bill would set North Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s primary for March 8. Un\u00adlike Forest\u2019s sug\u00adges\u00adtion, that date means del\u00adeg\u00adates would be al\u00adloc\u00adated pro\u00adpor\u00adtion\u00adally in\u00adstead of win\u00adner-take-all. But more than any\u00adthing, Lewis said he wanted to get the con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion star\u00adted in the le\u00adgis\u00adlature, adding that he\u2019s open to any date that\u2019s not in Feb\u00adru\u00adary to avoid los\u00ading a sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant share of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan del\u00adeg\u00adates.\n\nIt\u2019s happened be\u00adfore. In 2012, the RNC slashed Flor\u00adida\u2019s and Michigan\u2019s del\u00adeg\u00ada\u00adtions in half for hold\u00ading their primar\u00adies too early. Demo\u00adcrats pun\u00adished those states in 2008, too.\n\n\u201cNorth Car\u00ado\u00adlina can choose to com\u00adply and have the de\u00adsired im\u00adpact of the ori\u00adgin\u00adal le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion, which is to make North Car\u00ado\u00adlina voters\u2019 voices heard in a more rel\u00adev\u00adant way, or we can stick to this date and gamble wheth\u00ader or not the pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial cam\u00adpaigns will both\u00ader with such a small num\u00adber of del\u00adeg\u00adates to be picked up,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nLewis and Rucho have worked to\u00adgeth\u00ader on ma\u00adjor is\u00adsues be\u00adfore, as the two headed up the state\u2019s re\u00addis\u00adtrict\u00ading ef\u00adfort in 2011. But state Sen\u00adate lead\u00aders have not got\u00adten along all that well with their coun\u00adter\u00adparts in the House, the state party, or the gov\u00adernor\u2019s of\u00adfice in re\u00adcent years. Last year, feud\u00ading with the state Sen\u00adate kept state House Speak\u00ader Thom Tillis, who was run\u00adning for Sen\u00adate, off the cam\u00adpaign trail for ex\u00adtra weeks at a time (Tillis won any\u00adway).\n\nLewis said he hopes to have the primary is\u00adsue re\u00adsolved by the end of May, though oth\u00aders spec\u00adu\u00adlated that the is\u00adsue could drag through the sched\u00aduled end of the le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive ses\u00adsion in Ju\u00adly. North Car\u00ado\u00adlina Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans an\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adate Lewis\u2019s bill will eas\u00adily pass through the House.\n\nBut Rucho hasn\u2019t blinked yet, and it\u2019s not clear that he will. A spokes\u00adwo\u00adman for Sen\u00adate Pres\u00adid\u00adent Pro Tem\u00adpore Phil Ber\u00adger said he is de\u00adfer\u00adring to Rucho giv\u00aden his po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion on the state\u2019s elec\u00adtions-over\u00adsight com\u00admit\u00adtee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Republican National Committee rules would punish the state for holding its primary in February as scheduled, but a GOP state senator stands in the way of a plan to move it.", "title": "North Carolina Could Jump the Line in the GOP Presidential Primaries", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/2015/04/08/north-carolina-could-jump-line-gop-presidential-primaries", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/03/20/nsteinimage-37628.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"site": "@nationaljournal", "image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/03/20/nsteinimage-37628.jpg"}, "description": "Republican National Committee rules would punish the state for holding its primary in February as scheduled, but a GOP state senator stands in the way of a plan to move it.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "North Carolina Could Jump the Line in the GOP Presidential Primaries"}, "description": "Republican National Committee rules would punish the state for holding its primary in February as scheduled, but a GOP state senator stands in the way of a plan to move it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rucho\u2019s le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion in 2013 tethered North Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s primary date to South Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s in or\u00adder to give his state more in\u00adflu\u00adence in se\u00adlect\u00ading pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial nom\u00adin\u00adees.\nBut last year, the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee passed new rules that would strip del\u00adeg\u00adates from non\u00adtra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal states, like North Car\u00ado\u00adlina, that held too-early primar\u00adies.\nOne \u201ccan\u00adtan\u00adker\u00adous\u201d North Car\u00ado\u00adlina le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00ador is threat\u00aden\u00ading to throw a wrench in\u00adto the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party\u2019s care\u00adfully planned pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial primary cal\u00aden\u00addar in 2016.\nNorth Car\u00ado\u00adlina Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans an\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adate Lewis\u2019s bill will eas\u00adily pass through the House.\nSince South Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s 2016 primary is ex\u00adpec\u00adted to take place on Feb. 20, North Car\u00ado\u00adlina\u2019s would be on Feb. 23 un\u00adder that law."}
