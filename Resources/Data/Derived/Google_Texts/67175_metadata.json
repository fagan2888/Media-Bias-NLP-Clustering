(WISH) \u2014 Police said a man was arrested Thursday morning after he set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s car on fire and led officers on a pursuit.\n\nPolice dispatchers with IMPD said at 6:47 a.m., officers started following a stolen vehicle near 13th Street and Southern Avenue in Beech Grove. A few minutes later, a vehicle pursuit began.\n\nPolice said Jordan Smith, 23, went westbound on Troy Avenue. Once he passed Keystone Avenue, the vehicle began passing other cars.\n\nThe pursuit lasted for a few minutes. At Troy and Shelby, the vehicle lost control, hit a utility pole and knocked over a traffic light. The car then caught fire and soon became completely engulfed in flames.\n\nOfficers took Smith into custody. An ambulance was called to the scene, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he suffered any injuries.\n\nPolice said the victim, Erica Brenton, 20, told officers that Smith, who is her ex-boyfriend, came to the home, set a rag on fire and put it in her gas tank, then left.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police said a man was arrested Thursday morning after he set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s car on fire and led officers on a pursuit.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wish", "og": {"site_name": "WISH-TV", "description": "Police said a man was arrested Thursday morning after he set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s car on fire and led officers on a pursuit.", "title": "Police: Ex-boyfriend set woman\u2019s car on fire", "url": "http://wishtv.com/2014/07/03/police-chase-ends-in-crash-car-fire-on-indys-south-side/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/jordan-smith.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police said a man was arrested Thursday morning after he set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s car on fire and led officers on a pursuit.", "title": "Police: Ex-boyfriend set woman\u2019s car on fire", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/jordan-smith.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WISH_TV", "site": "wish_tv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488524387", "fb": {"pages": 51020120862}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WISH-TV", "google-site-verification": "-0bIsWnsWP_Tti2P_v5CM_6E-Jif4gWmQWQHbxcE9q4", "keywords": "Beech Grove - Indiana, Marion County, Local News, News, Top Video, Staff Reports", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wishtv", "published_time": "2014-07-03T11:13:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T16:51:27+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wishtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3eda613633012e4513b3dffff2e4b0bc?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceccc\"", "article_summary": "(WISH) \u2014 Police said a man was arrested Thursday morning after he set his ex-girlfriend\u2019s car on fire and led officers on a pursuit.\nPolice said the victim, Erica Brenton, 20, told officers that Smith, who is her ex-boyfriend, came to the home, set a rag on fire and put it in her gas tank, then left.\nA few minutes later, a vehicle pursuit began.\nPolice said Jordan Smith, 23, went westbound on Troy Avenue.\nPolice dispatchers with IMPD said at 6:47 a.m., officers started following a stolen vehicle near 13th Street and Southern Avenue in Beech Grove."}
