“You can’t keep teasing it. I think he’s a great manager, a great chief executive. He has management skills that our president, the 44th president Barack Obama, did not bring to the job,” Geraldo told hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover about Trump.

The 68-year-old real estate mogul has long hinted at a run for public office. In a Monday interview, “Access Hollywood’s” Bush said to him, “Most people think there’s no way you’re running.”

“People do think that,” Trump replied. “But we’ll see what happens. But people do think that. There’s no question about it. But I may surprise a lot of people.”

“Donald runs a multibillion dollar business,” Rivera said on Tuesday. “I think he’d be a great chief executive but he can’t keep teasing. He’s got to do it, spend some money, spend some effort, and really run and see what the voters think.”
