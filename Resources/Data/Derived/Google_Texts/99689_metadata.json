Their conversation stayed mostly light and steered clear of specific controversies (though Colbert did make a Kim Davis joke in his intro segment), but things got interesting when the host brought up the ban on cameras in the Court.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is about the last place in America where I couldn\u2019t bring my camera crew in to shoot what the government is doing, to get video of what the government is doing,\u201d Colbert said midway through the interview. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we watch you if the Supreme Court repeatedly rules that we can be watched by the government?\u201d he asked to applause from the audience.\n\nBreyer admitted there are \u201cvery good arguments\u201d on both sides of the issue, but when Colbert joked that the Justice could use the hypothetical cameras to promote his new book, The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities , from the bench, he said, \u201cRight there, in just what you\u2019ve said, you\u2019ve given part of the answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a job where we wear black robes, in part, because we\u2019re speaking for the law,\u201d Breyer said. \u201cEverybody know we\u2019re human beings\u2026 but the country doesn\u2019t want to know the Constitution according to Breyer or according to O\u2019Connor \u2014 they want to know what the answer to this thing is. That\u2019s true of the process.\u201d\n\nBecause, as Breyer explained, \u201cthe oral argument is about 5 percent of the basis for deciding a case\u201d \u2014 with the other 95 percent based on writing \u2014 he believes the American people would get a skewed view of the process. \u201cHuman beings, correctly and decently, relate to people they see, and they\u2019ll see two lawyers and they\u2019ll see two clients,\u201d he added. \u201cWill they understand the whole story? Will they understand what we\u2019re doing? Will there be distortions? Now that\u2019s the arguments against you. The argument for you is that it would be a fabulous educational process.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd pretty entertaining sometimes, too,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nThe two men agreed to disagree on that point.\n\nWatch video below, via CBS:\n\n[Photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Colbert welcomes his first Supreme Court Justice to the Late Show Monday night in the form of President Bill Clinton-appointee Stephen Breyer.
