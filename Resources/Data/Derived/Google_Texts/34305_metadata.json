An embarrassing (sorry, Peyton) mess. Injuries alone don\u2019t explain or excuse it. This is starting to be remindful of the Rockies, or the Broncos under the reign of Josh McDaniels.\n\nYou\u2019re left shaking your head and wondering: Do they know what they\u2019re doing?\n\nThe saving grace for the Nuggets has been the preoccupation locally with the Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl run \u2014 and even the angst and postmortems after their flop \u2014 that diverted attention.\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 issues go to competence and leadership. We\u2019re not seeing much of it, not on the floor, not from Brian Shaw and the coaching staff, not from general manager Tim Connelly and the front office, and not from ownership \u2014 the same ownership that was so adroit in hiring the right people and providing support, but mostly staying out of the way during the Avalanche turnaround.\n\nI\u2019ve been accused of fixating on the Andre Miller fiasco the past six weeks. Guilty. But that\u2019s better than ignoring it or waving off his absence as addition by subtraction because he\u2019s a 37-year-old point guard who pounds the ball too much in the backcourt. Or saying what the heck, this team is already caught in the NBA\u2019s no-man\u2019s land \u2014 no playoffs, yet long odds against landing a high first-round pick (whether Denver\u2019s own or the New York Knicks\u2019 choice) \u2014 so play the \u201ckids,\u201d even out of position, and beseech the lottery gods.\n\nThe Miller situation has been farcical. There was the game-night argument, the two-game suspension that was immediately rescinded, then the agreement that Miller would stay away from the team. It has come off as if both sides had a tacit understanding that they had enough on each other to make this even messier if the mud-slinging began, so all would maintain silence.\n\nBut that\u2019s old news. Now, it\u2019s not really about Miller. More important, the Miller fiasco is symptomatic and ominous.\n\nDo they know what they\u2019re doing?\n\nWhen Ty Lawson missed four of the past six games with, first, a shoulder injury, and now with a broken rib, the Nuggets tried getting by with zero natural point guards. Zero. Making $5 million and taking up one of the maximum 15 guaranteed contract roster spots, Miller has been working out and waiting for a trade.\n\nMiller should have been told this long ago, but it\u2019s imperative that he\u2019s told now. Be at practice Monday at 5 p.m., when the Nuggets reconvene from the break, or the team will find a way not to pay him.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a case of Shaw and the Nuggets coaxing or \u201caccepting\u201d him back, or demanding that he return. Shaw has said that he can coach anyone who wants to play \u201cright,\u201d and that short of personal conduct or words that cross the line to threatening someone, nothing can be taken personally.\n\nMiller, offended by an imminent DNP line on the box score and a diminished role as Shaw tightened his rotation, lashed out. He needs to stop acting like a baby.\n\nNo matter what was said that New Year\u2019s night in heated moments that also apparently included at least one other player getting involved in what seemed to become a mini-revolt, the rift should be mendable. Or, it should be at least mendable enough that all can at least acknowledge the obligations of professionalism and the really awful things a guy has to do to collect $5 million a year.\n\nIf Miller agrees to return, playing him now isn\u2019t a concession that he \u201cwon.\u201d It\u2019s an acknowledgment that circumstances have changed. And, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Memo to Denver Nuggets: Clean up your mess", "title": "Frei: Memo to Denver Nuggets: Clean up your mess", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/16/frei-memo-to-denver-nuggets-clean-up-your-mess/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__ty-lawsonp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__ty-lawsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T20:22:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:25:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda71b\"", "article_summary": "Coming out of the all-star break, the Nuggets are a mess.\nIf Miller agrees to return, playing him now isn\u2019t a concession that he \u201cwon.\u201d It\u2019s an acknowledgment that circumstances have changed.\nThis is starting to be remindful of the Rockies, or the Broncos under the reign of Josh McDaniels.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a case of Shaw and the Nuggets coaxing or \u201caccepting\u201d him back, or demanding that he return.\nMiller should have been told this long ago, but it\u2019s imperative that he\u2019s told now."}
