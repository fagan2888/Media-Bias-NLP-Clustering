These measures largely involve changes to the West Virginia Medical Professional Liability Act (MPLA), the law governing suits against health care providers in West Virginia. Paul \u201cKip\u201d Reese worked during the session as a committee lawyer at the West Virginia Legislature, and was therefore intimately involved in helping the legislators analyze and write many of the changes to the MPLA. If you have any questions about any of the changes, or the legislative process in general, Kip can provide a unique perspective.\n\nSome of the most significant changes to the MPLA for LTC providers are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Expands the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d so that it includes virtually any employee, agent or officer of the nursing home, including administrators, officers of \u201cupstream\u201d corporate entities, dietary staff and CNAs;\n\n\u2022 Expands the definition of \u201chealth care\u201d to specifically include such things as \u201ccustodial care or basic care,\u201d turning/positioning, hydration, staffing, credentialing, and nutrition. This should help to eliminate any argument by plaintiffs that certain acts performed by nursing homes are not \u201chealth care\u201d and therefore not governed by the damage caps and other limitations of the MPLA. Virtually any activity performed by a nursing home in connection with patient care is now governed by the MPLA and its non-economic damage caps;\n\n\u2022 Specifically includes \u201cupstream corporate\u201d entities who own or control nursing homes within the framework of the MPLA and the damage caps;\n\n\u2022 Places limitations on how state surveys, audits, and \u201cF-tags\u201d can be used against nursing homes as evidence at trial;\n\n\u2022 Places a hard \u201cceiling\u201d on the inflation adjustment to non-economic damage caps; and\n\n\u2022 Creates a rebuttable presumption that staffing was appropriate where a nursing home complies with state minimum staffing requirements.\n\nThese changes are clearly helpful to LTC providers in West Virginia, but they apply only to actions filed after July 1, 2015. You may see a sudden increase in suit filings prior to July 1 by plaintiffs who are attempting to avoid these new provisions.\n\nPlease see the attached summary of the MPLA changes for more information, as well as the attachedfull text of Senate Bill 6, which contains the verbatim changes to the MPLA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During its recent 2015 session, the West Virginia Legislature passed significant tort reform measures impacting Long Term Care providers", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/west-virginia-legislature-changes-medical-professional-liability-act", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "type": "article", "description": "During its recent 2015 session, the West Virginia Legislature passed significant tort reform measures impacting Long Term Care (LTC) providers.
