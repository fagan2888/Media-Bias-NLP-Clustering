I also didn\u2019t need to be told, once more, about how Gordon Moore came up with \u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u201d \u2014 his famous prediction that computer chip performance would double every 18 months. And I certainly didn\u2019t need to reacquaint myself with how Andy Grove\u2019s childhood in Hungary during World War II and under the Soviet thumb contributed to the kind of hard-charging relentless paranoia necessary to \u201cbuild the world\u2019s most important company.\u201d\n\nThose are all good and fascinating stories, and nobody knows the history of the chip industry better than longtime tech journalist Michael Malone. So if you don\u2019t know them, then \u201cThe Intel Trinity\u201d is a fine introduction to the founding myths legends of Silicon Valley. But these tales have been told many times before. I decided to read \u201cThe Intel Trinity\u201d because I was looking for something a little different. Love it or hate it, Silicon Valley, right now, has never enjoyed more political, cultural or economic influence. From whence did this power spring? The case can easily be made that Noyce, Moore and Grove were as responsible as anyone for how the Valley currently conducts itself. Their DNA lives on, in the venture capital companies that line Sand Hill Road, in the board rooms of Facebook and Google. So it seemed not just worthwhile to get a refresher course in how it all happened \u2014 it also seemed crucially important. Silicon Valley\u2019s success today is fraught with complexities that few people, outside of science fiction writers, imagined when the first microprocessor chips started rolling out of fabrication plants. Myths and legends take on a different hue when their inheritors transform from canny geeks to masters of the universe. It\u2019s more pressing than ever to figure out how we got here, from there.\n\nIn a Valley swamped by self-importance, it would also be easy to accuse Michael Malone of his own over-reaching hubris when you realize that his title, \u201cThe Intel Trinity,\u201d is a direct play on the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Really? Are we actually supposed to get down on our knees and worship these guys? But then again, there\u2019s no getting around it: the silicon chip has drastically changed our world. John Lennon overstepped when he boasted the Beatles were bigger than Jesus. But if Robert Noyce, the founder of both Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, had said the same thing about the first microprocessor, he wouldn\u2019t have been wrong. Silicon Valley arrogance does not come from nowhere. It is embedded, like millions of miniaturized transistors, in the holy silicon wafer.\n\nBut this is not necessarily a permanent state of affairs. If there is one great lesson from \u201cThe Intel Trinity,\u201d it is that nothing about the Valley is set in stone. Even Moore\u2019s Law! As Malone stresses at numerous points, Moore\u2019s Law is not actually a law. There are no physical or economic realities that mandate that chips will keep getting smaller and cheaper. Moore\u2019s Law, Malone explains, was also a promise: \u201ca unique cultural contract made between the semiconductor industry and the rest of the world to double chip performance every couple of years and thus usher in an era of continuous, rapid technological innovation and the life-changing products that innovation produced.\u201d\n\nMore than any other single company, Intel delivered on that promise. Intel catalyzed the modern era. The trinity of Noyce, Moore and Grove are responsible for the pervading psychological tenor of our times, in which change is the only constant.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty big deal \u2014 and well worth revisiting.\n\n***\n\nThe opening paragraph of \u201cCramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits\u201d by Gordon Moore, published on April 19, 1965, is one of the better technology forecasting documents ever printed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The soul of Silicon Valley: How Intel built a world of relentless technological change", "author": "Andrew Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The soul of Silicon Valley: How Intel built a world of relentless technological change", "title": "Metronome for the modern age", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/metronome_for_the_modern_age/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/intel_trinity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The soul of Silicon Valley: How Intel built a world of relentless technological change", "creator": "@koxinga21", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/intel_trinity.jpg", "title": "Metronome for the modern age", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Metronome for the modern age", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Andy Grove, Editor's Picks, Gordon Moore, Intel, Michael Malone, Robert Noyce, Silicon Valley, The Intel Trinity", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2717\"", "article_summary": "I decided to read \u201cThe Intel Trinity\u201d because I was looking for something a little different.\nLove it or hate it, Silicon Valley, right now, has never enjoyed more political, cultural or economic influence.\nSo if you don\u2019t know them, then \u201cThe Intel Trinity\u201d is a fine introduction to the founding myths legends of Silicon Valley.\nThe trinity of Noyce, Moore and Grove are responsible for the pervading psychological tenor of our times, in which change is the only constant.\nEven Moore\u2019s Law!"}
