Let\u2019s put it down to another inflection in the many inflections of being Jew-ish.\n\nJews are a practical people. They deal with this world not the next. They are an argumentative people. They know that truth may be a matter of disputation, or may be arrived at only through disputation. They tend to accept that being Jewish, one may have to be Jew-ish at times, fall a little short, be a little approximate.\n\nI have a column to write. Deadlines are unforgiving. Less forgiving than this Day of Atonement, whose significance was expressed in a phrase of Maimonides: \u201cWe have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, have cast them behind our backs, and removed them from us as far as possible.\u201d\n\nI love that \u201cas far as possible.\u201d Jews, as I said, are a practical people. Their interest is in the feasible not in magic wands.\n\nThis is a day of the inward gaze, of breaking from the world. It is a time for turning the mind and soul elsewhere, away from the ephemeral toward the eternal, away from multitasking toward mercy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA column is very much of this world. Once published, it is debated in real time, commented on, bounced across social media, its clicks counted; and so publication, no longer a singular event, becomes a process that may be protracted and distracting. Life today is a battle against distraction. You start off intent on doing one thing and end up doing another. Or not doing anything at all.\n\nIt feels good, then, to set aside pretense of action for the fecund inaction of sitting still in synagogue, in my case the beautiful 175-year-old West London Synagogue, to listen to many things (including silence); and to reflect, arrested now and then by a phrase or just by the sunlight glinting through stained glass into a place of proportions that speak of harmony.\n\nHow inexhaustible are the words of the sage Hillel: \u201cIf I am not for myself, who is for me? But if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now when?\u201d\n\nA couple of millennia have not produced a better summation of realism allied to humanity allied to the urgency of the deed, nor a more powerful injunction against self-delusion, selfishness and procrastination.\n\nI had arrived in London from the Greek island of Lesbos, where thousands of refugees who have fled the Syrian war are entering Europe every day on inflatable rafts. \u201cRefugees Welcome,\u201d said a banner at the entrance to the synagogue \u2014 scarcely the general view of Britain or its government. Jews, part of what Stefan Zweig called \u201cthe ever-recurring \u2014 since Egypt \u2014 community of expulsion,\u201d cannot in good conscience turn their backs on the expelled.\n\nIn different renderings, throughout the day, a cornerstone of Jewish ethics was expressed: \u201cYou shall love the stranger as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201d Recall what it is to be driven out of your land with no land to go to.\n\nAt no time did I hear of the God of dangerous certainties endemic to every form of fundamentalism. I did not hear of a God of revealed truths used to stoke the fires of confrontation between peoples, nor of an unforgiving God invoked by believers to justify zealotry or beheadings or discrimination or exclusive claims to land. No, this was the God of \u201cwhoever saves one soul, it counts as if he saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nJews came up with the idea of a faceless God with whom they had a covenant, and that covenant \u2014 binding over thousands of years of uprooted wandering \u2014 was in essence a covenant of ethics. For a long time it was a covenant of the powerless. It would be a terrible outcome if it proved irreconcilable with the exercise of power, now that the long-awaited return to Jerusalem has occurred, and a strong and vibrant modern Israel exists whose founding charter of 1948 says the state will be based on \u201cfreedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel.\u201d\n\nThose prophets\u2019 word was present in the synagogue. Zealotry is not the answer to zealotry. Being a practical people who have learned through the ultimate trial that without power survival itself is at risk cannot mean Jewish acquiescence to the injustice of dominion over another displaced people, the Palestinians. The teachings of the \u201ccommunity of expulsion\u201d demand ever-renewed commitment to inclusion, even when it seems hopeless. Justice and peace are incompatible with the status quo in the Holy Land.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps such ideas are Jew-ish, the delusions of which \u201creal Jews\u201d in their absolutist certainties have rid themselves. But I will take the \u201cas far as possible\u201d of the Jewish philosopher over the all-or-nothing conviction of the Messianic Jewish settler.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150924065716, "twitter": {"description": "Being part of Stefan Zweig\u2019s \u201ccommunity of expulsion,\u201d Jews cannot now turn their backs on the expelled.", "title": "Jews as Far as Possible", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/opinion/jews-as-far-as-possible.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003934181"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "NYTimesCohen", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/cohen-circular/cohen-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/opinion/jews-as-far-as-possible.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003934181", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/opinion/jews-as-far-as-possible.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Jews as Far as Possible", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 24, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Jews and Judaism,Yom Kippur", "CN": "roger-cohen", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Roger Cohen", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/cohen-circular/cohen-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROGER COHEN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Being part of Stefan Zweig\u2019s \u201ccommunity of expulsion,\u201d Jews cannot now turn their backs on the expelled.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/cohen-circular/cohen-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "description": "Being part of Stefan Zweig\u2019s \u201ccommunity of expulsion,\u201d Jews cannot now turn their backs on the expelled.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/columns/rogercohen/", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-09-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Yom Kippur", "published": "2015-09-24", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "25edcohen25", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150926152712, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/opinion/jews-as-far-as-possible.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/cohen-circular/cohen-circular-superJumbo-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "Being part of Stefan Zweig\u2019s \u201ccommunity of expulsion,\u201d Jews cannot now turn their backs on the expelled.", "title": "Jews as Far as Possible"}, "pdate": 20150924, "des": "Yom Kippur", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/roger-cohen", "tagline": "International affairs and diplomacy.", "uri": "/column/roger-cohen", "display-name": "Roger Cohen", "identifier": "roger-cohen", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003934181, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Jews as Far as Possible", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb086\"", "article_summary": "But I will take the \u201cas far as possible\u201d of the Jewish philosopher over the all-or-nothing conviction of the Messianic Jewish settler.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyPerhaps such ideas are Jew-ish, the delusions of which \u201creal Jews\u201d in their absolutist certainties have rid themselves.\nLess forgiving than this Day of Atonement, whose significance was expressed in a phrase of Maimonides: \u201cWe have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, have cast them behind our backs, and removed them from us as far as possible.\u201dI love that \u201cas far as possible.\u201d Jews, as I said, are a practical people.\nJews, part of what Stefan Zweig called \u201cthe ever-recurring \u2014 since Egypt \u2014 community of expulsion,\u201d cannot in good conscience turn their backs on the expelled.\nThey tend to accept that being Jewish, one may have to be Jew-ish at times, fall a little short, be a little approximate."}
