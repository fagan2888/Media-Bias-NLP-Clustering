That\u2019s because sometimes, there\u2019s nothing better than getting buzzed on a couple of dollars \u2014 and since we're not that fancy, who cares if the wine tastes more like weird juice than alcohol.\n\nBut a new lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday claims that several varieties of cheap wine \u2014 including Trader Joe\u2019s Charles Shaw White Zinfandel and brands like Sutter Home \u2014 may contain \u201cunsafe\u201d levels of arsenic, a chemical element that\u2019s found in both human and natural sources, particularly rocks, volcanoes, pesticides, and mining ores.\n\nThe lawsuit, which consists of four wine consumers from Southern California, lists 83 wines that have levels of arsenic higher than what\u2019s deemed safe for consumption (about 10 parts per billion in drinking water). According to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, Brian Kabateck, the lawsuit began when a former wine industry employee tested 1,306 wines because he was \u201ccurious\u201d about arsenic levels.\n\nThere is currently no standard for levels of arsenic in wine in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s not an indictment of the wine industry,\u201d Kabateck said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThe vast majority do it right. We brought this lawsuit because this is a very serious public health concern. We would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately. If not voluntarily, we would ask the court to do it.\u201d As a supplement to the lawsuit, the website TaintedWine.com was created for consumers to read more about the issue.\n\nBut there is still no real scientific evidence that the arsenic levels in these 83 wines are going to harm you. There\u2019s arsenic in a lot of things. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the chemical may be present in many different foods, including grains, fruits, and vegetables, since it\u2019s absorbed through from soil and water. Rice and fish also typically have higher levels of arsenic. While more research is needed, the FDA states that it\u2019s currently assumed long-term exposure to high amounts of arsenic could lead to a higher risk of skin, bladder, and lung cancers, as well as heart disease.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s and other wineries have condemned the lawsuit\u2019s claims. The Wine Institute released a statement, noting that \u201carsenic is prevalent in the natural environment in air, soil and water, and in food. There is no research that shows that the amounts found in wine pose a health risk to consumers.\u201d\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s, meanwhile, says the company is looking into it. \u201cWhile we do not comment on pending litigation, we are investigating the matter with several of our wine-producing suppliers,\u201d said Rachel Broderick, a Trader Joe\u2019s spokeswoman, in a statement. \u201cWe will not offer any product we feel is unsafe. Ever. We have no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe, including Charles Shaw White Zinfandel.\u201d She said that the lawsuit \u201cis without merit and we will vigorously contest it, as all Korbel products are perfectly safe to enjoy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cheap wines, arsenic", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cheap wines may contain arsenic levels higher than what's considered safe, according to a new lawsuit.
