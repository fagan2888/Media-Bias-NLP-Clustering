The chamber\u2019s outnumbered Democrats began to stall by asking extensive questions and then abruptly stopped, only to resume again early in the evening. By then it was unclear if there was still enough fodder on the agenda for their \u201cchubbing\u201d to work.\n\nLate Tuesday, the House was debating the gun measure, though it was unclear if it would pass.\n\nSeveral Republicans said that after the initial slowdown, Speaker Joe Straus intervened in the early afternoon, to get things moving. There were conflicting accounts, though, of precisely how Straus, a San Antonio Republican, did so.\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chairman Tan Parker of Flower Mound said that in conversations with individual Democrats, \u201cthe speaker was firm that he would use everything,\u201d meaning parliamentary \u201cnuclear options,\u201d to shut down debate and force votes.\n\nStraus, though, was coy.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to Democrats,\u201d Straus told a reporter. \u201cBut I intend to get through this,\u201d he added, referring to the House\u2019s agenda.\n\nOne consideration may have been that the campus carry bill is part of a grand bargain on tax cuts, border security, guns and ethics. The deal may allow lawmakers to finish their work Monday, as scheduled, instead of having a special session.\n\nAs passed by the Senate, the campus carry measure would allow the licensed concealed carrying of handguns in most public university buildings. There were rumblings the House might restore a campus-by-campus opt-in provision, as it did two years ago, or let the measure die when the clock struck midnight.\n\nWhether Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and his GOP allies in the Senate would consider that a breach of the grand bargain remained unclear.\n\nIntense day\n\nThe floor tactics led to an intense, sometimes dizzying day in the House. Republicans slammed Democrats and targeted some of their legislation, and when Democrats relented and let action speed up, some lamented that they had given up too easily.\n\nRep. Trey Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, said Republicans should blame themselves. He noted that GOP leaders revived the abortion coverage bill late Sunday. Under House rules, that required a 36-hour notice, which made the agenda with many of the hot-button bills ineligible for consideration until nearly noon on a crucial day, he said.\n\nMidnight Tuesday was the deadline for tentatively passing Senate bills.\n\nRepublicans signaled they would try to free up more time for the hot-button bills by shoving onto Wednesday\u2019s agenda a bloc of Senate bills that already have won preliminary House approval \u2014 and could wait another day.\n\nRep. Marisa Marquez of El Paso described Democrats\u2019 frustration.\n\n\u2018Enough already\u2019\n\nOpponents of abortion rights \u201chave gotten enough already,\u201d she said, noting that sweeping restrictions enacted two years ago have closed many abortion clinics. This year, lawmakers are close to finishing a bill tightening the judicial bypass that can allow pregnant teens to have an abortion without a parent\u2019s consent.\n\nMarquez noted that the insurance bill on abortion would block 31 other bills, some important to individual Democrats.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to get through to their bills that have a direct impact on their districts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time. We\u2019ve had numerous opportunities to debate reproductive health. \u2026 Enough.\u201d\n\nTo run out the legislative clock, Democrats began \u201cchubbing.\u201d One Republican has described the technique as the \u201cpractice of utilizing Texas House procedure, rules and the back mike to delay the clock.\u201d\n\nRep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, for example, soared to lofty rhetorical heights for nearly 10 minutes on a quotidian bill to keep the Texas Workforce Commission operating through 2027.\n\nAfter an hour or so of desultory debate on that and another bill, Republicans grew testy.\n\nRep. Ron Simmons, R-Carrollton, said some Democrats\u2019 tactics of feigning interest in minor bills and introducing amendments were \u201cmaking a mockery of this process.\u201d Fellow Republicans applauded.\n\nOthers took direct retaliation. House members defeated, 80-60, an innocuous bill offered by two Democrats on background checks for child care providers.\n\nDemocrats huddled privately. After a second private huddle of Democrats, the House got on track. In less than two hours, it passed about 40 bills.\n\nRep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, said he was upset that some senior Democrats relented.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given away too much leverage,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was talk that Martinez Fischer and other long-serving Democrats were worried the minority might be asking for too much, especially after gaining key House GOP leaders\u2019 cooperation in squelching bills aimed at unions and stopping hailstorm damage lawsuits.\n\nMartinez Fischer, though, called that too facile.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t view everything as a quid pro quo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s all about business.\u201d\n\nrtgarrett@dallasnews.com;\n\nmbarnett@dallasnews.com\n\nWhat\u2019s chubbing?\n\nChubbing is talking extensively on bills in hopes of endangering other measures further down the agenda as a deadline approaches. It\u2019s a longtime tactic in the Capitol.\n\nThe term\u2019s origins are steeped in mythology. Veteran lawmakers have recalled it going back to the 1960s.\n\nFormer Rep. Jim Jackson, R-Carrollton, has said that a long-forgotten representative named Joe Chub began the practice. And some have tied it the use of \u201cchubby\u201d \u2014 as in flabby speech. But no definitive source has been found.\n\nFrom staff reports\n\nAT A GLANCE: What\u2019s at stake\n\nSome measures that were in danger of dying late Tuesday as a key House deadline arrived:\n\nABORTION: A bill would have removed abortion coverage from insurance plans offered in the federal health care exchange. Some conservatives planned to expand the measure to bar the coverage from private and employer-provided insurance plans as well. Supporters say the change is necessary to guarantee that people who do not support abortion aren\u2019t paying for others to have the procedure by paying into an insurance plan. The proposal would have allowed women to buy coverage for abortion as an add-on to their base plan.\n\nCAMPUS CARRY: The bill would allow Texans with concealed handgun licenses to carry their firearms in most state university buildings. Republicans could still try to attach the measure as an amendment to another gun bill.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@RobertTGarrett @MarissaMBarnett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tension and retaliation were in play as a key legislative deadline arrived.", "og": {"description": "Tension and retaliation were in play as a key legislative deadline arrived.", "title": "Dizzying moves by Texas House Dems endanger \u2018campus carry,\u2019 abortion measures", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20150526-dizzying-moves-by-texas-house-dems-endanger-campus-carry-abortion-measures.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-05-27T06:29:13Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-05-27T03:57:51Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dizzying moves by Texas House Dems endanger \\u2018campus carry,\\u2019 abortion measures\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20150526-dizzying-moves-by-texas-house-dems-endanger-campus-carry-abortion-measures.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2311476\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-05-27T03:57:51Z\", \"section\": \"State Politics\", \"author\": \"ROBERT T.
