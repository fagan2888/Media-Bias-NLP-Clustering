Although 23 million people are expected to qualify for exemptions, huge delays from an overwhelmed IRS tasked with processing fraudulent Obamacare subsidies and legitimate exemptions ensures a coming administrative disaster.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObamacare greatly expands the authority and the scope of the Internal Revenue Service. Provisions of the law that resulted in the hiring thousands of new IRS agents and billions in funding include the enforcement of the individual mandate requiring most Americans to buy government-approved health insurance, enforcement of the employer mandate that forces most employers to take money out of workers\u2019 paychecks to purchase health insurance on their behalf, determination of fraudulent Obamacare subsidies, and granting of exemptions to qualifying individuals.\n\nThe CBO expects that of the 30 million Americans who remain uninsured by 2016, about 23 million are expected to qualify for exemptions from paying the Obamacare penalty fines. Those groups who are exempt include:\n\nUnauthorized immigrants, who are prohibited from receiving almost all Medicaid benefits and all subsidies through the insurance exchanges;\n\nPeople with income so low they are not required to file an income tax return;\n\nPeople who have income below 138% of the federal poverty guidelines (federal poverty level) and are ineligible for Medicaid because the state in which they reside has not expanded eligibility by 2016 under the option provided in the ACA;\n\nPeople whose premium exceeds 8% of their income in 2014 (indexed over time);\n\nPeople who are incarcerated; and members of Indian tribes;\n\nMembers of \u201crecognized religious sect\u201d with moral objections to health insurance;\n\n\u201cHealth care sharing ministries\u201d who have religious believers that have continuously pooled resources to fund medical expenses since 1999; and\n\nPersonal financial calamity and death in the family.\n\nThe challenge for those that believe they \u201cqualify\u201d for exemptions is to apply to the IRS and for the service to have the time to individually process their exemptions while overwhelmed with a massive amount of fraudulent and inappropriate subsidies.\n\nA July audit by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that manage Obamacare enrollments hired contractors that accept documents as authentic unless there are obvious alterations and are not required to detect fraud. When the GAO examined for fraud on the Obamacare exchanges, they found that 91% of fake applicants were able to get subsidized coverage on the exchanges.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Michigan) told NBC, \u201cWe are seeing a trend with Obamacare information systems: Under every rock, there is incompetence, waste, and the potential for fraud.\u201d Camp added. \u201cNow, we learn that in many cases, the exchange is unable to screen out fake identities or documents.\u201d\n\nSince the Obamacare subsidy frauds are going to be a direct hit on the U.S. Treasury, Congress will undoubtedly direct the IRS to concentrate their staff and resources on stopping fraud and collecting back subsidy dollars, rather than processing exemptions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty,\u201d George Brandes, V.P. of health care programs at Jackson Hewitt tax preparation service, told Politico. \u201cJust because you theoretically qualify for hardship, or another exemption, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get it.\u201d\n\nAbout 10% of Americans will remain uninsured when they calculate their income taxes and potential Obamacare penalties for the first time by April 15, 2015. Only those that filled out the exemption application, submitted the evidence regarding their qualification, and had the exemption approved will have received an IRS approved \u201cexemption certification\u201d number in the mail.\n\nThose whose exemption has been approved will then have to fill out a newly drafted tax form that will require the tax filer to state the number of days or months during the year they qualified for an exemption and then calculate how much penalty he or she will owe.\n\nAll of this guarantees an administrative disaster as the IRS is inundated with massive amounts of Obamacare paperwork and documents going back and forth. The IRS will be battling millions of Americans about subsidies the IRS determines they were not entitled to and exemptions the IRS will prove they are entitled to.\n\nChriss Street suggests that if you are interested in technology, please click on SILICON VALLEY TECH GIANTS SAY US SPYING MAY BUST-UP THE INTERNET", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare: IRS Nightmare over Fraudulent Subsidies and Exemptions", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obamacare: IRS Nightmare over Fraudulent Subsidies and Exemptions", "title": "Obamacare: IRS Nightmare over Fraudulent Subsidies and Exemptions - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/10/10/Obamacare-Enrollment-2-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/10/10/obamacare-irs-nightmare-over-fraudulent-subsidies-and-exemptions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare: IRS Nightmare over Fraudulent Subsidies and Exemptions", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/10/10/Obamacare-Enrollment-2-AP.jpg", "title": "Obamacare: IRS Nightmare over Fraudulent Subsidies and Exemptions - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dave Camp, NBC, Politico,Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Politico", "published_time": "2014-10-10T12:32:48-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1812\"", "article_summary": "Although 23 million people are expected to qualify for exemptions, huge delays from an overwhelmed IRS tasked with processing fraudulent Obamacare subsidies and legitimate exemptions ensures a coming administrative disaster.\nThe IRS will be battling millions of Americans about subsidies the IRS determines they were not entitled to and exemptions the IRS will prove they are entitled to.\nThe challenge for those that believe they \u201cqualify\u201d for exemptions is to apply to the IRS and for the service to have the time to individually process their exemptions while overwhelmed with a massive amount of fraudulent and inappropriate subsidies.\nThe CBO expects that of the 30 million Americans who remain uninsured by 2016, about 23 million are expected to qualify for exemptions from paying the Obamacare penalty fines.\nAll of this guarantees an administrative disaster as the IRS is inundated with massive amounts of Obamacare paperwork and documents going back and forth."}
