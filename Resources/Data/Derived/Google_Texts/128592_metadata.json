Rep. Diane Black (R-TN) described what a shame it was that such a previously thriving business had to close up shop thanks in part to Obamacare\u2019s stifling regulations and costs.\n\n\"We saw a real-life picture of the damage of Obamacare in my home state of Tennessee when a Music City institution \u2013 the Noshville Deli \u2013 announced this week that it would close its doors after 19 years because of the onerous mandates and high costs of this law. The restaurant\u2019s owner, Tom Loventhal, said that 'The administrative time and costs of managing mandated health insurance in the restaurant industry create an untenable burden, and that\u2019s before the cost of premiums.' He goes on to say, 'I\u2019ve spent many hours, including some sleepless nights trying to find a solution, but I can\u2019t find one.'\u201d\n\nLoventhal\u2019s story proves that Obamacare\u2019s negative impact on the country is more than a number. He is one of many people losing their livelihoods as a result of the president's health care overhaul.\n\nBlack praised Congress\u2019 reconciliation bill as a means of scaling back the damage Obamacare has done on small businesses and already struggling Americans across the country and hoped the president would come to his senses and put away his veto pen.\n\nFor now, the Tennessee representative told her Democratic colleagues to consider the Noshville Deli before ever singing Obamacare's praises again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Tennessee small business goes under thanks to Obamacare..05/26/2016 12:17:10PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A Tennessee small business goes under thanks to Obamacare.", "title": "TN Rep: Restaurant Owner Spent \u2018Sleepless Nights\u2019 Trying to Overcome Obamacare Costs Before Closing Business", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/12/10/tn-representative-restaurant-owner-spent-sleepless-nights-trying-to-overcome-obamacare-costs-before-closing-business-n2091654", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/12/9/25.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A Tennessee small business goes under thanks to Obamacare.", "title": "TN Rep: Restaurant Owner Spent \u2018Sleepless Nights\u2019 Trying to Overcome Obamacare Costs Before Closing Business", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/12/10/tn-representative-restaurant-owner-spent-sleepless-nights-trying-to-overcome-obamacare-costs-before-closing-business-n2091654", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/12/9/25.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "TN Rep: Restaurant Owner Spent \u2018Sleepless Nights\u2019 Trying to Overcome Obamacare Costs Before Closing Business , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3884\"", "article_summary": "Some of those lost salaries came from Noshville Deli, a restaurant that had stood for 19 years in Nashville, Tennessee.\nHe is one of many people losing their livelihoods as a result of the president's health care overhaul.\nFor now, the Tennessee representative told her Democratic colleagues to consider the Noshville Deli before ever singing Obamacare's praises again.\nHe goes on to say, 'I\u2019ve spent many hours, including some sleepless nights trying to find a solution, but I can\u2019t find one.\nGuy already brought us the unfortunate, yet unsurprising news that the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act has cost Americans about two million jobs."}
