(AP) - When the Rhode Island School of Design offered iconic filmmaker John Waters an honorary degree, he was surprised. After all, he got thrown out of every school he ever went to.\n\nKnown for quirky films that push the boundaries of good taste, including 1972\u2019s outrageous cult classic \u201cPink Flamingos,\u201d Waters is the keynote speaker at the prestigious art school\u2019s commencement next weekend.\n\nWaters will also receive an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree; recipients are chosen by the RISD community, and nominations are reviewed by a committee of students, faculty and staff.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I got a high school diploma. It\u2019s very peculiar. I feel very flattered,\u201d said Waters, who attended New York University briefly in the 1960s before getting kicked out for smoking marijuana on campus. \u201cI feel like the scarecrow in the \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 when they give him a brain.\u201d\n\nRISD\u2019s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee cited Waters\u2019 body of films as an \u201cenduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions, and define an expressive style,\u201d said RISD President Rosanne Somerson.\n\n\u201cIn the words of one nominator, he \u2018embodies the RISD \u2018tude galore\u2019,\u201d Somerson said.\n\nWaters will share a stage with three members of the band Talking Heads - two are RISD alumni - and New Yorker staff writer Adam Gopnik.\n\nWaters has written and directed more than a dozen films over his decades-long career, many of them low-budget movies featuring a cadre of unconventional characters, including drag queen Divine, Waters\u2019 longtime friend and muse. Waters saw mainstream success with 1988\u2019s \u201cHairspray,\u201d another cult classic that was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2002. He is also a published author and photographer.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been in school. You go to school to figure out what you wanted to do. I knew what I wanted to do,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI wish I had gone to RISD. They would have encouraged my ideas. I could have made \u2018Pink Flamingos.\u2019\u201d\n\nWaters does more writing these days than filmmaking: The paperback of his 2014 memoir \u201cCarsick: John Waters Hitchhikes Across America\u201d debuts this month. Waters said he was inspired to hitchhike from his native Baltimore to San Francisco because his life is so scheduled and controlled.\n\n\u201cMy inspiration has always been the same, which is human behavior I can\u2019t understand, which is always my interest, always has been,\u201d Waters said.\n\nThe filmmaker is looking forward to accepting his honorary degree, \u201cWithout irony, for one of the few times in my life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Rhode Island School of Design offered iconic filmmaker John Waters an honorary degree, he was surprised.
