He\u2019s missed a game with it after suffering the injury late in the fourth quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies last Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nuggets are expected to have the services of forward Darrell Arthur, who has been dealing with a sore knee. It hasn\u2019t caused him to miss any games, but he was held out of practice Tuesday as a precaution.\n\nAlso, Wilson Chandler will miss his ninth straight game.\n\nShaw says he\u2019s encouraging both Lawson and Chandler to return if they can by season\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d still like for them to try and get back to finish the season on the court as opposed to being off the court,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cSo I\u2019m encouraging if they can, to try to at least get another game under their belt and finish on that type of note. But if that\u2019s not the case, then so be it.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ty Lawson, Wilson Chandler out for Nuggets; coach urges both to return", "title": "Ty Lawson, Wilson Chandler out for Nuggets; coach urges both to return", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/09/ty-lawson-wilson-chandler-out-for-nuggets-coach-urges-both-to-return/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140409_125903_ty-lawson.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140409_125903_ty-lawson.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-09T12:56:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:44:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd421d\"", "article_summary": "Shaw says he\u2019s encouraging both Lawson and Chandler to return if they can by season\u2019s end.\nNuggets guard Ty Lawson did not participate in shootaround and will not play Wednesday night at the Pepsi Center against the Houston Rockets, coach Brian Shaw said.\n\u201cI\u2019d still like for them to try and get back to finish the season on the court as opposed to being off the court,\u201d Shaw said.\nHe\u2019s missed a game with it after suffering the injury late in the fourth quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies last Friday.\nMeanwhile, the Nuggets are expected to have the services of forward Darrell Arthur, who has been dealing with a sore knee."}
