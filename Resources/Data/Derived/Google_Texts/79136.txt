The leader of the Nation of Islam group in a recent interview spoke out against GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, warning Americans that the real estate mogul will take the country “into the abyss of hell” if he is elected in 2016.

In an interview on “The Cliff Kelly Show,” the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, charged that Mr. Trump’s leadership was not rooted in justice and said he is “tearing away the skin of the onion of white civility,” according to video he posted on Facebook Thursday.

“And the more he pulls the skin of that onion back, he’s beginning to show something in the character of the whites that follow him. That they don’t care what he says,” Mr. Farrakhan added.

He accused Mr. Trump of “exacerbating the race situation in America,” before warning that America is headed “into the abyss of hell.”

“And if you make a mistake in choosing your leaders, maybe you’ll go there faster,” Mr. Farrakhan added.

He also accused Mr. Trump of acting like a thug when he said in August that he would “knock the hell out of” the Islamic State terror group and “take the oil.”

Mr. Trump is not the first political figure Mr. Farrakhan has criticized.

The controversial Nation of Islam leader famously labeled President Obama a “murderer” over the death of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Last summer, Mr. Farrakhan made headlines when he called for an army of 10,000 to “rise up and kill those who kill us.”

In October, the Nation of Islam hosted the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., with the chilling theme “Justice or Else.”
