From more than a foot of snow in some places to slush and ice in others, it was a full day for plows in South Dakota.\n\nMorgan Ness of Pierre is planning a three-hour trip home on South Dakota roads Wednesday with her young daughter. Her sister, Dawn Dovre, will drive home, as well.\n\n\n\n\"We've been watching the weather, anticipating what will happen,\" Ness said.\n\n\n\nThat's what officials at the Departments of Public Safety and Transportation are asking drivers to do. Full tank of gas, cell phones charged and slow driving; those are just a few requests they have for those traveling regardless of where.\n\n\n\n\"We had snow, ice or wet roads pretty much state-wide,\" Greg Fuller, director of operations at the South Dakota Department of Transportation, said.\n\n\n\nBecause of that, crews were out statewide Tuesday. They are prepared to continue throughout the holiday travel season.\n\n\n\nFuller says crews will be out even on Christmas Day if needed. The South Dakota Highway Patrol has troopers working but will send more if needed as well.\n\n\"We make sure we know where folks are even if they're not working so if something happens or something develops quickly with just a few short phone calls and the chain of command structure that we have, we can allocate those resources really quite quickly if necessary,\" Col. Craig Price said.\n\n\n\nHe's asking drivers to do their part as well, monitoring Safe Travel USA for the latest travel conditions as they make final travel plans.\n\n\n\n\"I think it'll really depend on the drifting, how much the winds sustain overnight. So if it looks like the roads are going to deteriorate, we'll definitely wait until the morning,\" Dovre said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Drivers faced difficult road conditions during the holiday travel season Tuesday.
