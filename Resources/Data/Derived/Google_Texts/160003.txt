A jogger was running along the east side of Fountain Creek, near the wooden pedestrian bridge on the morning of Aug. 15, 2012 when he spotted a dog, a blue bike and a blood-drenched body.

The runner had just passed the same area along the Santa Fe Trail on the East side of Fountain Creek about 30 minutes earlier at 10:30 a.m. and hadn’t seen the dead man.

Several other people using the trail soon gathered near the body. Colorado Springs police were called.

The dead man had long shaggy, graying hair. He had been stabbed several times.

The amount of bleeding at the location where he was found suggested it was the same spot where he had been attacked, just south of Cimmaron Bridge.

A perimeter was set up. The El Paso County coroner’s office was called and the crime scene was searched.

The bearded dead man was a well-known transient, whose campsite was about three-quarters of a mile away.

John Vincent Knudsen was described by family as somewhat of a gypsy.

After his birth in Fort Ord, Calif., in 1956 Knudsen traveled through Europe and the United States as his father was frequently transferred to new U.S. Army assignments.

“These years of traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people and experiencing new things continued to influence John throughout the remainder of his life,” family members would write in an obituary.

He had gone throughout the country as a long-haul driver. He once worked in construction.

“John’s love for his dogs is legendary,” the obituary says.

Everywhere he went he was flanked by Reuben, Rusty or Booger Ray, his canine friends.
