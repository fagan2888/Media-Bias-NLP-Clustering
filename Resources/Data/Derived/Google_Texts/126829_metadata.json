No pension \u2013 According to the Congressional Research Service, as of Oct. 1, 2013, there were 367 former members of Congress who had retired under the Civil Service Retirement System, the old system that was criticized for being too generous. Those members were receiving an average annual pension of $71,664. The pensions of the 250 former members who retired under the Federal Employees Retirement System, which began in 1987, average less. Their average pension was $42,048 in 2013. Read the Bill \u2013 Not sure how this will be enforced, but obviously, the line references the anger and frustration that was felt when Nancy Pelosi infamously said of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d Follow the law \u2013 Wilcox writes that, \u201cMembers of Congress MUST live under the same laws that apply to the American people. If it\u2019s good enough for the nation you serve, it should be good enough for a Senator.\u201d Lifetime lobbying bill \u2013 Currently, the law requires House members to wait at least a year after leaving office before becoming lobbyists. Former senators, meanwhile, must wait at least two years. There have been several attempts in recent years for a lifetime lobbying ban, with none getting the votes in Congress to pass.\n\nWilcox has been the only non-politician in the race for Senate, but that will change next week when Manatee County developer Carlos Beruff enters the race, joining U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera in rounding out the five-man field.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "In a year where it\u2019s all about Republicans proving how much they hate Washington, candidates in Florida\u2019s Senate race are amping up their game to show their disdain for the current political culture.
