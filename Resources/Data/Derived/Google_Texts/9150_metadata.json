And so at the very stroke of 6 p.m. on Thursday, fashionistas in the cavernous Park Avenue Armory were thrown back into their seats with a huge, pounding \"BOOM!\" It was just really, really loud music, but it certainly got everyone's attention.\n\nThen, Jacobs kept that attention with a moody, stylish show that at some points seemed to channel some darkly romantic Victorian novel, perhaps by Dickens, and at others seemed utterly modern.\n\nThe show was heavy on long, pleated skirts, often topped by gorgeously tailored and embroidered coats, or capes. Some of the outfits were heavy enough to wear outside in the rapidly descending New York temperatures, and others were light enough to \u2014 well, one gown was totally sheer.\n\nThere were luxurious coats in black-and-white mink, and there was plenty of sparkle, too: in silvery metallic pleated skirts and jackets, for example, or on gowns covered with the brightest of sequins. Model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner, half-sister of Kim Kardashian, sported a sleek black coat over a floral pleated skirt.\n\nHer hair, like that of all the models, was pulled up into a topknot on the very front of her head. These distinctive hairdos \u2014 meant to elongate the neck, as in a swan \u2014 were accompanied by heavy silver-gray eye shadow and eggplant-colored lips, for a dramatic and elegant look apparently inspired partly by Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion columnist and editor who died in 1989.\n\nAmong Jacobs' guests at the show: singer Nicki Minaj, director Sofia Coppola, and actress Christina Ricci, a longtime Jacobs fan. \"It's the most exciting show, the most fun show,\" Ricci said. \"Such a creative mind, always doing something unexpected.\"\n\nSomething unexpected like, perhaps, those waiters offering guests glasses of vodka with a lemon twist when they arrived in from the cold? That was pretty creative, too.\n\n\u2014Jocelyn Noveck and Nicole Evatt\n\n____\n\nRALPH LAUREN'S WINTER WONDERLAND\n\nWith a model's tip of a high floppy hat for the cameras and others wrapped in furry shearling, Ralph Lauren put on a show of sexy \u2014 and warm \u2014 elegance.\n\nForget shades of grey. Lauren stuck mostly to taupe and cream, in suede platform boots, cozy cashmere sweaters and fringe on coats, collars, ponchos and capes. Wide suede belts hung at the hip, offering a little oomph to a few body-skimming looks.\n\nThere were wide-brimmed hats in tune with Lauren's signature vibe, but he threw in some warm, Russian-style gems in shearling worthy of weather that put this round of fall previews in the deep freeze.\n\nThere was also black, in a floral lace evening dress, another in velvet with a scant back strap and a beautifully tailored leather skinny pant and jacket set.\n\nSo what'd Lauren have on his mind?\n\n\"The mix of clothes,\" he said after the last of two shows. \"The very sharp black silhouettes for evening. Sexy, very bare. Daytime is cashmere and warm and (shearling) hats. The weather is changing and it sort of goes with the world.\"\n\nKanye West, who made his fashion week debut last week, sat on Lauren's front row with a smiling Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City.\n\n\"I love this so much. You know I love Ralph,\" West gushed. \"He's the No. 1 inspiration. He's the greatest designer of our time.\"\n\n\u2014Leanne Italie and Emerald Morrow\n\n____\n\nCALVIN KLEIN: A STOP FOR SALLY BOWLES\n\nOn her way to the Kit Kat Club in decadent 1930s Berlin, Sally Bowles stopped off at Calvin Klein.\n\nThat would be Sienna Miller, who just began a stint starring in \"Cabaret\" on Broadway, taking over for Emma Stone. Miller's been having a big year, with a major role in the movie \"American Sniper\" and now her theater gig. Dressed in chic winter white, she had the seat of honor next to Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Thursday's show.\n\n\"I'm very excited,\" she said before the models came out. \"Francisco (Costa) is a friend,\" she said of the Calvin Klein designer, \"and I've managed to squeeze it in between my play, so I'm really happy to be here.\"\n\nAs for the clothes, Costa was clearly favoring patchwork leather in coats, jackets and dresses this season; fully half of his runway looks had it, in black, blush, chocolate, eggplant and forest green.\n\nCosta also showed coats in haircalf, and dresses in a comfy-looking metallic knit. And he presented an extremely shiny patent leather peacoat, in burgundy and in black.\n\nThe designer said he was inspired by the very \"vocal\" type of woman he sees in New York \u2014 \"very strong, very confident,\" he said.\n\n\u2014Jocelyn Noveck and Nicole Evatt\n\n____\n\nPROENZA SCHOULER: PERFECT FOR A (VERY HIP) MUSEUM\n\nIt felt like no accident that Proenza Schouler showed their collection at the imposing (and now empty) Whitney Museum on Madison Avenue. Design duo Jack McCollough and Lazaro Fernandez are so innovative \u2014 even audacious \u2014 with fabric work, their garments could be shown in glass cases and wouldn't look out of place. But that would have been a shame, since many of the items \u2014 including some soft tweed coats with nice wide belts \u2014 seemed perfect for the freezing night air outside.\n\nWednesday's event drew an artsy crowd, all the better to appreciate the show's theme: The art movement called the New York School, a mid-20th century group of artists based in New York, including abstract expressionist painters. Particularly, the designers say they were inspired by the paintings of Helen Frankenthaler, and her \"instinctual and spontaneous approach\" to her art.\n\nThe designers say that led them not to overthink their designs, and clearly that worked for them, because the collection left many in the crowd gushing over the creativity on display.\n\nThe early part of the show \u2014 which took place in an upstairs gallery with models crisscrossing each other between the seated rows at a brisk pace \u2014 focused heavily on that thick, luxurious tweed, often in gray or black. There was also a striking \"spotted calf\" fabric that looked exactly what it sounds like.\n\nThe Proenza designers use titles for their fabrics that hint at the complex development process: \"Boiled felt,\" for example, and \"needle-punched chiffon-crepe.\" The collection moved from those comfy tweeds to gauzier items to dresses and tops that, like bandages, wrapped around the body and tied in back \u2014 no closures. If they literally looked like they had been stripped apart, it seems they had been. Drawing from the work of sculptor Robert Morris, \"clothes are cut, slashed and pieced together to create a feeling of movement and freedom,\" the designers wrote in a statement.\n\nOften designers' themes and inspirations sound silly and unrelated to the garments on show. Not here, though. Even the hosiery looked like a work of contemporary art \u2014 with huge oval holes making the black tights look like super-artsy fishnets.\n\n\u2014Jocelyn Noveck\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Fashion at twitter.com/AP_Fashion", "article_metadata": {"description": "NY Fashion Week: Swanlike creatures at Marc Jacobs - AP News: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Associated Press is all over .05/27/2016 3:32:56AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Associated Press is all over New York Fashion Week, from", "title": "AP News - NY Fashion Week: Swanlike creatures at Marc Jacobs", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/02/19/ny-fashion-week-proenza-schouler-on-the-art-of-fashion-n1959494", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\50\\f3db1208-d20a-432f-b720-032bbc5dfc39.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Associated Press is all over New York Fashion Week, from", "title": "AP News - NY Fashion Week: Swanlike creatures at Marc Jacobs", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/02/19/ny-fashion-week-proenza-schouler-on-the-art-of-fashion-n1959494", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/50/f3db1208-d20a-432f-b720-032bbc5dfc39.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "NY Fashion Week: Swanlike creatures at Marc Jacobs, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Associated Press is all over New York Fashion Week, from the runways to celebrities as eight days of fall previews come to a close Thursday.\n____MARC JACOBS: CLOSING FASHION WEEK WITH A BANG \u2014 AND A BOOMMarc Jacobs is known for starting his shows exactly on time, not almost 30 minutes late as most designers do.\nKanye West, who made his fashion week debut last week, sat on Lauren's front row with a smiling Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City.\nAmong Jacobs' guests at the show: singer Nicki Minaj, director Sofia Coppola, and actress Christina Ricci, a longtime Jacobs fan.\nHer hair, like that of all the models, was pulled up into a topknot on the very front of her head."}
