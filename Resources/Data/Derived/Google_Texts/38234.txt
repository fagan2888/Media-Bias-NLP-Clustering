Tuesday's volleyball season opener between Enka and North Henderson was close throughout even though the Sugar Jets won the match in straight sets, 3-0.

Enka took the first game 25-21 and scored the final three points of the second to win it 25-22. In the final game, North got within a point at 20-19 but ended up falling 25-21.

"We're just really young, and we're probably going to have to take our lumps early on," Lady Knight veteran coach Sue Moon said. "They just have a few more weapons than we do."

North's main weapon was junior power hitter Caroline Marsh, who finished the night with 24 kills and six blocks. The reigning Times-News Volleyball Player of the Year led Western North Carolina in kills last season with 586 kills.

Every time Marsh put down a kill against Enka, Sugar Jet senior Sallyanne Johnson answered back with a kill of her own. Kloyee Anderson, Abbie Trantham and Bailee Trantham were her supporting cast and had tips and dump kills that kept North's defense off balance.

Senior Alex Oates had a double double with 14 assists and 12 digs, and senior Megan Edwards had 12 digs to lead the defense.

The Lady Knights will have an eight-day break before returning to action on Aug. 27 at home against A.C. Reynolds.

In Tuesday's JV opener, North won 2-1 over Enka.
