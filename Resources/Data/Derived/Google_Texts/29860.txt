AUL said the state “has some of the nation’s most comprehensive laws protecting the health and safety of women seeking abortions and providing legal recognition and protection for the unborn.”Louisiana also ranked No. 7 in a national study of abortion laws by the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute that looked at state-imposed restrictions, The Washington Post reported in 2013 The state received an F grade from NARAL Pro-Choice America for its choice-related laws. That organization labeled Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal and the state legislature as “anti-choice” and pointed out that the state “has a near-total criminal ban on abortion that would take effect if Roe v. Wade were overturned.”Louisiana requires counseling 24 hours prior to a woman undergoing an abortion as well as an ultrasound. Minors seeking an abortion must have signed consent of a parent or guardian, FindLaw noted Insurance plans in Louisiana covered by the Affordable Care Act cannot cover abortion, and public funds may only be used on abortions if the mother's life is at risk or in the event of incest or rap, the Guttmacher Institute said It noted that in 2011, 92 percent of Louisiana counties did not have an abortion clinic while nationally, 89 percent of all counties had no clinic.
