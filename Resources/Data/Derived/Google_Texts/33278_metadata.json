Broken down, closures include 55 Kmart stores, 30 Sears stores and 31 Sears Auto Center locations, according Seeking Alpha, citing liquidation sale notices. Many of the closings are expected to happen before Christmas.\n\nShares rose on the report.\n\nIn an email sent to The Associated Press, Howard Riefs, a Sears spokesman, said that the store count and list of closures was inaccurate but declined to offer details on the closings. He noted that the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company will update its store count in its third-quarter financial results next month.\n\n\u201cAs we have previously communicated, adjusting our physical footprint to focus on our best performing locations is a core component of our transformation. While this has resulted in store closures where appropriate \u2014 decision that we do not take lightly \u2014 we continue to have a substantial nationwide footprint with a presence in many of the top malls in the country.\u201d\n\nRiefs also noted that counting the closings of Sears stores and Sears Auto Centers as separate units is not \u201centirely accurate.\u201d Sears Auto stores are typically attached to the stores, he said.\n\nThe layoffs come as Sears\u2018 financial struggles are worsening under its CEO Edward Lampert, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Sears is trying to reverse mounting losses and sales drops in recent years by cutting costs, reducing inventory and selling assets to return to profitability. At the same time, it\u2019s shifting its focus from running a store network to operating a member-focused business called Shop Your Way. Its biggest albatross remains its stores, which have been criticized for being outdated and shabby.\n\nBut those turnaround efforts haven\u2019t been gaining traction. For the quarter ended Aug. 2, Sears lost $573 million, up drastically from $194 million in the year ago period. That brought the retailer\u2019s losses for the second half of the fiscal year to $975 million.\n\nLampert, a billionaire hedge fund investor, combined Sears and Kmart in 2005 about two years after he helped bring Kmart out from under bankruptcy protection.\n\nOn Monday, Sears said it was looking to raise more cash, announcing that it is planning a rights offering that may raise up to $625 million. The company also said Monday that it struck a leasing deal with European fashion retailer Primark. Sears\u2018 lease agreements with Primark are for seven stand-alone stores in malls. Sears will still have a significant presence at six of the locations.\n\nSears had announced that it expects to close about 130 stores in 2014, which includes a combination of leased and owned locations. To date, the retailer has closed 95 locations. Following the closures, the company will operate 1,900 Sears and Kmart stores.\n\nRiefs noted that represents 200 million square feet throughout the U.S.\n\n\u201cFew companies have this scale and reach,\u201d he added.\n\nShares rose more than 4 percent, or $1.53, to close at $35.95 on Thursday. Still, the stock is down 20 percent in the past year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sears Holdings Corp. discredited a report Thursday that says it will be shuttering 116 Sears and Kmart stores, resulting in the layoffs of more than 6,000 workers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sears Holdings Corp. discredited a report Thursday that says it will be shuttering 116 Sears and Kmart stores, resulting in the layoffs of more than 6,000 workers.", "title": "Sears refutes store-closing report", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/24/sears-refutes-store-closing-report/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/20/sears-raising-moneyjpeg-07e63.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/20/sears-raising-moneyjpeg-07e63.jpg", "description": "Sears Holdings Corp. discredited a report Thursday that says it will be shuttering 116 Sears and Kmart stores, resulting in the layoffs of more than 6,000 workers.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Sears refutes store-closing report"}, "Author": "Anne D'Innocenzio", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Sears Holdings Corp, Kmart, Howard Riefs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5a2\"", "article_summary": "Broken down, closures include 55 Kmart stores, 30 Sears stores and 31 Sears Auto Center locations, according Seeking Alpha, citing liquidation sale notices.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sears Holdings Corp. discredited a report Thursday that says it will be shuttering 116 Sears and Kmart stores, resulting in the layoffs of more than 6,000 workers.\nThe layoffs come as Sears\u2018 financial struggles are worsening under its CEO Edward Lampert, the company\u2019s largest shareholder.\nFollowing the closures, the company will operate 1,900 Sears and Kmart stores.\nFor the quarter ended Aug. 2, Sears lost $573 million, up drastically from $194 million in the year ago period."}
