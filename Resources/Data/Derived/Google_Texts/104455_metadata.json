The Fox News alumna \u2014 and, according to a report from TV Newser, newly minted CNN contributor \u2014 is progressive enough to work for Roger Ailes\u2019s network without anyone ever questioning her liberal bona fides. And that\u2019s why, when she takes jabs at the institutional Left, conservatives should pay attention.\n\nFirst, though, a bit about Kohn: Though not a household name, she has become fairly well known as a TV pundit over the last few years. She tells NRO that she stumbled from college at George Washington University to community organizing to cable news in general to, specifically, a Fox News gig without much forethought or strategizing. She grew up in an upper-middle-class family in Allentown, Pa., a ragged-around-the-edges Rust Belt enclave where most people were not as well off as her family. \u201cOne of the greatest gifts they gave me was understanding that,\u201d she says.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania, she headed to D.C. And while flipping through a GLAAD mailer one day in college, she noticed an ad for interns at a community-organizing group. It seemed like a good fit; though she was interested in activism and policy, partisan electoral politics had never grabbed her the way they do so many GW students.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that into politics with a capital P, party politics, electoral politics,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t get me up in the morning.\u201d\n\nSo community organizing it was. \u201cIt felt like a way to change the world that wasn\u2019t as raw and transactional as party politics,\u201d she says. \u201cIt put regular people at the front of political change, instead of glossy candidates and high-paid consultants.\u201d\n\nFrom her various positions at national organizations, she traveled around the country and helped direct local efforts. One of her proudest accomplishments, she tells NRO, was collecting stories from Blue Dog Democrats\u2019 constituents to marshal support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say Kohn is nostalgic about the first years of the Obama presidency. \u201cI think the job of independent and small-p political organizations is to hold elected leaders\u2019 feet to the fire,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that. The first two years, we kind of gave him a pass. We were dazzled. We believed the rhetoric.\u201d\n\nA collection of factors kept many leftists from pressuring Obama more during the first two years of his presidential term, when Democratic control of the House and Senate gave progressives unprecedented clout in Washington. And right when it mattered most, Kohn says, the Left dropped the ball.\n\n\u201cThis White House has a really hard time with criticism, including from the left,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like being criticized, and they implicitly and sometimes explicitly kind of threatened the institutional Left with excommunication if they were too independent or critical. And with some exceptions, the Left stayed in its lane and did what the White House told it to.\u201d\n\nBlistering criticism from the right made it easier for the Left to acquiesce to the White House\u2019s expectations, she adds.\n\n\u201cThe operating principles of the Left in that moment were based on the idea that he\u2019s, like, \u2018I got this,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t. And on top of that, Kohn and others thought he conceded too much to Republicans in negotiations. So, by the close of 2009, Kohn was feeling a little disenchanted with the White House and the Left.\n\nWithin a year, she\u2019d been discovered \u2014 speaking on a panel about art and activism \u2014 and had her first appearance on Hannity. It wasn\u2019t too long before she signed with Fox.\n\n\u201cAbout a year later I saw Roger Ailes on the street outside of Fox,\u201d she says. \u201cI waved at him, he waved at me, we had a meeting, he offered me a job. It went like that.\u201d\n\nAnd now she\u2019s part of the camp of progressives interested in the Left\u2019s newly invigorated focus on populist economic policy. When I asked what she thought of the Elizabeth Warren mold \u2014 especially in contrast to Hillary Clinton\u2019s political trajectory \u2014 she laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think I think?\u201d she asks. \u201cLove it!\u201d\n\nShe adds that she places herself squarely in the Warren camp of the progressive movement: claiming victory on social issues, at least in the long term, and prioritizing policy solutions to economic inequality. \u201cI\u2019d be like a camp counselor in her camp,\u201d she says.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019s not a participant in the emerging Hillary hype. Obama was Clinton 2.0, she says, citing his choices for Treasury secretary and chief of staff. \u201cDo we want Clinton 3.0?\u201d she asks. \u201cThose of us on the left would say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not look at the current crop of figures in the Democratic party and get tingles running down my spine,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe modern Democratic party does not seem to be something that creates the space for progressive populist ideas.\u201d\n\nWhile the conservative movement allows diversity and has a wide ideological spectrum, the institutional Left, she believes, has become increasingly centrist, partisan, and corporate.\n\n\u201cYou have very vocal, very vibrant, well-funded, visible parts of the Right that basically want to abolish government altogether \u2014 Kevin!\u201d she says, laughing, referring to National Review\u2019s Kevin D. Williamson. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that extreme equivalent on the Left.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s a bad thing, in her view. There aren\u2019\u200bt progressive equivalents of FreedomWorks and Heritage Action to push the Democratic party\u2019s agenda. And although she wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with their leftist equivalents, she thinks their existence would be healthy.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit of the background she\u2019ll bring to CNN: frustration with the president, frustration with the institutional Left, frustration with the Clinton machine, and, yet, enough affability to still get along with Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cYou can rise a lot faster in this business if you say really nasty, asinine things about your political opponents,\u201d she says. \u201cOh well.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Betsy Woodruff is a William F.
