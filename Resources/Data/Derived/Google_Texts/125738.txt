What do you think about the Affordable Care Act? Blakeman thinks the Affordable Care Act was "misguided" and believes that it should be repealed and replaced. In place of Obamacare, Blakeman believes we should create an assigned risk pool to allow patients with pre-existing conditions access to insurance -- similar to the way insurers provide coverage to high-risk drivers. Rice says we have a "moral imperative" to provide health care and that even though the rollout of Obamacare could have been better and that there are some improvements to be made, that the law should not be repealed.

Should the federal government intervene to mitigate climate change? Blakeman believes that conservation is wise whether or not climate change is happening. He supports policies like raising fuel efficiency standards, but opposes direct efforts to mitigate carbon emissions like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. Rice says that government should always push businesses like automakers "to be better and do better." She supports a carbon tax.
