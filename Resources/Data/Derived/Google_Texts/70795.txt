As the Denver Broncos wrap up the club’s home schedule Sunday with the AFC championship game, a historic trolley company is inviting fans along for the ride.

The Platte Valley Trolley’s football shuttle will be up and running Sunday, transporting Broncos fans to the game. It will be the non-profit trolley’s last run of the season, until it reopens in the spring.

The trolley, operated by the Denver Tramway Heritage Society, has been taking fans to Broncos games for more than two decades.

Broncos games are among the trolley’s biggest events of the season and “the playoffs turn it up a notch,” said Ethan Yazzie-Mintz, vice chairman of the society. “The Broncos shuttle is like a bullet train with a lot of excited fans.”.

The trolley runs from 15th Street and Confluence Park to a stop at the Broncos Bridge near Sports Authority Field at Mile High. A round-trip fare is $5 and a one-way ticket is $3. The trolley is cash only and complete details, check out the trolley’s website.

The ride along the South Platte River takes about 10 minutes.

Fans who ride the football trolley not only support the Broncos, but also the vibrant and rich history of trolley transportation in Denver.

“It’s fun and exciting,” Yazzie-Mintz said. “People get a unique ride to the game and can avoid the traffic around the stadium.”
