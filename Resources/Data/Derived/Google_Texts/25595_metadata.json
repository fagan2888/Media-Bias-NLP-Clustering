Summers, seeing echoes of second-term struggles for presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush, revived the idea of a constitutional shift to a single six-year presidency.\n\nSuch talk has all but vanished. Mr. Obama has overseen shrinking unemployment, a reduction in the proportion of Americans without health insurance and diplomatic breakthroughs on trade, climate policy, relations with Cuba and Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nRepublicans are now more likely to denounce his ideology and use of executive power than his competence. \u201cUnfortunately, I think he has been successful at achieving his agenda,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, lamented recently.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFormer Representative Vin Weber, a Republican who came to power in Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide in 1980, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for Republicans to acknowledge that. But you can\u2019t deny the successes.\u201d\n\nSmooth sailing in the final year is by no means guaranteed. Ten months before Bill Clinton left office, the technology bubble burst; the 2008 Wall Street collapse made a ruin of Mr. Bush\u2019s final chapter. Frightened by the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, most Americans say Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy against the Islamic State isn\u2019t working.\n\nBut the evidence points to a second term for Mr. Obama that is more successful than most.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to the Truman era, his stacks up favorably \u2014 in fact, much better than the majority,\u201d said Thomas Cronin, a scholar of the presidency at Colorado College.\n\nPresidential achievement takes different forms. Some predecessors accomplished more with Congress in second terms. Mr. Reagan, for example, signed sweeping overhauls of the tax and immigration systems.\n\nBut partisan polarization has steadily made legislative compromise more difficult. Although Mr. Obama still hopes that Congress will approve his Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, he has spent much of his second term using his executive authority and fending off Republican attempts to thwart him.\n\nThe presidential historian Robert Dallek described Mr. Obama\u2019s performance as \u201cwell above average,\u201d calling it a model for an era of ferocious partisanship.\n\n\u201cThat he can carry this off sort of sets a new parameter,\u201d Mr. Dallek said.\n\nNational consensus remains beyond Mr. Obama\u2019s reach. As measured by Gallup, his approval rating among Republicans has remained below 20 percent throughout his second term; his approval among Democrats has remained at 75 percent or higher.\n\nThose numbers broadly resemble the partisan divide over Mr. Bush\u2019s second term, a split that has inflamed a steady stream of allegations over management of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department, among others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet none has blossomed into the sort of second-term disaster suffered by Mr. Reagan with the Iran-contra scandal, or Mr. Clinton with the Monica Lewinsky affair, not to mention Richard Nixon with Watergate.\n\n\u201cCompared to recent presidents, the number of scandals is exceptionally low,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston professor who monitors executive branch scandals.\n\nThe closest thing to a public corruption prosecution tied to an Obama appointee\u2019s official duties was a guilty plea by the former C.I.A. director David Petraeus in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge for allowing his mistress access to classified material.\n\nThe durability of Mr. Obama\u2019s second-term legacy depends partly on his successor. Every twice-elected president since World War II left office with Congress controlled by the opposing party.\n\nUnless Senate Democrats gain at least four seats in November, Mr. Obama will, too.\n\nEven a friendly successor could discard Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives if they prove ineffective. Mr. Weber, the former lawmaker, questions whether the Cuba opening will change much, for example, and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Iran deal\u2019s going to accomplish what he wants.\u201d\n\nThe only judgment possible now, Mr. Weber added, is this: \u201cHe did it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160106064715, "twitter": {"description": "Political observers say that President Obama appears to have avoided the pitfalls that often undermine a second presidential term.", "creator": "JohnJHarwood", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/avoiding-the-dreaded-second-term-curse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004123872"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Avoiding the Dreaded \u2018Second-Term Curse\u2019", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/06/us/06letter_web/06letter_web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/avoiding-the-dreaded-second-term-curse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004123872", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/avoiding-the-dreaded-second-term-curse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 6, 2016", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Presidents and Presidency (US),United States Politics and Government,Obama  Barack", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John Harwood", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "06letter", "byl": "By JOHN HARWOOD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Political observers say that President Obama appears to have avoided the pitfalls that often undermine a second presidential term.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/06/us/06letter_web/06letter_web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Political observers say that President Obama appears to have avoided the pitfalls that often undermine a second presidential term.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 6, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/john_harwood/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-01-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2016-01-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160106064715, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/avoiding-the-dreaded-second-term-curse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/06/us/06letter_web/06letter_web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Political observers say that President Obama appears to have avoided the pitfalls that often undermine a second presidential term.", "title": "Avoiding the Dreaded \u2018Second-Term Curse\u2019"}, "pdate": 20160106, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "col": "Letter From America", "articleid": 100000004123872, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Avoiding the Dreaded \u2018Second-Term Curse\u2019", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/06/us/06letter_web/06letter_web-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The durability of Mr. Obama\u2019s second-term legacy depends partly on his successor.\nFrightened by the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, most Americans say Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy against the Islamic State isn\u2019t working.\nBut the evidence points to a second term for Mr. Obama that is more successful than most.\nMr. Weber, the former lawmaker, questions whether the Cuba opening will change much, for example, and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Iran deal\u2019s going to accomplish what he wants.\u201dThe only judgment possible now, Mr. Weber added, is this: \u201cHe did it.\u201d\nUnless Senate Democrats gain at least four seats in November, Mr. Obama will, too."}
