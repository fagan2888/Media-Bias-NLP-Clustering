He stepped into the role after the New York insurance conglomerate became a ward of the U.S. government when it received the government\u2019s single biggest rescue package of about $185 billion. Mr. Benmosche and his team worked to pay back the bailout, and the firm had fully repaid the government by late 2012.\n\nThe WSJ reported last year that Mr. Benmosche had received an advance to write a book about his work at AIG.\n\nHere is the statement from AIG:\n\nAmerican International Group, Inc. today announced with great sorrow the death of its former President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert H. Benmosche. Mr. Benmosche, 70, who had undergone treatment for lung cancer since 2010, died this morning at 8:15 a.m. at NYU Langone Medical Center, with his family at his side.\n\n\u201cWe announce this news with profound sadness, and our thoughts and prayers are with Bob\u2019s family at this difficult time,\u201d said Robert S. Miller, Chairman of the AIG Board of Directors. \u201cBob was one of the most inspirational and successful leaders in corporate America by any measure. We will never forget that under Bob\u2019s extraordinary leadership, the people of AIG repaid America in full plus a profit of nearly $23 billion. Everyone in the AIG family has been greatly blessed by Bob\u2019s vision, his loyalty, and his friendship during his five years with the company. Bob was a brilliant man who brought tremendous leadership, energy, passion, and tenacity to his job. At AIG, we will honor his legacy by continuing to focus on integrity and performance. He will be deeply missed.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike so many people who had the privilege to work with Bob, I am humbled and inspired by the example he set,\u201d said Peter D. Hancock, President and Chief Executive Officer, AIG. \u201cBob was piercingly honest and driven by a remarkable belief in the possibility of greatness that exists in every person. He poured his energy and focus into enabling AIG\u2019s people to live up to their potential, and that\u2019s why this company today is a sustainable enterprise that understands the importance of meeting and exceeding the expectations all of our stakeholders. As we build on his legacy at AIG in so many ways, let\u2019s remember him by living and working according to a belief he stated repeatedly and upheld in the most trying of circumstances: \u2018There is no limit to the greatness that good people can accomplish when you give them the freedom to act.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Benmosche served as President and CEO of AIG from August 10, 2009, to September 1, 2014. Upon arriving at AIG, Mr. Benmosche was responsible for a company that had received taxpayer assistance in connection with the 2008 financial crisis totaling some $182 billion.
