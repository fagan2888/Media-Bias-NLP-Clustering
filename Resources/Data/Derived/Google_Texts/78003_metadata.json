The suspension is intended as an interim step while the department formally changes its policy.\n\nThe change applies only to people in the HUSKY D Medicaid program, which covers adults who don\u2019t have minor children. HUSKY D was created in 2010 when the state expanded Medicaid as part of Obamacare, and it covers more than 127,000 people.\n\nIn addition, the change applies only to care received after Jan. 1, 2014. That means that people 55 and older who received Medicaid-covered care before this year would still be subject to having their estates repay the cost of their pre-2014 care.\n\nSocial Services Commissioner Roderick L. Bremby described the changes in a recent letter to the co-chairwomen of the legislature\u2019s Appropriations Committee.\n\nFederal law requires states to recover Medicaid funds spent on long-term care for people aged 55 and older, but some states, including Connecticut, seek repayment for additional services.\n\nState and federal officials have raised concerns that some Medicaid-eligible people have avoided enrolling in the program because they don\u2019t want their estates to be docked to repay the cost of their care when they die.\n\nIn February, a federal health official indicated that the federal government intended to consider options for eliminating the recovery of Medicaid benefits. Cindy Mann, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, cited \u201cthe potential barrier to enrollment that future estate recovery may create for some individuals.\u201d\n\nState Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri has raised similar issues, and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, expressed concerns to DSS that the previous recovery policy could hurt enrollment in the expanded Medicaid program.\n\nDSS spokesman David Dearborn said this week that the change is in line with federal guidance, and cited the potential for recovery to deter eligible people from Medicaid, even though one of the major goals of the federal health law is to cover the uninsured.\n\nIn addition, since the federal government is reimbursing the state for all of its HUSKY D costs through 2016, having state employees spend time pursuing recoveries that are not federally required did not seem as productive as pursuing repayment for care that the state has partially funded, Dearborn said.\n\nLast fiscal year, the state Department of Administrative Services recovered approximately $15 million related to Medicaid payments.\n\nOverall, more than 659,000 Connecticut residents are covered by Medicaid. The change does not apply to adults in HUSKY A, which covers more than 445,000 low-income children and their parents.\n\nMedicaid recovery: A guide\n\nWho is still subject to estate recovery:\n\nAdults in HUSKY A or HUSKY D of any age who receive long-term care, such as nursing home care or home- and community-based services. The recovery can include the cost of related hospital and prescription drug services.\n\nAdults in HUSKY A aged 55 and older who receive medical services.\n\nAdults in HUSKY D aged 55 and older who received medical services paid for by the program before Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nIn these cases, the state would seek repayment from the estate of a Medicaid recipient after he or she dies. If the person is survived by a spouse or child under 21, the state\u2019s claims would be delayed until the spouse dies and the child turns 21.\n\nWho is no longer subject to estate recovery:\n\nPeople 55 and older in HUSKY D who receive medical care on or after Jan. 1, 2014 (if the care is not related to long-term care).\n\nRecovery while alive:\n\nThere is one circumstance in which the state can seek repayment from a HUSKY client while living: if a person receives Medicaid coverage for injuries sustained in an accident and receives a financial settlement related to the accident. In those cases, the state can seek reimbursement for accident-related bills.\n\nIn addition, a separate set of recovery rules apply to people who received care covered by SAGA medical, or state administered general assistance, which was converted to HUSKY D in April 2010. People who received SAGA medical coverage are subject to more state recovery efforts, including having the state place a lien on property or make a claim against any inheritance they\u2019re slated to receive, lottery winnings or any other windfall.\n\nThe HUSKY alphabet\n\nWhat about the other HUSKY programs?\n\nHUSKY B covers children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. There are no adults in the program, and members are not subject to asset recovery.\n\nHUSKY C covers poor seniors and people with disabilities. Unlike the other HUSKY programs, a person\u2019s assets are taken into account in determining eligibility and people who qualify have limited assets.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/09/ct-scales-back-medicaid-repayment-rules-for-some-recipients/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Affordable Care Act, estate recovery, HUSKY, Medicaid, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/09/ct-scales-back-medicaid-repayment-rules-for-some-recipients/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Connecticut officials are scaling back the circumstances in which the state can seek repayment from the estates of Medicaid recipients when they die.
