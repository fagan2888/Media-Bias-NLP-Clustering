Ultimately, roughly 36,000 Americans signed up for an insurance plan online, the report said.\n\nThe image above shows the declining numbers of participants who progressed through the site's different stages.\n\nIn an e-mail, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters challenged the idea that traffic had dipped as much as the analysis suggested.\n\n\"HealthCare.gov received 14.6 million unique visits in the first 11 days, showing the intense demand for quality, affordable health insurance,\" Peters said. \"While traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one, it remains high as Americans continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options. We will be releasing enrollment figures on a monthly basis similar to how we release data for the CHIP and Medicare programs.\"\n\nAn administration official who asked not to be identified because enrollment figures have not been published said the numbers in the Kantar US Insights report were \"inaccurate.\n\nAnd Aneesh Chopra, who served as the White House's first-ever chief technology officer during President Obama's first term, said the analysis actually captured the public's sustained interest in signing up for health insurance on the federal exchange. He noted that while the total number of visitors to the site is interesting, it matters much more that one million Americans created an online account.\n\n\"Account creation is always the holy grail. That\u2019s the moment that matters,\" Chopra said in an interview. \"In one week, a million people began a process that will result in affordable coverage. That means a lot of people are going to ultimately get the product.\"\n\nIn a blog post, Millward Brown Digital Vice President Matthew Pace, who called the first week's performance \"atrocious,\" noted that the numbers could change dramatically once the federal government improves how the Web site functions.\n\n\"The fact that millions of Americans not only visited the exchanges but also took what actions they could to register and enroll suggests that demand indeed exists for new healthcare options,\" Pace wrote.\" As the site improves and more consumers are able to compare their coverage options, they'll decide with their wallets how truly affordable Obamacare turns out to be.\"\n\nAt the moment, Americans' interest in logging on has dropped sharply from the time of the launch. In an interview, Pace compared the initial number of users to the kind of traffic Target.com experiences, noting that about 0.9 percent of all online users logged onto HealthCare.gov during the first week. As of Oct. 13 that reach had declined to 0.1 percent, he said. Last week, he estimated, the site attracted 4.1 million visitors, or less than half of what it garnered during its first week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HealthCare.gov traffic has plummeted 88 percent, according to a new analysis, while less than half of 1 percent of the site's visitors enrolled during the first week.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "HealthCare.gov traffic has plummeted 88 percent, according to a new analysis, while less than half of 1 percent of the site's visitors enrolled during the first week.", "title": "Analysis: Obamacare glitches scare off many Web site users", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/10/15/analysis-obamacare-glitches-scare-off-many-web-site-users/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/files/2013/10/funnel.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/10/15/analysis-obamacare-glitches-scare-off-many-web-site-users/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, HeathCare.gov, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare web traffic, Kantar US Insights, Millward Brown Digital,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, HeathCare.gov, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare web traffic, Kantar US Insights, Millward Brown Digital,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdaf\"", "article_summary": "Last week, he estimated, the site attracted 4.1 million visitors, or less than half of what it garnered during its first week.\nHe noted that while the total number of visitors to the site is interesting, it matters much more that one million Americans created an online account.\nIn an interview, Pace compared the initial number of users to the kind of traffic Target.com experiences, noting that about 0.9 percent of all online users logged onto HealthCare.gov during the first week.\nOf the 9.4 million unique visitors to the site during the launch's first week, according to the analysis, roughly a third attempted to register, and a third of that number \u2014 1.01 million \u2014 completed registration.\nIn an e-mail, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters challenged the idea that traffic had dipped as much as the analysis suggested."}
