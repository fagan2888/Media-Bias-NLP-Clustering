But DCH continues to treat around the same percentage of uninsured, Dusang said. In 2014, around 7 percent of the patients at DCH were uninsured. In 2015, it was 6.5 percent.\n\n\u201cThough people are mandated to have insurance or face a penalty, most of the people coming through our doors without insurance are refusing assistance to explore the exchange possibilities,\u201d Dusang said.\n\nThe increases are included in the fiscal year 2016 budget, which was approved by the DCH Health System board of directors Tuesday night.\n\nOverall, the budget is a tight one, with no major capital projects, Dusang said.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to be tight this year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe budget includes $497 million in total operating expenses, $16.4 million in routine capital expenses and $14.6 million for potential new projects for the DCH hospitals,\n\nThe major expenditures include:\n\n- $1.6 million to replace an inpatient MRI unit at DCH Regional Medical Center\n\n- $400,000 to replace monitors in the neonatal intensive care unit at DCH Regional and Northport Medical Center\n\n- $350,000 to replace digital radiology equipment in the emergency department at DCH Regional.\n\nThe budget also includes a 2 percent merit pay increase for employees planned for March.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on our financial performance at that time,\u201d Dusang said.\n\nAll DCH full-time and part-time employees, including those at DCH Regional Medical Center, Fayette Medical Center and Northport Medical Center will be eligible. There are about 3,120 full-time and 1,600 part-time DCH employees. DCH had a similar 2 percent raise during the 2015 fiscal year.\n\nThe 2016 budget is very similar to the fiscal year 2015 budget, which had $468 million in total operating expenses, $14 million in routine capital expenses and $11.6 million for potential new projects.\n\nThe budget is larger than last year \u2014 by about $29 million. But a portion of that goes to employee raises.\n\nSome of the cost increase also goes toward paying the increasing cost of supplies. For instance, IV saline solution has seen a 50 percent increase in pricing, Dusang said.\n\n\u201cThis increase will cost DCH close to an additional $1 million annually just on this one product alone,\u201d Dusang said.\n\nThere are no major construction projects planned for 2016. The budget does include some infrastructure upgrades, including new air handling units and continued face lifts to the existing medical surgery units, Dusang added.\n\nReach Lydia Seabol Avant at lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com or 205-722-0222.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DCH Health System in the 2016 fiscal year will likely have a reduction of $2 million in federal funding \u2014 money meant to bolster hospitals that treat a higher percentage of low-income and non-insured patients.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-2D53063B-62EA-4328-B119-2C5BE2816716-pubTL"}, "og": {"site_name": "TuscaloosaNews.com", "description": "DCH Health System in the 2016 fiscal year will likely have a reduction of $2 million in federal funding \u2014 money meant to bolster hospitals that treat a higher percentage of low-income and non-insured patients.", "title": "DCH Health System to face $2 million budget reduction", "url": "http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20150908/NEWS/150909756", "image": "http://G52-TLweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=TL&Date=20150908&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=150909756&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150908, "fb": {"app_id": 126505827419704}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150909756-pubTL"}}, "keywords": "Local News - TL"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6c4\"", "article_summary": "All DCH full-time and part-time employees, including those at DCH Regional Medical Center, Fayette Medical Center and Northport Medical Center will be eligible.\nThe DCH Health System will end the current fiscal year with $4 million less in annual disproportionate share payments to DCH, with another $2 million less expected in fiscal year 2016.\nMedicare continues to tighten down on supplemental disproportionate share payments by the Affordable Care Act, said Nina Dusang, DCH chief financial officer.\nThe increases are included in the fiscal year 2016 budget, which was approved by the DCH Health System board of directors Tuesday night.\nThe 2016 budget is very similar to the fiscal year 2015 budget, which had $468 million in total operating expenses, $14 million in routine capital expenses and $11.6 million for potential new projects."}
