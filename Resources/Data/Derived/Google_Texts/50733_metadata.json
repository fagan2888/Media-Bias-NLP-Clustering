But Sen. Warren\u2019s financial records may dash their hopes.\n\nWhile making presidential noises, the Democrat senator has positioned herself as the Democratic Party\u2019s top defender of the working class.\n\nOn Wednesday, she told the AFL-CIO in its \u201cSummit on Raising Wages\u201d that the system is \u201crigged\u201d in favor of the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe average family not in the top 10% makes less money today than they were making a generation ago. So who got all of the increase in income? One hundred percent of it went to the top 10%,\u201d Warren preached, sounding like a reincarnated Eugene Debs. \u201cAll the new money earned went to the top. All of it.\u201d\n\nAnd, as it turns out, a healthy share of it went to Warren herself. She\u2019s amassed a personal fortune bashing the rich \u2014 while insisting she\u2019s not one of them.\n\nCombing through her latest Senate financial disclosure filings, however, it becomes clear she is part of the same top 10% she rails against. In fact, her net worth puts her in the wealthiest 1%.\n\nThe assets of the self-proclaimed godmother of the Occupy Wall Street movement and champion of the 99% include:\n\n\u0095 Financial assets worth between $3.7 million and $10 million.\n\n\u0095 Real estate assets worth more than $3.1 million, including a home in Cambridge, Mass., valued at $2.4 million and a condo in Washington valued at $740,000.\n\n\u0095 A $525,000 book advance for her new memoir, \u201cA Fighting Chance.\u201d\n\n\u0095 At least 19 investment funds, including stock funds worth at least $1 million.\n\nHer large stock portfolio is odd, given her crusading against the \u201cexcesses\u201d and \u201cgreed\u201d of Wall Street. And it\u2019s downright unseemly, given her bashing of members of Congress who own stock.\n\n\u201cThere are some wealthy individuals \u2014 I\u2019m not one of them \u2014 but some wealthy individuals who have a lot of stock portfolios,\u201d she told MSNBC during a 2012 campaign interview.\n\nDuring a senatorial debate, she jabbed her GOP foe Scott Brown for standing \u201cwith the millionaires, not those who are out of work.\u201d Turns out Brown was standing right next to one.\n\nLast summer, Warren ripped then-Senate Ranking Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for blocking a government spending program she proposed. \u201cMitch McConnell is there for millionaires and billionaires.\u201d Apparently he\u2019s also there for Warren, a millionaire many times over.\n\nWarren is even wealthy by Hill standards. Her minimum net worth alone ranks her 76th among the 535 House and Senate members combined.\n\nYes, a lot of senators are richer than she is. But they haven\u2019t made a career of bashing the rich. Warren has a lot of nerve trying to pass herself off as one of the 99% for whom she claims to speak.\n\nThe former Harvard professor claims she can relate to working and middle-class families better than other politicians, including Clinton. But she\u2019s just as out of touch.\n\nWarren has no debt, owns two posh homes and dines at the finest restaurants. She hasn\u2019t the foggiest notion about the pain the working and middle class are suffering from ObamaCare and other big government policies she pushes.\n\nFor all her Marxist bunkum, Warren isn\u2019t even that altruistic. According to her 2009 tax returns, for example, she donated only 2% of her $980,670 income. She likes redistributing your money but not her own.\n\nWarren, who falsely claimed \u201cNative American\u201d minority status to score a high-paying Harvard gig, is not just a fake Indian. She\u2019s a fake populist, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2016: Liberals hope that the populist-sounding Elizabeth Warren will run to the left of Hillary Clinton, whom they fear is now too rich and out of touch.
