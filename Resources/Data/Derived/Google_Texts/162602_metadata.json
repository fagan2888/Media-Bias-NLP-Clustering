It follows North Korea\u2019s threat it would engage in a \u201cpreemptive and offensive nuclear strike\u201d in reaction to the start of joint U.S.-South Korean war games Monday.\n\n\u201cWe consider it to be absolutely impermissible to make public statements containing threats to deliver some \u2018preventive nuclear strikes\u2019 against opponents,\u201d said the statement, as translated by the Russian TASS news agency. \u201cPyongyang should be aware of the fact that in this way the DPRK [North Korea] will become fully opposed to the international community and will create international legal grounds for using military force against itself in accordance with the right of a state to self-defense enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\u201d\n\nRussia also had harsh words for the U.S. and South Korea, condemning the \u201cunprecedented\u201d exercises. \u201cThe development of the situation on the Korean peninsula and around it is causing growing concern,\u201d said a statement issued Monday, as reported by the Kremlin-funded RT news channel.\n\nPart of the planned war games involved the U.S. and South Korea simulating strikes against North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities and special forces raids against Pyongyang leadership. Around 17,000 U.S. personnel and 300,000 South Korean personnel are participating in the ongoing eight-week war game. The troop levels represent about a one-third increase from last year\u2019s similar war game.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s sabre-rattling has reached a fever pitch in recent months. The pariah state carried out its fourth nuclear test in January and launched a rocket in violation of international sanctions in February. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned Congress in early February that North Korea had restarted its plutonium reactor and was poised to produce weapons-grade nuclear material within weeks.\n\nIn response to North Korean provocations, the United Nations security council voted unanimously last Thursday to pass a new round of sanctions against the country.\n\nFollow Russ Read on Twitter\n\nSend tips to russ@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
