The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which handles the security clearance process for federal agencies, said Thursday it was starting to bring its submission system, called e-QIP, back online. The agency pulled the platform down in the wake of devastating hacks at the agency that exposed more than 22 million people's sensitive information, including 21.5 million people's background investigation forms for security clearance.

The bill is named after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program designed to detect and repel known digital threats. The Einstein software has come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the damaging hacks at the OPM. Many have criticized Einstein as an outdated program that is ineffective against skilled digital intruders since it can only catch previously identified threats. Einstein has also been knocked for its repeated delays and bloated budget. To read our full piece, click here.\n\nLIGHTER CLICK:\n\n--A GEEK'S TAKE.
