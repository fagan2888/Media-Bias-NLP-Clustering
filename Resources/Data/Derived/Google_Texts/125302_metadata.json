This particular scene comes from a clip called \"You Can't POP Your Cherry (HYMEN 101)\" which explains, with the kind of bubbly, web-savvy humor that makes her a popular vlogger, that the hymen isn't a membrane that needs to bleed or be broken during intercourse\u2014it's actually just small, usually elastic folds of mucous tissue that only partially cover the vaginal opening and can, but don\u2019t always, tear if stretched. A year and a half after it premiered, with well more than one million views, Green's video debunking one of the most enduring misconceptions about virginity is also one of the most popular segment she's ever recorded.\n\nFor a lot of women (and men), Green's message is hardly news, for any number of reasons. Several comments on the video, which still arrive almost daily, point that out. But other comments tell a different story: that myths about virginity, sex, and basic biology still pervade even among sexually active adults, and when those myths get reinforced by vacuums of reliable information and sexist messages ingrained in popular culture, they can have serious consequences for women's health. \u201cEvery night I have people come up to me about this video in particular,\u201d Green, who takes her sex-positive presentations to college campuses across the country, tells me. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m so glad I saw this.\u2019 \u2018Sex was so much better than I thought it was.\u2019 \u2018It didn\u2019t hurt.\u2019 It\u2019s sad to me that people expect this to be a painful experience.\u201d * * * When Therese Shechter lost her virginity at age 23, it wasn\u2019t the firework-spouting, momentous occasion she had come to expect. On the contrary, it was kind of unremarkable given the hype. Now a filmmaker, Shechter spent much of the past six years working on her new documentary How to Lose Your Virginity, which revisits her experience\u2014including the basement apartment where it happened, now, funnily enough, a flower shop called Bloom\u2014and explores the \"myths and misogyny\" behind one of society's most institutionalized rites of passage. Fewer than half of all women bleed during the first time they have sex. Experiences vary from individual to individual and depend on factors like lubrication and arousal. Through interviews with historians, abstinence advocates, sex educators, and self-described virgins and non-virgins alike, Shechter learned she's not the only one who had certain ideas about what sex is supposed to be like. There are a number of pervasive and loaded myths about virginity: That having sex for the first time will be an irreversible transformation that changes your body and mind; that there\u2019s a \u201cright\u201d way to lose your virginity, and how you lose it will affect the rest of your life; that it's going to be the most pleasurable, magical feeling; that it's going to be the most painful experience of their lives. These myths persist in part because of a lack of information about what happens to the human body, specifically the hymen, during sex\u2014information that's often not taught in schools, that's not always found online, and that's not always available from medical providers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to lots of women who are just terrified of having sex because they think it\u2019s going to be this horrible pain and [they\u2019ll] bleed gallons of blood,\u201d says Shechter, whose documentary makes its broadcast premiere on February 8 on the Fusion Network and is airing in cities across the U.S. and internationally in coming months. Abstinence-only education in U.S. schools isn't to blame for creating these myths, but Shechter and Green say the programs, which have received more than $1.5 billion dollars and counting in federal funding since 1996 despite mounting research about their ineffectiveness, do create environments where this kind of misinformation thrives. (Even some schools with more comprehensive programs, Green notes, are guilty of getting the facts wrong, too.) Abstinence-only education promotes marriage as the proper venue for sexual activity and the only prevention method for STDs and pregnancy\u2014it doesn't offer information about how, once someone becomes sexually active, to make sure sex isn't painful or how to avoid the kind of bleeding Green talks about. (Fewer than half of all women bleed during the first time they have sex; they can bleed a little or a lot, or not at all, and it can be painful or painless. There\u2019s a range of experiences that vary from individual to individual and depend on factors like use of lubrication and levels of arousal.) Reliable information is out there, but it doesn't always find its way to young women (or men) who could benefit from it. Kiki Zeldes, a senior editor of Our Bodies, Ourselves, the landmark book about women\u2019s health and sexuality published by a Boston-based non-profit, says the Internet can often lead astray young women looking for answers. While sites like Scarleteen, an independent sex-education website founded in 1998, are devoted to providing accurate, non-judgmental information to young people, Zeldes says she's concerned by the number of Google search results and general information sites that describe the hymen as a tissue that completely covers the vaginal opening, one that tears and bleeds. \"There are a tremendous number of women who don't understand how their bodies work and what happens when they are sexually active,\" says Zeldes, who adds that \u201chymen\u201d is the most-searched term on the book\u2019s website. \"There's lots of information out there, but it's more about reaching young women in formats that they will hear.\" \"Your average gynecologist doesn't know a whole lot about the hymen.\" Even the medical community contributes to that void. Most medical schools offer little education about the hymen, according to Virgin: The Untouched History author and historian Hanne Blank, and for relevant reasons: it's medically uninteresting and very rarely poses health problems\u2014it's just tissue left over from sometime between the fifth and seventh months of fetal development, roughly. \"Your average gynecologist doesn't know a whole lot [about the hymen],\" Blank says. \"From the medical perspective, we could fairly charitably say there's a wide range of knowledge, and there's a wide range of belief. Doctors are the same as everyone else. Unless an individual physician has taken efforts to educate themselves, chances are what they think they know about the hymen is more reflective of what's around them.\" One Swedish sexual health organization felt that misinformation about the hymen was so rampant that it decided to do away with the word entirely. In 2009, the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) began promoting the term \"vaginal corona\" as an alternative in order to dispel myths and rebuild associations with this part of the body from scratch. (None of the women I spoke to expect the term to catch on in any serious way\u2014though the latest edition of Our Bodies, Ourselves does adapt RFSU's materials\u2014but all agreed it was an important symbolic step in rebooting the conversation.)\n\nMyths about virginity don't exist solely because of misinformation about the hymen, however, and that's because the concept of virginity existed long before the hymen was even identified. First acknowledged in the 16th century by anatomist Andreas Vesalius, the hymen, historically speaking, is a relatively new discovery; social and cultural ideas about virginity, on the other hand, have been building on thousands and thousands of years of history. For reference: Flip open a Bible to the Book of Deuteronomy, which declares that if \"tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel \u2026 [then] the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die.\" What constitutes \"purity,\" it turns out, is surprisingly messy. The exact origins of virginity are difficult to pinpoint, Blank says, because people have been talking about virginity for as long as we\u2019ve had written records, and the earliest mentions of virginity suggest it was already an established concept. (One popular explanation, called the K-Strategist Theory, suggests men used virginity to help determine paternity\u2014a way to make sure the material resources they devoted to new or expectant mothers weren\u2019t wasteful investments.) Despite its long history, virginity has never had a precise definition. Many associate the word with penile-vaginal intercourse between cisgender men and women, but that's not the only way two people can be sexually active together, and that definition also excludes LGBTQ people. What constitutes the idea of purity, it turns out, is surprisingly messy. Yet what's allowed virginity to persist in spite of this, Blank says, is that virginity is a highly effective way of organizing women. Throughout history, virginity tests, like the \"string test\" (which \"determined\" virginity based on the relative size of your head and neck) Blank performs on Shechter in How to Lose Your Virginity, weren\u2019t really concerned with science so much as they were concerned with control: However nebulous its definition, virginity easily sorts women into those who have had sex and those who haven't, which, in societies that place value on a women's purity, also helps determine their worth. That value system\u2014and the idea that a woman's first sexual experience is this permanent, hymen-breaking change\u2014is reinforced by the language used to talk about a woman's first time,: She lost her virginity; he took her virginity; She gave it up to him; he popped her cherry; she was deflowered. \"It's kind of violent,\" Green says in her video as she comically jabs a dildo into her home-made model of a hymen. These words, she argues, don't just further the idea that there's a painful or bloody transformation, they also carry a lot of baggage about gender roles. They characterize women as passive with something to lose, and men as the aggressors with something to gain; they suggest that men are the stewards of virginity\u2014the same idea behind the \u201cpurity balls\u201d that take place across the country today, where young girls pledge their virginity to their fathers until husbands come along.\n\nFor evidence of just how strongly these ideas about virginity and sex are rooted in popular culture, Shechter points to the number of businesses that profit off them. Genres of pornography fetishize virginity and frequently depict the moment innocent school girls are \"corrupted.\u201d Hymenoplasties, or controversial surgeries that \"reconstruct\" the hymen to induce bleeding during sex as proof of virginity, have become an established practice around the world (stories about the trend have appeared in Time magazine and The New York Times, which, it\u2019s worth noting, called the hymen \"the vaginal membrane that normally breaks in the first act of intercourse\" in its reporting). In her film, Shechter meets with a wedding dress vendor who markets a dress's virginal qualities as a selling point. Male partners' expectations of blood in particular sometimes leads women to take drastic, unhealthy measures. \"You click back to that other time for the [wedding] day because now you're this dirty, ruined women,\" Shechter says. \"We still make jokes, 'I can't wear white at my wedding.' All that [says] is there's this object of value, and when it's given away or taken or sold, that value is lost. [Virginity] sells purity rings and artificial hymens [because] being perceived as not having that value can be a death sentence.\" Women do still get killed over others' perceptions of their own virginity: In 2005, an Alabama woman told a Birmingham police detective she killed her 12-year-old daughter by pouring bleach down her throat because her daughter revealed she was no longer a virgin. Male partners' expectations of blood in particular sometimes leads women to take drastic, unhealthy measures: In How to Lose Your Virginity, Shechter reports on women who sewed stitches into their vaginas to make sure they bled. Artificial hymens that can be inserted into the vagina and \"bleed\" red dyes can be bought online cheaply and have been trendy in China, but have also been known to cause infections. Green says she's even heard from women who said their boyfriends became verbally abusive when there wasn\u2019t any blood or pain following their first time having sex. \u201cPeople told me they show their boyfriends my video and explain why there wasn\u2019t any bleeding,\" Green says. \"It\u2019s kind of bizarre when you have these kids getting angry at each other because there wasn\u2019t enough blood.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vacuums of reliable information and sexism in popular culture can have serious consequences for women&#39;s health.", "author": "Nolan Feeney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Vacuums of reliable information and sexism in popular culture can have serious consequences for women&#39;s health.", "title": "Living Myths About Virginity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/4849756970_f36465a68c_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/living-myths-about-virginity/283628/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bc1\"", "article_summary": "Myths about virginity don't exist solely because of misinformation about the hymen, however, and that's because the concept of virginity existed long before the hymen was even identified.\nYet what's allowed virginity to persist in spite of this, Blank says, is that virginity is a highly effective way of organizing women.\n\"You click back to that other time for the [wedding] day because now you're this dirty, ruined women,\" Shechter says.\nBut other comments tell a different story: that myths about virginity, sex, and basic biology still pervade even among sexually active adults, and when those myths get reinforced by vacuums of reliable information and sexist messages ingrained in popular culture, they can have serious consequences for women's health.\nThe exact origins of virginity are difficult to pinpoint, Blank says, because people have been talking about virginity for as long as we\u2019ve had written records, and the earliest mentions of virginity suggest it was already an established concept."}
