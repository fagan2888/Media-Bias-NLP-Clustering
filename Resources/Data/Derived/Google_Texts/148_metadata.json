Gone are the days when consumers had free range to demand satisfaction as part of doing business. Some companies get it right, but many do not.\n\nAlso driving down satisfaction, unsurprisingly, is health care costs. The study found that 55 percent of members indicate having experienced an increase in costs in 2013, which negatively impacts cost satisfaction. The average monthly premium paid in 2013 is $285. Additionally, the survey found that 35 percent of members said they received a notice of changes in their coverage, networks or rates from their health plan in the past 12 months.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s study said that there are simple things to be done to improve satisfaction from plan members. Among them is timely communication and services \u2014 such as wellness programs \u2014 that increase member engagement. \u201cHealth plans must look for ways to promptly communicate both pre-approvals and cost in order to minimize member anxiety and mitigate concerns about access to care, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mark Roberts", "description": "In health care, satisfying the customer is more important than ever.", "og": {"url": "http://www.benefitspro.com/2014/12/05/healthy-customers-equal-good-business", "image": "http://origin.media.sbmcloud.com/social-icons/social-share-bpro-716x372.png", "type": "website", "description": "In health care, satisfying the customer is more important than ever.", "title": "Healthy customers equal good business"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Benefits_Pro", "creator": "@Benefits_Pro", "description": "In health care, satisfying the customer is more important than ever.", "card": "summary", "title": "Healthy customers equal good business"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-05", "keywords": "Consumer Driven Health Care, Sales Strategies, social media, Employee Benefit Research Institute, health insurance plans, healthcare, claims processing, retail store, J.D.
