He\u2019s forgotten why he should.\n\nA liver transplant patient from over a decade ago, the man knows the pill ritual. He has the drill down. A little applesauce in a spoon, a quick swallow \u2013 done.\n\nEvery day for life. But not today. Today is not a good day so far. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing me any good,\u201d he tells my mom.\n\nThe man is my father. Mom has called me for support. \u201cHe won\u2019t budge today. I\u2019m out of ideas. Maybe you can help.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me try,\u201d I say.\n\nQuestions\n\nAs hard as the physical breakdown has been, Dad's mental losses have been even tougher. Not long ago he started asking unusual questions. He\u2019d wake up in the morning, glance around the quiet house \u2013 and ask, \u201cWhere are the kids?\" After a long pause, he'd sigh and say, \"I guess they\u2019re at school by now.\u201d\n\nRelated: Alzheimer's Will be Fiscal Nightmare of the Century\n\nThe nurses advised Mom to go along. It was easier that way, at least on the surface. \u201cYes, they\u2019re all out of the house by now,\u201d she\u2019d say carefully. Her grown children, of course, had their own homes, lives and families.\n\nMy dad is one of the millions of people who will cost the nation an estimated $203 billion. He\u2019s one in three seniors who will almost certainly die of Alzheimer\u2019s or some other dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Alzheimer's was never an invited guest. But here we are with it in our midst, day and night.\n\nSometimes he wakes up at 2 a.m. \u201cWhere\u2019s my car?\u201d he says into the dark. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my car in a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you need it?\u201d says Mom from the bed beside his. She long ago sold that car.\n\n\u201cI have sales calls to make. People are expecting me.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday is Saturday,\u201d she says patiently. \u201cYou don\u2019t have work today. You can stay home with me.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday? Are you sure?\"\n\nDad hasn\u2019t read a calendar, turned a page, dialed a phone, in months. He can't. He can\u2019t walk, never mind drive.\n\nFor decades Dad drove the eastern corridor as a successful sales executive. He rose through the ranks of a Fortune 500 company and ran big regions of territory, with teams of bright young salespeople reporting to him. He gave pats on the back, helped seal a lot of deals, brought in money for the company and was duly rewarded. His success helped put his children through college and gave him ample time to enjoy his 18 grandkids.\n\nRelated: Alzheimer's Funding Should Be a No-Brainer\n\nHe can still, even now, be a great closer. You don\u2019t need a car to close a deal.\n\nOn the phone, I hear Mom try to push the pills at him again. \u201cNo,\u201d he says.\n\nSo now it\u2019s my turn.\n\nNegotiations\n\n\u201cDad, I know you can do this,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why Mom wants me to take them,\u201d he says.\n\nAs we talk, I pace in the little hallway of my home, trying to dredge up anything that might work. \u201cThey're helping you, Dad. They really are. Besides, the doctor wants you to take this medicine.\u201d\n\nBringing up Doc usually moves the needle. Not today.\n\n\u201cRemember how you used to tell me to drink my milk?\u201d I say finally. \u201cRemember how, when I was little, you'd say, \u2018Drink your milk so you'll be strong and healthy\u2019?\u201d\n\nI hear his breathing on the line. \u201cYes,\u201d he says at last.\n\nWe have a yes. \u201cOK. So your medicine is keeping you strong and healthy, just like that milk did for me. This is keeping you alive. Keeping you going. You have to take it. I know you can, Dad.\"\n\nWhen he protests again, I try a new tack: \u201cDad, I'll stay on the phone with you while you take it. I'm not leaving. I\u2019ll hang with you. OK? Then we can talk again when you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nThere's a big block of silence \u2013 then small noises, fumbling and fiddling. When Mom comes on the phone again, I tell her the plan.\n\n\u201cLet's try it,\u201d she says.\n\nFor what feels like an eternity I cling to the phone, trying to hear every movement on their end while Mom gets the medicine ready. Is this how my father used to wait for me when I was being stubborn about something? I think. He was always so patient. I'm not giving up.\n\nI hear their voices in the background. \u201cOK, here we go, dear,\u201d she says to him.\n\nThey\u2019re in the kitchen together. I can picture it. Dad, his eyes watery and hands wrinkled, is sitting in the wheelchair, rolled up to his spot at the table. Mom is hovering nearby. She just wants him to be well.\n\nI hear more sounds. Eating sounds. Then more silence, muffled movement, the minutes ticking by. Finally, Dad comes back on the line.\n\n\u201cWendy?\u201d he says. \u201cAre you still there?\u201d\n\nHe remembered. This time he remembered. \u201cYes, I\u2019m here,\" I say.\n\nPause. Then \u2013 \u201cThe deal is done,\u201d he says.\n\nRack up one more success for the deal closer.\n\nI'm relieved, grateful, pleased at his accomplishment. \u201cYou did it, Dad. You closed the deal. I knew you could. I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d\n\nThen I hear the familiar voice and the words I used to hear as a kid: \u201cWendy, I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\nThe author, who requested anonymity, has written this article under a pseudonym.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The 80-year-old man, a veteran of the Korean War who raised 6 children, won\u2019t take his", "title": "How One Alzheimer\u2019s Family Sealed the Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/27/How-One-Alzheimer-s-Family-Sealed-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08222012_Elderly_Pills_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/27/How-One-Alzheimer-s-Family-Sealed-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08222012_Elderly_Pills_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The 80-year-old man, a veteran of the Korean War who raised 6 children, won\u2019t take his", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s one in three seniors who will almost certainly die of Alzheimer\u2019s or some other dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nOn the phone, I hear Mom try to push the pills at him again.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m here,\" I say.\nAfter a long pause, he'd sigh and say, \"I guess they\u2019re at school by now.\u201dRelated: Alzheimer's Will be Fiscal Nightmare of the CenturyThe nurses advised Mom to go along.\nRelated: Alzheimer's Funding Should Be a No-BrainerHe can still, even now, be a great closer."}
