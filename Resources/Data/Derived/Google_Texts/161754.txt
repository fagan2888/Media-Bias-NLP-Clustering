Not to say negotiating rookie contracts is easy in today’s NFL, but the Broncos just signed five draft picks in 24 hours.

Third-round draft pick Michael Schofield, a right offensive tackle from Michigan, and fifth-round selection Lamin Barrow, a linebacker from LSU, each received four-year deals Tuesday.

On Monday, the Broncos gave four-year contracts to second-round wide receiver Cody Latimer, sixth-round center Matt Paradis and seventh-round linebacker Corey Nelson.

The only unsigned player on the Broncos’ 89-man roster — a spot is open after the Broncos waived offensive tackle Ramon Harewood — is first-round cornerback Bradley Roby. Yet, because of the NFL’s draft pick contract-slotted system, even Roby’s total package and guarantee are pretty well established before negotiations started.

Schofield’s four-year deal will be worth about $2.75 million, with $521,200 coming in the form of a signing bonus. The 6-foot-6, 301-pounder has been impressive early, getting some reps with the second-team offense during the Broncos’ organized team activities this week.

Barrow will get approximately $2.4 million over four years, with $192,000 in signing bonus.
