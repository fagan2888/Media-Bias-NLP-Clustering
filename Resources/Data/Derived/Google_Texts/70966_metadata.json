But it\u2019s not completely clear that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee understands that being presidential means a whole lot more than not hurling insults.\n\nIt also means weighing the impact of your words before floating an idea in public the way Trump did yesterday in an interview with the financial news channel CNBC.\n\nRelated: GOP Chief -- This Isn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s Party\n\nIn part of a conversation about fiscal and monetary policy, Trump proposed that the US could reduce its national debt by pressuring creditors to accept less than full payment on Treasury securities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying a very low interest rate,\u201d Trump said of the current debt load. \u201cWhat happens if that interest rate goes two, three, four points up? We don\u2019t have a country. I mean, if you look at the numbers, they\u2019re staggering.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said that he would still use the debt markets to finance the government. \u201cI would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal...And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can\u2019t lose.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, Trump is suggesting that the US Treasury threaten to renege on its promise to pay investors the full amount they are owed on the bills, notes and bonds the government sells when it issues or rolls over its debts.\n\nRelated: Why People Are Worried About Donald Trump Learning State Secrets\n\nThis is an inexpressibly awful idea, and the fact that it came out of the mouth of a man who looks to be a major party presidential candidate is really amazing in at least two major ways.\n\nFirst is the ignorance it implies about how the debt markets work. US Treasury securities are the closest thing in the world to a risk-free asset. The assumption that the Treasury Department will pay its obligations on time and in full is precisely why the United States can borrow at extremely low rates, and is why they make up part of investment portfolios around the globe.\n\nWhether the US could cut down on its debt by strong-arming creditors at all when they have no incentive to agree to a deal is doubtful at best. Is Trump going to take the US government into Chapter 11? Not really an option.\n\nEven if Trump could force investors to accept less than 100 percent of what they are owed, the results would not be some sort of fiscal nirvana for the country. A demand by the US Treasury that its investors take a haircut on US securities would be a massive disruption to the markets, injecting uncertainty into one of the rare corners of near-absolute certainty in investing.\n\nRelated: The Battle Between Donald Trump and Paul Ryan Was Inevitable\n\nUncertainty implies risk, and risk demands reward, and the next thing President Trump would find out is that those low interest rates he was talking about have been replaced by higher ones -- much higher ones -- and that rolling over existing debt and issuing new debt to investors who no longer think the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the United States is worth very much just became vastly more expensive.\n\nThat touches on the second amazing thing about Trump\u2019s comments: he made them aloud and on television.\n\nConsider for a moment what would happen if President Obama, in an interview, let slip that his administration was considering a debt reduction strategy that involved stiffing the country\u2019s creditors. The reaction in the bond markets would be immediate and furious, with Treasury securities being sold off at a steep discount as the rate on new issues would skyrocket. And that\u2019s all without him making a single concrete move to put the plan into action.\n\nPoliticians are often criticized for appearing too scripted or reserved -- in fact, his willingness to say almost anything is a big part of Trump\u2019s appeal to many of his voters. But in many cases, there is a reason why politicians, particularly those in positions of power and influence, don\u2019t just spit out whatever ideas pop into their heads: It can have consequences.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Is the GOP\u2019s Dream Opponent, but Trump Is Its Nightmare\n\nIt may suggest something about what the markets believe about Trump\u2019s chances of actually becoming president that there was no appreciable reaction to his proposal yesterday. But as the general election approaches and he starts being taken seriously as a candidate for president, his words will start to carry a lot more weight.\n\nIt would probably be a good thing for the country if someone in the Trump organization took the candidate aside and explained that being \u201cpresidential\u201d extends well beyond avoiding schoolyard taunts to more complex matters, like thinking through the implications of a policy position before floating it on live television.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump needs to understand that being \u201cpresidential\u201d means a whole lot more than just not spewing insults at opponents.
