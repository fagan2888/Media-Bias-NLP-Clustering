But it\u2019s only temporary, said Alaska State Museums Conservator Ellen Carrlee.\n\n\u201cThe state is working on what they\u2019re calling the SLAM Project - the state libraries archives and museums project,\u201d Carrlee said. \u201cThose three entities, which have previously been in separate facilities, are coming together into one giant facility, which is under construction right now.\u201d\n\nThe new building will sit on the site of the old museum building, so the site will remain home for a number of exhibits, including a mining locomotive, historic kayaks, a lighthouse lens, mammoth tusks, \u201ctons and tons\u201d of taxidermized animals and a crab pot from the TV show \u201cDeadliest Catch.\u201d Come spring 2016, it will also house a restored Bristol Bay double-ender, Carrlee said.\n\nA Bristol Bay double-ender is a single-sail fishing boat that was widely used by immigrant fishermen from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s in Bristol Bay.\n\n\u201cThey were basically made to be filled with fish and with two guys in it, and (also) to be accidentally beached at (low) tide and be able to float off again at (high) tide,\u201d Carrlee said, \u201cbut they were slow and clunky and not very maneuverable. \u2026 They were like big, fat work horses.\u201d\n\nThe idea of the double-ender began in California in the 1860s, but it quickly moved up the coast, where the boats became known as \u201cColumbia River Salmon Boats\u201d for their effectiveness in harvesting salmon on the Columbia River, according to John Breiby, author of \u201cRigging the Spritsail on a Bristol Bay Double Ender.\u201d By the 1880s, the concept of small single-sail, low-sitting fishing boats traveled farther north - by bumming a ride, said Carrlee.\n\n\u201cThey would be on the deck of a bigger boat that would come up from Seattle, and it would have all these cannery workers on it and people who would be fishing in Bristol Bay,\u201d Carrlee said.\n\nOnce the double-enders reached Bristol Bay, they were manned by two fishermen.\n\n\u201cThe boat itself has this way that two people can run this boat, put the sail up and down and catch all these fish and live and sleep on it for days at a time,\u201d Carrlee said.\n\nAs more effective fishing methods and equipment developed, some double-enders were left to rot on beaches, but many were refurbished to accommodate motors, Carrlee said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably people in Ketchikan who have double-enders,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really popular to take them and covert them into motorized boats. It\u2019s pretty hard to find one that they haven\u2019t turned into what they call a conversion and had an engine put on them.\u201d\n\nBut the museum found one, and it had some of its original equipment, including oars, masthead, masthoops and sails - sails in rough shape.\n\n\u201cThe old sails that we have are dirty, and they have splotches and stains and whatnot from use,\u201d Carrlee said.\n\nA little wear and tear would be alright for just a display, but the museum had something different in mind, Carrlee said.\n\n\u201cThe exhibit designers wanted to be able to project film footage of Bristol Bay double-enders under sail in Bristol Bay doing this kind of work,\u201d Carrlee said. \u201cThe Alaska State Library\u2019s historical collection has really cool film footage. \u2026 The idea was, \u2018Why don\u2019t we have Louie Bartos make a replica sail that we could then use for that purpose of projecting this film and then we\u2019d also have an original Louie Bartos sail. How amazing would that be?\u2019\u201d\n\nBartos is a longtime Ketchikan local and the owner of Mariner Sails. He\u2019s also an internationally published author, an accomplished sailmaker and a dedicated sail and naval historian.\n\nBartos and Carrlee had previously worked together on preserving a piece of an old sail researchers had sent to him to analyze and interpret, and Bartos was the first person Carrlee thought of when the museum decided a replica sail was required for the projection project on the Bristol Bay double-ender.\n\n\u201cHow many people do you know who can make sails from scratch?\u201d Carrlee said.\n\nAnd not just any sails - historically accurate replicas that are more technically precise and carefully crafted than the originals.\n\n\u201cI took the original sail to Ketchikan and laid it out in Louie\u2019s sail loft,\u201d Carrlee said. \u201cWe got measurements off of it and looked at the technical details of the sail and talked over which aspects of the sail were things that we wanted to copy exactly and which ones, according to Louie, were poor workmanship that he would execute properly on the replica sail.\u201d\n\nThe original sails had a lot of errors, Bartos said, with the corners especially, but also the stitching of the bolt rope, which borders the outline of the sail and provides the sail\u2019s strength.\n\n\u201cThe original was production made,\u201d Bartos said, \u201cIn other words, the cannery said, \u2018Hey, make me 100 sails,\u2019 and like cookie cutters, they made them very quickly. What they did was skip stitches in the bolt rope - instead of each strand being hooked or stitched, it was every other one. Well, that\u2019s weak. (It\u2019s) poor, poor, poor construction, so it just doesn\u2019t set right. That rope is the strength of the sail. The cloth is not strong. These boats are pretty small, but on a ship, that\u2019s very, very, very important. That\u2019s the strength of the sail, that\u2019s what strong. The rest of it - nothing. It would just catch the wind, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nBartos is writing a book about the craft. The book, tentatively titled \u201cThe Evolution of Sails and Sailmaking between 1500 and 1900,\u201d currently runs some 900 pages long, and it\u2019s not finished.\n\n\u201cAll these little things - (I\u2019m always asking), \u2018How do they do that?\u2019 and I get onto it and suddenly that one paragraph becomes two pages, becomes 50 pages, something like that when you really dig into it,\u201d Bartos said.\n\nBartos learned to sail as a boy on the shores of Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, where he grew up. From his love of sailing, he picked up the basics in sailmaking.\n\n\u201cI started sailing then (as a 10-year-old boy) and I just sailed and sailed and anytime I got a chance to sail, I\u2019d sail - dinghy sails or good boats,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI was taught handsewing \u2026 and anytime I found an old-timer, I would bend his ear and say, \u2018How\u2019d you do that?\u2019 They would tell me because I was a kid - they didn\u2019t care. I had good teachers who taught me the old ways. \u2026 They told me all the basic stuff, and I just built on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old ways\u201d of sailmaking fascinate Bartos, he said.\n\n\u201cI like the history of stuff. It\u2019s probably one of my biggest problems, ever since I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201d \u2026 It used to bother me a lot - \u2018Where did that come from? When was that built and when did they put that ship on line and why did they do that?\u2019 It drove people nuttier than a fruitcake, me saying, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to know.\u2019 But you have to know to know when things are right or if they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nBartos\u2019 sail will be on display as a permanent exhibit at the Alaska State Museum in Juneau starting in June 2016.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Ketchikan (Alaska) Daily News, http://www.ketchikandailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Alaska State Museum in Juneau is homeless.
