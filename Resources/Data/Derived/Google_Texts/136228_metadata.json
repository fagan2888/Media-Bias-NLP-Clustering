Yet in his first outing on the presidential debate stage, the Texas senator found himself far away from the center of the action, largely above the fray while a handful of foes brawled in made-for-TV moments.\n\nIt was not entirely a surprise \u2014 Cruz has sworn off what he calls \"Republican-on-Republican violence\" \u2014 but it offered the clearest example yet of his approach to a fractured GOP field led by unpredictable billionaire Donald Trump. While Trump lobbed insults at candidates and moderators, Cruz managed to duck the rancor and convey his central pitch to Republican primary voters with little difficulty.\n\n\u201cWe see lots of campaign conservatives, but if we\u2019re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative,\" Cruz said as the debate clock wound down, giving him one last chance to drive home his anti-establishment appeal.\n\nAsked earlier in the debate about his polarizing reputation in Washington, he made no apology.\n\n\"If you're looking for someone to go to Washington to go along to get along ... to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists of special interests, then I ain't your guy,\" Cruz replied.\n\nCruz's answer came between contentious exchanges between Trump and others on stage over everything from the businessman's sexist comments to his inflammatory views on illegal immigration. The debate was also lit up by a tense episode between New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul sparked by a question about government surveillance.\n\nAfter the debate, Cruz allies argued his performance showed what he has claimed all along \u2014 that he will not get bogged down in nasty intra-party squabbles on the path to the White House.\n\n\"He came across as a statesman,\" spokesman Rick Tyler told reporters. \"He didn\u2019t engage in the kind of back-and-forth bickering and arguing.\u201d\n\n\"I see him tonight as very statesmanlike, very serious, and [he] demonstrated his fidelity to the Constitution even in the short amount of time he had,\" added state Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury.\n\nThe action-packed nature of the debate did not entirely work out in Cruz's favor. He seemed to receive less speaking time than the more assertive candidates, and at one point, he asked to interject before getting cut off by a commercial break.\n\nFollowing the debate, Cruz surrogates said any campaign always wishes its candidate got more time to speak in a debate. Tyler specifically cited three topics the campaign had hoped Cruz would be asked about: the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom and President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nThe closest Cruz got to acknowledging the more raucous aspects of the debate was an allusion to Trump's comment that \"stupid\" political leaders are responsible for federal inaction on border security.\n\nIt\u2019s not a question of stupidity,\" Cruz said. \"It\u2019s that they don\u2019t want to enforce the immigration laws.\u201d\n\nIt is on that issue that Cruz was anything but reluctant to a draw a broad contrast with the GOP field. He touted his efforts to derail the immigration reform bill initially supported by a fellow debater, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n\u201cA majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty,\" Cruz said. \"I have never supported amnesty.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune provided this story.\n\nVideos: Watch Ted Cruz debate highlights\n\nTed Cruz on Russia and China and cyberwar\n\nTed Cruz on ISIS\n\nTed Cruz on 'looking for someone to speak the truth'\n\nPhoto: Brian Snyder/Reuters", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "CLEVELAND \u2014 If there's one thing Ted Cruz relishes, it's a confrontation.
