But it's the quiet ones who may have the advantage.\n\nThe world is more extroverted than ever. But it's the quiet ones who may have the advantage. The RSA, YouTube/screenshot\n\nAs the United States moved from an agriculture-based economy to one based on big business, people started to prize different personality traits. Quiet, industrious types got outmoded, and in their place arrived the charismatic and the gregarious. Introversion was out. Extroversion was in.\n\nBut today the story is playing out very differently, argues Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts In A World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking. The world isn\u2019t either/or. There is room for both extroverts and introverts, as the dichotomy isn\u2019t a two-sided coin, but one continuous spectrum.\n\nIntroverts bring a sense of subtle confidence and observational firepower to what they do, while extroverts reach out into the world and talk, argue, and celebrate with it. \u201cMy vision of the right world is a world where it\u2019s yin and yang,\u201d Cain said in 2012, following her book\u2019s release. \u201cAnd there\u2019s space for introverts and there\u2019s space for extroverts. It\u2019s equal space.\u201d\n\nWithout an introvert to stop and think or an extrovert to get out and hustle, many people tend not to live up to their potential. Cain uses Apple duo Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak as an example. It was the quiet and reserved Wozniak who built the first Apple computer, but it was Jobs \u2014 the showman \u2014 who egged on his partner to sell it.\n\n\u201cThe two types are really drawn to each other,\u201d Cain said. And more than that, they \u201creally need each other.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "team, dynamics, introverts, observational, skills, bring, out, best, outgoing, extroverts, and", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The world is more extroverted than ever.
