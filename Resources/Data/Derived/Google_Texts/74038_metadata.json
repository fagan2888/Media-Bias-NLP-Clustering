Julia Roberts? The movie star will be lending wattage to the Emmys in the way that Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Winslet have in recent years \u2014 a distraction that proves TV still has a vestigial inferiority complex. Roberts is nominated for an Emmy, and could very well win, for her brief supporting turn in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d this year. And if history is a guide, she\u2019ll be given a marquee spot in the ceremony, even though her last role on the small screen was in a 1999 episode of \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d\n\nThe Emmys have a robust recent history of giving trophies to movie actors over their perhaps more deserving TV-centric peers, asking movie stars to present the top awards, and cutting to them in the audience. At TV\u2019s biggest night, it pays to spend most of your time working outside TV. Just ask Melissa McCarthy, who won a 2011 best actress Emmy for \u201cMike & Molly\u201d that was widely viewed as a prize for \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d or Gwyneth Paltrow, who scooped up an Emmy for \u201cGlee\u201d and went on to hand out the top prize of the night. The miniseries categories seem disproportionately weighted with superfame, partly by movie stars looking to pick up the \u201cE\u201d for their \u201cEGOT\u201d (Roberts in \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d Kidman in \u201cHemingway & Gellhorn,\u201d Winslet in \u201cMildred Pierce\u201d), and partly by the Emmy voters\u2019 own fixations. Ellen Burstyn famously got an Emmy nomination for her 14-second cameo in the HBO film \u201cMrs. Harris,\u201d and won last year for an over-the-top role as a former showgirl in the fun but risible \u201cPolitical Animals.\u201d She\u2019s nominated again this year for Lifetime\u2019s \u201cFlowers in the Attic,\u201d no one\u2019s idea of an instant classic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The parade of megawatt film stars at the Emmys is evidence of TV's vestigial inferiority complex", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The parade of megawatt film stars at the Emmys is evidence of TV's vestigial inferiority complex", "title": "Julia Roberts doesn\u2019t need the spotlight: Why the Emmys is too obsessed with movie stars", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/21/julia_roberts_doesnt_need_the_spotlight_why_the_emmys_is_too_obsessed_with_movie_stars/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/julia_roberts_normal_heart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The parade of megawatt film stars at the Emmys is evidence of TV's vestigial inferiority complex", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/julia_roberts_normal_heart.jpg", "title": "Julia Roberts doesn\u2019t need the spotlight: Why the Emmys is too obsessed with movie stars", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Julia Roberts doesn\u2019t need the spotlight: Why the Emmys is too obsessed with movie stars", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Julia Roberts, The Emmys", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde28\"", "article_summary": "Julia Roberts?\nTopics: Julia Roberts, The Emmys, Entertainment NewsThe first round of Emmy presenters to get announced included some of TV\u2019s biggest stars \u2014 Bryan Cranston, Julianna Margulies, Julia Roberts, Jim Parsons\u2026Wait.\nRoberts is nominated for an Emmy, and could very well win, for her brief supporting turn in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d this year.\nAt TV\u2019s biggest night, it pays to spend most of your time working outside TV.\nEllen Burstyn famously got an Emmy nomination for her 14-second cameo in the HBO film \u201cMrs."}
