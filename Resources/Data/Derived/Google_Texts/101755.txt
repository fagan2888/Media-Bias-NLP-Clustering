An oil tanker roll-over crash in western Colorado along the Colorado River Sunday evening closed Interstate 70 in both directions for several hours, a Colorado State Patrol spokesman said.

About 30 gallons of oil spilled as the truck trailer broke apart in the westbound lane around 5:33 p.m., State Patrol Trooper Tim Sutherland said.

The spill happened less than a quarter mile from the Colorado River, Sutherland said, but oil did not reach the river.

“It is not going to affect the river,” he said.

A Grand Junction hazardous materials team was handling cleanup along I-70 Sunday night. At 8:50 p.m., the Colorado Department of Transportation tweeted that the eastbound lanes had reopened.

The cause of the crash wasn’t clear, Sutherland said. “We’re still investigating it.”
