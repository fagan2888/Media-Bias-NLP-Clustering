JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It's the biggest victory in University of North Florida basketball history.



The Ospreys took home the Atlantic-Sun Conference championship title Sunday night beating USC-Upstate 63-57.



With the win, UNF "swooped" in for a slot in the NCAA men's basketball tournament and made team history.



UNF made history on the court, and on campus the Ospreys are still flying on cloud nine.



ESPN spent the day on campus interviewing star players, coaches and the instant Internet sensation and dancing machine freshman, Stephen Putnam, the team's MVP.



It's a moment these young men will never forget and it's not over yet. Strap on your dancing shoes, Ospreys -- it's time to take flight.
