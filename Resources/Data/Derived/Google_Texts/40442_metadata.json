Organizer Russel Counce said the entire event usually attracts about 15,000, but this year\u2019s attendance totaled about 8,000 due to the weather.\n\nThe toss is a female-only event in which contestants age 4 to 100 compete to see how far they can send the skillet flying.\n\nThe only rule is that contestants can not step over a designated line as they toss their skillet. The event, although an interesting game to watch, can also be dangerous as the skillets sometimes find unintended targets, like spectators or journalists who get too close for their own good.\n\n\u201cI just threw it,\u201d said Wendy James, an Alabama native who claimed first prize in the 31 to 45 age group. \u201cMy husband told me to pretend he was out there.\u201d\n\nEach contestant approached the event with their own personal technique. Some would swing the skillet a few times before making a toss, stepping forward in hopes of giving the iron projectile an extra push of centripetal force.\n\nOthers would use their brute strength to launch the skillet with feet planted firmly to the ground. But not matter what method used, contestants who mastered the timing of the whole process seemed to be the most successful.\n\nThe game\u2019s history is not entirely clear. Some accounts claim the event began during the times of the westward traveling pioneers, when women would pass the time away competing to see who could throw their cookware the farthest while waiting for their husbands to return.\n\nAnother story \u2014 perhaps more unnerving to some \u2014 is that those women who showed a talent for throwing their skillets with both power and accuracy might have gained the upper hand in their marriages.\n\nAnd yet organizer Felecia Nix said there just had to be an alternative to a tractor pull.\n\n\u201cWe wanted something for the women to participate in,\u201d the competition\u2019s organizer Felecia Nix said.\n\nCompetitors were divided between six different age groups. A total of 40 women and girls took part in the competition with three of the farthest throwing gals from each age group receiving an award.\n\nFirst place winners from each age group took home \u2014 What else? \u2014 a skillet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAWRENCEBURG \u2014 Whether contestants throw it, toss it, pitch it or just chunk it, they all have one goal in mind \u2014 sending the 10-inch cast iron skillet farther than anyone else.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "MIKE CHRISTEN mchristen@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "LAWRENCEBURG \u2014 Whether contestants throw it, toss it, pitch it or just chunk it, they all have one goal in mind \u2014 sending the 10-inch cast iron skillet farther than anyone else.", "title": "Lawrenceburg skillet toss wins crowds", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/lifestyles/celebrations/lawrenceburg-skillet-toss-wins-crowds", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_WendyJamesSkilletToss.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/lifestyles/celebrations/lawrenceburg-skillet-toss-wins-crowds", "title": "Lawrenceburg skillet toss wins crowds", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1299211", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1299211", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Celebrations,Features,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T06:00:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc71f\"", "article_summary": "The toss is a female-only event in which contestants age 4 to 100 compete to see how far they can send the skillet flying.\nFirst place winners from each age group took home \u2014 What else?\n\u201cI just threw it,\u201d said Wendy James, an Alabama native who claimed first prize in the 31 to 45 age group.\nThe only rule is that contestants can not step over a designated line as they toss their skillet.\nLAWRENCEBURG \u2014 Whether contestants throw it, toss it, pitch it or just chunk it, they all have one goal in mind \u2014 sending the 10-inch cast iron skillet farther than anyone else."}
