We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nSANDERS TAKES GLOVES OFF AGAINST CLINTON IN INTERVIEW: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is drawing sharper distinctions with front-runner Hillary Clinton, casting her policy reversals over the years as a character issue that voters should take into account when they evaluate the Democratic field. Sen. Sanders of Vermont, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, also said the federal investigation of the security surrounding Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email account is appropriate.\n\nJIM LO SCALZO/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY\n\nIn the Democratic debate last month, Mr. Sanders said voters were \u201csick and tired\u201d of the focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cdamn emails.\u201d Afterward, many Democrats and political analysts said that he had appeared to dismiss her use of a private email account and server in her four years as secretary of state. Mr. Sanders rejected that assessment on Wednesday. If her email practices foiled public-records requests or compromised classified information, those are \u201cvalid questions,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s pointed comments mark a turning point in what has been a polite Democratic contest. When he entered the race in the spring, Mr. Sanders barely mentioned Mrs. Clinton by name. When he did, it was merely to spell out plain-vanilla differences over policy.

Marco Rubio is defending his use of an American Express card issued to him by the Republican Party of Florida when he served in the state\u2019s legislature, a day after rival Donald Trump called his credit card use \u201ca disaster\u201d \u2026 When Sen. Bernie Sanders files paperwork on Thursday to run in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary, a question looms: Is he a Democrat, and if not, can he run in that party\u2019s primary?

Republicans give him high marks for being easygoing and likable and for possessing the experience and knowledge to handle the presidency. He also scores much higher than businessman Donald Trump on having the right temperament for the job, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. But the numbers get pretty grim from there.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, has routinely conducted cyberwarfare against American government agencies for years. But the U.S. officials said there has been a surge in such attacks coinciding with the arrest last month of Siamak Namazi, an energy industry executive and business consultant who has pushed for stronger U.S.-Iranian economic and diplomatic ties. Jay Solomon reports.\n\nMOHAMMED BADRA/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY\n\nU.S., ALLIES TO BOOST AID TO SYRIA REBELS: The U.S. and its regional allies agreed to increase shipments of weapons and other supplies to help moderate Syrian rebels hold their ground and challenge the intervention of Russia and Iran on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, U.S. officials and their counterparts in the region said. The deliveries from the Central Intelligence Agency, Saudi Arabia and other allied spy services deepen the fight between the forces battling in Syria, despite President Barack Obama\u2018s public pledge to not let the conflict become a U.S.-Russia proxy war. Adam Entous reports.\n\nPlus: Democrats in Congress have grown increasingly critical of President Obama\u2019s strategy in Syria after his decision last week to send special-operations forces to assist in the fight against Islamic State militants.\n\nOBAMA LOOKS MORE LIKELY TO CLOSE GUANTANAMO VIA EXECUTIVE ACTION: President Obama appears increasingly likely to have to resort to executive action to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a move that would fulfill one of his earliest promises. The president is making a last-ditch effort to work through Congress to shut down the prison, but his timing is expected to trigger a battle with lawmakers that allies said he can\u2019t win. Guantanamo Bay held 112 detainees as of Oct. 30, down from 240 when Mr. Obama took office. Mr. Obama plans to send a revised plan on the prison to Congress in coming days. Carol E. Lee and Kristina Peterson report.\n\nREP. BRADY GAINS EDGE TO BECOME HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN: Rep. Kevin Brady will likely become the next chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee after winning an intraparty contest Wednesday. Mr. Brady beat Rep. Pat Tiberi of Ohio in a vote of the House Republicans\u2019 steering committee, a group where new House Speaker Paul Ryan had outsize sway to select his successor as Ways and Means chairman. The choice must be ratified by the full Republican conference, which is set to meet Thursday morning. Mr. Brady will become one of the party\u2019s leading voices on tax, trade and health policy. He said in a statement that he wanted to implement a \u201cpro-growth agenda\u201d for the country. Richard Rubin reports.\n\nPlus: A bill requiring hedge funds to disclose their holdings more frequently was introduced in Congress, a move that if signed into law would represent a seismic change for the hedge-fund industry.\n\nGETTY IMAGES\n\nPACIFIC TRADE AGREEMENT HERALDS PUBLIC BATTLE: The text of the sweeping Pacific trade agreement that the U.S. concluded with Japan and 10 other countries around the Pacific was released on Thursday, setting off a public battle over the merits of the deal and whether it should be ratified. William Mauldin reports.\n\nSUPREME COURT UPDATE: Maryland Republicans seeking to reinstate a challenge to the state\u2019s 2011 congressional map made headway early in Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court arguments.
