The maximum amount an uninsured family will be penalized is $975 under the flat-rate method.\n\n\u201cThe penalty is meant to incentivize people to get coverage,\u201d Laura Adams, senior analyst of InsuranceQuotes.com, told CBS News. \u201cThis year, I think a lot of people are going to be in for a shock.\u201d\n\nCBS News reports that many Obamacare plans will be charging more as a 27-year-old earning 250 percent of the poverty rate will now have to pay an average of 7 percent more for the lowest-cost bronze plan. The analysis from Investor\u2019s Business Daily found that the lowest-cost silver plan will rise 9 percent and the lowest-priced catastrophic policy will go up by 18 percent.\n\nHHS Secretary: \u2018The Affordable Care Act Is Working\u2019\n\nAdams stated that very few uninsured Americans don\u2019t understand the penalties they are facing.\n\n\u201cThere is very little awareness of this,\u201d she told CBS News. \u201cUntil people understand the financial consequences, they don\u2019t have an incentive.\u201d\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department said earlier this week that between 9 to 9.9 million Americans will receive health care plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for next year\u2019s coverage. That\u2019s lower than the 13 million estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bugs have supposedly been removed from the famously troubled http://www.healthcare.gov website, which can withstand last season\u2019s peak loads and beyond with at least 125,000 simultaneous users. The online application has been pared from 76 screens to 16 for most consumers.\n\nThe \u201cyoung invincible\u201d crowd of 18-to-36 year olds is crucial to the law\u2019s success because insurance companies need their business to offset the costs of covering older, sicker and more expensive enrollees.\n\nWhat Has The Affordable Care Act Accomplished A Year Later?\n\nExperts say education is one of the biggest challenges as many consumers only focused on the low monthly premium last year and didn\u2019t understand the potentially high deductible and out-of-pocket costs. Consumers were confused when they discovered their doctor wasn\u2019t in their plan\u2019s network or that they had to pay for testing because deductibles hadn\u2019t been met.\n\nInsurance companies say volume will always be an issue because open enrollment coincides with Medicare enrollment and many large groups also renew their policies in January. But insurers say they\u2019ve expanded Internet bandwidth, added staff and increased customer service hours.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
