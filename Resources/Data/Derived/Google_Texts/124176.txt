The top 25 cities on the latest Mercer Quality of Living Rankings don’t include even one metro area from the United States.

The highest-ranked U.S. cities on the list include San Francisco (27), Boston (33), and Honolulu (36). The list considers 39 factors, including political and social environment, economic environment, and healthcare conditions, in more than 440 cities.

The study is used by multinational companies to determine compensation packages for workers that they send abroad.

European cities dominate the list, with Vienna taking the top spot, followed by Zurich , Auckland , and Munich . Even with economic concerns, Western European cities offer a stable environment and many have tightened security following the attacks in Paris and Copenhagen , according to Mercer.

North America still has a strong showing, slightly further down on the list. In fifth place, Vancouver is the highest-ranking North American city, followed by Toronto (15), and Ottawa (16). “Quality of living remained high in North American cities overall, due to the range of consumer goods and services that are available,” Steve Nurney, Mercer’s North America Global Mobility business leader said in a statement.
