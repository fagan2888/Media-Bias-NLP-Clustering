There\u2019s a strong case as to why it won\u2019t, but the prospect of another fiscal impasse remains a distinct possibility.\u201d\n\nWashington Post\u2019s Karen Tumulty writes \u201cthe GOP establishment has embarked, once again, on a round of soul-searching. But this time, the question is: What will it take to save the Republicans from the self-destructive impulses of the tea party movement? That the government shutdown was a political disaster for the party that engineered it is widely acknowledged, except by the most ardent tea partyers. And that near-unanimity presents an opportunity for the establishment to strike back \u2014 and maybe regain some control from the insurgent wing.\u201d\n\nPolitico looks at the political \u201canatomy\u201d of the shutdown: \u201cThe fiscal drama turned on a series of complicated relationships, internecine Republican warfare and rare Democratic unity.\u201d\n\n\n\nNBC\u2019s Jessica Taylor: \u201cThe lobbying arm of conservative think tank Heritage Foundation is credited with helping to direct the GOP-push to shut down the government over Obamacare. But with the government reopened and the GOP having little to show for it, some Republicans wonder if Heritage overplayed its hand. \u2018Heritage used to be the conservative organization helping Republicans and helping conservatives and helping us to be able to have the best intellectual conservative ideas,\u2019 longtime GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said on Thursday\u2019s The Daily Rundown. \u2018There\u2019s a real question in the minds of many Republicans right now, and I\u2019m not just speaking for myself: Is Heritage going to go so political that it really doesn\u2019t amount to anything anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nHeritage Foundation President Jim DeMint took to the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages to defend his group\u2019s crusade against Obamacare. We \u201cwill continue to fight. The reason is simple: to protect the American people from the harmful effects of this law.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who pushed the strategy to tie government funding to defunding President Obama\u2019s health care law, wouldn\u2019t rule out revisiting it in the coming months. \u2018I would do anything, and I will continue to do anything I can, to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,\u2019 Cruz said when asked by ABC News\u2019 Jon Karl whether he would rule out another shutdown. \u2018The test that matters Jon, is are we doing anything for all the people that are getting hurt from Obamacare?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Hill: Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell says he will not allow another government shutdown as part of a strategy to repeal ObamaCare. McConnell\u201d said \u201cthat his party learned a painful political lesson over the past 16 days, as its approval rating dropped while the government was shuttered\u2026.\u2019One of my favorite old Kentucky sayings is there\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule. The first kick of a mule was when we shut the government down in the mid-1990s and the second kick was over the last 16 days,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is no education in the second kick of a mule. There will not be a government shutdown.\u2019\u201d\n\nPolitico: \u201cRepublican donors were horrified in November after pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into losing campaigns for president and Congress with nothing to show for it. A year later they\u2019re appalled by how little has changed, angered by the behavior of Republican lawmakers during a string of legislative battles this year capped by the shutdown, and searching for answers. In conversation after conversation, donors express growing frustration with the party and the constellation of outside groups they\u2019ve been bankrolling.\u201d\n\nWriting from the Bluegrass State, National Journal\u2019s Jill Lawrence argues that \u201cmost important for Republicans judging Paul\u2019s 2016 viability and his potential to turn enthusiastic fans at rallies into GOP votes at the polls is this: At a time when Americans despise the notion of more foreign entanglements, he has somehow made President Obama and his Democrats look like interventionist hawks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdd another name to the short list of Democrats seriously considering a run for president in 2016. In an interview with RealClearPolitics, former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer indicated that he may launch a White House bid, even if front-runner Hillary Clinton also enters the race.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Rundown\u2019s Jessica Taylor writes that \u201c2016 hopefuls are scrambling to shape the narrative of how they handled the fiasco\u2013especially ones who had to take the tough votes.\u201d and looks at how the storlines are emerging: \u201cRand Paul: The Reboot, Paul Ryan: The Insider\u2019s Balancing Act, Ted Cruz: The New Reality Star, and Marco Rubio: The Cautious Conservative.\u201d\n\nPolitico echoes the Paul shift, writing that \u201cAccording to many moderate GOP observers, the Kentucky Republican and likely 2016 contender has deftly maneuvered the past several weeks of shutdown politics, toeing the conservative line without alienating the rest of the party \u2014 especially compared to his frequent sidekick\u201d Cruz.\n\n\n\nNational Review notices that \u201cSenator Marco Rubio began this year amid buzz that he was the logical choice to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He is likely to finish it on a decidedly lower note, partly removed from the national spotlight, eclipsed by the rising star from Texas, Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nCharlie Cook writes that \u201cthe question is whether conservatives and Republicans should begin to worry if their instincts\u2014specifically, their judgment on matters of politics and policy\u2014are a bit off. Maybe \u2018spectacularly wrong\u2019 would be more accurate. Does that worry anyone on the right or in the Republican Party? Are they concerned that continuing to follow such awful political instincts could lead to catastrophic consequences for their movement and their party?\u201d\n\nStu Rothenberg notes that \u201cthe deal to open the government and raise the debt ceiling may be done, but the damage to the national Republican Party is considerable\u2026.The problem, of course, is that the Ted Cruz/Ted Yoho wing of the party doesn\u2019t really believe in negotiation, which, at its core, requires compromise. And while they don\u2019t like compromise, they are particularly unwilling to negotiate with a president they regard as illegitimate and at war with fundamental American values.\u201d\n\nCook Political Report\u2019s David Wasserman writes that \u201cMostly as a result of the damage House Republicans sustained during the 16-day government shutdown, we are making changes to our ratings in 15 House seats, all but one in Democrats\u2019 direction. Democrats still have a very uphill climb to a majority, and it\u2019s doubtful they can sustain this month\u2019s momentum for another year. But Republicans\u2019 actions have energized Democratic fundraising and recruiting efforts and handed Democrats a potentially effective message.\u201d\n\nMISSISSIPPI: AP: \u201cSecond-term state Sen. Chris McDaniel said Thursday that he\u2019s running for the U.S. Senate in 2014, a decision that likely pits him against longtime incumbent Thad Cochran in the Republican primary. Cochran turns 76 in December and is expected to announce late this year whether he\u2019ll seek re-election to the Senate seat he first won in 1978.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Rundown\u2019s Jessica Taylor reports that McDaniel \u201cswiftly got the backing of both the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund \u2013 their first Senate endorsements of the 2014 cycle \u2013 along with the Madison Project\u2026..their rush to throw their lot with McDaniel shows they not only want to pressure Cochran to take the easy exit, but that they want to stake a claim for McDaniel in what could be a crowded field if the senator does retire. In the third quarter of the year, Cochran raised only $48,000 \u2013 hardly the cash needed for a statewide bid, even in an inexpensive state like Mississippi. He had $804,000 in the bank.\u201d\n\nNEW JERSEY: Wall Street Journal: \u201cA day after Cory Booker became New Jersey\u2019s senator-elect, the outsize role he could play in Washington and Democratic Party politics began to become clear on Thursday. A spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Mr. Booker\u2014fresh off a victory over a conservative opponent\u2014could be asked to raise money and stump for Democrats running against tea-party candidates. The Newark mayor appeared with Republican Gov. Chris Christie and pledged to cut through Washington\u2019s partisan rancor.\u201d\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA: Sioux Falls Argus Leader: \u201cA controversial Sioux Falls Republican has filed paperwork to run for governor next year. Lora Hubbel, a former state lawmaker and local party official, will challenge Gov. Dennis Daugaard in the Republican primary if she\u2019s able to get enough voter signatures next year.\u201d\n\nVIRGINIA: NBC\u2019s Domenico Montanaro: \u201cNational Republicans may be glad the midterm elections are a year away after polls have shown the party\u2019s favorability at all-time lows because of the federal government shutdown. But one Republican \u2013 in a swing state \u2013 is caught in the buzz saw. A new NBC4/NBC News/Marist poll finds Republican Ken Cuccinelli slipping further behind Democrat Terry McAuliffe, 46 to 38 percent in the race for Virginia governor among likely voters. That\u2019s 3 points wider than McAuliffe\u2019s 43 to 38 percent lead a month ago \u2013 before the shutdown. Libertarian Robert Sarvis gets 9 percent.\u201d\n\nJessica Taylor notes at The Daily Rundown that \u201cCuccinelli\u2019s woman problem is only getting worse.\u201d McAuliffe\u2019s \u201clead with women is now at 20 points\u2013a two-point jump since last month\u2019s NBC poll\u2013with McAuliffe up among female likely voters 52%-32%. Cuccinelli still leads among men, 44%-40%, but that\u2019s been cut in half since his eight point lead with likely male voters last month.\u201d\n\nAnd yet another ad releaed Thursday by McAuliffe was aimed at women, the Washington Post notes.\n\nAP: \u201cA federal judge will hear arguments today from Virginia Democrats who want the State Board of Elections to reinstate nearly 40,000 voters who were recently purged from the voter rolls. County officials conducted the purge recently on orders from the state, based on evidence that the voters had subsequently registered in other states. But the Democratic Party of Virginia says the list used to conduct the purge was riddled with errors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "McConnell says his party won't allow another shutdown and has learned its lesson, but Cruz says he'd continue to do 'anything' to stop Obamacare.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-daily-rundown/first-read-flash-0", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "McConnell says his party won't allow another shutdown and has learned its lesson, but Cruz says he'd continue to do 'anything' to stop Obamacare.", "title": "First Read Flash: 'No education in the second kick of a mule'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-daily-rundown/first-read-flash-0", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/dailyrundown_firstreadflash_general.png?itok=SFlBTNu_", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "First Read Flash: 'No education in the second kick of a mule'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-daily-rundown/first-read-flash-0", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/dailyrundown_firstreadflash_general.png?itok=ez-XuRey", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "McConnell says his party won't allow another shutdown and has learned its lesson, but Cruz says he'd continue to do 'anything' to stop Obamacare."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-18T08:45:08-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "McConnell says his party won't allow another shutdown and has learned its lesson, but Cruz says he'd continue to do 'anything' to stop Obamacare.", "nv": {"author": "fb-jessleanne", "title": "First Read Flash: 'No education in the second kick of a mule'", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-daily-rundown/first-read-flash-0", "published": 1, "date": "10/18/2013 08:45:08 EDT", "tags": "the-daily-rundown"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6440\"", "article_summary": "The first kick of a mule was when we shut the government down in the mid-1990s and the second kick was over the last 16 days,\u2019 he said.\nDoes that worry anyone on the right or in the Republican Party?\n\u2018There is no education in the second kick of a mule.\nA new NBC4/NBC News/Marist poll finds Republican Ken Cuccinelli slipping further behind Democrat Terry McAuliffe, 46 to 38 percent in the race for Virginia governor among likely voters.\nThat the government shutdown was a political disaster for the party that engineered it is widely acknowledged, except by the most ardent tea partyers."}
