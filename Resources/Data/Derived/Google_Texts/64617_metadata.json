This week, Congress finished up some important work before heading home for the holidays.\n\nFor the first time in years, both parties came together in the spirit of compromise to pass a budget \u2014 one that helps chart our economic course for the next two years. This budget will unwind some of the damaging cuts that have threatened students and seniors and held back our businesses.\n\nIt clears the path for critical investments in the things that grow our economy and strengthen our middle class, like education and research. And it will keep reducing our deficits \u2014 at a time when we\u2019ve seen four years of the fastest deficit reduction since the end of World War II.\n\nMembers of Congress also voted to finally allow several dedicated and well-qualified public servants to do their jobs for the American people \u2014 many of whom waited months for a simple yes-or-no vote.\n\nThese are judges, cabinet secretaries and military leaders. They\u2019re men and women charged with growing our economy, keeping our homeland secure, and making sure our housing system and financial system work for ordinary Americans.\n\nSo after a year of showdowns and obstruction that only held back our economy, we\u2019ve been able to break the logjam a bit over the last few weeks. It\u2019s a hopeful sign that we can end the cycle of short-sighted, crisis-driven decision-making and actually work together to get things done.\n\nAnd that\u2019s important. Because there\u2019s plenty of work to do.\n\nRight now, because Congress failed to act before leaving on vacation, more than one million Americans are poised to lose a vital source of income just a few days after Christmas. For many people who are still looking for work, unemployment insurance is a lifeline that can make the difference between temporary hardship or lasting catastrophe.\n\nInstead of punishing these families who can least afford it \u2014 especially now \u2014 Congress should first restore that lifeline immediately, then put their entire focus on creating more good jobs that pay good wages.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll be focused on next year, and every day I have the privilege of being your President. Growing the economy. Expanding opportunity. Building an America that offers everyone who works hard the chance to get ahead, and every child a fair shot at success.\n\nAnd if Congress continues to act in the spirit of cooperation we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, I\u2019m confident we can make much more progress together in the year to come. Thank you. Have a great weekend and a very Merry Christmas. ####\n\nRELATED:\n\nAnother empty Obama vow ignites a media revolt\n\nInside the News: The true unemployment rate is 11+%\n\nThe Obamas get by this year with only 24 Christmas trees\n\nObamaCare: Time to delay the law for everyone, not just business", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's weekly remarks Hi, everybody.
