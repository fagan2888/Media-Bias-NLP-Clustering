The path is difficult and dangerous for Border Patrol agents to access, says Spratte, and easy for smugglers to direct immigrants onto U.S. soil.\n\nSpratte describes how smugglers transport children and families from one side of the Anzalduas Dam to the other. Once in the U.S., many of them willingly give themselves up. Within the last several months, the Border Patrol agent says, the Department of Homeland Security, or \u201cwhoever controls press access\u201d to the U.S. side of the dam, has made it more difficult for the news media to get to that spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really restricted the ability of the American press to report what\u2019s going on to the public,\u201d Spratte said. \u201cWe believe the public has a right to know what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s difficult when the press is being controlled and not allowed to go to those areas.\u201d\n\nIn a highly visible part of Anzalduas Park in the Rio Grande Valley, Spratte describes how human smugglers use jet skis to transport men, women, and children from parkland on the Mexico side of the river to the Texas side. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a checkpoint at the park,\u201d he said, making it \u201cimpossible\u201d to tell whether people arrived illegally.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In three news videos, a Border Patrol agent shows The Daily Signal how Central Americans cross illegally from Mexico into the U.S. near McAllen, Texas.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In three news videos, a Border Patrol agent shows The Daily Signal how Central Americans cross illegally from Mexico into the U.S. near McAllen, Texas.", "title": "This Is Exactly How Central Americans Cross Mexico-Texas Border", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140716_BorderPatrol_Thumb.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-16T22:36:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1oJ0Zhe"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In three news videos, a Border Patrol agent shows The Daily Signal how Central Americans cross illegally from Mexico into the U.S. near McAllen, Texas.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140716_BorderPatrol_Thumb.jpg"}, "title": "This Is Exactly How Central Americans Cross Mexico-Texas Border", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-07-16T16:03:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T22:36:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e22\"", "article_summary": "Along the banks of the Rio Grande Valley, illegal immigrants navigate tall sugarcane to make it onto American shore.\nSpratte describes how smugglers transport children and families from one side of the Anzalduas Dam to the other.\n\u201cWelcome to America,\u201d Border Patrol agent Albert Spratte says.\nIn the three videos below, Spratte breaks down the illegal immigrants\u2019 access points, revealing how easy it remains to break into America.\nAs politicians in Washington debate how to best deal with the influx of illegal immigrants from Central America along the southwest border, smugglers continue to transport women, children, and entire families into the country."}
