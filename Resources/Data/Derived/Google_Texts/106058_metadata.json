The show\u2019s seven seasons covered the turbulent decade from 1960 until 1970, dramatizing changing styles and social mores in the lives of \u201cMad Men\u201d and women, or professionals in the Madison Avenue advertising industry.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t regular watchers: A lot of the show\u2019s male characters spent their time chasing young women around the office and a lot of the female characters spent their time trying to land or keep a husband.\n\nCritics have consistently lauded the series, not just for its entertainment value but also for exposing the dark underbelly of a prosperous, conservative era. Yet I can\u2019t help but wonder if in some ways life wasn\u2019t easier back then \u2014 especially for single, marriage-minded women.\n\nNew York City career women in their 30s and 40s told me this week that in some ways life seemed easier back then for single women, and love was easier to find during our mothers\u2019 day than it is now.\n\nMelanie Notkin, cultural anthropologist and author of \u201cOtherhood: Modern Women Finding a New Kind of Happiness,\u201d said the women she interviewed, \u201cno matter their race, ethnicity or cultural background, had similar concerns with dating \u2014 men didn\u2019t plan dates, dressed down for dates, were no longer chivalrous.\u201d\n\nAlthough she faced other problems, surely Joan, the voluptuous office manager on \u201cMad Men,\u201d didn\u2019t date anyone who failed to put on a suit, plan an evening and pay the check.\n\nThe proliferation of online dating sites and \u201chookup culture\u201d \u2014 or decreased stigma around no-strings-attached sex between strangers \u2014 means that immature men\u2019s playground is no longer just the halls of their office buildings. It\u2019s the entire city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve become this commodity where men can pick out what they want whenever they want,\u201d said Alicia, 37, who works in advertising and lives downtown.\n\nSays Ellie, 42, a student on Manhattan\u2019s East Side who used to work in publishing, \u201cTechnology is supposed to bring people closer, but especially in the context of dating it pushes people further apart. It used to be a guy had to call and leave a message and you called him back and you made a date.\u201d\n\nNow, says Ellie, it\u2019s just \u201ctexting that leads nowhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there was more respect for marriage and family life during\u201d the 1950s and early 1960s, Ellie added. \u201cI wish I could travel backward to a simpler time.\u201d\n\nIndeed, for better or for worse, more Americans are putting off marriage or deciding to forgo it entirely: According to a September 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, the share of American adults who have never been married is at an all-time high.\n\nIn 1960, only one in 10 adults age 25 or older had never been married. Now it\u2019s up to one in five.\n\nPew also found that people are marrying for the first time later in life now than in the early 1960s: In 2011, the median age for first marriage was almost 29 for men and 26.5 for women as compared to the early 20s for both sexes in 1960.\n\nIs it possible that some of the wild enthusiasm for \u201cMad Men\u201d among viewers stems from a yearning for the satisfaction and sexiness of traditional sex roles, including chivalry?\n\n\u201cWhen I watch \u2018Mad Men,\u2019 I think, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it have been great to date a man who knows what he likes to drink, who pulls out the chair, who dresses up and is clean shaven and at least wears a sport jacket?\u2019 It\u2019s sexy,\u201d said Notkin.\n\n\u201cAlthough in many ways he\u2019s despicable, in certain ways many of us find Don Draper attractive,\u201d Notkin said, adding that the character Joan \u2014 the office bombshell \u2014 resonates with some female viewers because \u201cwe are craving the power of our femininity.\u201d\n\nUltimately most women want equality with men, and value the increased legal protection from sexual harassment in the workplace of the type dramatized in \u201cMad Men.\u201d\n\nAfter hours, though, some of us long for men who can treat us not only as equals to be respected, but as women to be desired \u2014 and cherished.\n\nHave we become madwomen to consider anything less?\n\nHeather Robinson is an independent journalist who lives in Manhattan and blogs at heatherrobinson.net.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The final episode of AMC\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d this Sunday heralds the end of a TV era.
