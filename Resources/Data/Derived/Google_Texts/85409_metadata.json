Connect for Health Colorado opened in October 2013. The state did not begin to address the exchange\u2019s security weaknesses until November 2014.\n\nIf personal information had been compromised, the consequences would have been severe, the inspector general said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we did not find evidence that the weaknesses had been exploited, exploitation could have resulted in unauthorized access to and disclosure of PII, as well as disruption of critical marketplace operations,\u201d the inspector general said. \u201cAs a result, the weaknesses were collectively and, in some cases, individually significant and could have compromised the integrity of Colorado\u2019s marketplace, thus increasing the risk that PII could have been exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, without proper safeguards, systems are not protected from individuals and groups that obtain access to commit fraud, waste, or abuse or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks,\u201d the inspector said.\n\nThe Colorado health exchange cost taxpayers more than $184 million to create, the audit said.\n\nThe audit marks the latest bad news for Obamacare in Colorado, after the state\u2019s biggest co-op announced it was folding last year. Colorado HealthOP collapsed in October, leaving 83,000 Coloradans without health insurance.\n\nThe inspector general shared its security findings with Connect for Health Colorado before publicly releasing the report, and said the exchange began addressing its security deficiencies. The exchange has fixed some of the problems, but only \u201cpartially remediated\u201d others.\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence provided, C4HCO has successfully remediated the issues we found related to the system security plan and incident response testing and has partially remediated the issues we found related to the application production databases and vulnerability mitigation,\u201d the inspector general said.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado did not immediately respond to request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Colorado Obamacare health exchange had \u201cnumerous weaknesses\u201d and had \u201cinadequate security settings,\u201d leaving enrollees' personal information vulnerable.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Obamacare health exchange in Colorado faced \u201cnumerous weaknesses\u201d and had \u201cinadequate security settings,\u201d leaving the personal information of enrollees vulnerable, according to a new audit", "title": "\u2018Numerous Weaknesses,\u2019 \u2018Inadequate Security Settings\u2019 Found in Colorado Obamacare Exchange", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/numerous-weaknesses-inadequate-security-settings-found-in-colorado-obamacare-exchange/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AP_437083740823-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obamacare health exchange in Colorado faced \u201cnumerous weaknesses\u201d and had \u201cinadequate secu", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AP_437083740823-150x150.jpg", "title": "\u2018Numerous Weaknesses,\u2019 \u2018Inadequate Security Settings\u2019 Found in Colorado Obamacare Exchange", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Colorado health exchange cost taxpayers more than $184 million to create, the audit said.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe Obamacare health exchange in Colorado faced \u201cnumerous weaknesses\u201d and had \u201cinadequate security settings,\u201d leaving the personal information of enrollees vulnerable, according to a new audit.\nThe inspector general shared its security findings with Connect for Health Colorado before publicly releasing the report, and said the exchange began addressing its security deficiencies.\nConnect for Health Colorado did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nConnect for Health Colorado opened in October 2013."}
