She greeted people on their way to the food pantry in the basement, but no one asked for advice about the law.\n\nFinally, Jill Clemons, of Braddock, stopped. She heard about the law\u2019s requirement to get insurance by March 31. She asked Ms. Byrd a set of questions and grabbed several fliers.\n\n\u201cI just want to feel more secure,\u201d said Ms. Clemons, who has been uninsured since she was laid off from UPMC last year.\n\nAs the law\u2019s March 31 deadline to get insurance approaches, Pennsylvania\u2019s navigators are cramming their schedules with outreach events, trying to enroll as many of the uninsured as they can. After that date, the uninsured will have to pay an annual fee of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is larger. The fee will grow over the years.\n\nWorking for the Allegheny Intermediate Unit in Homestead, Ms. Byrd is one of six navigators covering Allegheny, Beaver and Butler counties. They\u2019re funded by a federal grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nResources for Human Development, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia, is overseeing the efforts of 30 navigators in Pennsylvania. It\u2019s concentrating them in the 10 counties with the largest number of uninsured people, said Laura Line, assistant director for health care. That includes Allegheny County, which had about 97,000 uninsured in 2010, according to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center.\n\nBy March 14, the 30 navigators had helped 18,500 people learn about the law or enroll in insurance plans, Ms. Line said.\n\n\u201cI think Pennsylvania is doing pretty well relative to other states, but certainly there are a lot of folks to help,\u201d she said.\n\nTo reach the uninsured, navigators go to places frequented by low- to middle-income working people who make too much to qualify for Medicaid. Those places include churches, the YMCA and the Salvation Army. Resources for Human Development has also put ads in newspapers, on the radio and on the sides of buses to spread the word about the March 31 deadline.\n\nMs. Byrd, who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December with a degree in health services, became a navigator because she plans to go into healthcare law. Before starting the job at the beginning of February, she went through 20 hours of online training, learning about tax credits, the details of the health law and the insurance industry in general.\n\nShe estimates that she\u2019s enrolled between 20 and 40 people. The job can be tough; people come with tricky questions. But it has its rewards. One woman took Ms. Byrd out to lunch after she helped her enroll in the federal marketplace.\n\n\u201cI like listening to people and their issues,\u201d Ms. Byrd said. \u201cI like to connect with people.\u201d\n\nOne of the job\u2019s challenges is explaining the intricacies of the 900-page law, which has different implications for people depending on their income and insurance status. Many come in knowing little about the law, afraid of the health insurance fees it could bring them, or the penalties for not having insurance.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not fully educated about something, and you hear things like being penalized, you start to panic,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother challenge for Ms. Byrd is helping people who don\u2019t file federal taxes, making them unable to get the tax credits that subsidize insurance under the law. Some are wary of filing a federal tax return because they don\u2019t understand that it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they would pay taxes, she said.\n\nSometimes, Ms. Byrd said, people go through the enrollment process before deciding they would rather just pay the penalty for not having insurance because they\u2019re healthy enough to go without it.\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d \u2014 people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for the Affordable Care Act subsidies. One of those people is Ms. Clemons. Ms. Byrd told her she can apply for an exemption from the law\u2019s penalty for not having insurance.\n\nWalking out of the Salvation Army with bags of groceries from the food pantry, Ms. Clemons said she planned to give Ms. Byrd a call. Going without insurance takes a toll on her, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really uncomfortable for me because I know I have appointments I need to make,\u201d said Ms. Clemons, 55. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable to know I can\u2019t get my prescriptions. It\u2019s really uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nRichard Webner: rwebner@post-gazette.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After the March 31 deadline, the uninsured will have to pay an annual fee of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is larger", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "An hour passed, and no one came up to Angela Byrd, a \u201cnavigator\u201d who helps the uninsured sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
