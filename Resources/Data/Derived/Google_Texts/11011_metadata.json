Mom asked me when I\u2019d get a \u201creal job\u201d like his.\n\n..\n\nThen the crusade against capitalism reached his world.\n\n\n\nMedical \u201cjournalists\u201d demanded that corporations distance themselves from medical research. They\u2019ll bias the results, \u201cput profits before people\u201d and sell dangerous goods.\n\n..\n\nTom didn\u2019t notice this \u201cconflict of interest crusade\u201d until he joined the scientific advisory board of a biotech company and learned how difficult it is to bring medical innovation to market. Now he\u2019s furious about what he calls \u201cpharma-phobia.\u201d\n\n..\n\nHe says criticism of medical-industry cooperation \u201cis a mixture of moralistic bullying, opinion unsupported by empirical evidence, speculation, simplistic and distorted interpretations ...\u201d\n\n\n\nYou get the idea. At dinner, we tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re probably right, but shut up now.\u201d\n\n..\n\nBut he shouldn\u2019t shut up. Trying to take money out of medicine will deprive us of the very innovation we want. Drug companies are the ones with the resources to create cures. It\u2019s insane to limit their access to medical research.\n\n..\n\nTom just wrote a book about this titled \u201cPharmaphobia: How the Conflict of Interest Myth Undermines American Medical Innovation.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne way that the anti-capitalists want to purify medicine is by urging people not to trust scientists who consult for industry and to ban them from government advisory panels and scientific studies. But it\u2019s usually the smartest researchers who are hired by industry. Banning them means banning the most qualified scientists.\n\n..\n\nWhile activists denounce industry for \u201cexploiting\u201d sick people, industry keeps helping us live healthier lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the nearly 50 years I\u2019ve been a physician, health care has improved,\u201d writes Tom. \u201cOur lifespan has increased by 10 years, we\u2019re half as likely to die of a heart attack or stroke, and suffer a lot less from arthritis as we age.\u201d If that\u2019s what happens when capitalists get involved in medicine, I say: Let\u2019s have more of it!\n\n..\n\nThe activists take new treatments for granted but resent paying for them and resent the profit motive that brought them about. So do many patients.\n\n\n\nTom\u2019s brother-in-law Patrick was dying of cancer until he was given a new drug that\u2019s kept him alive for 15 years. Patrick was grateful but angry that the drug costs so much: $123,000 per year (his insurance company pays the bill).\n\n..\n\nThat cost \u2014 $123,000 \u2014 seems outrageous, especially because activists claim government funds all-important scientific research. But that\u2019s a lie. Eighty-seven percent of new drugs are discovered by private industry, only 13 percent come from public-sector research.\n\n..\n\nThen there\u2019s the average 16 years of required government testing before it will allow you to sell anything. Only vilified industry has the patience and self-interest to wade through that process, knowing they may lose money because 9 out of 10 promising new drugs will never be approved.\n\n..\n\nYou start to suspect that the activists aren\u2019t really concerned about what\u2019s best for patients. Some are purists, argues Tom, who just want profit removed from life. But many have self-serving agendas: Insurers benefit from drug price controls, and a demonized industry is easier prey for prosecutors and tort lawyers.\n\n..\n\nNew rules imposed on universities and hospitals forbid doctors to educate other doctors about new drugs, or learn FDA-approved drug information from company representatives.\n\n\n\nEven tiny gifts from companies, like a pen with a corporate logo, are regarded as potentially corrupting. Part of Obamacare called the \u201cSunshine Law\u201d demands that companies report to the U.S. Department of Health any payment of as little as $10 to a doctor.\n\n..\n\nThis is useless. Few doctors are corrupted by a box of doughnuts, and no one reads thousands of pages of disclosure forms. Much worse is that it diverts billions of dollars from drug research to bureaucrats working pointlessly in companies\u2019 new \u201ccompliance\u201d departments.\n\n..\n\nIn a free market, medical practitioners and medical companies earn more money if they make their patients and customers happy and keep them healthy. That\u2019s the best incentive. I trust that competition more than I\u2019ll ever trust the activists who want to shut it down.\n\n..\n\nJohn Stossel is host of \u201cStossel\u201d on Fox News and author of \u201cNo They Can\u2019t!
