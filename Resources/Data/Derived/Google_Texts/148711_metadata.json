Very rarely does freedom ask how one feels. Rather it asks what is right.\n\nFreedom is also fragile.\n\n\u201cI believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations,\u201d James Madison once said.\n\nProtecting against these \u201cencroachments\u201d is one of the central purposes of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nOf course, history remembers those violent \u201cusurpations\u201d Madison mentions but rarely acknowledges the \u201cgradual and silent encroachments\u201d of power. Why? These encroachments are exactly as Madison might have called it today: convenient and popular.\n\nThese convenient and popular encroachments are more evident as laws and regulations continue catering to the feelings of people, rather than the values and principles America was founded upon.\n\nResisting the impulse to make others feel comfortable with their loss of liberty and standards is difficult. Those who resist this urge are often accused of being uncompassionate and close-minded. This persecution only increases when such commitment comes from inside the government itself.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz is one of those people who has stood against continual corruption of American values.\n\nIn 2015, Cruz worked to revoke taxpayer dollars from Planned Parenthood, a government-funded organization that provides, among other services, abortions and sell fetal tissues, according to National Public Radio.\n\nIn 2014, Cruz sought to end political targeting by the IRS, according to The Wall Street Journal. This action was opposed by every Democratic senator in Washington, those same senators who have taken an oath to preserve and protect the Constitution and the freedom it provides.\n\nWithin his first few days in office as a U.S. senator, Cruz introduced legislation calling for the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ObamaCare, according to Fox News.\n\nThese are just a few of Cruz\u2019s notable achievements. In each of these instances, Cruz\u2019s actions were not convenient or popular, but preserved freedom.\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s work to preserve freedom continues on the campaign trail. While campaigning, Cruz has pushed to maintain states rights in gay marriage decisions and gun control laws.\n\nHe\u2019s also advocated for increased national security by tightening immigration laws.\n\nThe promise of America can be found in the first lines of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d the Declaration of Independence reads.\n\nWe need a president that is committed to the American dream and will fight day after day to preserve liberty and freedom.\n\nWe need a president that will ask what\u2019s right, instead of what feels good.\n\nTed Cruz is that president.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BYU-I Scroll", "description": "Editor\u2019s Note: The following is a column from the editorial staff.
