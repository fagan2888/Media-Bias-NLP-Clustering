Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who leads the House\u2019s investigation of the fetal tissue industry, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThey are putting a dollar value on these organs from these children\u2014unborn children that have been aborted. It is just beyond belief.\u201d\n\nAccording to Republicans involved in the investigation, a researcher paid a middleman procurement company $3,340 for a fetal brain, $595 for a \u201cbaby skull matched to upper and lower limbs,\u201d and $890 for \u201cupper and lower limbs with hands and feet.\u201d\n\nMiddleman procurement businesses are companies that obtain tissue and other body parts from aborted babies and provide them to institutions or other organizations for research. Under federal law, the transportation of fetal tissue is based on a nonprofit model.\n\nThe committee\u2019s documents, which will be used today in a House hearing on the pricing of fetal tissue, include payments made from a middleman procurement company to an abortion clinic on a monthly basis. Those dollar amounts range from $6,010 to $11,365.\n\nOver the span of a year, one research institution paid a middleman company $42,535 to obtain 38 fetal brains, 12 fetal hearts, three fetal upper/lower limbs, five fetal livers, and 12 fetal pancreases, according to the select House panel\u2019s documents.\n\nThe Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, as it is formally known, was created on Oct. 7, 2015, when the House passed a resolution calling for a full and complete investigation regarding the medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations that sell fetal tissue.\n\nIn the most recent documents being released, the panel did not publicly identify companies or individuals involved in the transactions \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d Blackburn told The Daily Signal in a phone interview prior to the hearing.\n\nBecause the documents were highly redacted, The Daily Signal was unable to independently confirm the prices of each body part.\n\nHowever, the panel announced earlier this year that it was issuing subpoenas to companies and organizations that refused to cooperate with the investigation. Those groups included StemExpress, Ganogen, Biomedical Research Institute of America, the University of New Mexico, and Southwestern Women\u2019s Options.\n\nDemocrats on the select panel have called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by Blackburn and other Republicans who oppose abortion.\n\nAs The Daily Signal has previously reported, Democrats have condemned the panel\u2019s investigators for requesting the names of doctors, medical students, researchers, and others involved in the abortion and fetal tissue procurement industries, arguing that obtaining those names could make the panel \u201ccomplicit in physical assaults or murders of these people.\u201d\n\nBut with the imminent release of the next round of evidence, Blackburn said she is hopeful Democrats \u201cwill recognize that we are taking every possible precaution and doing our best to fulfill the requirement that Congress has made of us.\u201d\n\nThe 1993 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act prohibits profiting from the sale of any fetal tissue. However, it is legal to provide and accept payment to cover reasonable costs for \u201ctransportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.\u201d\n\nAmong documents uncovered in the investigation is an image of a procurement company marketing itself to abortion clinics as \u201cfinancially profitable.\u201d The name of that company also was redacted.\n\nQuestions about whether abortion clinics and middleman procurement companies profit from transactions involving body parts and other fetal tissue from aborted babies were raised after a series of videos published last year. The hidden-camera videos showed officials at Planned Parenthood affiliates discussing the buying and selling of fetal tissue with a middleman company, StemExpress.\n\nCate Dyer, founder of StemExpress, told The New York Times in July that her company \u201cobtained fetal tissue in accordance with the rules made by ethics boards at the institutions buying it.\u201d\n\nIn that article, Dyer also was quoted as saying the process of obtaining fetal cells is \u201chard,\u201d \u201cexpensive,\u201d and takes \u201cmillions of dollars of equipment.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America consistently has denied any wrongdoing and was cleared in multiple state investigations. In October, after facing questions about its fetal tissue donation practices, Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement as part of its tissue donation program.\n\nDuring today\u2019s hearing, called \u201cThe Pricing of Fetal Tissue,\u201d Republicans were expected to call Brian Patrick Lennon, a former assistant U.S. attorney from Michigan, to testify as a witness.\n\nIn his written testimony, released in advance, Lennon argues that based on the evidence, an \u201cethical federal prosecutor could establish probable cause that both the abortion clinics and the procurement business violated the [federal] statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289g-2), aided and abetted one another in violating the statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2), and likely conspired together to violate the statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371).\u201d\n\nRepublicans also were scheduled to hear testimony from Michael Norton, a former U.S. attorney for the state of Colorado; Catherine Glenn Foster, associate scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute and CEO and general counsel at Sound Legal; and Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who is pro-life, among others.\n\nDemocrats were slated to bring in Fay Clayton, a lawyer who formerly represented the Anatomical Gift Foundation, a nonprofit corporation that provided donated tissue to medical researchers.\n\nIn her prepared statement, Clayton criticizes Republicans for \u201cusing [the panel\u2019s] subpoena power to compel testimony from health care providers and medical researchers\u201d and for failing to subpoena David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, the pro-life group behind the string of undercover videos targeting Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the select panel has been using its subpoena power to compel testimony from health care providers and medical researchers\u2014who have better things to do with their time than Mr. Daleiden does\u2014suggests the panel is not genuinely interested in public policy at all,\u201d Clayton says in the written statement.\n\nDemocrats also were set to hear from Robert Raben, president and founder of the Raben Group, a progressive policy group, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., a pro-choice lawmaker.\n\nWitnesses likely will be asked to respond to Blackburn and other panel members who, the chairman said, \u201cbelieve that it is more than likely that payments to the abortion clinics and to the procurement businesses have exceeded reasonable cost.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A special House panel investigating the transfer of fetal tissue from aborted babies releases new details about the the price of baby body parts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A special House panel investigating the transfer of fetal tissue from aborted babies releases new details about the the price of baby body parts.", "title": "Here\u2019s How Much Baby Body Parts Cost", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160419_abortion-parts_FEATURE_v4.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-20T07:38:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NkGv10"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A special House panel investigating the transfer of fetal tissue from aborted babies releases new details about the the price of baby body parts.", "title": "Here\u2019s How Much Baby Body Parts Cost", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160419_abortion-parts_FEATURE_v4.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-04-20T06:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:38:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion, fetal tissue, planned parenthood, stem express, House investigation, fetal issue procurement, Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, marsha blackburn, gop, abortion, pro-life"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe042f\"", "article_summary": "Under federal law, the transportation of fetal tissue is based on a nonprofit model.\nThe hidden-camera videos showed officials at Planned Parenthood affiliates discussing the buying and selling of fetal tissue with a middleman company, StemExpress.\n\u201cIt is just horrifying,\u201d Rep.
