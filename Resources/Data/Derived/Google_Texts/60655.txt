Sedgwick County is facing around a $10,000,000 budget shortfall and possible cuts are upsetting members of the community.

Sunflower Community Action is going door-to-door, hoping Sedgwick County residents will contact their commissioners and tell them to not cut health services.

"I believe that the real importance is that we do need to have these health services and that we get the money for them somehow...people do need health services and this is a matter, not of having better roads but matters of life or death for some people," said Andres Leland of Sunflower Community Action.

County commissioners are still trying to figure out the budget and are allowing the public to comment. An open house will be held on Thursday, August 6 at 6 p.m on the third floor of the county courthouse.
