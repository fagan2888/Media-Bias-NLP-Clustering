We\u2019re keeping them alive and well so they don\u2019t have to go to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nSponsors are sought for the annual fundraiser, which last year raised $35,000 for the clinic, Meegan said. This year\u2019s goal is $50,000. Tickets are on sale now for the fundraiser, which typically sells out early. Tickets cost $75 per person and sponsorship levels start at $250.\n\nThe event this year is set for 5 to 9 p.m. May 7, which coincides with the Derby Day race, billed as \u201cthe most exciting two minutes in sports.\u201d This year\u2019s Kentucky Derby Party venue is at the Palmetto Club at FishHawk Ranch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited, and the FishHawk population seems really excited about it,\u201d Meegan said, noting that clinic volunteers sold a bunch of tickets at the Farmer\u2019s Market in Park Square held the first Sunday in March.\n\n\u201cThe derby is a fun event that is different from so many other fundraising events,\u201d Meegan said. \u201cThe ladies love to dress up in beautiful hats, and the men love to sip bourbon.\u201d\n\nAlso featured are horse contests, a cornhole contest and a \u201cTaste of the Derby,\u201d featuring menu items from local restaurants.\n\n\u201cPeople are always drawn to a wide variety of foods,\u201d Meegan said.\n\nDoctors, nurses and other medical professionals who donate their time and services provide care through the not-for-profit clinic. To be seen, a patient must be between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level, depending on household size. All ages are served, from children to senior citizens.\n\nAs always, the need is great, Meegan said.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has had an impact,\u201d she added, \u201cbut there\u2019s still thousands of uninsured people who need our services right here in Hillsborough County.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 09:16:50 -0400", "Description": "BRANDON \u2014  Outreach Clinic Brandon is set to celebrate its fifth annual Kentucky Derby Party, a signature fundraiser for the nonprofit\u2019s efforts to bridge the healthcare gap for Hillsbo", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "BRANDON \u2014  Outreach Clinic Brandon is set to celebrate its fifth annual Kentucky Derby Party, a signature fundraiser for the nonprofit\u2019s efforts to bridge the healthcare gap for Hillsbo", "title": "Tickets on sale for Outreach Clinic\u2019s Kentucky Derby Party", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/brandon/tickets-on-sale-for-outreach-clinics-kentucky-derby-party-20160323/", "image": {"width": 1760, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20160323/ARTICLE/160329723/EP/1/4/EP-160329723.jpg", "height": 1166}, "updated_time": "2016-03-23T09:16:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "BRANDON \u2014  Outreach Clinic Brandon is set to celebrate its fifth annual Kentucky Derby Party, a signature fundraiser for the nonprofit\u2019s efforts to bridge the healthcare gap for Hills", "title": "Tickets on sale for Outreach Clinic\u2019s Kentucky Derby Party", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20160323/ARTICLE/160329723/AR/0/AR-160329723.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2016-03-23T09:16:50Z-04", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T09:16:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Outreach Clinic Brandon is set to celebrate its fifth annual Kentucky Derby Party, a signature fundraiser for the nonprofit\u2019s efforts to bridge the healthcare gap for Hillsborough County residents with economic need.\nFounded as the Brandon Outreach Clinic, the nonprofit this year celebrates its 26th anniversary, seeing a rising need in the care of aging baby boomers.\nTickets are on sale now for the fundraiser, which typically sells out early.\nDoctors, nurses and other medical professionals who donate their time and services provide care through the not-for-profit clinic.\n\u201cThe derby is a fun event that is different from so many other fundraising events,\u201d Meegan said."}
