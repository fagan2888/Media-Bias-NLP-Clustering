After an \u201cextraordinary\u201d hearing, Judge Sullivan ordered the IRS to tell him under oath exactly what happened to Lois Lerner\u2019s hard drive. He demanded sworn declarations specifying what the agency had done to recover the thousands of emails missing. Time\u2019s up.\n\nThe IRS filed its \u201cdeclarations\u201d yesterday. As an attorney who has read the filings and who has written extensively about this dedicated judge in my book Licensed To Lie, I could not in good conscience sign those filings. It\u2019s not that they are false. Oh no, . . .each is very carefully worded to be literally true (hence, not perjurious). But, each says little, answers less, and reveals nothing that would actually lead to recovery of the emails or to anyone\u2019s accountability for their disappearance in any form. In fact, the few pages say less than has already been revealed elsewhere.\n\nJudge Sullivan may be quite impressed with IRS declarations\u2014but not favorably. He\u2019s the kind of judge who expects forthrightness and good faith, along with truth from the government. He wants to know what every citizen who gave any thought to the issues would want to know\u2014real answers. Those emails have not disappeared. Remember, Emmett Sullivan is the no-nonsense and gutsy judge who held DOJ lawyers in contempt for their gamesmanship. He later named an independent special prosecutor of his own choosing to investigate the Department upon discovery that it had hidden evidence favorable to the defense in its corrupt prosecution of US Senator Ted Stevens.\n\nJudge Sullivan knows better than to trust the government\u2019s blanket, bald, and rote denials of wrongdoing and the existence of evidence. He\u2019s seen the difference between an internal investigation\u2019s results and the fresh report of an independent prosecutor who has neither a job, nor power, nor a personal or political agenda to protect.\n\nWhile Judge Sullivan might appreciate the details of the tests IRS technicians ran on Lois Lerner\u2019s laptop, like us, he will probably have more questions than ever upon reading the IRS\u2019s flaccid verbiage.\n\nWho among us doesn\u2019t receive and send emails from more than one device\u2014each of which often has a different server? Did Lois Lerner have a desktop computer? Did she have any other device on which she could or did receive office emails? Did she have a Blackberry, a smartphone, an iPad or other similar devices? Where are those now and what servers did each use?\n\nAs AIM reported earlier, an American Center for Law and Justice complaint cites Lerner\u2014and her comrades Douglas Shulman, Sarah Hall Ingram, Nikole Flax and Judith Kindell\u2014for \u201crepeatedly us[ing] nonofficial, unsecure, personal email accounts to conduct official IRS business, including sending tax return information and official classified documents to non-agency email addresses. . ..\u201d Did their home computers crash too?\n\nAnd what about Sara Hall Ingram, who was Commissioner of the tax-exempt section of IRS from 2009 to 2012? She made 165 trips to the White House . . . then was promoted to head the IRS division managing Obamacare. Clearly, since the IRS\u2019s competence in record retention is so stunning, it should be entrusted with the nation\u2019s healthcare. Was that promotion payback for Hall\u2019s and Lerner\u2019s work targeting political opposition to the president and illegally sharing taxpayer information with the White House?\n\nSpeaking of the White House, who among the staff there received emails from Lerner, Hall, and friends? It\u2019s already been disclosed that Hall was talking with the White House about lawsuits attacking the controversial contraceptive mandate in Obamacare\u2014the recent Supreme Court reversal in Hobby Lobby poking yet another hole in the incomprehensible legislation.\n\nLike many of us, Judge Sullivan just might have already read that Deputy Associate Chief Counsel of the IRS, Thomas Kane, admitted to Congress on July 21 that the number of hard drive crashes had not only expanded from one (Lerner\u2019s) to seven, but had risen to just fewer than twenty; and, there might be copies of the emails on back up devices, but they weren\u2019t sure yet. How long does that take? It\u2019s been weeks\u2014actually years.\n\nYesterday\u2019s declarations mention nothing of these facts. Apparently, Mr. Kane, who is not even in the Treasury\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, but rather, has coordinated the IRS\u2019s painful and pathetic \u201cresponse\u201d to multiple Congressional inquiries, believes that his superficial representations are all that Judge Sullivan should need.\n\nMr. Kane obviously hasn\u2019t read Licensed to Lie. Judge Sullivan won\u2019t be fooled again by a \u201cjust-trust-us\u201d internal investigation\u2014especially when Mr. Kane and his colleagues provided no details and no timeline. Of course, the IRS says it will give Judicial Watch the documents that it has already found\u2014after it reviews them. No IRS official has even asserted to Judge Sullivan that he was trying to find the emails elsewhere.\n\nAnd someone in the IRS recommended that Lerner\u2019s hard drive be given to an outside technician to retrieve the emails, but instead, it was destroyed. Who made that recommendation? Who over-rode it? Who authorized the destruction of a hard drive containing evidence of correspondence with the White House? How would that excuse work for a taxpayer\u2019s records? Oooops, sorry. That\u2019s a felony.\n\nWhen these few pages of declarations were written, Mr. Kane must have forgotten that Defendant Lerner alone \u201caccumulated more than 1,600 pages of emails and documents related to official IRS business in a nonofficial, unsecure, personal email account, including almost 30 pages of confidential taxpayer information.\u201d\n\nWhat about her \u201cpersonal\u201d email accounts, other devices, the multiple devices of others\u2014not to mention the servers? That\u2019s right\u2014no declaration mentioned the servers. Yet, everyone knows emails reside on servers, and there had to have been multiple servers.\n\nIt looks like Magistrate Judge John Facciola, who has expertise in electronic discovery, will indeed have to provide substantial assistance to the parties to locate the emails and perhaps issue some subpoenas to have devices brought into court, get data from servers, or open discovery for depositions. The parties have until September 24 to resolve it with the Magistrate\u2019s help.\n\nThe IRS claims it has found about 24,000 of Lerner\u2019s emails on the computers of others. Why weren\u2019t hard copies retained as was required by the Federal Records Act? Whose computers in the White House have been checked? Did they all crash at the same time too\u2014just losing the emails with the IRS?\n\nThere are far more questions than answers from the IRS declarations. And law-abiding citizens want to know.\n\nThe only thing these miserly declarations prove is that IRS has abdicated all responsibility and has no interest in finding the emails. But Judge Emmet Sullivan does.\n\nSidney Powell worked in the Department of Justice for 10 years and was lead counsel in more than 500 federal appeals.
