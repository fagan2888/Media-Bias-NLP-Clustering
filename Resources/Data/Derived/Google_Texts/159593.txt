Sebelius: "The Majority Of People Calling For Me To Resign" Are "People I Do Not Work For"

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says calls for her resignation are coming from people who don't want the government's new health insurance program to succeed. Sebelius was in Phoenix on Thursday to promote Obamacare.



"The majority of people calling for me to resign I would say are people I do not work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place. I have had frequent conversations with the president and I have committed to him that my role is to get the program up and running. And we will do just that," Sebelius said at a press conference Thursday night.

KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HHS SECRETARY: No one. No one has been fired. My goal is to actually get the website up and running.



REPORTER: Madame Secretary, what is your response to people calling for you to resign?



SEBELIUS: The majority of people calling for me to resign I would say are people I do not work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place. I have had frequent conversations with the president and I have committed to him that my role is to get the program up and running. And we will do just that.
