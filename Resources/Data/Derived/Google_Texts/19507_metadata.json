Prior to the past five years\u0092 all-out, U.S.-government led efforts to \u0093suspend disbelief\u0094 with unprecedented, 24/7 application of a blanket money printing, market manipulation and propaganda campaign, this week\u0092s events would have caused plunging financial markets and expanding, global fear. However, in today\u0092s Bizarro world \u0096 which like the 1960s London Gold Pool, won\u0092t last forever \u0096 the Italian stock market hits multi-year highs when its government collapses for the second time in five months and its largest city \u0096 Rome \u0096 heads for a Detroit-style bankruptcy filing! As we discussed earlier this week, \u0093Draghi\u0092s Reckoning Day\u0094 is coming; perhaps, as soon as Thursday\u0092s ECB meeting, when \u0093Goldman Mario\u0094 will likely admit that not only is Europe\u0092s \u0093recovery\u0094 in jeopardy, but in dire need of the ECB\u0092s printing presses. As expected, the Euro Zone reported comically low \u0093annual inflation\u0094 of 0.8% this morning; as apparently, soaring food and energy prices are not considered inflation in Europe \u0096 as is the case here in the States, per the \u0093core CPI\u0094 favored by the Fed. Under such circumstances, it\u0092s a fait accompli that if the ECB doesn\u0092t lower its benchmark rate from 0.25% to 0.00% on Thursday, it most certainly will shortly thereafter. Moreover, it\u0092s only a matter of time before it introduces negative deposit rates, overt QE \u0096 via its OMT, or Outright Monetary Transaction scheme, and/or other similar \u0093extraordinary measures. Countless ECB officials have hinted as much in recent months; which we assure you, wasn\u0092t done by accident! Amazingly, the Euro continues to rise against the dollar \u0096 depicting just how poor the dollar\u0092s fundamentals are. In fact, the dollar has this morning fallen below the key psychological level of 80 to 79.77 as I write. In and of itself, a sub-80 dollar index doesn\u0092t mean much \u0096 particularly as the Exchange Stabilization Fund has in the past demonstrated its virtually unlimited mandate to protect that level, at any cost. However, given that the dollar has risen against essentially every currency since commencing Operation Twist, QE3 and QE4 in late 2011 \u0096 by exporting cancerous inflation the world round \u0096 it\u0092s quite remarkable that it can\u0092t rise against the rapidly dying Euro. By the way, atop this morning\u0092s \u0093deflationary\u0094 European CPI report, it was also reported that Euro Zone unemployment held within 0.1% of its record level in January. And yet, with the prospect of Draghi easing policy further next week, the Euro is still rising sharply against the dollar! Moving eastward, let\u0092s go back to what we wrote in yesterday\u0092s \u0093Chinese Financial Torture\u0094 \u0096 of how the PBOC is quite obviously weakening the Yuan and doing so in dramatic fashion. In that article, we wrote of how it\u0092s 1% decline this week against the dollar was the largest since the dollar/Yuan peg was put in place 20 years ago \u0096 and that was before today\u0092s additional Yuan decline. We also discussed the enormous amount of derivatives linked to this exchange rate, triggering massive bank losses each time the Yuan even slightly declines. The supposed \u0093danger zone\u0094 \u0096 where such losses accelerate \u0096 is apparently 6.15 to 6.20 Yuan to the dollar; and this morning, the Yuan declined from 6.12 to 6.15, putting it right on the cusp of this zone. Next week, major financial meetings will occur within China\u0092s government; and if their consensus on the Chinese economy is more dovish, don\u0092t be surprised if PBOC policy is decidedly more \u0093aggressive\u0094 in the coming months. As Bill Holter wrote this morning, \u0093On Any Given Day\u0094 the Chinese has the financial might to destroy the world; and whether purposefully or not, they are ultimately destined to do so, knowing full well they will arise from the ashes as the 21st century\u0092s undisputed superpower. The fact that 2013 Chinese gold imports doubled the previous record level \u0096 set in 2012 \u0096 should tell you exactly how to prepare for this inevitability; and by ignoring such warnings, you are exposing yourself to the equally inevitable hyperinflation that will accompany the dollar\u0092s demise as the \u0093world\u0092s reserve currency.\u0094 Speaking of dying currencies, how about the Yen? Ironically, as the BOJ doubles Japan\u0092s money supply in a two year period \u0096 thus, seeking to massively devalue it \u0096 the Yen refuses to materially fall against the dollar again because no matter how weak Japan\u0092s fundamentals are, they cannot usurp the dollar\u0092s bleak outlook. In fact, the BOJ\u0092s own \u0093stabilization fund\u0094 has been as vehement about preventing the Yen from falling below 102/dollar as the Cartel has been in preventing gold from rising above its current $1,330/oz. \u0093line in the sand.\u0094 Frankly, how and why the PPT has latched upon the 102/dollar exchange rate as its \u0093launching pad\u0094 for the \u0093Dow Jones Propaganda Average\u0094 is beyond me; but needless to say, we have seen \u0093dead ringer\u0094 U.S. stock ramps every day this week \u0096 in nearly every case, with a 100% correlation to the dollar/yen exchange rate. Huh???? As for the dollar, whose \u0093deadly demographics\u0094 are the focus of today\u0092s article, it didn\u0092t take \u0093Whirlybird Janet\u0094 long to hint at \u0093pausing\u0094 the Fed\u0092s supposed tapering strategy. While continuing to utilize the latest propaganda red herring of \u0093bad weather\u0094 \u0096 which we recently refuted, in spades, in \u0093mother nature has had enough\u0094 \u0096 Yellen made it crystal clear that indeed, the Fed is as \u0093data dependent\u0094 as ever. And thus, her statement that \u0093if there\u0092s a significant change in the (economic) outlook, certainly we would be open to reconsidering (tapering).\u0094 Better yet, under the category of the most comical statements ever made by a Central banker, Janet Yellen said: There is no need to bring down the size of our portfolio to tighten monetary policy. We have a range of tools that we can use to raise the level of short-term interest rates at the time the Committee deems appropriate. -Macro Business.com, February 28, 2014 So let me get this straight. The world\u0092s largest hedge fund \u0096the Fed \u0096 holds $4.4 trillion of overvalued U.S. Treasuries and mortgage bonds in its portfolio; which, \u0093tapering\u0094 and all, is increasing at the rate of $65 billion per month. According to Yellen\u0092s statement, the Fed will eventually raise interest rates \u0096 thus, torpedoing the value of this portfolio \u0096 without simultaneously selling anything? Honestly, the best analogy I could give is if the Miles Franklin Blog, instead of speaking of why one should buy Precious Metals, turned tail and started aggressively writing of why one should sell. In other words, destroying not only our firm, but our personal net worth\u0092s. Amazingly, is ignored by Wall Street and the MSM; but in time \u0096 when rates inevitably do rise \u0096 you can be sure they\u0092ll be right on top of it! Speaking of \u0093data dependency,\u0094 does anyone remember January 30th; i.e., when the BEA, or Bureau of Economic Analysis, reported a ridiculous 4Q 2013 GDP growth rate of 3.2%? I won\u0092t even go into the comical accounting here \u0096 much less, the dislocation of such a number with all semblance of reality. However, suffice to say, Wall Street and the MSM gushed of how the so-called recovery was gaining momentum. In fact, in typical Cartel fashion, gold and silver were instantaneously attacked by 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, to nearly their lowest levels since mid-2010 \u0096 i.e., before the Fed\u0092s QE3, the ECB\u0092s LTRO and OMT and the BOJ\u0092s \u0093Abenomics\u0094 were launched. Remember, Janet Yellen took office as Fed Chairman just two days later; and since then, has unwaveringly spoke of how the \u0093recovery\u0094 continues \u0096 even after the following week\u0092s miserable NFP report, and four additional weeks of beyond miserable, across-the-board economic weakness. Well, here we are on February 28th, and already this \u0093amazing\u0094 GDP number was revised dramatically lower, from 3.2% to a still ridiculous 2.4%. Let\u0092s just ignore the comical 1.6% GDP \u0093deflator\u0094; as just as is the case in Europe, food and energy prices are not considered inflation; nor are Obamacare taxes and fees, for that matter \u0096 which are starting to appear on restaurant checks nationwide! Sure, the PPT is gunning the Dow again on such \u0093good news\u0094; and of course, defending gold\u0092s $1,330/oz. \u0093line in the sand\u0094 on today\u0092s COMEX \u0093first notice day.\u0094 In fact, per what we recently wrote of in \u0093Gold Manipulation Going Mainstream,\u0094 Bloomberg published a shocking article this morning of how gold has been manipulated for a decade at the 10:00 AM EST; i.e., \u0093key attack time #1.\u0094 Perhaps they have finally seen this damning chart from Dmitri Speck, of what has occurred since 1998 when the world\u0092s physical markets close at this time \u0096 as was the case today. But I digress, as such futile manipulations will ultimately end up in the dustbin of historical failure, given their attempt to stop far larger, more powerful forces; as the fact remains that there never was, and never will be, a \u0093recovery\u0094 as the global fiat Ponzi scheme reaches its cancerous, terminal phase. No currency has ever survived such financial suicide and none will fall further this time than the dollar \u0096 in turn, yielding history\u0092s most violent Precious Metals surge \u0096 given that U.S. borrowing capacity has been massively overinflated by the dollar\u0092s unwarranted, seven decade privilege as the \u0093world\u0092s reserve currency.\u0094 Which leads me to today\u0092s primary topic; i.e., the \u0093deadly demographics\u0094 working to further undermine the dollar\u0092s influence. We have long referenced the \u0093demographic hell\u0094 that dooms Japan, in that it has the world\u0092s second oldest population and second lowest birth rate; in both cases, behind only Monaco, which sports a population of just 37,000. America is \u0093middle of the pack\u0094 on both counts; but ominously, is aging more rapidly rate than at any time in its history. With the first wave of baby boomers reaching their 70s; a massive wave of \u009360-somethings\u0094 right behind them; and thanks to a soaring cost of living, the lowest birth rate in the nation\u0092s history, the percentage of senior citizens is set to double in the next 20 years, per the below chart. Worse yet, the vast majority have little or no savings \u0096 per this terrifying article by the great Michael Snyder; explaining why so many are competing for the handful of remaining jobs with the young. Moreover, this scary graph depicts just how bad the U.S. Labor situation has become; simultaneously, proving how such \u0093deadly demographics\u0094 are manifesting themselves on the economy. As aging of the U.S. population accelerates in the coming decades, along with public spending \u0096 and taxation \u0096 related to Obamacare, Medicare, Social Security and other social programs geared toward the aged, America\u0092s finances will continue to deteriorate, on both the public and private levels; in turn, yielding exploding budget deficits, national debt and ultimately \u0096 QE notwithstanding \u0096 catastrophic interest rate increases. And thus, all we can say is this. Anyone not considering such factors when planning their financial futures is taking the equivalent of a giant leap into a bottomless abyss. There is simply no way the dollar\u0092s purchasing power can go anywhere but down over the long-term; while conversely, the \u0093path of least resistance\u0094 for Precious Metals is decidedly up. http://blog.milesfranklin.com/\n\n| Digg This Article\n\n-- Published: Sunday, 2 March 2014 | E-Mail | Print | Source: GoldSeek.com Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus\n\nPrevious Articles\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gold News, Gold Stocks, Gold Market Updates, Buying Gold, Gold Prices, Precious Metals, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, News, Quotes, Stocks, Commentary, Forums, Markets, Free, Mining, Newsletter, Links, Trading, Price, International, Live, Seek, Vote, Wire", "description": "Since 1995, news.GoldSeek.com publishes the leading gold news commentaries, gold market updates and reports providing gold investors with the most updated gold and silver prices, news & precious metals information!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f07\"", "article_summary": "As for the dollar, whose \u0093deadly demographics\u0094 are the focus of today\u0092s article, it didn\u0092t take \u0093Whirlybird Janet\u0094 long to hint at \u0093pausing\u0094 the Fed\u0092s supposed tapering strategy.\nIn fact, the dollar has this morning fallen below the key psychological level of 80 to 79.77 as I write.\nMoreover, this scary graph depicts just how bad the U.S. Labor situation has become; simultaneously, proving how such \u0093deadly demographics\u0094 are manifesting themselves on the economy.\nAmazingly, the Euro continues to rise against the dollar \u0096 depicting just how poor the dollar\u0092s fundamentals are.\nAnd yet, with the prospect of Draghi easing policy further next week, the Euro is still rising sharply against the dollar!"}
