People who polish off a whole bag of chips or cookies at one sitting (usually in front of TV) are often doing exactly what the product was designed to do\u2013be addictive.\n\nHave you noticed the overpowering something-in-the-oven smell that wafts up when you walk past a Subway? Mark Christiano, Subway\u2019s Global Baking Technologist, insists the aroma is not pumped outside to entice passers-by and adds that the bread recipe is \u201cproprietary.\u201d But in the war for your food dollar, all tactics are clearly on the table including the way a food smells, looks, and feels in the mouth. Nothing is left up to chance.\n\n\u201cFood technologists\u201d use $40,000 devices that simulate a chewing mouth to test and perfect chips, for example. \u201cPeople like a chip that snaps with about four pounds of pressure per square inch,\u201d says Michael Moss, author of Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us so technologists seek \u201cthe perfect break point.\u201d\n\nFat is a big part of the food technology stagecraft too because it promotes crunch, creaminess and contrast, blends flavors and even lubricates mouthfuls so that people eat faster. And, speaking of fast eating, people who wolf down their food do not entirely have themselves to blame\u2013the actual time it takes to chew food has shrunk. \u201cIn the [45 years] that I have been in the food business, we used to have foods that we chewed 15 times and 20 times and 30 times before we swallowed,\u201d says Gail Vance Civille, of the consumer research firm Sensory Spectrum. Now most foods only have to be chewed 12 times and \u201cyou\u2019re in for the next hit to get more pleasure, says Civille.\n\nOf course sugar, salt and fat themselves can be addictive as H\u00e4agen-Dazs or Krispy Kreme junkies can attest, but food technologists have a clear equation for designing hyper-rewarding, hyper-palatable foods. They fabricate \u201ccomplex formulas that pique the taste buds enough to be alluring but don\u2019t have a distinct, overriding single flavor that tells the brain to stop eating,\u201d says Moss.\n\nHere are some foods deliberately designed to hook you at the first whiff or taste.\n\n1. Soft drinks\n\nHalf of Americans drink a soft drink every day and many people say they are addicted. This is not an accident. To create Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper, for example, food technologists tested 3,904 \u201ctastings\u201d or versions for \u201cdryness,\u201d \u201cgumminess,\u201d and \u201cmoisture release,\u201d the right mix of cherry, vanilla and Dr Pepper flavoring and of course color.\n\nOf course caffeine is one reason people get hooked on soft drinks. Constant exposure to caffeine makes your brain compensate by decreasing the number of receptors for its own \u201cstimulant,\u201d norepinephrine, which makes you seek the stimulation from an outside source. But there are other probable \u201caddictors\u201d as seen in Mountain Dew, arguably the most addictive of the soft drinks (including among some gamers who reportedly drink it nonstop). While Dew certainly packs a lot of caffeine, it derives its fizzy bite from phosphoric, citric, malic and tartaric acids, all kept afloat by a controversial additive known as BVO or brominated vegetable oil. Beverage companies are starting to drop BVO, which the public has turned against because it is also a flame retardant. But Dew will likely keep its bite.\n\n2. Cured Meats\n\nEven people who would give wide berth to a Slim Jim or Kentucky cured ham have been swept up in the Bacon Everywhere movement with bacon added to everything from gum and candy to ice cream. Unfortunately the bacon flavor everyone loves is created by ingredients no one loves\u2013nitrites. Sodium nitrite, also found in ham, pastrami, salami hot dogs and sausages, inhibits bacteria, lengthens shelf life and imparts the pleasing taste and color that add to these foods\u2019 appeal. But, and it is a big but, during the process of cooking, nitrites combine with other chemicals to form carcinogens which many health organizations warn against.\n\nCan\u2019t bacon be made without nitrites? Yes and no. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Test Kitchen had the results of their bacon testing and they disliked the nitrite free sample because it was too pale and didn\u2019t taste like bacon,\u201d says one post on the web site chowhound. \u201cNitrates add plenty to flavor. You\u2019ll find bacon producers who attest to that all over Google,\u201d says another post. The New York Times food writer R.W. Apple himself states that \u201cnitrates provide some of the characteristic bacon flavor, and the only nitrite-free bacon I have sampled tasted more like roast pork,\u201d defending the safety profile of the chemicals. The web site Livestrong agrees that nitrites \u201cgive cured meats that characteristic smoky flavor and pink color that make them irresistible,\u201d but suggests that people limit their intake and \u201chave a salad\u201d instead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Food scientists use dangerous chemicals to make you eat -- and buy -- more junk food", "title": "5 unhealthy foods engineered to be addictive", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Food scientists use dangerous chemicals to make you eat -- and buy -- more junk food", "title": "5 unhealthy foods engineered to be addictive", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/5_unhealthy_foods_engineered_to_be_addictive_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/bacon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Food scientists use dangerous chemicals to make you eat -- and buy -- more junk food", "title": "5 unhealthy foods engineered to be addictive", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/bacon.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Martha Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bacon, big food, Cured Meats, junk food, Microwave Popcorn", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFood technologists\u201d use $40,000 devices that simulate a chewing mouth to test and perfect chips, for example.\nOf course sugar, salt and fat themselves can be addictive as H\u00e4agen-Dazs or Krispy Kreme junkies can attest, but food technologists have a clear equation for designing hyper-rewarding, hyper-palatable foods.\nUnfortunately the bacon flavor everyone loves is created by ingredients no one loves\u2013nitrites.\nThe New York Times food writer R.W.\nApple himself states that \u201cnitrates provide some of the characteristic bacon flavor, and the only nitrite-free bacon I have sampled tasted more like roast pork,\u201d defending the safety profile of the chemicals."}
