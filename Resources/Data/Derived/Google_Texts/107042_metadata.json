Over the course of five decades of marriage, the now retired contractor has purchased a warehouse of dresses for his wife Margot.\n\nThe habit started before they emigrated from Germany to America in the 1950s, when \u2014 as a young dock worker \u2014 Paul was allowed to pick out 10 dresses from a shipment for Margot, who was his girlfriend at the time.\n\n\"I was fascinated by the dresses from the '50s. The petticoats and the wide skirts made a woman look real feminine,\u201d Paul told LA Weekly. \u201cAnd that is what I really liked. When I seen a gal with a dress like that,\" he says, \"I wanted to get her on the dance floor.\"\n\nThe couple married and carried a love of ballroom dancing over to Ohio, where Paul insisted that Margot wear a different gown to each weekly party. By the time they landed in Los Angeles in 1988, by way of Arizona, the family had collected nearly 25,000 dresses.\n\nPaul and Margot Brockman.

Over the next couple of decades, he eventually filled six of these giant containers with an estimated 55,000 dresses worth about $1.5 million.\n\nThis is according to his daughter Louise, who, rather than inherit the dresses, has moved the dresses into a warehouse and started selling them with her father. The makeshift shop, equipped with its own Facebook page, is trading about three per month, but Louise and Paul hope that a large investor will arrive to buy the vintage clothes en masse.\n\nMolly Morgan models a dress from the Brockmanns' collection.
