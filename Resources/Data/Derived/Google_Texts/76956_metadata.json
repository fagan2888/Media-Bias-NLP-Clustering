During an interview with William Shatner on Ora TV\u2019s Brown Bag Wine Tasting, via a report by Us Weekly on June 12, Glanville opened up about Eddie Cibrian and his \u201cextra girlfriends,\u201d including Scheana Marie of Vanderpump Rules and country singer LeAnn Rimes, whom he later married.\n\n\u201cI guess you can say. He had some ladies on the side.\u201d\n\nAlthough Glanville says she tried to forgive Eddie Cibrian for his infidelities, she failed to do so once she discovered there was more than just a couple other ladies involved.\n\nEddie Cibrian and Rimes began their relationship on the set of Lifetime\u2019s Northern Lights and were eventually exposed when a magazine printed photos of the pair kissing at a restaurant near the set. At the time, Rimes was married, as well, and her husband, Dean Shermet, was just as shocked as Glanville when he was made aware of his wife\u2019s affair.\n\n\u201cIt took me about a year to figure out that it had nothing to do with me, but it took a while\u2026 I was wondering how I could be any better than I was. Was I not tall enough? Skinny enough? Are my boobs not big enough? Should I have blue eyes? It was all of that. It made me a better person to go through that, and to figure out that it had nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\nAs the Inquisitr previously reported, Eddie Cibrian\u2019s ex-wife, Glanville, also spoke to Ross Matthews recently, denying she\u2019s been fired from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and claiming she will only participate in one more season with the show. On Matthews\u2019 Podcast, via Reality Tea, Glanville revealed why she\u2019s gotten so much backlash for her role on the show and explained her future with Bravo.\n\n\u201cI am outspoken, and that tends to get me in trouble, especially with the ladies that are sitting around pretending to be perfect. I say what is on my mind.\u201d\n\nAs for season six of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Glanville said the network has yet to make any decisions.\n\n\u201cThey wait. I think they do it partly as a negotiation so nobody will ask for more money. I would like to do it one more time, then hopefully go onto something a little healthier.\u201d\n\nEddie Cibrian starred in a reality show with wife LeAnn Rimes, but the series was canceled after just one season.\n\n[Photo via Twitter]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eddie Cibrian's affairs are being discussed by his ex-wife, 'Real Housewives' Brandi Glanville, yet again.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Eddie Cibrian\u2019s affairs are being discussed by his ex-wife, \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 Brandi Glanville, yet again.", "title": "Eddie Cibrian\u2019s Ex-Wife \u2018RHOBH\u2019 Brandi Glanville Rehashes Their Messy Split", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2166090/eddie-cibrians-ex-wife-rhobh-brandi-glanville-rehashes-their-messy-split/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/brandi6.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-12T12:15:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T12:44:17+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/brandi6.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-06-12T12:15:17+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "eddie cibrian,brandi glanville,bravo,leann rimes,scheana marie,the real housewives of beverly hills,celebrity news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/brandi6.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Eddie Cibrian\u2019s affairs are being discussed by his ex-wife, \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 Brandi Glanville, yet again."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Eddie Cibrian and Brandi Glanville ended their marriage after nine years when Glanville discovered her husband, the father of her two sons, Mason and Jake, had been cheating on her with multiple women.\nHe had some ladies on the side.\u201dAlthough Glanville says she tried to forgive Eddie Cibrian for his infidelities, she failed to do so once she discovered there was more than just a couple other ladies involved.\nOn Matthews\u2019 Podcast, via Reality Tea, Glanville revealed why she\u2019s gotten so much backlash for her role on the show and explained her future with Bravo.\nI say what is on my mind.\u201dAs for season six of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Glanville said the network has yet to make any decisions.\nAt the time, Rimes was married, as well, and her husband, Dean Shermet, was just as shocked as Glanville when he was made aware of his wife\u2019s affair."}
