Pressure-sensing floor mats can sense when they have fallen or let caregivers know when a patient has not showered for a while. Sensors that customers wear on their bodies can detect whether they are moving in a manner that would indicate they have taken a spill.\n\nThe aim of these upgrades is to allow an aging population to stay in their homes -- and independent -- longer.\n\nThe market is small but could explode as more people enter retirement, analysts said. The devices could provide independence to some elderly people, but they also pose familiar questions about how to best ensure privacy is protected.\n\nThe devices often mean adding \"sensor platforms in what have traditionally been protected spaces -- your home, your office,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"Even something like a temperature sensor can be revealing. ... It can easily tell if you're home.\"\n\nThe effort also pushes \"telemedicine,\" including videoconferencing with one's doctor, into a more intimate space.\n\nReceiving such data from a patient can make it easier for doctors to monitor their health, said David Lindeman, a gerontologist and director of the Center for Technology and Aging. Also, he said, monitoring people while they are in their natural environment rather than a clinical setting can also lead to more accurate diagnoses.\n\nMobileHelp's alert and fall notification devices work inside and outside the home, giving customers a way to report emergencies no matter where they are. One customer said the device helped alleviate her fear of walking to her mailbox alone, said Robert Flippo, chief executive of MobileHelp.\n\n\"She'd literally sit at the window and watch for when someone walked by so she wouldn't be alone when she went to check her mail,\" he said.\n\nQualcomm, which offers a medical-connected home service called \"HealthyCircles,\" showed off the possibility of the smart home on the showroom floor at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month.\n\nUsing a central receiver, Qualcomm says, it pulls data from a variety of tools patients use to monitor their health -- smart scales, connected blood pressure monitors and glucose readers, for example -- into a central location so the information can be analyzed at a glance.\n\nA patient portal, which users pull up on their iPhone, iPad or Android devices, lets them easily report the effects of new medication and share small updates with their doctors, family members or other caretakers, Qualcomm says.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs, which was one of the first in the country to roll out a broad tele-health program that used videoconferencing and smart monitors, has seen a dramatic improvement since it was launched in 2003. Adam Darkins, a physician and national coordinator of VA's tele-health program, said the program has reduced days spent in the hospital by 59 percent and hospital admissions by 35 percent for veterans of all ages across the country.\n\nFor every patient VA manages with the program, he said, the organization saves $2,000 per year in costs, even when factoring in the cost of the program itself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/02/hfaging18.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "As more baby boomers enter retirement, many may see their homes get a high-tech makeover.\nThe aim of these upgrades is to allow an aging population to stay in their homes -- and independent -- longer.\nPressure-sensing floor mats can sense when they have fallen or let caregivers know when a patient has not showered for a while.\nSensors that customers wear on their bodies can detect whether they are moving in a manner that would indicate they have taken a spill.\nThe devices could provide independence to some elderly people, but they also pose familiar questions about how to best ensure privacy is protected."}
