It\u2019s named after 12-year-old Gabby Mair, who was hit by a car after getting off the school bus in DeBary in 2010. The next day, she was pronounced brain dead.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t the first and she wasn\u2019t the last,\u201d said her father, Don Mair. \u201cAnother 27 kids died the same exact way as Gab, and nothing has been done until now.\u201d\n\nThe bill was filed by Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs. It would expand fines and penalties for passing a stopped school bus.\n\nSimmons said the whole concept of children getting on and off school buses on busy highways will have to be addressed.\n\n\u201cAs we get more and more information with respect to the number of injuries and deaths, which are significant and certainly very, very sad, we\u2019ll continue with the progress of the bill,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nExpanded fines would help fund hospital trauma programs. Mair wants to see the bill expanded to include video cameras on school buses and automatic ticketing.\n\nCheck here to read Gabby\u2019s Bill.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
