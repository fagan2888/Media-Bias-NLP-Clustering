Al Sharpton has come out against the officer\u2019s telling of the incident that left Brown dead and a town in the international spotlight.\n\nIn a New York Times article that detailed grand jury testimony of Darren Wilson, he said he feared for his life in the moments leading up to Brown\u2019s shooting death at the hands of the officer, calling it \u201cself defense.\u201d\n\nBut Al Sharpton\u2019s view of Darren Wilson\u2019s testimony is not kind, calling it \u201cexcuses\u201d in a Business Insider story released just hours after The New York Times article was released.\n\n\u201cWe were involved in Trayvon Martin. We were supportive of Jordan Davis\u2026 The strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse\u2026 The only gun there was Darren Wilson\u2019s! Strange parallels with all of these cases.\u201d\n\nAl Sharpton continued attacking Darren Wilson\u2019s account of the events leading to Brown\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you stopped him \u2014 Michael Brown and his friend \u2014 walking down the street, what led to the scuffle?\u2026 Secondly, how does he and you get in your car? You trying to do what by yourself?\u2026 Now, if I go with you with your story all the way to that \u2014 that Michael Brown was shot, gets up off you in the car \u2014 why are you trying to tell me that a man\u2026 ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him?\u201d\n\nNot only was it revealed Saturday (October 18) that Wilson reported fearing for his life, but CNN reported that Brown\u2019s blood was found on Wilson\u2019s gun and in a Ferguson police patrol car following the fatal shooting.\n\nThe CNN report said it is unknown what exactly transpired in the car before the shooting, but it quoted Ferguson resident and activist Angela Whitman as saying people who believe Wilson\u2019s telling will see the situation in St. Louis County deteriorate quickly.\n\n\u201cThis is not a black and white thing, this is about what\u2019s right and wrong. St. Louis is in trouble, because if this is what Darren Wilson said, and they believe him, St. Louis is going to burn\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated with this. It\u2019s all for political gain. It\u2019s become no longer about Mike Brown.\u201d\n\n[Image via Flickr Creative Commons]", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was just earlier today that Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson's accounting of his shooting of Michael Brown was made public, and already,the Rev.
