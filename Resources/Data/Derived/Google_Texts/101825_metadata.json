The law professors, some of whom assisted with Winston\u2019s legal defense, have persuasively argued that he is innocent of the allegations made against him. In response, filmmakers Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering and had this to say:\n\nIn an emailed statement, \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d director Kirby Dick and producer Amy Ziering also denounced the website from Winston\u2019s legal team. \u201cIt\u2019s a slick and sad attempt to mislead the public and blame the victim,\u201d they wrote. They also criticized the Law School professors, many of whom have been vocal critics of Harvard\u2019s recently overhauled approach to handling sexual harassment cases, for their letter critiquing the film. \u201cThe Harvard Law professors\u2019 letter is irresponsible and raises an important question about whether the very public bias these professors have shown in favor of an assailant contributes to a hostile climate at Harvard Law,\u201d Dick and Ziering wrote.\n\nThis galling smear is reminiscent of the Title IX investigation of Northwestern University\u2019s Laura Kipnis, who was essentially accused of violating Title IX because she was criticizing Title IX. Similarly, critiquing an activist film that relies on junk science is unacceptable and possibly illegal, purveyors of hysteria claim.\n\nJanet Halley, Royall Professor of Law at Harvard, called the filmmaker's comments \"bizarre,\" in an email to Reason.\n\n\"The press release and the website enable the public to gauge for itself the veracity of the film,\" wrote Halley. \"This might have made a more unfriendly environment for the exaggerations, omissions, and falsehoods spread by the Hunting Ground. But here at the Law School we cherish debate and think that evidence matters\u2014sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Harvard professors; Dick and Ziering were equally dismissive of Reason\u2019s criticism of their film. Earlier this week, NPR wrote about the controversy surrounding The Hunting Ground and took note of Reason\u2019s investigation of David Lisak\u2019s confused approach to serial predators:\n\nThe libertarian magazine Reason has challenged the work of one of the scholars who serve as a touchstone for the film, the University of Massachusetts, Boston's David Lisak. He has been invoked as an authority by military officials, college campuses and media outlets, including NPR. In an interview with Reason, Lisak acknowledged that his study concluding the prevalence of serial campus rapists drew heavily on the earlier work of a former graduate student, whose research was not specifically focused on college rapes. It was conducted on people who happened to pass by on the UMass-Boston campus, a commuter school with an older population than the stereotypical four-year college. \u2026 Dick said the overwhelming consensus of relevant studies implicates repeat offenders \u2014 and so did the filmmakers' interviews. Ziering said a significant number of the women who participated in the documentary told her they did so because they were heartbroken to learn their victimizer had assaulted other women too. \"When it comes to statistics, we have to look to the scientists and look at the discussion that's going on among scientists,\" Dick told NPR. \"And [we should] not pay attention to people who might be pundits, because they're not researchers. We should really rely on the researchers to give us guidance.\"\n\nSome scientists, of course, do indeed take issue with Lisak\u2019s serial predator theory. But Dick and Ziering would apparently like to live in a world where the only person allowed to comment on these issues is the guy who shares all of their biases and completely agrees with them.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of the fundamental weakness of their argument\u2014a symptom of the fact that college campuses are simply not \u201chunting grounds\u201d teeming with criminal sociopaths who prey on women\u2014that Dick and Ziering have only one response to their critics: you\u2019re not allowed to criticize us.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Media is catching on to the junk science that forms the core narrative of the campus rape crisis.", "title": "Harvard Profs Criticizing The Hunting Ground Might Have Created a 'Hostile Climate,' Activist Filmmakers Claim", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/07/harvard-profs-criticizing-the-hunting-gr", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14492570151778.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Media is catching on to the junk science that forms the core narrative of the campus rape crisis.", "title": "Harvard Profs Criticizing <em>The Hunting Ground</em> Might Have Created a 'Hostile Climate,' Activist Filmmakers Claim", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14492570151778.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-12-07T15:33:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe039d\"", "article_summary": "The law professors, some of whom assisted with Winston\u2019s legal defense, have persuasively argued that he is innocent of the allegations made against him.\n\u201cThe Harvard Law professors\u2019 letter is irresponsible and raises an important question about whether the very public bias these professors have shown in favor of an assailant contributes to a hostile climate at Harvard Law,\u201d Dick and Ziering wrote.\nIt wasn't just the Harvard professors; Dick and Ziering were equally dismissive of Reason\u2019s criticism of their film.\n\"The press release and the website enable the public to gauge for itself the veracity of the film,\" wrote Halley.\nJanet Halley, Royall Professor of Law at Harvard, called the filmmaker's comments \"bizarre,\" in an email to Reason."}
