Americans spend nearly $800-million on peanut butter every year. This weekend, two organizations are teaming up to share it with those in need.

Saturday is National Peanut Butter Lover’s Day. It's a day to recognize what some call America’s favorite sandwich spread but area food pantries say it's also one of their most expensive items. Two local groups are teaming up to share the popular spread with others.

The Des Moines Area Religious Council Food Pantry Network assisted around 4,300 families last month alone. And with grocery prices rising, cuts in snap programs and high heating bills, the DMARC officials say more families than ever before are asking for help.

To help others in need, Skippy peanut butter and 20 area Hy-Vee stores are hosting a peanut butter promotion. For every three pounds of Skippy peanut butter sold, the team will donate a pound of peanut butter.

Together they hope to provide around 1,400 pounds of peanut butter, which is about 1,400 jars. That’s roughly the amount of peanut butter the DMARC Food Pantry Network goes through in a week.
