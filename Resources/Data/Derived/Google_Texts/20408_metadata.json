Leading politicians and presidential candidates face high levels of disapproval. The latest Gallup survey of public confidence in institutions finds television news battling Congress for the bottom of the barrel. The Pew Research Center details the steady decline of ratings for cable news. Quarterly reports detail the steady decline of cable television subscribers.\n\nNewton Minow, the great former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, once referred to television as a \u201cvast wasteland.\u201d The simultaneous collapse of confidence in American politicians and media is caused by the vast wasteland of public discourse from politicians that\u2019s being reported in the vast wasteland of political journalism suffering from collapsed quality \u2014 both of which are a debasement of democracy and an insult to citizens.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe pending format for the first round of presidential debates promises to become a fiasco, with the crowd of GOP candidates elbowing one another for scarce air time.\n\nCampaign \u201cjournalism\u201d has now degenerated into a freak show, with breathless \u201creporters\u201d chasing after Donald Trump Donald TrumpCarson rooting for Trump, Sanders debate Developer rejects Trump\u2019s Keystone pipeline proposal Trump take victory lap over rivals' remarks MORE like poodles after a treat, for irrelevant nuggets about his opinion on any matter dominating the latest news cycle. These tidbits are followed by \u201call star panels\u201d of opining pundits and dueling spinmeisters shilling for their favored candidates, uttering poll-tested platitudes of no interest to intelligent voters concerned about the future of their families and our nation.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a dramatic alternative. Let\u2019s revive the notion that the free press of a great nation should treat the airwaves of democracy and the printing presses of serious newspapers as a public trust, not as a ludicrous spectacle of banana republic politics that insults citizens, who then tune out the candidates and turn off the television.\n\nI propose three separate 90-minute GOP debates occurring in prime time on three successive evenings. Each debate would include five candidates chosen by lot. This would be fair to all candidates and provide each with a serious opportunity to offer \u2014 and provide every voter an intelligent opportunity to evaluate \u2014 his or her plans for the presidency and vision for America.\n\nUnder the current format, with an unmanageable gaggle of candidates dividing an inadequate amount of time, no one will have an opportunity to say anything serious, substantive or thoughtful. Most likely Trump will briefly make outrageous statements. The other candidates will briefly respond. After the freak show debate is over, it will be followed by a gaggle of talking heads offering freak show commentary, long after most in the audience have already tuned out.\n\nWhile I am not a Republican, I am very concerned about the state of our democracy and the declining quality of mainstream media. My advice to the Republican National Committee would be to encourage and support the alternative debate format I propose here.\n\nTo create a new, more thoughtful debate format, a leading role could be played by C-SPAN or public television, which have an impeccable reputation for fairness and quality, possibly with partners in blue-chip newspapers or cutting-edge new media such as Facebook, You Tube and Netflix.\n\nC-SPAN has pioneered in-depth public affairs television worthy of American democracy by giving fair voice to all parties and differing points of view while adding a wide range of discussion that includes history and books involving matters of politics, policy, leadership and governing.\n\nAs Steve Scully, C-SPAN senior executive producer and political editor, told me for this column: \u201cC-SPAN has always been about transparency and inclusion. We welcome any opportunity to provide our viewers and listeners with a chance to hear from the candidates and learn about their policy decisions.\u201d\n\nTruer words were never spoken about the kind of debates Americans desire and deserve as we decide who will lead our nation after the next election.\n\nBudowsky was an aide to former Sen.
