While a tornado was on the ground south of Ellicott, snow was falling less than 50 miles away on U.S. 24.\n\nAnd at the same time authorities tried to reassure nervous residents along the St. Vrain and Big Thompson rivers that this was not a repeat of the deadly floods of 2013, the National Weather Service forecast a snowy Mother\u2019s Day, not just in the mountains but all along the Front Range, with up to 10 inches expected along Interstate 25.\n\nEarly Saturday evening, as the Colorado Department of Transportation announced that chain restrictions were in effect in the mountains because of heavy snow on Interstate 70, a series of fresh tornado alerts were issued on the Eastern Plains for multiple tornadoes near Eads and Cheyenne Wells.\n\n\u201cMay not hurt to watch for frogs and locusts, too,\u201d the State Patrol in Sterling playfully tweeted.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this, at this time of year, for the past several years,\u201d said Jim Kalina, a NWS meteorologist, of the prolonged wet weather pattern and Saturday\u2019s wild weather mix.\n\n\u201cThe last few springs have been really dry,\u201d Kalina said. \u201cBut if we didn\u2019t have this, we would probably be seeing fires.\u201d\n\nA severe thunderstorm on Saturday afternoon unleashed golf-ball-size hail east of Pueblo, damaging roofs, siding, windows and vehicles, according to the Weather Service.\n\nAt about 1:30 p.m. Saturday, U.S. 24 was closed in both directions in Manitou Springs around the Cascade/Cave of the Winds interchange, as stalled vehicles caused safety concerns and cars slid on 3 inches of fallen hail.\n\nFor the third straight day, the city of Colorado Springs called out snowplows to clear deep hail from roads.\n\nThe plows then were put on standby, anticipating snow.\n\nThe American Red Cross briefly opened an evacuation center in Manitou Springs because of the threat of flash flooding in the Waldo Canyon burn scar area.\n\nIn the northeastern part of the state, several roads and highways, including parts of Colorado 54, 71 and 113, were closed by flooding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a ton of closures,\u201d said Trooper Tim Sutherland, a Colorado State Patrol spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s the weather, hail, rain, a lot of flooding, a lot of creeks over their banks.\u201d\n\nMorgan County Sheriff Jim Crone issued a statement advising \u201canyone who had to evacuate from along the South Platte in 2013 to be prepared to evacuate again in the next few days.\n\n\u201cThere is NO evacuation recommendation at this time,\u201d he added.\n\nHe asked area residents to stay off county roads because of flooding and for ranchers along the South Platte River to move livestock to higher ground.\n\nBoulder was under a flash flood watch and the city closed open space trails west of Broadway.\n\nBut officials tried to reassure residents.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be the moisture content or anything close to the 2013 floods,\u201d Mike Chard, director of the Boulder Office of Emergency Management told the Daily Camera, \u201cbut we are going to have and we are having localized flooding issues throughout the county and even across the whole Front Range.\u201d\n\nPower outages were reported in Ward, Gold Hill and parts of Four Mile Canyon, and \u201cdebris\u201d was falling and drifting onto parts of Flagstaff Road.\n\nRising waters in Turkey Creek on Saturday, around Turkey Creek Park near North Turkey Creek and South Turkey Creek roads, in the foothills west of Littleton were washing out driveways, according to Inter-Canyon Fire Protection District.\n\nThe strong storm system is part of the same pattern that\u2019s been bringing wet weather to northeastern Colorado for more than a week, Kalina said. This weekend\u2019s storm is packing more moisture than the prior recent weather systems.\n\nIn the foothills, 8 to 12 inches of snow is possible by 9 a.m. Sunday, with 5 to 10 inches in Denver and parts of northeastern Colorado.\n\nHeavy snow is also expected in the mountains, with up to 16 inches in some areas above 9,000 feet in elevation.\n\nThe snow and gusty winds, up to 40 mph, could produce poor visibilities on Sunday morning, as well as snap tree branches and topple trees.\n\n\u201cThe forecast is calling for snow,\u201d Sutherland said Saturday afternoon. \u201cIf snow comes in on top of this, it\u2019s not going to be good. I recommend staying inside Mother\u2019s Day and cooking mom a nice dinner.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado weather: Wet, wild conditions close roads, unleash hail, tornadoes", "title": "Colorado weather: Wet, wild conditions close roads, unleash hail, tornadoes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/09/colorado-weather-wet-wild-conditions-close-roads-unleash-hail-tornadoes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__weatherp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__weatherp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T09:30:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T13:20:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For the third straight day, the city of Colorado Springs called out snowplows to clear deep hail from roads.\nAt one point, Elbert County and Colorado Springs were under five different sorts of warnings or advisories.\nRising waters in Turkey Creek on Saturday, around Turkey Creek Park near North Turkey Creek and South Turkey Creek roads, in the foothills west of Littleton were washing out driveways, according to Inter-Canyon Fire Protection District.\nWet, wild weather swept through widespread parts of Colorado on Saturday, with hail pounding Pueblo and Manitou Springs as watches and warnings were posted for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, floods, flash floods and winter weather.\nIn the northeastern part of the state, several roads and highways, including parts of Colorado 54, 71 and 113, were closed by flooding."}
