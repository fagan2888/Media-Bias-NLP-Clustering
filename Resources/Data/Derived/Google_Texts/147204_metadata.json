She buttresses her point with a phone conversation she had with a representative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe former CBS reporter told Fox News\u2019 Howard Kurtz that since the appointment of Ebola czar Ron Klain by President Obama, CDC Director Tom Frieden has been virtually absent from the public sphere. \u201cInfectious disease experts remain very concerned about the disease,\u201d Attkisson said.\n\nKlain, a former aide to Vice President Joe Biden, has no prior medical experience. Attkisson also noted the CDC is tracking 1,400 possible Ebola cases in the United States, but does not advertise that information on their website:\n\n\u201cI called CDC not long ago and said, \u2018How many active cases are being monitored in the United States of Ebola?\u2019 And they said \u20181,400.\u2019 I said, \u2018Where is that on your website, these updates?\u2019 They said, \u2018We\u2019re not putting it on the web.\u2019 \u201cSo I think there is an effort to control the message and to tamp it down. This is public information we have a right to, and I think the media should not hype it but cover it.\u201d Advertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAs of Monday, there is no section of \u201cData & Statistics\u201d for Ebola on the CDC\u2019s website, but the site does include sections for \u201cLife Expectancy\u201d and \u201cOverweight and Obesity.\u201d\n\nh/t Newsmax\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This is public information we have a right to...\"", "author": "James Beattie", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"This is public information we have a right to...\"", "title": "Watch: Reporter Reveals A Possible Obama Admin Cover Up That Could Endanger Many Americans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ebola-atkinson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-03T17:22:42-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/sharyl-attkisson-cdc-tracking-1400-possible-ebola-cases/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"This is public information we have a right to...\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ebola-atkinson.jpg", "title": "Watch: Reporter Reveals A Possible Obama Admin Cover Up That Could Endanger Many Americans", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-23T12:16:45-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Ebola", "published_time": "2014-12-23T12:16:45-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T17:22:42-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "tracking ebola, cdc is tracking ebola, 1400 active ebola cases, cdc tracking 1400 ebola cases, is ebola still a threat, ebola in the us, ebola in america, sharyl attkisson, sharyl attkisson ebola, centers for disease control and prevention cdc, ebola, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "\u201cInfectious disease experts remain very concerned about the disease,\u201d Attkisson said.\nShe buttresses her point with a phone conversation she had with a representative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\"This is public information we have a right to...\"Advertisement - story continues belowInvestigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson argued Sunday it was not an accident that there has been less coverage by the media of the Ebola crisis.\nThe former CBS reporter told Fox News\u2019 Howard Kurtz that since the appointment of Ebola czar Ron Klain by President Obama, CDC Director Tom Frieden has been virtually absent from the public sphere.\nKlain, a former aide to Vice President Joe Biden, has no prior medical experience."}
