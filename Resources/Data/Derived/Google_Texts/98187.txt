SAN FRANCISCO — Walt Weiss managed his final game of the 2015 season Sunday afternoon against the Giants, a 7-3 victory.

But will Weiss return to manage the Rockies in 2016? That remains unclear.

Weiss said he is tentatively scheduled to meet with general manager Jeff Bridich on Tuesday in Denver to discuss this season and the future. Though Weiss has one year remaining on his two-year, $2 million contract, Bridich has been noncommittal about Weiss’ future.

A recent interview on MLB Network radio raised speculation about Bridich’s commitment to Weiss, but Bridich said the interview was misconstrued by some.

“It is semantics. I think the way I said it was, ‘Everybody knows that he’s got a year left.’ But what I also said was that we are going to sit down, like any other year, and we are going to review ourselves,” Bridich said last week. “What’s gone wrong? What’s gone right? What do we need to work on?

“Now is not the time to focus on that stuff. We are focused on trying to win as many games as (we have left). There is nothing that has changed.

“For the entire year it hasn’t been on the radar. The only reason it’s being talked about now — for media, or fans, for whatever — it’s because we are at the end of the year.”

The Rockies finished this season 68-94, and Weiss has a 208-278 record in three years at the helm. That .428 winning percentage is the lowest for any Rockies manager.

Weiss reiterated that he wants to return, but said he has received no indication from Bridich or Rockies owner Dick Monfort on whether or not he will be back.

“I haven’t heard. … But I’m signed up, man,” Weiss said.

Asked to assess the ups and downs of the season, Weiss said: “I think I’ve handled it just fine. I will let other people talk about me or evaluate me, or whatever they want to do. I have no regrets.”
