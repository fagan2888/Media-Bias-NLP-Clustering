But the reports are credible and consistent with the shrinking workweek at used merchandise stores.\n\nMore broadly, the workweek has fallen to a record low in industries where the pay of nonsupervisors averages up to about $14.50 an hour. It is clear that modest-wage workers have the most to fear from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nDoing Harm To Doing Good\n\nNow, we have examples of organizations synonymous with doing good apparently being compelled to act in ways that do harm to their own workers.\n\nThe risk is that this becomes a trend. IBD\u2019s ObamaCare employment impact list already includes the LDS Church-owned Deseret Industries, which operates thrift stores that train war refugees for lasting employment.\n\nThe list\u2019s seven new additions include Cabela\u2019s (CAB); Worldwide TechServices; Davis School District in Utah; Eastern Florida State College; and three Indiana school districts (School City of Mishawaka, Shelby Eastern Schools and Southwestern Consolidated School District).\n\nThey include three employers whose work-hour cuts have apparently gone unreported. In each case, current or former employ ees provided official documents to back up their claims.\n\nCabela\u2019s, whose 42 U.S. retail stores sell hunting, fishing and camping gear, cut part-time workers to a maximum of 28 hours per week. A notice to employees informed them that the change was due to health care reform: \u201cthe definition of part-time em ployment is changing to less than an average of 30 hours per week.\u201d\n\nFirst Tech Firm On List\n\nWorldwide TechServices of Tewksbury, Mass., is the first technology firm on IBD\u2019s list. It cut the hours of field service technicians to a maximum of 29 per week at the end of 2012. The technicians do low-margin contract warranty repairs for firms such as Dell (DELL) and Lenovo.\n\nAfter July\u2019s employer mandate delay, the company temporarily lifted the cap on hours worked.\n\nDavis School District in Farmington, Utah, cut hours of part-time support staff such as bus drivers to 29.5 hours a week, starting this December. In a memo to employees, officials blamed \u201cthe potential costs that would be incurred as a result of the ACA mandate to provide insurance for any employee that works 30 hours or more per week.\u201d\n\nIBD is removing Wal-Mart (WMT) from the list, after it set plans to lift 35,000 part-time workers to full-time status. It\u2019s no longer clear that Wal-Mart is systematically altering its labor model to avoid ObamaCare\u2019s mandate.\n\nAs IBD noted this week, the negative impact of the employer mandate won\u2019t only show up in fewer hours worked. It also will hurt the operation of the health insurance exchanges.\n\nAnother way of dodging the mandate is to offer employees inexpensive skinny\u201d plans that don\u2019t cover hospitalization or surgery, but are cheap enough that they might appear like a good deal relative to exchange policies.\n\nAs promotional efforts ramp up to get the young and healthy to enroll, businesses aiming to hold the line on health expenses will be giving many of them a reason to opt out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IBD's list of employers that have cut work hours or adopted other labor policies to limit ObamaCare liability has expanded to 319.
