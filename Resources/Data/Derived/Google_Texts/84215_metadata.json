Patrick Leahy (D-VT) pressed Judiciary Committee witness Jonathan Turley on how much he is paid and whether he was paid for his testimony during the second day of hearing on Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTurley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University and the attorney for the House of Representative\u2019s lawsuit challenging the Obama administration\u2019s changes to Obamacare, stressed he was not paid for his testimony.\n\nA Senate GOP aide, however, expressed dismay that a former chairman of the committee would ask about payment for testimony.\n\n\u201cLeahy was chairman of the committee until his party got shellacked last November. Surely he knows he can\u2019t get paid for testimony before Congress,\u201d the aide emailed Breitbart News. \u201cStooping to that level is beneath the dignity of a sitting senator.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Leahy was focused on Turley\u2019s paycheck.\n\n\u201cThe House Republicans have hired you to sue the administration in another area and taxpayers will pay your fee. They say that this could cost as much as $3 million. They\u2019re not paying you $3 million, are they?\u201d Leahy asked.\n\nTurley laughed and responded that \u201cI\u2019m certainly open to that, Sen. Leahy, but, no, no one\u2019s offered me $3 million.\u201d\n\nThe constitutional lawyer said that he believes the contract set the hourly rate at $500 and noted that he is working for the House of Representatives, which voted to authorize the lawsuit, not just the House Republicans.\n\n\u201cRepublican vote. It was a partisan vote, you know. Not to put too, spend too closely \u2014 Do you get paid for your testimony here today?\u201d Leahy asked.\n\n\u201cOh, no, of course not,\u201d Turley responded\n\n\u201cThank you. I thought I\u2019d ask that out of fairness to you,\u201d Leahy added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheap Shot: Dem Asks Turley If He Was Paid For Testimony", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cheap Shot: Dem Asks Turley If He Was Paid For Testimony", "title": "Cheap Shot: Dem Asks Turley If He Was Paid For Testimony - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/turley.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/29/cheap-shot-dem-asks-turley-if-he-was-paid-for-testimony/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cheap Shot: Dem Asks Turley If He Was Paid For Testimony", "title": "Cheap Shot: Dem Asks Turley If He Was Paid For Testimony - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/turley.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jonathan Turley, Patrick Leahy,Big Government,patrick leahy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Patrick Leahy", "published_time": "2015-01-29T09:19:11-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa1a\"", "article_summary": "Not to put too, spend too closely \u2014 Do you get paid for your testimony here today?\u201d Leahy asked.\nSurely he knows he can\u2019t get paid for testimony before Congress,\u201d the aide emailed Breitbart News.\nA Senate GOP aide, however, expressed dismay that a former chairman of the committee would ask about payment for testimony.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTurley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University and the attorney for the House of Representative\u2019s lawsuit challenging the Obama administration\u2019s changes to Obamacare, stressed he was not paid for his testimony.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSen.
