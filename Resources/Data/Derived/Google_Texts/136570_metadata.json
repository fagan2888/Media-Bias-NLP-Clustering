REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n3981128\n\nConservatives are outraged over Harry Reid pulling the trigger on the so-called nuclear option in the Senate, making it impossible for Republicans to stop President Obama from nominating anyone he wants to positions in the government.\n\nBut some on the right are finding comfort in the theory that Reid\u2019s legislative maneuver could actually make it easier for Republicans to eventually repeal Obamacare \u2014 if all the pieces come together in 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Democrats \u2014 led by Reid, the Senate majority leader \u2014 took the drastic step of changing the body\u2019s rules to prevent Republicans from being able to filibuster most of the president\u2019s nominees.\n\nBy employing the nuclear option, Democrats changed the rules so that nomination voted on by the Senate \u2014 such as cabinet positions or appeals court judges \u2014 only need a majority of votes to pass, instead of the traditional 60 votes.\n\nWhile Democrats claim the new rule only applies to nominations \u2014 and not Supreme Court picks or legislation \u2014 conservative commentator George Will is among those who pointed out that there\u2019s no reason to think the majority rule won\u2019t be expanded to other issues in the Senate.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something that could help Republicans repeal Obamacare if they win the presidency in 2016, win the Senate and keep control of the House.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no limiting principle in the principle they\u2019re invoking,\u201d Will said on Special Report on Fox News on Thursday night. \u201cThat is majorities should rule all the time.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhat this means is if in the spring of 2017 there\u2019s a Republican president, which there could be, the Republicans still hold the House, and they have 51 senators, they can repeal Obamacare with 51 votes. And I\u2019m not sure the people who did this today have thought this.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell broadly warned Democrats that they might later regret using the nuclear option.\n\n\u201cI say to my friends on the other side of the aisle you\u2019ll regret this,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'I'm not sure the people who did this today have thought this'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservatives are outraged over Harry Reid pulling the trigger on the so-called nuclear option in the Senate, making it impossible for Republicans to stop President Obama from nominating anyone he wan", "title": "Silver lining for GOP: Nuclear option could make repealing Obamacare easier", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/22/silver-lining-for-gop-nuclear-option-could-make-repealing-obamacare-easier/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-13T194554Z_1_CBRE9AC1IWM00_RTROPTP_4_USA-CONGRESS-e1384895141286.jpg", "height": 276}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'I'm not sure the people who did this today have thought this'", "title": "Silver lining for GOP: Nuclear option could make repealing Obamacare easier Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/22/silver-lining-for-gop-nuclear-option-could-make-repealing-obamacare-easier/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-13T194554Z_1_CBRE9AC1IWM00_RTROPTP_4_USA-CONGRESS-e1384895141286.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-22 11:30:29", "sailthru.title": "Silver lining for GOP: Nuclear option could make repealing Obamacare easier", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "harry reid,mitch mcconnell,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "harry-reid,mitch-mcconnell,obamacare,alex-pappas", "sailthru.description": "Conservatives are outraged over Harry Reid pulling the trigger on the so-called nuclear option in the Senate, making it impossible for Republicans to stop President Obama from nominating anyone he wan", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-13T194554Z_1_CBRE9AC1IWM00_RTROPTP_4_USA-CONGRESS-e1384895141286.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf93c\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s something that could help Republicans repeal Obamacare if they win the presidency in 2016, win the Senate and keep control of the House.\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) (L) speaks to the media about healthcare on Capitol Hill in Washington October 29, 2013.\nBut some on the right are finding comfort in the theory that Reid\u2019s legislative maneuver could actually make it easier for Republicans to eventually repeal Obamacare \u2014 if all the pieces come together in 2017.\nOn Thursday, Senate Democrats \u2014 led by Reid, the Senate majority leader \u2014 took the drastic step of changing the body\u2019s rules to prevent Republicans from being able to filibuster most of the president\u2019s nominees.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no limiting principle in the principle they\u2019re invoking,\u201d Will said on Special Report on Fox News on Thursday night."}
