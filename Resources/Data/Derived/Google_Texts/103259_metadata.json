Susan Collins (R-Maine), arguably the last moderate Republican in Congress, thought she\u2019d offered Democrats a credible solution to the ongoing crises. The Maine senator told reporters yesterday she \u201cbent over backwards\u201d to try to work something out, before Democrats rejected her idea.\n\nThere were, however, two problems. The first is that Collins\u2019 plan called on Democrats to make concessions in exchange for nothing \u2013 her idea would reopen the government for six months, raise the debt ceiling for a year, and require Democrats to accept sequestration levels and throw in a two-year delay of the medical-device tax in the Affordable Care Act. It was a one-sided deal \u2013 Democrats would make some concessions, while Republicans made none.\n\nThe second problem is that even if Senate Democrats took Collins\u2019 slanted deal, it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference since House Republicans said they\u2019d refuse to even bring the bill to the floor. And why\u2019s that? Because House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) isthinking ahead.\n\nThis defiance was fed by Ryan, who stood up and railed against the Collins proposal, saying the House could not accept either a debt-limit bill or a government-funding measure that would delay the next fight until the new year. According to two Republicans familiar with the exchange, Ryan argued that the House would need those deadlines as \u201cleverage\u201d for delaying the health-care law\u2019s individual mandate and adding a \u201cconscience clause\u201d \u2013 allowing employers and insurers to opt out of birth-control coverage if they find it objectionable on moral or religious grounds \u2013 and mentioned tax and entitlement goals Ryan had focused on in a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nGot that? We\u2019re in the midst of two crises, but Paul Ryan is already thinking ahead to the nextself-imposed crises, at which point he\u2019ll demand restrictions on access to contraception. (The establishment routinely forgets just how extreme a culture warrior Ryan really is.)\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder why Democrats, if they agree to pay a ransom now, will only encourage more hostage-taking later.\n\nPolitico had an item this morning that noted, \u201cWhatever else came out of the shutdown, President Barack Obama said he wanted two things to change: no more negotiating under threat. And no more lurching from crisis to crisis.\u201d And though that\u2019s obviously proving to be difficult, it\u2019s an important goal.\n\nUnder the current Republican model, the American legislative process is effectively broken. They could pursue policy goals by relying on constitutional norms \u2013 introducing bills, holding hearings, considering amendments, allowing floor debates, etc. \u2013 but that\u2019s unlikely to deliver they results they want. Worse, it might require some compromises, which isn\u2019t part of their m.o.\n\nSo instead they\u2019ll just rely on a series of intermittent deadlines. The government needs funding? Then Republicans will demand concessions in exchange for nothing. The Treasury needs to have its borrowing authority extended? Then Republicans will demand moreconcessions in exchange for nothing. The entire federal policymaking process will simply lurch from one hostage crisis to the next, with Republican lawmakers refusing to engage outside of a crisis environment.\n\nPaul Ryan looks at these moments like children looking forward to their birthday \u2013 he starts thinking about what he\u2019ll ask for months in advance. And in this case, he doesn\u2019t like any plan that will delay his gifts because he\u2019s so looking forward to making it more difficult for Americans to access birth control.\n\nRemember: in GOP land, Paul Ryan is supposed to be the conservative intellectual that the rest of us take seriously.\n\nThose who wonder why governing has become so impossible in 2013 just aren\u2019t paying close enough attention.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Those who wonder why governing has become so impossible in 2013 just aren't paying close enough attention.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/contraception-still-gop-focus", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Those who wonder why governing has become so impossible in 2013 just aren't paying close enough attention.", "title": "Contraception restrictions remain a top Republican priority", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/contraception-still-gop-focus", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/ap603172125518.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/contraception-still-gop-focus", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap603172125518.jpg?itok=w2U-viGz", "height": 553}, "title": "Contraception restrictions remain a top Republican priority", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Those who wonder why governing has become so impossible in 2013 just aren't paying close enough attention."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-14T15:28:01-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "rachel-maddow-show", "contentId": 20959509, "title": "Contraception restrictions remain a top Republican priority", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/contraception-still-gop-focus", "date": "10/14/2013 15:28:01 EDT", "published": 1}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Those who wonder why governing has become so impossible in 2013 just aren't paying close enough attention.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe062b\"", "article_summary": "Remember: in GOP land, Paul Ryan is supposed to be the conservative intellectual that the rest of us take seriously.\nWe\u2019re in the midst of two crises, but Paul Ryan is already thinking ahead to the nextself-imposed crises, at which point he\u2019ll demand restrictions on access to contraception.\nPaul Ryan looks at these moments like children looking forward to their birthday \u2013 he starts thinking about what he\u2019ll ask for months in advance.\nAnd no more lurching from crisis to crisis.\u201d And though that\u2019s obviously proving to be difficult, it\u2019s an important goal.\nSen.
