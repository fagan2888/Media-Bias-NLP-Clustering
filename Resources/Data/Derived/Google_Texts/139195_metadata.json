Rick Scott, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and Republican Party of Florida Chairman Lenny Curry.\n\nIn its 2012 endorsement of Gardiner, the Orlando Sentinel described the senator as \u201ca staunch fiscal and social conservative, but not a shrill partisan like some other party leaders.\u201d (The full video interview is accessible here.)\n\nThe 44-year-old Orlando Republican laid out an agenda focused on the economy, water and natural resources and expanding educational and employment opportunities for disabled Floridians.\n\nThe state\u2019s economy \u201cappears to be on a steady uphill climb,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\n\u201cWe are headed in the right direction and we have the right governor to head us in that direction. \u2026 It should be a goal of our caucus to continue to look for areas where we can improve,\u201d he said.\n\nGardiner, a vice president of external affairs at Orlando Health, said the Senate will reconsider the enterprise zones set to go away in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe ought to look at them and make sure they did what we intended to do. Maybe we change them,\u201d he said.\n\nGardiner, whose son Andrew has Down syndrome, said he wants to do away with \u201cspecial diplomas\u201d that he said mean little in the real world.\n\nInstead, students should get trained in specific trades that would enable them to attend college \u201cbut also get a meaningful job when they\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nA triathlete, Gardiner also said he wants a statewide policy for Florida\u2019s water and natural resources, which could be linked to eco-tourism. Gardiner pushed for a $50 million coast-to-coast bike trail included in the budget but vetoed by Scott this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re known for our theme parks but we should be known for our rivers and our lakes and our bike trails all across this great state,\u201d he said.\n\nGardiner will officially take the helm of the chamber after the 2014 elections in November.\n\nThe designation of the even-handed and low-key Gardiner could bring peace to what has been a fractured caucus for a number of years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to dictate. I\u2019m not here to tell you what to do. I\u2019m here to support and help you,\u201d Gardiner told his colleagues.\n\nGardiner survived a caucus coup attempt last year in which other Republicans, including Sen. Joe Negron of Stuart, tried to oust him. A battle between Negron and Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, to become president after Gardiner has yet to be resolved.\n\n\u201cI think it means peace and quiet for the Senate. He\u2019s a very calming influence on senators. He works with everyone. He\u2019s universally well-liked. And I think it means a good two years for the Senate,\u201d Latvala said.\n\nInspired by Gardiner\u2019s son Andrew \u2014 an Orlando Magic fan \u2014 the caucus surprised Gardiner with a video featuring some of the basketball team players and Magic jerseys for each of the Gardiner children bearing the number \u201c86\u201d because Gardiner is the 86th Senate president.\n\nGardiner gave his caucus members replicas of the state seal made from copper from the old Capitol dome accompanied by a quote from Benjamin Franklin: \u201cThat government is the strongest of which every man feels a part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it and I live it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013Dara Kam, News Service of Florida\n\nThe News Service of Florida has five questions for Andy Gardiner:\n\nQ: How does your son\u2019s disability affect the way you govern?\n\nGARDINER: Well, I came in in 2000 in the House, and certainly my views of the role of government have changed. But having children, as well, has changed that a lot. My son has unique challenges, and I think that\u2019s opened up my eyes to a lot of families that are living that journey. And I believe government has a role in helping them along that journey. So that\u2019s been a lot of my focus.\n\n(Do you think children\u2019s issues get short shrift?) If you look at our budget last year, we put about $15 (million) or $17 million into (the Agency for Persons with Disabilities) for the Medicaid waiver list. I think we should continue to buy that down. If you look at the history of children\u2019s issues, not just with Governor Scott but going back to Governor (Jeb) Bush \u2026 I mean, Governor Bush paid off the entire waiting list. The more we can do, working with APD, to work on that waiting list, the better.\n\nAnd early intervention services \u2014 we put more money into that \u2014 those are all very important issues. But it\u2019s important to remember when you do all these early interventions and you\u2019re helping the child from 6 years old to 7 or 8 years old, at some point that child gets to high school and wants to go get a real job and wants to go to college. You\u2019ve prepared them. Now it\u2019s time for us to look at what we can do next.\n\nQ: In your acceptance address, you said, \u201cWhether your personal life journey started with a unique challenge that most others do not face, or includes starting over after coming home from military service, or aging out of foster care, we in public service should not endeavor to carry you on your journey but to clear your path of obstacles.\u201d What does that mean, in terms of policy, for people with disabilities, military veterans and kids aging out of foster care?\n\nGARDINER: Well, regardless of when that diagnosis is, whether it\u2019s an injury or it\u2019s a birth and the parents are notified, I believe what our job should be in government is really hand that family, \u201cHere\u2019s where the state of Florida will be a partner with you,\u201d whether it\u2019s early intervention services, or we make changes to the (Individualized Education Program) process where families now are empowered to make the decision. And to be able to say to a veteran coming back, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, the state of Florida\u2019s here. And we\u2019re going to provide you a road map. Here\u2019s all the services that are available to you.\u201d\n\nIf you look at it, we have a lot of great services that are already being provided, even for children with disabilities. But it\u2019s almost overwhelming for a family, and for a veteran, or a child in foster care, we should lay all of it all out for them, and almost like a deck of cards, choose the one that\u2019s best for you to be successful in the state of Florida.\n\nQ: You supported a Senate plan to accept federal money for expanding health care coverage, an alternative to expanding Medicaid. But your counterpart, Speaker-designate Steve Crisafulli, says he won\u2019t back off the House\u2019s position, which refuses money tied to Obamacare. Will you try to convince him?\n\nGARDINER: Number one, I\u2019m not president yet, and I will support my president, Don Gaetz, whatever his decision is. I think the Senate has a pretty good proposal that is not an expansion of Medicaid but really provides some of that personal responsibility premium assistance. And we\u2019re open to discussion with the House, but I can only speak for the Senate, and if there\u2019s ever an opening to sit down and talk about numerous ideas \u2014 and if the House has new ideas \u2014 we\u2019re certainly open to that. But until it\u2019s my time, my job is to support Senate President Gaetz and what he wants to do on that particular issue.\n\nQ: In your acceptance address, you said we need better policies on water and the environment. We\u2019ve heard critics of the governor\u2019s jobs program say it\u2019s costing us too many natural resources. What do you think of that criticism?\n\nGARDINER: I don\u2019t necessarily agree with that criticism, and I don\u2019t want residents of the state to think that I\u2019m somehow saying we haven\u2019t done the right thing. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of great things. But what I wanted to let people know is, as our economy gets stronger and the revenues are increasing, it gives us the opportunity to look at areas that maybe we have not looked at as much because the revenues were down.\n\nAnd I know it\u2019s also a priority for the Speaker-designate, and I just think it\u2019s a great time to sit down and say, \u201cLet\u2019s look at all our water policies, let\u2019s look at bike trails, let\u2019s look at all these things.\u201d Could we leave a legacy that it\u2019s not an annual fight over funding for one particular project? Maybe it\u2019s a significant change in the way we do water policy in the state of Florida.\n\nQ: You\u2019re known for your ties to Disney, which opposes destination casinos. As Senate president, what will be your approach to gambling?\n\nGARDINER: Well, it\u2019s not who I\u2019m tied to or who I know. I think everybody knows that I\u2019m opposed to gambling. I always have been, and there\u2019s usually three or four of us who consistently vote against any expansion \u2014 including the lottery.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s important for everybody to understand the Senate president\u2019s job is to help the Senate be successful, and there are so many views on that particular issue. It\u2019s not my job to dictate to the Senate that \u201cThis will be our position.\u201d It\u2019s (to) put the members in the right places \u2014 they\u2019ll draft it; they\u2019ll bring it forward.\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to take a hard look at our gambling policy in the state of Florida.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andy Gardiner, The 44-year-old Orlando Republican, was lauded as a compassionate and temperate conservative as he laid out an agenda focused on the economy, water and natural resources and expanding educational and employment opportunities for disabled Floridians.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "FlaglerLive", "description": "Andy Gardiner, The 44-year-old Orlando Republican, was lauded as a compassionate and temperate conservative as he laid out an agenda focused on the economy, water and natural resources and expanding educational and employment opportunities for disabled Floridians.", "title": "Florida Senate Names Andy Gardiner Its Next President In a Nod to Less Abrasive Republicans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/divider.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-04T12:42:02-04:00", "url": "http://flaglerlive.com/61830/andy-gardiner-florida-senate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/sen-andy-gardiner.jpg", "description": "Andy Gardiner, The 44-year-old Orlando Republican, was lauded as a compassionate and temperate conservative as he laid out an agenda focused on the economy, water and natural resources and expanding educational and employment opportunities for disabled Floridians.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida Senate Names Andy Gardiner Its Next President In a Nod to Less Abrasive Republicans"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.9", "fb": {"app_id": 116656355016711}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-FlaglerLive-270x270.jpg", "article": {"section": "Carousel", "tag": "republicans", "published_time": "2013-12-11T18:27:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-04T12:42:02-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "As Senate president, what will be your approach to gambling?\nGardiner is \u201ctested by life, tempered by experience and with a strong backbone, a warm heart and\u2026an optimism as warm as the Florida sunshine,\u201d Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said.\nGARDINER: Number one, I\u2019m not president yet, and I will support my president, Don Gaetz, whatever his decision is.\nBut until it\u2019s my time, my job is to support Senate President Gaetz and what he wants to do on that particular issue.\nGardiner, a vice president of external affairs at Orlando Health, said the Senate will reconsider the enterprise zones set to go away in 2015."}
