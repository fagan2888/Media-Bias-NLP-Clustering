It has been grim reality.\n\nMr Justice Nigel Sweeney, an oddly charismatic judge with a conversational style, raised his voice into lecture mode for his sentencing remarks, and proceeded to tell Harris off in headmasterly style.\n\nRolf Harris arrives for sentencing with his daughter Bindi (left) and niece Jenny. Photo: Reuters\n\n\u201cYou have no-one to blame but yourself,\u201d he admonished Harris, who slumped in the dock stony-faced, wearing the same tie he wore six years ago to receive his ARIA hall of fame award that has now been revoked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou took advantage of the trust placed in you,\u201d Sweeney continued, still in his private school form room persona. \u201cYou have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.\u201d\n\nIn front of a silent, packed courtroom 2 at Southwark Crown Court, Sweeney reiterated the base, gynaecological, shocking facts of the case.\n\nCount one, Harris\u2019 hand went here, and \u201cyou took her childhood innocence\u201d.\n\nCount two, he groped there, and \u201che treated me like a toy that he played with for his own pleasure\".\n\nCount three, he spat on his fingers. Count four, again. Counts five and six, same again, in his daughter\u2019s own bedroom, in an extraordinary breach of trust to almost anyone you could name. Counts seven and eight, again, graphic details of Harris\u2019 abuse of the main complainant even as he was \u201ckeeping an eye on Bindi\u201d asleep in the next bed.\n\nCount nine in a swimming pool, and again with the graphic details.\n\nAnd finally Tonya Lee, the Australian who had dreamed of an acting career. Instead, her star role was summarised as a sordid tale of groping and tights and\u2026 and so on.\n\nSweeney reread Lee\u2019s victim impact statement.\n\n\u201cWhat Rolf Harris took from me was my self belief and more so the ability to feel safe\u2026 What Mr Harris took from me was my very essence.\u201d\n\nThe court was silent. Harris a motionless centre, his family on one side, their faces set and grim, his lawyers taking notes and frowning, his public relations team thinking who knows what. The invisible 3G frequencies were thick with the Tweets of the waiting media.\n\nAnd then what they were waiting for unraveled.\n\nMr Justice Sweeney had explained, matter of factly, that his hands were tied.\n\nDespite the \u201csevere psychological injury\u201d Harris had caused, despite each victim impact statement that Sweeney had made a point of saying \u201cI believe to be true\u201d, despite the fact that Harris\u2019 assaults had led to alcoholism, anger, the death of aspirations, shame, guilt, the loss of innocence, physical and mental pain, family trauma and the trauma of revisiting it all in a courtroom\u2026\n\n\u201cThe equivalent offences today attract significantly higher maximum sentences,\u201d Mr Justice Sweeney said. The subtext was: there was nothing he could do. A few decades ago, society just didn\u2019t care as much.\n\nHe was bound by convention. The theoretical maximum sentences, already low, must be lowered further, because of the possibility that Rolf Harris could have behaved even worse, or not done as many good deeds.\n\nThe numbers were crunched, and the result came out.\n\n\u201cPlease stand,\u201d Mr Justice Sweeney said.\n\nHarris did.\n\n\u201cThe total sentence is therefore one of 5 years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless released earlier, you will serve half that sentence when you will be released on licence for the remainder of the sentence.\u201d\n\nA few moments later, with a few loose ends tied up: \"You may take him down,\" Mr Justice Sweeney told the court officers in the dock with Harris.\n\nHarris stood, buttoned up his coat and left the room.\n\nThe energy in the room dissipated. After all we had heard over two harrowing months, Rolf Harris would spend a few years in prison. No more, no less.\n\nThis was a song without a punchline. Just a fading out to silence.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "World", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "After two months of lead-up, it was a moment of anticlimax.", "title": "The final act of Rolf Harris' harrowing courtroom drama", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/world/the-final-act-of-rolf-harris-harrowing-courtroom-drama-20140705-zsxbi.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/b/e/5/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsxbi.png/1404562234100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/b/e/5/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsxbi.png/1404562234100.jpg"}, "title": "The final act of Rolf Harris' harrowing courtroom drama", "description": "After two months of lead-up, it was a moment of anticlimax.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "After two months of lead-up, it was a moment of anticlimax."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4fc\"", "article_summary": "After all we had heard over two harrowing months, Rolf Harris would spend a few years in prison.\nIt was a useful reminder: Rolf Harris might be an entertainer, but this has not been a show.\n\u201cWhat Rolf Harris took from me was my self belief and more so the ability to feel safe\u2026 What Mr Harris took from me was my very essence.\u201dThe court was silent.\nRolf Harris arrives for sentencing with his daughter Bindi (left) and niece Jenny.\nMr Justice Sweeney had explained, matter of factly, that his hands were tied."}
