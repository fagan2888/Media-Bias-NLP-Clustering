New important federal investments have been made and numerous state and local initiatives have begun, yet millions of families continue to struggle with the skyrocketing high cost and pervasive low quality of child care and pre-K. As the nation looks toward its next slate of leaders in 2016, the Center for American Progress today launched the \u201cWithinReach\u201d campaign to elevate and create momentum around the need to put high-quality child care and pre-K within reach for kids, for families, and for the economy as part of the national debate.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s website, WithinReachCampaign.org, features a sign-on letter to urge candidates and policymakers to prioritize early childhood; an interactive map showing how out of reach child care and pre-K are in every U.S. state; a video; an action toolkit; a guide to engage candidates; click-to-share graphics for social media; and news and updates.\n\n\u201cFor two-thirds of children under age 6 in the United States, all parents work. When high-quality child care and pre-K are out of reach, families are forced to make impossible choices: working long hours away from their family to pay for child care or dropping out of the workforce. Supporting access to affordable, high-quality child care and pre-K would ease the middle-class squeeze for millions of working families,\u201d said Neera Tanden, President of CAP. \u201cGreater access also levels the playing field for kids and families by improving children\u2019s health and social outcomes. The WithinReach campaign will help ensure that these issues are a priority in the coming year.\u201d\n\nHigh-quality early education prepares children for school, gives families a fair shot to make ends meet and get ahead, and allows parents to participate more fully in the workforce, thereby strengthening the U.S. economy. But skyrocketing costs are putting child care and preschool out of reach for millions of hard-working Americans, leaving families struggling to choose between their paycheck and their child\u2019s care. In the 12-year period from 2000 to 2012, child care costs for a typical middle-class family grew $2,300. In its 2014 report \u201cThe Middle-Class Squeeze,\u201d CAP detailed the economic pressures felt by working- and middle-class families as a result of the growing costs of child care and other early childhood programs and supports.\n\nEarlier this year, CAP released a new proposal that would provide a High-Quality Child Care Tax Credit to help low-income and middle-class families afford child care. The proposal would expand child care access to roughly 6 million children under age 5 in the United States, increasing the current service level more than fourfold while supporting financial security for working families. In 2013, CAP released a proposal to make high-quality preschool universally accessible to all 3- and 4-year-old children\u2014legislation that has since been introduced in Congress as the Strong Start for America\u2019s Children Act.\n\nThe Center for American Progress will host Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) at today\u2019s campaign launch. Business, economic, and labor leaders will offer their views on a panel to follow, offering diverse voices to the campaign to make access to early childhood education a reality for millions of families.
