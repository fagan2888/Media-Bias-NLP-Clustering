The page is entitled "What do incarcerated people need to know about the Marketplace?" Only those serving sentences upon conviction are considered incarcerated for purposes of the Marketplace, not those locked up pending disposition of charges. Those on probation, on parole, or in home confinement are not included either. The medical care of incarcerated individuals is provided by the government institution in whose custody those individuals are held, so Medicaid and private insurance are unnecessary. But those seeking information about Medicaid at Healthcare.gov are encouraged to get a step ahead in preparation for eventual release, as the following partial screenshot shows:

Additional information is provided as well:

Although the incarcerated may not use the Marketplace to buy private insurance, they have 60 days upon release to purchase a plan, even if the time falls outside the normal open enrollment period.

Those held on charges but not yet convicted may use the Marketplace for private insurance.

The incarcerated are not subject to the individual mandate and will not have to pay the penalty that "some others without insurance must pay beginning in 2014."
