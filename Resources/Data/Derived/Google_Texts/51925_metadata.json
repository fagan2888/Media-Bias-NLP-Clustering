But the highest risk of repeal comes in the fifth Congress after a law is passed.\n\nIn this Oct. 5, 2011, file photo, then-Sen. Jim DeMint (R) of South Carolina (c.) joins other conservative lawmakers to call for the repeal of President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called 'Obamacare,' during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take them long, did it?\n\nJust a few days into the 114th Congress, Republicans in the House passed not one, but two bills to undo elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat follows is the first of two posts about the effort to \u201crepeal Obamacare.\u201d For today, I\u2019ll address two big picture elements of these repeal efforts. Next week\u2019s post will tackle some finer questions, looking in particular whether Republicans are likely to succeed in repealing Obamacare.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about health-care reform? Take our quiz!\n\nWhat follows is based on two papers I\u2019ve written on the topic of policy repeal. See for example this paper published in the journal American Politics Research. In brief, for this project I dug through various historical documents and created a dataset of all major repeals since the late 1800s. With this data, I developed a statistical model that examines when and why repeal happens.\n\nRepublicans are serious this time\n\nI first want to suggest that, this time around, Republicans are \u201cserious\u201d about repealing Obamacare. I also want to use last week\u2019s votes to put repeals in historical context.\n\nRecall that, in the 113th Congress, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed more than 50 measures to undo Obamacare. Most of these votes were on bills designed to repeal all or most of the law. Notably, this isn\u2019t how laws are usually undone.\n\nFirst, the word \u201crepeal\u201d is synonymous with various actions: defunding, invalidation by the courts, sunset provisions, amending activity, etc. All are tied to a broader topic, \u201cpolicy change,\u201d but are technically different actions.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s quite rare for a law to be repealed in its entirety. I found in the course of my research that this is true throughout history, but especially true today given the increasing complexity of legislation. Rather, individual provisions (often, a tiny fraction of a bill) are modified or repealed.\n\nFor example, in 1988 Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act and, just a year later, repealed major elements of it. Observers remember this landmark law as one of the \u201cshortest-lived pieces of social legislation\u201d (see Eric Patashnik\u2019s excellent book \u201cReforms at Risk,\u201d pg. 74). But even in this extreme case, some elements of the MCCA remained in place after those repeals were adopted.\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is that, even if Republicans are successful in their repeals efforts, it\u2019s likely that major elements of Obamacare will remain in place. Indeed, some aspects of the law are incredibly popular.\n\nNow, in the 113th Congress, because Democrats controlled the Senate, Republicans knew their chances of repealing the entire Affordable Care Act were almost exactly zero. Voting to repeal the whole bill wasn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d attempt but was, instead, an act of what political scientists call \u201cposition-taking.\u201d Note: that\u2019s not a criticism. In some ways, you could argue the whole repeal drama in 113th Congress was a \u201cgood thing\u201d because it gave voters a clear choice between two policy alternatives (i.e. voters knew what the two parties would do if given control of the House and Senate).\n\nHere\u2019s the point: What happened in the first few days of the 114th Congress was something qualitatively different than what happened in the 113th Congress. On the surface, you would think that, after winning control of the Senate in rather dramatic fashion, Republicans would once again advance a bill to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. But again, that\u2019s not how laws are usually undone.\n\nInstead, Republicans advanced two piecemeal bills that target specific provisions of the act. Ergo, they\u2019re going about it in a very calculated manner this time around (contrary to the wishes of some hardliners, who see this piecemeal approach as increasing the law\u2019s strength). On Tuesday, the House passed a bill to exempt Veterans from what counts towards businesses\u2019 employee limit. It passed 412-0. And on Thursday, the House passed a bill that changes a provision defining the work requirement regarding what\u2019s considered \u201cfull time\u201d employment. It passed 252-172.\n\nAs a whole, don\u2019t be surprised to see Republicans succeed in the 114th Congress modifying or even repealing some elements of the Affordable Care Act this session. In fact, I think it\u2019s an inevitability.\n\nThe likelihood of repeal will Increase in the 115th and 116th Congresses\n\nIn next week\u2019s post, I\u2019ll examine specific factors that affect the probability of repeal. However, policy repeal has a broader pattern. Here\u2019s a chart with what you need to know:\n\nThe chart (from this paper) is the hazard of repeal after passage for all landmark laws enacted since the 1950s. Higher values indicate a greater likelihood of repeal in a subsequent Congress while lower values indicate a lower likelihood of repeal.\n\nWhat the figure shows is that repeals become increasingly likely up to five subsequent Congresses (or 10 years) after a law is enacted. We can see that the \u201cpeak\u201d in the likelihood of repeal is in the fifth Congress after passage. After this 10-year window, repeals become increasingly less likely for the reminder of a policy\u2019s lifecycle. After about 20 Congresses have passed (or, 40 years), repeals have just a 4 percent chance of happening.\n\nNow, because this is the 114th Congress, we\u2019re at just three Congresses since the law was enacted. Big picture: the probability of some repeal has indeed increased in the 114th Congress, but we\u2019re still two Congresses (or, four years) from when the law will be most \u201cat risk.\u201d (Note: This is based on the general pattern of repeal. Specific factors will vary.)\n\nCertainly, that\u2019s bad news for Democrats (i.e. the worst isn\u2019t here yet). However, the good news for Democrats is that if the law survives for the next decade (for example, if Hillary Clinton wins election in 2016), the probability of repeal begins to drop off precipitously.\n\nWhy does this regular pattern exist? In the first part of a policy\u2019s lifecycle, soon after it was signed by the president, when major elements or the law are being implemented for the first time, flaws begin to develop such that the original law needs to be revisited. In other words, it\u2019s normal for lawmakers to revisit legislation after they observe its real world performance. After the 10-year period, however, laws become \u201cinstitutionalized\u201d such that modification or repeal is difficult to accomplish. Consider entitlement programs (like the Affordable Care Act). It\u2019s hard to repeal a policy that provides groups of citizens with some material benefit.\n\nJordan Ragusa publishes his Rule 22 blog at http://rule22.wordpress.com/.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "ae6d947fd75837a1ee3ea44a26c0fd67", "sailthru.author": "Jordan Ragusa", "description": "The probability of some repeal of Obamacare has increased in the 114th Congress, based on the repeal record of all landmark laws enacted since the 1950s.
