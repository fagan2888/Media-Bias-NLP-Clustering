“Star Wars” and “Hamilton” fans had their collective minds blown Monday night when “Force Awakens” director J.J. Abrams revealed to Jimmy Fallon that he and Lin-Manuel Miranda have written brand-new music for the film’s upcoming “Cantina” scene.

Tony-winning actor-composer-lyricist-rapper Miranda is the brains behind the runaway Broadway hit — he wrote the musical and stars as Alexander Hamilton.

As Abrams told the story while visiting “The Tonight Show,” Miranda had come up to him during intermission the night the director had gone to see “Hamilton” — Miranda wasn’t performing that evening — and joked, “Hey, if you need music for the Cantina, I’ll write it!”

But what Miranda didn’t realize was that Abrams did indeed have an updated Cantina scene for the new movie: “I’m like, ‘Does he know?’” And as luck would have it, Abrams further revealed that “Star Wars” and original Cantina theme composer John Williams had respectfully requested that he not write new music for the scene in question so he could focus on the score. The best part of this anecdote is learning that Williams calls Abrams “J.J. baby.”

So Abrams e-mailed Miranda, and asked if he would write the new Cantina music for real.

Miranda’s response? “I’ll drop everything!”

“We’ve never discussed this before,” said Abrams. “He might kill me for revealing this.”

Judging from Miranda’s confirmation tweet, it’s safe to say Abrams will live long enough to see the film’s premiere on Dec. 18.

We did. Worked on it between 6pm & 7:30 on 2 show days for the past 2 months. JJ is the best. Can't wait to see. https://t.co/pPYu8nRsxI — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 1, 2015
