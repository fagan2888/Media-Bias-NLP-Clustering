A study out Wednesday from UC Berkeley researchers disputes that view, finding that 21 popular beverages have high sugar content and other additives including caffeine and sodium, which may be harmful to children and teens.\n\n\u201cAll of these beverages that are marketed to kids and teens \u2026 as if they\u2019re healthy, are just packed with sugar,\u201d said Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy which commissioned the study.\n\nIn the report researchers at UC Berkeley\u2019s Atkins Center of Weight and Health looked not only at sugar and caffeine in these 21 beverages but also scrutinized additives such as guarana, ginseng, taurine, gingko biloba and ginger extract.\n\nDr. Patricia Crawford, the study\u2019s lead author, said of all these additives, only ginger extract is classified as \u201clikely safe\u201d by the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. She called it \u201ctroubling\u201d that the other additives have not been widely studied in children and teens, yet are added to these drinks.\n\nCrawford also expressed concern about the amount of caffeine in some of the beverages. Guarana is a plant that contains caffeine and is used as an energy supplement. It\u2019s hard for people to know how much caffeine they might be consuming, Crawford said.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly there are reports about children drinking too much caffeine and being admitted to emergency rooms for heart palpitation and problems they didn\u2019t associate with the beverages,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nChristopher Gindlesperger, a spokesman with the American Beverage Association, called the study \u201cspin and attempted fear mongering from a group that is aggressively advocating to impose taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages in California.\u201d The California Center for Public Health Advocacy sponsored a statewide soda tax bill last year in the California legislature. It died in committee. Gindlesperger said the industry goes \u201cabove and beyond what is required when it comes to labeling and information\u201d and referred me to two websites.\n\nGoldstein says that sports beverages were meant for athletes working out for an hour \u2014 and sweating \u2014 in the hot sun. \u201cThat is not most of who is drinking sports drinks,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of (those) drinking sports drinks are people who are \u2014 more than anything \u2014 drawn to the marketing of these products, who have been convinced they need to replace their electrolytes.\u201d\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation surveyed the evidence and reported last year that children and teens should drink water or milk that is either low-fat or nonfat.\n\n\u201cThe big message of this study,\u201d Goldstein said, \u201cis our kids and our teens should not be drinking sports drinks, energy drinks, vitamin water, even though the beverage industry is trying so hard to convince people that these are healthier products, they\u2019re really nothing other than a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated to clarify CCPHA\u2019s role as an advocate for soda taxes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sports and energy drinks often contain high amounts of sugar and caffeine.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"UC Berkeley Study: Sports, Energy Drinks as Unhealthy as Soda\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/06\\/sports-energy-drinks-as-unhealthful-as-soda-study-says\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-06 01:08:55\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-07 15:42:32\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20563,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Soda\",\"Sugar-Sweetend Beverages\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/13556198874_fdf70c448e_z.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Sports and energy drinks often contain high amounts of sugar and caffeine.", "title": "UC Berkeley Study: Sports, Energy Drinks as Unhealthy as Soda", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/06/sports-energy-drinks-as-unhealthful-as-soda-study-says/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/13556198874_fdf70c448e_z.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "soda,sugar-sweetend beverages", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2f6\"", "article_summary": "Because of their very name, sports and energy drinks are often viewed by consumers as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened sodas.\nA study out Wednesday from UC Berkeley researchers disputes that view, finding that 21 popular beverages have high sugar content and other additives including caffeine and sodium, which may be harmful to children and teens.\nShe called it \u201ctroubling\u201d that the other additives have not been widely studied in children and teens, yet are added to these drinks.\n\u201cThat is not most of who is drinking sports drinks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIncreasingly there are reports about children drinking too much caffeine and being admitted to emergency rooms for heart palpitation and problems they didn\u2019t associate with the beverages,\u201d Crawford said."}
