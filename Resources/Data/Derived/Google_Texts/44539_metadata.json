Bonds played in 20 postseason games with the Pirates -- six against Cincinnati and 14 against Atlanta -- and batted .191.

In eight playoff games, the 2013-15 Pirates averaged 2.6 runs.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe disappointment of Gerrit Cole\u2019s performance in the 4-0 loss to Chicago Wednesday was increased by the way John Lackey, not considered on Cole\u2019s level, handled the Cubs last night. In 7\u2153 innings, Lackey held the Cubs to no runs, two hits and one walk while striking out five.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIf you can find it on The Fan\u2019s website, check out the interview with John Wehner yesterday on the Cook and Poni Show. At the end of the interview, Wehner had surprisingly strong negative words about the Pirates, unusual for a team employee. He cited a lack of urgency early in the season, both in fundamentals and running out batted balls and blamed that for the team\u2019s poor start. He also said the lack or urgency carried out through much of the season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Final thoughts on the Pirates one-game postseason.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Final thoughts on the Pirates one-game postseason: Barry Bonds is reviled in Pittsburgh for many reasons and one of them is his failure to deliver in the postseasons of 1990-92 when the Pirates lost three times in the League Division Series.
