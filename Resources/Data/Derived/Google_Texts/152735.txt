WASHINGTON (AP) — The Newseum in Washington is planning a special program to remember legendary Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, who died this week.

The museum about news and the First Amendment is planning a remembrance Sunday afternoon to discuss Bradlee’s historic role in stories ranging from the Watergate scandal to the Pentagon Papers. The program will feature former Post editors Leonard Downie Jr., Shelby Coffey III, Mary Hadar and George Solomon.

The “Inside Media” program is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sunday and is free with museum admission.

The Newseum is also highlighting some of its artifacts this week that relate to Bradlee, including one of his press passes and the door from the Watergate break-in and stories from the News History Gallery.

Bradlee died Tuesday. He was 93.
