Ben\u2019s a doctor and he\u2019s not a dealmaker.... I think I have been a world-class businessman \u2026 and I make deals and I\u2019ll bring back jobs and I\u2019ll also bring back wealth to our country and I\u2019ll build up our military so that nobody is going to mess with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Ben is not a dealmaker at all, and I don't think would be a very good \u2014 I don't think that's his natural ability at all,\u201d Trump added for good measure.\n\nThe surprising frontrunners in the GOP race have been sniping at each other for days. Carson last week questioned Trump\u2019s religious faith and integrity, and later apologized for going too far. Trump had lumped Carson in with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in saying he lacks the \u201cenergy\u201d to become the next president. But while trying not to rise to Trump\u2019s bait, Carson said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program today that \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be loud to be energetic.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s assertions that he doesn\u2019t have the smarts and \u201cgreat, great energy\u201d needed to negotiate big deals with China and other world powers, Carson said today, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me because I recognize that I have plenty of energy \u2014 operating on people for 10, 12, sometimes greater than 20 hours at a time and making critical decisions after hours of intense work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump and Cruz Put GOP Leaders on Notice\n\nCarson also obliquely suggested that Trump lacks the temperament to be president \u201cbecause you have to be humble enough to listen to other people.\u201d And he repeated his criticism of Trump\u2019s call for a mass deportation of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in this country, saying that the logistics of that would be difficult.\n\nAsked later on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d whether Trump was \u201chumble enough\u201d to be president, Carson demurred, saying \u201cThat will be a decision that the voters will make.\u201d\n\nThere was a time when the Republican presidential candidates were content to blow their own horns and lash out at Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and President Obama. But that is rapidly changing as a slew of Republican aspirants \u2014 including Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 are seeing their prospects slip away as Trump continues to surge in just about every national and state poll.\n\nRelated: The 2016 Presidential Primary Carnival Rages On\n\nA new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released on Sunday shows Trump leading the GOP field in each of the early primary and caucus states \u2014 and holding an especially large lead in New Hampshire.\n\nIn Iowa, Trump leads with 29 percent of likely GOP caucus-goers while Carson is second with 25 percent and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is third with 10 percent, according to the CBS poll. In New Hampshire, Trump dominates with 40 percent of the likely Republican primary vote, while Carson is a distant second with 12 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich comes in third at 9 percent. Finally, in South Carolina, Trump and Carson are locked in a two-man race, with Trump garnering 36 percent of the Republican vote and Carson 21 percent.\n\nPriebus, the Republican National Committee Chairman, on Sunday again cautioned the real estate tycoon, Carson and the rest of the GOP presidential field to be careful of the tone and intensity of their remarks. With Clinton badly sinking in the polls and doing poorly in hypothetical matchups with Trump, Carson and others, the GOP is \u201cin a great place\u201d to win the 2016 presidential election \u2014 provided Republican candidates don\u2019t blow it by saying something that comes back to haunt them, Priebus said today.\n\n\u201cLook, I think that at the end of the day each candidate is going to be accountable for their own words and their own mouths and so they should proceed with caution,\u201d Priebus told Jake Tapper of CNN, which will be broadcasting the second GOP debate on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Trump Says CNN Should Donate Debate Profits to Vets\n\nTrump, though, appears to have no interest in letting up on Carson, just as he relentlessly lambasted Bush, and candidates lagging in the polls have sharpened their attacks on the frontrunner.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared this week that, \u201cTrump is a narcissist and an egomaniac.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who like Jindal is badly trailing in the polls, told reporters after a Iowa State student town hall on Friday that the rest of the Republican field should \u201cquit being shy\u201d about criticizing Trump, according to media reports.\n\nFor his part, Carson said today that he has no interest in engaging in a \u201cgladiator\u201d fight with Trump, and apologized again for having questioned Trump\u2019s religious convictions.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite Republican national party leader Reince Priebus's\u00a0ever so gentle", "title": "The Trump Insult-athon\u2019s Latest Target: Ben Carson", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/13/Trump-Insult-athon-s-Latest-Target-Ben-Carson", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-carson_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/13/Trump-Insult-athon-s-Latest-Target-Ben-Carson", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-carson_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite Republican national party leader Reince Priebus's\u00a0ever so gentle", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Finally, in South Carolina, Trump and Carson are locked in a two-man race, with Trump garnering 36 percent of the Republican vote and Carson 21 percent.\nCarson last week questioned Trump\u2019s religious faith and integrity, and later apologized for going too far.\nIn New Hampshire, Trump dominates with 40 percent of the likely Republican primary vote, while Carson is a distant second with 12 percent and Ohio Gov.\nFor his part, Carson said today that he has no interest in engaging in a \u201cgladiator\u201d fight with Trump, and apologized again for having questioned Trump\u2019s religious convictions.\nTrump had lumped Carson in with former Florida Gov."}
