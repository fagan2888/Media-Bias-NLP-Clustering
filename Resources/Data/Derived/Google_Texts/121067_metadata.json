The tweets included a link to a petition that begged all who clicked to \u201cStop Obama\u2019s BATF Ammo Ban! Add Your Name.\u201d\n\nBeneath an unflattering photo of President Obama was a letter from Paul himself. \u201cPresident Obama is determined to cement his anti-gun agenda into law. Recently, Obama\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF) announced they will ban .223 M855 ammunition ...And I\u2019m counting on your immediate action to help RANDPAC flood the agency with a message from America\u2019s pro-gun majority.\u201d\n\nIn order to sign the petition, users were asked to provide their first name, last name, email address, and ZIP code.\n\n\u201cAfter you submit your petition, please help me contact and mobilize as many pro-gun Americans as possible by chipping in a generous contribution of $20 or $10 today.\u201d\n\nThe petition, paid for by the Kentucky senator\u2019s political action committee, RANDPAC, felt oddly familiar.\n\nIndeed, urgent Twitter appeals for cash to help roll back the Obama agenda have been a constant presence across Paul\u2019s social media accounts for weeks.\n\nOn February 20, he was begging people to sign a petition to \u201c#AuditTheFed.\u201d\n\nOn February 24, he was urging supporters to help defund \u201c#ExecutiveAmnesty.\u201d\n\nOn March 5, he was soliciting signatures to \u201c#RepealObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear Dr. Paul, I agree !\u201d the latter petition read. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying the American people overwhelmingly rejected ObamaCare in November 2014. To help you fight for the FULL REPEAL of ObamaCare, I am signing and submitting my REPEAL OBAMACARE petition to my U.S. Representative and Senators.\u201d\n\nAfter 24 hours of incessantly promoting the petition, Paul tweeted: \u201cWe reached our goal with over 1200 signatures! Your pressure is vital in the fight to #RepealObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe petitions, according to RANDPAC, will be sent \u201cto the Capitol Hill offices of your U.S. Representative and Senators\u201d to help convince them to support auditing the fed, or defunding executive amnesty, or repealing Obamacare, or \u201c#StopObamasAmmoBan.\u201d Never mind that none of these proposals have any chance of passing Congress this year.\n\nThey\u2019re not really about the Congress\u2019s legislative agenda. They\u2019re about Paul\u2019s political future.\n\nThe senator is in the awkward position of running for president without being able to explicitly say, \u201cI\u2019m running for president.\u201d Rather than just a means of alerting Paul\u2019s fellow senators that conservatives support his ideas, the petitions appear to be a clever way to collect the personal information of potential donors who are active on the Internet and can eventually help propel a digital grassroots movement for Paul when he formally announces his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nYes, your congressman\u2019s office might get a notification of some kind (Paul\u2019s staff didn\u2019t answer a question about whether it would be a physical document or an email) that says you don\u2019t like Obama messing with your ammo, but more important for Paul, the senator is going to use that email address you provided to hit you up for cash as soon as his campaign starts and perhaps entice you into volunteering for the effort.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

So please sign your \u201cStand with Rand\u00ae\u201d Directive right away!\n\nAnd after you sign your pledge, please chip in a contribution so RANDPAC can mobilize constitutional conservatives across America to help our movement win in 2015 and beyond.\n\nIn Liberty,\n\nRand Paul\n\n\u201cAnd beyond.\u201d Wonder what that could mean.\n\nAsked if the petitions are just an excuse to get the private information of supporters so that they can be asked for money once the campaign gets moving, Doug Stafford, a senior Paul aide, responded via email: \u201cIt enables us to engage people specifically on an issue. It allows us to know what issue they care about so that we can send them news and updates on this issue. And yes, it helps us build a list of people who agree with and support Senator Paul on specific issues.\u201d\n\nThe petitions, which are hardly uncommon, especially on the right, seem disingenuous. After all, writing a check to Paul\u2019s PAC isn\u2019t going to help convince Congress to pass an audit-the-Fed bill. But someone reading the Paul petition might come to the mistaken conclusion that there\u2019s some connection between the two.\n\nTo that point, Stafford claimed that public support moves policy in Washington while also acknowledging that despite the majority of the population supporting auditing the Fed, it has never happened: \u201cActually it does often take public support to move things in Washington. 75 percent of Americans supported an Audit the Fed bill last Congress, but the bill wasn\u2019t even voted in the Senate.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt often takes more than theoretical support. It takes action.\u201d Petitions, he said, are action.\n\nThis form of voter-information-gathering, which occasionally has the whiff of a scam, is familiar to Paul. His father, former congressman and two-time presidential candidate Ron Paul, became a pioneer of direct mail and grassroots fundraising after he entered politics in the mid-1970s. In between stints in Congress, he ran a lucrative newsletter business targeting conservatives that reportedly earned $940,000 in one year in the early 1990s.\n\nMore recently, while running for president in 2007, the elder Paul raised $6 million in a 24-hour period in one of his famous \u201cmoneybombs.\u201d (In all he raised an impressive $34 million in that campaign.) In his 2010 Senate campaign, Rand Paul mimicked his father\u2019s fundraising tactics and dipped into his father\u2019s base of supporters. He held his own \u201cmoneybomb\u201d and in the end outraised his better-known Democratic opponent by $2 million.\n\nBut Paul isn\u2019t the only likely Republican 2016 candidate sneakily obtaining his supporters\u2019 personal information.\n\nAt CPAC, the right-wing Comic-Con where speakers address a different crowd than on Twitter, Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, made an odd request of the crowd. \u201cTo turn this country around, it will not come from Washington, it will come from the American people,\u201d he yelled. \u201cAnd so I will ask every one of you if you will join our grassroots army.
