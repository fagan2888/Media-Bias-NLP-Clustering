Dan Landsman (Black) thinks wooing this Hollywood star back to their high school would make him the hero of the reunion.\n\nAs Landsman, Black dupes his boss, lies to his wife and ignores his son to gain favor with the handsome actor.\n\nBlack\u2019s performance is heartfelt and heartbreaking. Marsden is on point as a self-absorbed actor. But this flawed comedy comes with a strong undercurrent of sexism and homophobia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First Look: Jack Black is brave, heartbreaking in \u2018D Train\u2019", "author": "Sandy Cohen", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "First Look: Jack Black is brave, heartbreaking in \u2018D Train\u2019", "title": "First Look: Jack Black is brave, heartbreaking in \u2018D Train\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/24/first_look_jack_black_is_brave_heartbreaking_in_d_train/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/2015-sundance-film-festival-quotthe-d-trainquot-premiere.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First Look: Jack Black is brave, heartbreaking in \u2018D Train\u2019", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/2015-sundance-film-festival-quotthe-d-trainquot-premiere.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "First Look: Jack Black is brave, heartbreaking in \u2018D Train\u2019", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "First Look: Jack Black is brave, heartbreaking in \u2018D Train\u2019", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde767\"", "article_summary": "Dan Landsman (Black) thinks wooing this Hollywood star back to their high school would make him the hero of the reunion.\nAs Landsman, Black dupes his boss, lies to his wife and ignores his son to gain favor with the handsome actor.\nBut this flawed comedy comes with a strong undercurrent of sexism and homophobia.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Jack Black said he was drawn to \u2018The D Train\u2019 because he recognized the desperation of the character he plays: An outcast willing to do anything to get the most popular kid from his graduating class to attend their 20th high school reunion.\nMarsden is on point as a self-absorbed actor."}
