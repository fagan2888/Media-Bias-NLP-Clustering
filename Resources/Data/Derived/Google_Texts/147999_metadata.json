Bush is a former two-term governor of Florida, and Kasich is serving his second term as Ohio\u2019s governor. Kasich is 63, while Bush\u2019s 63rd birthday is on Thursday.\n\nThe two share similar views on several issues, including repealing the Affordable Care Act while maintaining select policies within it, and being in the minority of Republican candidates in acknowledging climate change and humans having some role in it. The two even seemed to be friendly during Saturday night\u2019s debate while other candidates attacked each other.\n\nThe two are considered more moderate compared with the other contenders in the Republican race, and are the alternatives to the more radical front-runners. And, both have spent most of their time campaigning in New Hampshire, pinning their hopes on a strong finish at the polls when voting takes place here on Tuesday after lackluster finishes in Iowa.\n\nHowever, in the town hall setting, the two show markedly different styles. Kasich, who as of Sunday night has held 102 town hall meetings, is more relaxed, often weaving in personal stories before addressing a question and reflecting on the world as a whole. Meanwhile, Bush focuses on the issues and the politics of the race.\n\nHis answers are often dry and full of policy details, with the occasional personal story to bolster his point, with varying degrees of success.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason this year, policy doesn\u2019t have the same consequence as it should,\u201d Bush said Sunday morning at a town hall in Salem, New Hampshire. \u201cBut we have laid out the most detailed plans across the spectrum of policy because I believe ideas have consequences and policy matters.\u201d\n\nBush often repeats the words \u201cbackbone,\u201d and \u201cleadership\u201d in addressing his audience, emphasizing that he\u2019ll be a problem solver as opposed to all talk. In addition, he tends to use dry language. Bush has used phrases like \u201cI\u2019m a 10th amendment guy\u201d multiple times, and refers to how many line item vetoes he recorded as Florida governor.\n\nKasich, meanwhile, takes his time before getting into policy. At his event here on Sunday, the Ohio governor didn\u2019t give a typical stump speech, but instead paced around the floor of the high school cafeteria and spoke about how humans are all connected and should want to work together for a common good. He talked about his parents and when he learned they had died in a car crash. Only the last five minutes of his 15-minute speech mentioned his qualifications and accomplishments.\n\nHe took questions from the audience about Social Security and national security. In both responses, Kasich briefly mentioned details about how he\u2019d address each issue, but focused more on a general message of politicians working together to get things done. In addition, he\u2019d share personal stories before getting into his answer, asking questions of the audience and impersonating Arnold Schwarzenegger and Henry Kissinger at various times on Sunday.\n\nThe candidate gave more specifics on a question about illegal immigration, where he and Bush agree on giving those here illegally a path to legalization that involves paying fines and getting a job.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another key difference between the two, one that has become Kasich\u2019s calling card: The Ohio governor has refused to attack his opponents in the way that almost every other candidate has.\n\nOne woman, before asking her question, thanked Kasich for his positivity and focusing on his issues rather than other candidates.\n\n\u201cBefore you get to your question, I just want to say, look\u2026 why doesn\u2019t everybody take down their negative ads and tell people what we\u2019re for, for the last 24 hours?\u201d Kasih said.\n\nIn his speech that he gives at every event, Bush calls out Donald Trump and Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz by name, saying they\u2019re gifted speakers but unfit to lead.\n\nOn Sunday, he called Donald Trump a loser, earning a standing ovation at his town hall in Nashua, New Hampshire. Kasich\u2019s name was even mentioned on Sunday at a Bush town hall.\n\n\u201cJohn Kasich is good man who doesn\u2019t understand the world we\u2019re in,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham while introducing Bush, adding that Kasich is a good friend, but that he disagrees with the Ohio governor\u2019s stance on closing military bases.\n\nBoth candidates seem to have gained momentum heading into Tuesday\u2019s vote. Bush has drawn a few hundred voters to each of his town hall events since his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, joined him in Derry, New Hampshire, on Thursday night. Kasich\u2019s long-term effort has given voters plenty of chances to hear him speak, and both benefitted from stronger-than-usual performances in Saturday\u2019s debate.\n\nBush will make a final push with voters during a luncheon on Monday afternoon and a final town hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Monday night.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "CONCORD, N.H. \u2014 In a fight to remain relevant in the crowded field of Republican\u00a0presidential primary candidates, Jeb Bush finds himself neck-and-neck in m", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "Kasich\u2019s name was even mentioned on Sunday at a Bush town hall.\nBush has drawn a few hundred voters to each of his town hall events since his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, joined him in Derry, New Hampshire, on Thursday night.\nBush is a former two-term governor of Florida, and Kasich is serving his second term as Ohio\u2019s governor.\nBush will make a final push with voters during a luncheon on Monday afternoon and a final town hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Monday night.\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 In a fight to remain relevant in the crowded field of Republican presidential primary candidates, Jeb Bush finds himself neck-and-neck in most polls with Ohio Governor John Kasich."}
