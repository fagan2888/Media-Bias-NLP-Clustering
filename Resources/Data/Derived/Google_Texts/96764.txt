ASPEN — Citing new evidence that came to light late last week, the 9th Judicial District attorney’s office has dropped criminal charges against Nancy Styler, one of three people arrested in the killing of Aspen native Nancy Pfister.

Authorities arrested Nancy Styler, 62, and her husband, William Styler, 66, at the Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt on March 3. Both have been held in separate jails, without bail, since their arrests. The Front Range couple were charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and accessory after the fact to murder in connection with Pfister’s death. An Aspen resident, Katherine Carpenter, 56, was arrested March 14 and faces the same charges.

Reached for comment late Tuesday afternoon, prosecutor Andrea Bryan would not discuss the new evidence that led to the dismissal of charges against Nancy Styler.

“With the new information received and a lack of other evidence refuting the new information, the district attorney could not prove that Ms. Styler was involved in the crimes,” a statement from District Attorney Sherry Caloia said. “She will be released from jail immediately.”
