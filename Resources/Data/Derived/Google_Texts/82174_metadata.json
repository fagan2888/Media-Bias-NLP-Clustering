Indeed, while officials scramble to address technical problems as quickly as possible, new concerns continue to come to light\n\nThe system\u2019s defenders, however, are not without compelling responses. It is, for example, still early, and plenty of similar troubles have plagued similar systems in years past. It\u2019s also true that the system would be running far smoother if fewer Republican governors hadn\u2019t refused to create state marketplaces of their own. What\u2019s more, the problems have been technical, not structural \u2013 the computer difficulties don\u2019t detract from the merits of the underlying law.\n\nBut as Jonathan Cohn noted this morning, to \u201cfully appreciate what\u2019s happening, you need a split screen.\u201d While the federally-run marketplace has been overwhelmed, there are ample state-based success stories natonwide.\n\nTake Oregon , for example.\n\nThough Oregon\u2019s health insurance exchange is not yet up and running, the number of uninsured is already dropping thanks to new fast-track enrollment for the Oregon Health Plan. The low-income, Medicaid-funded program has already signed up 56,000 new people, cutting the state\u2019s number of uninsured by 10 percent, according to Oregon Health Authority officials.\n\nJust to be clear, the progress is not the result of a better online exchange. On the contrary, Oregon\u2019s website doesn\u2019t work yet. Rather, state officials created a fast-track registration process, approved by the Obama administration, that\u2019s quickly expanding coverage through Medicaid expansion.\n\nSarah Kliff explained that Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber (D) is \u201cobsessed\u201d with the issue, and his administration specifically targeted uninsured residents. The \u201cwave of notices targeting the exact people who are supposed to qualify for Obamacare\u2019s benefits in the first place\u201d has made a real difference.\n\nThe larger takeaway reinforces a couple of important truths. First, Medicaid expansion, rejected by far too many far-right governors, is a powerful tool in quickly reducing the number of uninsured Americans. For many \u201cred\u201d states to deliberately turn down these resources is a tragedy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "When state officials want \"Obamacare\" to work, it can quite well.
