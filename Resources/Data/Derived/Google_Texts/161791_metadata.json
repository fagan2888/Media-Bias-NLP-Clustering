After a particularly brutal spate of deaths last year, Mayor Boris Johnson drew the ire of cyclists when he insisted \u201cthere\u2019s no amount of traffic engineering that we invest in that is going to save people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nActually, about $360 million of engineering should do it. That\u2019s according to plans for SkyCycle, a 137-mile network of elevated bike paths that would allow Londoners to pull a Mary Poppins by riding above the city\u2019s traffic. Unveiled this week by a team of architects including Lord Norman Foster (the guy who designed that giant egg-shaped building), the design is two years in the making and would take about 20 years to complete. The Guardian has more:\n\nThe project, which has the backing of Network Rail and Transport for London, would see over 220km of car-free routes installed above London\u2019s suburban rail network, suspended on pylons above the tracks and accessed at over 200 entrance points. At up to 15 metres wide, each of the ten routes would accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour and improve journey times by up to 29 minutes, according to the designers. Lord Foster, who says that cycling is one of his great passions, describes the plan as \u201ca lateral approach to finding space in a congested city.\u201d \u201cBy using the corridors above the suburban railways,\u201d he said, \u201cwe could create a world-class network of safe, car-free cycle routes that are ideally located for commuters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SkyCycle would allow commuters to bike high above London's traffic", "title": "Architects unveil plan for $360 million bike path in the sky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "SkyCycle would allow commuters to bike high above London's traffic", "title": "Architects unveil plan for $360 million bike path in the sky", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/02/architects_unveil_plan_for_3_6_million_bike_path_in_the_sky/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/skycycle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SkyCycle would allow commuters to bike high above London's traffic", "title": "Architects unveil plan for $360 million bike path in the sky", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/skycycle.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bikes, green transportation, infrastructure, London", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f7e\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s according to plans for SkyCycle, a 137-mile network of elevated bike paths that would allow Londoners to pull a Mary Poppins by riding above the city\u2019s traffic.\nThe Guardian has more:The project, which has the backing of Network Rail and Transport for London, would see over 220km of car-free routes installed above London\u2019s suburban rail network, suspended on pylons above the tracks and accessed at over 200 entrance points.\nTopics: bikes, green transportation, infrastructure, London, Sustainability News, Life NewsMore and more cities are investing in ways to get bikers on the road, but London has been particularly preoccupied with keeping them safe.\nUnveiled this week by a team of architects including Lord Norman Foster (the guy who designed that giant egg-shaped building), the design is two years in the making and would take about 20 years to complete.\nAt up to 15 metres wide, each of the ten routes would accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour and improve journey times by up to 29 minutes, according to the designers."}
