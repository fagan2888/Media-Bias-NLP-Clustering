Federal spending is going up this year, mostly due to increases in health spending, according to recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office.

The nonpartisan agency projects that mandatory federal outlays will rise by $168 billion in 2016 –– or 6 percent –– and that $104 billion of that will come from increased spending on Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and subsidies to those purchasing insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. That amounts to an 11 percent increase in federal health spending over the previous year.
