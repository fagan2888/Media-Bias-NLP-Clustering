Osmosis Skincare claims that their product, Harmonised H20 UV protection, can protect anyone from the sun up to factor 30. Sunscreen protection factor, also known as SPF, is a measure of how much UV radiation exposure is needed to burn the protected skin \u2014 not a measure of how much time a person can spend in the sun before getting burned.\n\nBen Johnson, M.D., an aesthetic medicine practitioner, says that while this product is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, it is still effective. Dr. Johnson did say that he tried to go to the FDA for approval, but since this is a skincare product, the process wasn\u2019t as seamless as he hoped it would be.\n\nHarmonised is a water-based, drinkable product that works using scalar wave technology to protect against the sun's rays. Scalar wave technology is a hollistic approach to healing using stationary or longitudinal waves. Dr. Johnson does note that when he first started formulating the product there were some setbacks, but insists that the product does work. \u201cThe first round was not effective,\" Dr. Johnson told Medical Daily. \"We found out that the product didn\u2019t work when the person went into salt water, so we went through early formulation changes... People are very skeptical of the product, but I\u2019m not going to recommend plain water to a bunch of my patients and then have them come back with sunburns.\"\n\nAccording Dr. Johnson\u2019 recommendations, the product should be ingested an hour before you head out into the sun \u2014 one and a half hours if you eat since the food will interact with the product. He also notes that exercising will have an effect on the product. \u201cThe higher your heart rate gets, the less this product will work,\u201d he said.\n\nThere have also been a number of internal trials done in his office, and he has been developing and working on this product for several years. \u201cOf course this stuff isn\u2019t flying off of the shelves, but we have thousands of people who have used this product and are completely satisfied. I even use this and so does my family.\u201d\n\nThe product will cost about $30 for 50 doses in a 100ml bottle. It comes in two forms: \"tanning\" and \"non tanning.\u201d Dr Johnson says that the tanning formula will give protection while still allowing for users to get a little bit of color. In the United States, the formulas for sunscreen have not been updated in 15 years, so products like this might be beneficial and useful for SPF protection.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "osmosis, drinkable sunscreen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A drinkable sunscreen claims to offer complete body protection up to SPF 30 for its users.", "title": "Would You Use Drinkable Sunscreen?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drinkable-sunscreen-uses-wave-technology-could-be-next-big-thing-complete-uv-ray-protection-283398", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/19/uvneutralizerh20-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A drinkable sunscreen claims to offer complete body protection up to SPF 30 for its users.", "title": "Would You Use Drinkable Sunscreen?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drinkable-sunscreen-uses-wave-technology-could-be-next-big-thing-complete-uv-ray-protection-283398", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/19/uvneutralizerh20-2.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/19/uvneutralizerh20-2.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-19T17:09:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-19T17:09:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A drinkable sunscreen claims to offer complete body protection up to SPF 30 for its users."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7b4\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Johnson does note that when he first started formulating the product there were some setbacks, but insists that the product does work.\nIt comes in two forms: \"tanning\" and \"non tanning.\u201d Dr Johnson says that the tanning formula will give protection while still allowing for users to get a little bit of color.\nOsmosis Skincare claims that their product, Harmonised H20 UV protection, can protect anyone from the sun up to factor 30.\n\u201cThe first round was not effective,\" Dr. Johnson told Medical Daily.\nSunscreen protection factor, also known as SPF, is a measure of how much UV radiation exposure is needed to burn the protected skin \u2014 not a measure of how much time a person can spend in the sun before getting burned."}
