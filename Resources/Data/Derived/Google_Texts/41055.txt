Malaysia Airlines can't seem to catch a break, as even Air France's nine-day old strike doesn't appear to be sending many passengers its way.

The gate agent was confident the flight would leave as scheduled the next day, saying it was only canceled because a pilot had called in sick and the substitute hadn't had enough rest between flights.

But I was skeptical, especially after standing in line for more than an hour with a mother-daughter pair faced with their third canceled flight in two days. An agent at the baggage claim said this was the current strike's first flight canceled at the last minute.
