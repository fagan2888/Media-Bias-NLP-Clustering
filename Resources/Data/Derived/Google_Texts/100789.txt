"It was an error by a graphic artist looking at design not content. The artist moved a name to make evenly spaced columns and didn't replace a name listed twice with a missing name.

In the past few days, a Grassley fundraising letter has appeared in Iowans’ mail boxes. It’s the typical fundraising letter we are used to seeing in Iowa. It’s as much about the presidential race as it is about Grassley’s re-election bid. The reply device is called the “2015 Iowa Issues Survey.” It asks you to answer 20 simple questions on issues ranging from the Second Amendment to Obamacare and return it with a check ranging from $250 to $1,250 – at least that’s what my letter asked me to give.

Grassley Lists Trump as a Democrat, Forgets Cruz

Chuck Grassley, the dean of the Iowa congressional delegation, recently sent out a fundraising letter/poll to Iowa voters. (He's running for his seventh six-year term in the Senate in 2016.) Craig Robinson at The Iowa Republican writes: In the past few days, a Grassley fundraising letter has appeared in Iowans’ mail boxes.
