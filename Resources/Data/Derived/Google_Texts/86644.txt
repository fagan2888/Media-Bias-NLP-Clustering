Following the GOP-led House passing a bill that would defund Obamacare, NBC Latino Contributor Viviana Hurtado told MSNBC’s John Liu that this is a bad strategy for a party attempting to rebrand and capture the Hispanic vote.

“Latinos are the largest number of uninsured in the country, so this is a group that is extremely supportive of this action,” Hurtado said of Obamacare.

Hurtado went on to discuss a new series of ads that want viewers to “Opt Out” of Obamacare.
