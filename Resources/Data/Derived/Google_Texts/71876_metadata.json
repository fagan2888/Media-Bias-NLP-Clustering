The Derby school district found a few students that needed some help this holiday season and worked with the police department to get the event going. The police meet up with the kids and they all went shopping together.\n\nTarget stores across America participate in the Shop With A Cop program. Toy dogs with the Target logo imprinted on them were given out to the kids.\n\nThe children were allowed to buy presents for their family and few for themselves, but they did not have to spend their own money.\n\nDavis-Moore donated $1,000 to Derby Police to sponsor the event. After a morning of shopping, officers and the children went back to the police station and wrapped up all the toys. Following that, Papa Johns Pizza donated food.\n\nDerby Police Chief Robert Lee says that events like these aid more than the children, but also improve relations between police and citizens.\n\n\u201cI think it is a win-win for everyone involved,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthis has been a rough year, nationally for police and we have to do the things that we need to do to show the public and demonstrate to the public that we are still the good guys.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Derby Police officers took children shopping at Target to get Christmas presents.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Derby Police officers took children shopping at Target to get Christmas presents.", "title": "Shop With A Cop program takes over Derby store", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Shop-With-A-Cop-program-takes-over-Derby-285727571.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/42C/25B/42C25B8FAFED4EDDA38430522402DAE9", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/146/7C5/1467C5763732441E9F6802E08EAB7C57.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Derby Police officers took children shopping at Target to get Christmas presents.", "title": "Shop With A Cop program takes over Derby store", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Shop-With-A-Cop-program-takes-over-Derby-285727571.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/ShopWithACop2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Shop With A Cop program takes over Derby store", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Shop With A Cop program"}, "article_summary": "The Derby Police Department took children shopping for Christmas presents at Target for the Shop With A Cop program.\nThe Shop With a Cop program pairs children and police officers together to go shopping for Christmas presents.\nTarget stores across America participate in the Shop With A Cop program.\nThe police meet up with the kids and they all went shopping together.\nAfter a morning of shopping, officers and the children went back to the police station and wrapped up all the toys."}
