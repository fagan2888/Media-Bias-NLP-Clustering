from his livelihood, blocking his access to bank accounts and forcing him to pay exorbitant fees for basic financial services.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American, and when the government does something like this to its own citizens, it has to be stopped,\u201d said Andy Kramer, owner of Discount Check Casher of Georgia.\n\nKramer supports his wife, who is a public school teacher, and three children by running a small check-cashing service in Savannah, Ga.\n\nBut over the past year, he has struggled to make ends meet, finding himself subject to the Justice Department\u2019s covert program Operation Choke Point.\n\nBusiness in Jeopardy\n\nKramer is aware that his industry, check cashing, is often criticized for charging exorbitant fees and thereby subject to complex regulations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the poster boy for compliance,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind going through all the hoops\u2014it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s expensive, but I do it.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, Kramer said national banks like SunTrust, Wells Fargo and Bank of America went on a campaign to eliminate money-service businesses from their customer base.\n\nBut because local banks still supported his service, decisions made by \u201cthe big boys\u201d never posed a significant threat.\n\nUntil Operation Choke Point kicked into gear.\n\nThe program, Kramer believes, caused a series of local banks to drop his accounts, putting Discount Check Casher of Georgia and its nine full-time employees in jeopardy.\n\nWithout Cause\n\nIn December 2013, Ameris Bank in Savannah, Ga., closed Kramer\u2019s bank account.\n\nHis banker told him that although he was a \u201cgreat account\u201d and an \u201cideal customer,\u201d the bank had made a blanket decision that they could no longer do business with check cashers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American, and when the government does something like this to its own citizens, it has to be stopped,\u201d says Andy Kramer\n\nSensing a prejudice against his industry, Kramer dramatically changed the way he did business.\n\nInstead of bringing checks directly to the bank for deposit, Kramer switched to a remote deposit system, where a third party would process his customers\u2019 checks and transfer the money\u2014basically in cash form\u2014to the bank.\n\nThe idea is to transfer risk from the bank to a third party.\n\n\u201cThe bank has no risk at all\u2014there\u2019s no check,\u201d said Kramer.\n\nFinancially, this requires Kramer to spend between $13,000 and $15,000 for services that previously cost between $1,500 and $2,500.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nOver the course of the next seven months, two more banks\u2014Coastal Bank and United Community Bank, both located in Savannah\u2014dropped him as a customer.\n\n\u2018Choking\u2019 Unpopular Industries\n\nIn 2012, the Justice Department set out on an ambitious mission to \u201creduce dramatically mass market consumer fraud\u201d by limiting fraudsters\u2019 ability to access bank accounts and other financial services.\n\nThey would do so by utilizing the broad scope of President Obama\u2019s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to pressure banks into scrutinizing their customer base.\n\nJustice Department officials called the program \u201cOperation Choke Point.\u201d\n\nUsing covert tactics, the agency believed it could \u201cpowerfully affect the entire banking industry.\u201d\n\nWhether intentional or not, the initiative resulted in the termination of bank accounts in a range of legal and legitimate industries.\n\nLike Kramer, business owners across America found themselves blocked from basic financial services.\n\nRisky Businesses\n\nOf the nine or more government agencies involved in the execution of Operation Choke Point, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has taken the most heat.\n\nThe agency has been accused of discouraging banks from doing business with range of legal and legitimate industries.\n\n>>> Firearms Sellers Say They\u2019re Being Choked From Payment Processors\n\nEvidence points to a 2011 list created by the FDIC, which was adopted into Operation Choke Point.\n\nCheck cashers weren\u2019t specifically called out in the FDIC\u2019s \u201chigh risk\u201d list (although some might classify the business as a \u201cmoney transfer network\u201d), but the guidance set a vague precedent for the termination of accounts from a broad range of industries, especially those subject to the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nBrian Wise, a senior adviser at the U.S. Consumer Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that has been gathering first-hand accounts of businesses impacted by the operation, said he\u2019s seen at least 20 different industries affected\u2014from international logistics companies and mom-and-pop pawn shops to gun dealers and tobacco companies.\n\nHe told The Daily Signal, \u201cThe example of Kramer shows that the list was only the start and that many more industries than were included on that list have become victims of this program.\u201d\n\nUnder Scrutiny\n\nSince coming under pressure from Republicans in Congress, the FDIC walked back its involvement in Operation Choke Point, taking dramatic steps to reverse its policies in targeting legal and legitimate industries that are unpopular within the Obama administration.\n\n>>> Read More: FDIC Changes Tactics in Response to Operation Choke Point\n\nBut industry insiders\u2019 say Choke Point is far from over, and the FDIC\u2019s policy change is insufficient to protect business owners.\n\n\u201cThe FDIC\u2019s latest move is as a stunning admission that the government targeted legal and lawful businesses for undue regulatory scrutiny,\u201d said Jamie Fulmer, senior vice president of public affairs for Advance America, Cash Advance. However, he said:\n\nThe FDIC gave little hint at whether it would rectify the damage done to the untold number of regulated businesses who lost crucial banking relationships or whether officials with personal biases against legal businesses used by millions will be held accountable.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Coalition\u2019s Wise said the FDIC\u2019s latest move was a political stunt to \u201cquell the public scrutiny of this program.\u201d He added:\n\nWe know this because the same week that the [Financial Institution Letter] came out from the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put out a warning to banks threatening them not to disclose anything about the examination process. This warning amounts to witness intimidation and witness tampering and demonstrates that Operation Choke Point is nowhere close to being over. Those claiming victory right now are woefully misinformed.\n\nDespite the significance of the FDIC\u2019s action, questions remain.\n\nWho is being held accountable for the FDIC\u2019s targeting of legal industries?\n\nHow do legal businesses owners protect themselves from becoming victims of the program?\n\nIs the government still funding Operation Choke Point?\n\nAnd who\u2014and what\u2014can stop it?\n\nLooking Ahead\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost broke me,\u201d Kramer said of Operation Choke Point. \u201cWhen I found out [about the program], I said, \u2018Why would they do this to me?\u2019\u201d\n\nKramer has since found a new bank that claims it doesn\u2019t discriminate against his business, but has no way of knowing whether he\u2019ll be dropped again.\n\nTo protect that bank, Kramer asked to keep its name anonymous.\n\nAfter a few months of good service, Kramer asked his banker, \u201cWhy are you the only bank that treats me like a businessman?\u201d\n\nThat banker responded:\n\nBecause the president of our bank believes that in order to be a community bank, you\u2019ve got to service the needs of the community. And there\u2019s certainly a need for check cashing in this community.\n\nAs grateful as he is, the saga has taken its toll on both Kramer and his employees.\n\n\u201cInstead of facing normal business problems, upon waking each morning it is a question of will we still have a bank to do business with or will I have to shut my doors,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of his employees, Arnie Goldstein, understands the threat. He said: \u201cIf the bank we have now decides to do this again, we have no place to go. It means padlocking the door.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI\u2019m an American, and when the government does something like this to its own citizens, it has to be stopped.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m an American, and when the government does something like this to its own citizens, it has to be stopped.\u201d", "title": "Small Business Owner Questions Why Justice Department Would Threaten His Livelihood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/CheckCashersCOVER.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:24:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1u44hEH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m an American, and when the government does something like this to its own citizens, it has to be stopped.\u201d", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/CheckCashersCOVER.jpg"}, "title": "Small Business Owner Questions Why Justice Department Would Threaten His Livelihood", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2015-02-04T03:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:24:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "choke point, operation choke point, justice department, doj, check cashers, payment processors"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe22\"", "article_summary": "But over the past year, he has struggled to make ends meet, finding himself subject to the Justice Department\u2019s covert program Operation Choke Point.\nThis warning amounts to witness intimidation and witness tampering and demonstrates that Operation Choke Point is nowhere close to being over.\nUntil Operation Choke Point kicked into gear.\n>>> Firearms Sellers Say They\u2019re Being Choked From Payment ProcessorsEvidence points to a 2011 list created by the FDIC, which was adopted into Operation Choke Point.\nRisky BusinessesOf the nine or more government agencies involved in the execution of Operation Choke Point, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has taken the most heat."}
