Three plays and one holding penalty later, the drive stalled at the Giants\u2018 34-yard line and ended with a blocked field goal attempt. The defense had Manning and the Giants flummoxed, yet somehow, Washington failed to score even three points.\n\nThe Redskins had already scored, though, in the sense that the defense was playing with a toughness the Giants could not match. Washington claimed a 20-14 victory on Sunday at FedEx Field, picking up, on a tiebreaker, first place in the NFC East.\n\nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Redskins can see the light in an otherwise dark NFC East\n\nBlackmon\u2019s interception had coach Jay Gruden charged up, but no more than the crushing hit that rookie Kyshoen Jarrett delivered just a moment before. As Giants wide receiver Dwayne Harris tried to secure the catch, Jarrett leveled him, knocking the ball loose. Blackmon, who had almost intercepted the pass on his first try, circled back to secure the loose ball.\n\nOn the Giants\u2018 opening drive, inside linebacker Perry Riley intercepted a pass intended for Shane Vereen that bounced out of the running back\u2019s hands. Though Gruden would have liked to see the Redskins convert the turnovers into points, the effort was just as satisfying.\n\n\u201cOur defense was flying all over the place, which I love to see that, man,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cCome late in the season, that\u2019s your meal ticket right there. The [interceptions] were momentum, and it just justifies when you play with great effort, great things are going to happen. I just like the way I felt the energy on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: With long touchdown reception, DeSean Jackson shows he\u2019s back to full strength\n\nIn the third quarter, the Giants had worked their way to the Redskins\u2018 four-yard line, seemingly poised to chip away at Washington\u2019s 17-0 deficit. On third-and-4, Manning tried to connect with Rueben Randle in the back of the end zone. Rookie cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who converted to the position from wide receiver during training camp, intercepted the pass to curb New York\u2019s push. The Giants scored 14 unanswered points in the fourth quarter, but by then it was too late.\n\nThe resiliency that the Redskins defense displayed on Sunday was forged on Saturday night when free safety Dashon Goldson called a players-only meeting.\n\nIt was an open forum, Goldson said, but his message was simple.\n\n\u201cMine specifically was to believe in what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Goldson said. \u201cWe got the talent here. We\u2019ve got the talent here, it\u2019s just a mindset to click, like we did today. We played well together. We played as a team. Message was sent.\u201d\n\nGoldson, a nine-year veteran, knew that type of message was needed not just for the team, but for the secondary after cornerback Chris Culliver tore the ACL and MCL in his right knee in practice last Thursday. It was that message that led the Redskins\u2018 defensive backs to believe that even without Culliver, they could get a victory, despite facing one of the league\u2019s best receivers in Odell Beckham Jr. When Dunbar intercepted Manning\u2019s pass, Goldson and Blackmon swarmed the rookie, overwhelmed with excitement.\n\n\u201cWe knew what kind of player he was. We just knew when he got that opportunity he\u2019d shine,\u201d Goldson said. \u201cHe was jacked up about this game, even last night, the opportunity. I was so happy for him because I remember the first opportunity I got, how excited I was.\u201d\n\nDunbar was injured in the third quarter when he deflected Manning\u2019s pass intended for Randle. He sustained an open dislocation in his left index finger and did not return and the defense suffered.\n\nThe Redskins were able to disguise their looks when Dunbar was in the game, as cornerback DeAngelo Hall and Jarrett were able to rotate between the free safety and nickel corner positions. Once Dunbar was out, Blackmon had to play the outside corner, which Hall said limited the Redskins\u2018 looks.\n\nWhen the secondary struggled, the Redskins\u2018 pass rush continued to chase Manning. The Redskins sacked the Giants\u2018 quarterback three times on Sunday, taking advantage of New York\u2019s injured offensive line. Left guard Justin Pugh and center Weston Richburg were ruled out before the start of the game, and guard Geoff Schwartz broke a leg in first quarter.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were going to face some guys that were backups and that weren\u2019t their original crew,\u201d said outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who had two sacks. \u201cWe knew us upfront, we had to be the difference makers in the game and I think for the most part, we were.\u201d\n\nThough the Redskins moved into first place with Sunday\u2019s victory, they know their work has just started. They play the Dallas Cowboys next Monday at home \u2014 another opportunity to gain ground in the NFC East.\n\nIf the Redskins ultimately want to sustain success, they need to win consecutive games or win on the road, something they haven\u2019t done yet this season.\n\n\u201cAll that does is keep us in control of what we want to do, and you know, we\u2019ve got to come back ready to work,\u201d inside linebacker Will Compton said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who we play next week. We\u2019ve got to come back ready to work and we need to learn how to win and continue to win. If we want to be a winning football team, we\u2019ve got to prepare hard and string wins together, so you know, it\u2019s \u2014 the emotion\u2019s high, everyone\u2019s excited, but we need to use this for momentum, learn from the film and use it to get the ball rolling next week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins intercepted Giants quarterback Eli Manning three times on Sunday and had a shutout for more than three quarters in a 20-14 victory that moved them past the Giants and atop the NFC East.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Redskins intercepted Giants quarterback Eli Manning three times on Sunday and had a shutout for more than three quarters in a 20-14 victory that moved them past the Giants and atop the NFC East.", "title": "Defense helps Redskins handle Giants, vault into first place in division", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/29/defense-helps-redskins-handle-giants-vault-first-p/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/29/AP_582678917748.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/29/AP_582678917748.jpg", "description": "The Redskins intercepted Giants quarterback Eli Manning three times on Sunday and had a shutout for more than three quarters in a 20-14 victory that moved them past the Giants and atop the NFC East.", "card": "summary", "title": "Defense helps Redskins handle Giants, vault into first place in divisi"}, "Author": "Anthony Gulizia", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Will Blackmon, Eli Manning, Nfc East, Washington Redskins"}, "article_summary": "The resiliency that the Redskins defense displayed on Sunday was forged on Saturday night when free safety Dashon Goldson called a players-only meeting.\nWhen the secondary struggled, the Redskins\u2018 pass rush continued to chase Manning.\nThe Redskins had already scored, though, in the sense that the defense was playing with a toughness the Giants could not match.\nWhen Dunbar intercepted Manning\u2019s pass, Goldson and Blackmon swarmed the rookie, overwhelmed with excitement.\nThe defense had Manning and the Giants flummoxed, yet somehow, Washington failed to score even three points."}
