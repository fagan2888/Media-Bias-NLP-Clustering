Should Donald Trump retain his commanding surge in the polls and end up winning the White House, despite all the bluster, "the constitutional constraints of the office would become apparent, and the fears of instantaneous disaster would dissipate," relegating the real estate tycoon to the same challenges faced by those before him, according to Politico The reality star businessman may enjoy a productive first 100 days, according to the website, by doing things like rescinding President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration and labeling China a "currency manipulator," "a legal precursor to imposing new tariffs popular with working-class Americans and manufacturing chiefs but opposed by other CEOs who rely of cheap Chinese goods."But beyond that, he would be hog-tied by a divided Congress, just as those who have served before him."Like for much of the past four decades, nothing will be able to survive without scratching and clawing to cobble together bipartisan support," according to Politico.Victories by other celebrities-turned-politicians, like Jesse "The Body Venture" and Arnold "The Terminator" Schwarzenegger, elected as governor of Minnesota and California, respectively, provide good examples of how changing the system is not as easy as it might appear.Even if he followed the "kinder, gentler path" of Ventura and Schwarzenegger, Trump would be hard-pressed after picking the "low-hanging legislative fruit," Politico reports."Intractable bipartisan disputes over spending levels and corporate tax reform would remain intractable. Republican desires to gut Obama’s legacies such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank bank reform law would meet the usual Democratic filibuster."Disagreements between parties and between interest groups would be as they always were. Before long, people will be lumping Trump into the category of 'all talk no action politicians.'"For Trump to even make it to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would knock America off its feet, even though he has been out front since practically announcing his candidacy. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics recently wrote in his "Crystal Ball" that "if Trump is nominated, then everything we think we know about presidential nominations is wrong."Even Trump’s brash comments about minorities and women, which would likely have sunk another candidate, have only seemed to bolster Trump in the eyes of his supporters."As inappropriate as some of his comments are, I think it’s stuff that a lot of people are thinking but afraid to say," supporter Lisa Carey, 51, of Greenfield, New Hampshire, told The New York Times . "And I’m a woman."Another Granite State Trump supporter, 54-year-old teacher Lori Szostkiewicz, told the newspaper that it’s Trump’s boldness that is part of his appeal."I want people who are negotiating with him to believe my president when he says he’s going to do something," Szostkiewicz said. "I want to negotiate from a position of strength, not weakness."
