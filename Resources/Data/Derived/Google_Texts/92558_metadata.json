But in January, Nancy died of lung cancer.\n\nStill, Toms, 70, decided to push ahead without his wife of 49 years and raise the 4-year-old alone.\n\n\u201cThere is nobody else left to take care of him but me, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Toms said. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit old to be a father, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nToms made it official Saturday during a National Adoption Day event for more than 60 children at the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice Center in West Dallas. Jacob\u2019s mother had lost custody of him, and Saturday\u2019s event was designed to expedite the adoption process for children like him.\n\nThe soon-to-be-families, many of them dressed in their Sunday best, crowded the hallways lined with balloons and photographers and the court rooms filled with teddy bears.\n\nBefore he took his turn before a judge Saturday, Toms, a retired Coast Guard veteran, described raising the young boy \u2014 who he swears will be an engineer because he takes everything apart \u2014 has been rewarding, chaotic and demanding.\n\n\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t give it up for nothing,\u201d he said. The adoption, he added, \u201cis going to be a highlight of my life.\u201d\n\nDallas Court Appointed Special Advocates, known as CASA, put on the event for the 16th-straight year \u2014 just in time for Christmas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so uplifting just to sense the generosity and the goodness of the families that are here,\u201d CASA executive director Kathleen LaValle said.\n\nAshley Rhodes-Courter, a foster child and foster parent who wrote two bestelling books about her experiences, watched the festivities.\n\nAnd officials with Children\u2019s Medical Center, which provides medical care for many of the foster kids, roamed the halls and beamed with pride. Heidi Roman, a pediatrician, attended for the first time and said the event was both \u201creally exciting\u201d and \u201creally emotional\u201d for her.\n\nThe Northwood Woman\u2019s Club offered kids their traditional spread of cookies, popcorn and soda. The women joked they have no problem offering kids sweet treats at 9 a.m. \u2014 after all, they don\u2019t have to take them home when they are on a sugar high.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to please the kids,\u201d Elizabeth Jenkins said. \u201cThis is like a birthday and Christmas. Whatever the kids want. This is their day.\u201d\n\nZachary Jones Walton, 15, said it was the biggest day of his life. The adoption ends three years in foster care for the South Dallas boy who now lives in Houston with his 70-year-old aunt Ruby Jackson. Now, he can focus on his future, which he believes will either be in the Air Force or as a police officer.\n\n\u201cI just really want to help and protect people,\u201d he said.\n\nOther families had no biological ties to the children.\n\nDiane and Jeff Stanley, who is a pastor, adopted six children Saturday after they had already adopted five more. Stanley said his wife pushed for adoption, and he agreed after he read scripture and \u201cdidn\u2019t get God to change his mind.\u201d\n\nTimothy and Kimberly Schafer of Forney adopted four new children. And they dressed themselves and the two boys and two girls in red so their picture at the event could double as their Christmas card photo.\n\nThe couple took on the kids, who are all siblings, because Kimberly already had a grown daughter who she had in high school.\n\nTimothy Schafer said he is still getting used to having four kids around the house, but \u201cthey just changed everything\u201d for him in a positive way.\n\nState District Judge Jim Jordan told the couple, \u201cI have a feeling it will really take a village\u201d to raise the kids.\u201d They replied they were up to it and have plenty of family help.\n\nCarmen Osowski, 35, of Brownsville couldn\u2019t have any children after she suddenly suffered a stroke while she was in banking 14 years ago in Germany. She and her husband officially adopted sisters Magali, 13, Jazmin, 9, and Briseidy, 6, from Fort Worth on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very blessed,\u201d Osowski said with tears filling her eyes.\n\nShawn Osowski, her husband, said that the kids made for \u201can easy gift this year\u201d for his wife\u2019s birthday, which was Friday.\n\n\u201cI tell people we\u2019re inches away from a long marathon,\u201d he said minutes before he walked into the court room. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to start another whole race here in a few minutes.\u201d\n\nToms, the single grandfather, said he felt unburdened once he was officially Jacob\u2019s adoptive father.\n\nToms and Jacob, who grasped his new teddy bear in hand, went down the elevator at the court house and left for a celebratory pizza party, their first as a legal family.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mine, and we\u2019ve got a whole life to go,\u201d Toms said.\n\nTwitter: @TristanHallman", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL21vcmUtdGhhbi02MC1jaGlsZHJlbi1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWFkb3B0ZWQtaW4tZGFsbGFzLWR1cmluZy1uYXRpb25hbC1hZG9wdGlvbi1kYXktZXZlbnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tristan Hallman", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Jim Toms and his wife, Nancy, took their grandson into their Seagoville home as a foster child after their son died in a car accident.
