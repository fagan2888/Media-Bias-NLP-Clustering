Ryan has instructed his health care task force to \u201cgo big and go bold\u201d in its push to replace Obamacare so that voters can see a clear GOP alternative before Congress breaks this summer for the presidential conventions, a powerful House Republican said Wednesday.\n\nRep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the task force will reach consensus on a plan, though it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019ll bring it up for a vote as long as President Obama is still in office and wields a veto.\n\n\u201cWe know what the outcome would be,\u201d Mr. Upton said, adding that the goal of the task force is instead \u201cto begin the foundation to prepare for a Republican president in 2017.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: HHS: Look at uninsured rate, not Obamacare signups\n\nBut as the Affordable Care Act enters its third year of full implementation, the Obama administration says the health law has become ensconced, and is now helping provide insurance to about 90 percent of Americans.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in our nation\u2019s history that this has been true,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHer department has struggled to meet enrollment projections, with just 12.7 million people signing up for private coverage on the health exchanges for this year. The Congressional Budget Office had initially said the number would be above 20 million.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tax forms pose new wrinkle in Congress\u2019s \u2018Obamacare exemption\u2019\n\n\u201cPoor enrollment results show Americans just aren\u2019t buying what the president\u2019s selling on this law,\u201d said Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, Texas Republican. \u201cIn fact, millions would rather pay the punitive individual mandate tax penalty than buy Washington-designed insurance they don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMrs. Burwell, though, said the lower enrollment number is actually a victory, since it means fewer Americans have been forced into the exchanges after losing coverage through their businesses.\n\nShe said Congress should judge success not by the number of enrollees in the exchanges, but by the dropping level of those without coverage at all.\n\nMrs. Burwell has less than a year on the job before Mr. Obama\u2019s term is up, and Republicans in Congress are already planning for that.\n\nMr. Brady and Mr. Upton are two of Mr. Ryan\u2019s four pointmen on replacing Mr. Obama\u2019s signature law with \u201cpatient-centered\u201d reforms. House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price of Georgia and Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline of Ohio round out the working group, which is soliciting ideas from rank-and-file lawmakers as part of Mr. Ryan\u2019s bottom-up approach to governing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s committed not only to getting the big idea right, but also getting the process right,\u201d Mr. Upton said of the speaker.\n\nFor now, Republicans have a set of goals: A replacement plan must reduce costs while increasing choices for patients, bolster competition in the insurance marketplace and help vulnerable Americans with targeted assistance, Mr. Upton said.\n\nTheir plan would get rid of Obamacare\u2019s unpopular insurance mandates on employers and individuals, plus its byzantine coverage requirements.\n\n\u201cJust erased, like an Etch-a-Sketch,\u201d Mr. Upton said.\n\nPeople with pre-existing medical conditions would still be guaranteed access to coverage, though Republicans would try to foster competition by letting insurance companies sell their plans across state lines, he said.\n\nRepublicans would give states more flexibility in how they run their Medicaid programs, and they would expand the use of health savings accounts so that Americans take personal responsibility for how much they spend on care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker Paul D.
