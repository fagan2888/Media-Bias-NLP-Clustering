The share price has not significantly surpassed that level in the past year despite GM's three straight quarters of record-breaking pretax profits.\n\nChief Executive Officer Mary Barra has stepped up efforts to persuade skeptical investors that GM can deliver consistently strong earnings - and return billions of dollars to shareholders - through the ups and downs of the industry's sales cycles.\n\nU.S. auto sales set a record last year and are on pace to top that in 2016, but many investors see signs of the start of a cyclical drop off, which has pressured share prices.\n\nExcluding a one-time expense for litigation settlements, GM's first-quarter earnings were $1.26 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.00.\n\nThe company said pretax income, excluding one-time items, was a record for the first quarter.\n\nGM said it still expected full-year earnings of $5.25 to $5.75 a share before special items, up from $5.02 in 2015.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter rose 4.5 percent to $37.3 billion. Adjusted profit margins increased to 7.1 percent of revenue from 5.8 percent a year earlier.\n\nNorth America accounted for 85 percent of GM's earnings before interest and taxes, reflecting robust profits from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, whose sales benefited from low gasoline prices.\n\nProfit margins in the region, however, dipped to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens attributed the decline to restructuring costs and more U.S. union members taking packages to retire.\n\nStevens said the company still expected North American margins of more than 10 percent for 2016.\n\nIn Europe, GM broke even, reversing a year-earlier loss of $200 million.\n\nStevens backed the company's target for 8 percent margins in Europe over the next several years but said the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union was a concern.\n\nThe automaker narrowed losses in South America. Income from joint ventures in China was flat at $500 million.\n\nBarra has led GM's efforts to bolster investors' view of the company, including a $9 billion share buyback program that runs through 2017. The company has also made moves to keep up with self-driving vehicles and other technological advances.\n\nIn January, GM said it would invest $500 million in ride-sharing company Lyft Inc. On Thursday, Barra said the company expected to close its deal to buy Cruise Automation, a self-driving vehicle startup.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph White and Bernie Woodall; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Von Ahn)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Demand for big trucks in North America and an improved performance", "title": "GM earnings beat estimates on strength in North America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/North-America-Europe-lift-GM-record-first-quarter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autos-gm_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/North-America-Europe-lift-GM-record-first-quarter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autos-gm_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Demand for big trucks in North America and an improved performance", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "North America accounted for 85 percent of GM's earnings before interest and taxes, reflecting robust profits from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, whose sales benefited from low gasoline prices.\nExcluding a one-time expense for litigation settlements, GM's first-quarter earnings were $1.26 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.00.\nGM said it still expected full-year earnings of $5.25 to $5.75 a share before special items, up from $5.02 in 2015.\nStevens said the company still expected North American margins of more than 10 percent for 2016.\nIn January, GM said it would invest $500 million in ride-sharing company Lyft Inc.
