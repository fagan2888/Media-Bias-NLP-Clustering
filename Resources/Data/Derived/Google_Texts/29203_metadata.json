Collins, Rose Scott and Denis O'Hayer here.\n\nWhat do Taylor Swift and U.S. Representative Doug Collins have in common? Both are passionate about songwriters getting paid fairly for their creative work.\n\nToday on \"A Closer Look,\" Collins spoke with Rose Scott and Denis O'Hayer about the Songwriter Equity Act, a bill he recently introduced to update provisions of the Copyright Act. He said the Act, which has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, would make sure that royalties set by government courts reflect the fair market value of music.\n\n\"We need to get government out of this,\" Collins said, pointing out that this bill will probably be part of a \"larger look at the entire system\" of copyright protection.\n\nSpeaking of \"broken systems,\" as the Congressman termed them, he also addressed questions related to the Republican House budget proposal that was released yesterday. Funding for key provisions of the Affordable Care Act are not provided. \"Let's work toward a patient-centered overhaul of the medical system,\" said Rep. Collins. About risks to rural hospitals, in his district and across the country, he emphasized his understanding of the funding crises they face. \"Everybody is valuable in the sight of God,\" he said, but \"how are we going to [provide quality health care] with taxpayer dollars.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "What do Taylor Swift and U.S. Representative Doug Collins have in common?
