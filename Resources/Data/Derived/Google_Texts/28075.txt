How quickly they fall.

Just days into the annual March Madness NCAA basketball tournament, the vast majority of brackets are already badly broken.

CBSSports.com says just 0.03% of the brackets it follows were still perfect, down from 0.2% at the end of play Thursday Night.

And Warren Buffett’s $1billion guarantee of the Quicken Loans perfect bracket contest is looking pretty safe. It’s down to its own version of the sweet 16.

The speed with which this year’s brackets have gone bust is in large part due to some big upsets early on. One of the biggest culprits was Duke’s loss to tiny Mercer University. Ohio State’s early exit also caused a lot of pain.
