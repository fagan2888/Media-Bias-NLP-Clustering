Watch the video above for a full recap of the president\u2019s four-point counterterrorism plan for Iraq and Syria. Read the full transcript.\n\n>>> What Obama Got Right\u2014and Wrong\u2014in His ISIS Speech\n\n1. Airstrikes\n\n\u201cFirst, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions, so that we\u2019re hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense.\u201d\n\n2. Send 475 More Troops to Iraq\n\n\u201cSecond, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi security forces. Now that those teams have completed their work \u2013 and Iraq has formed a government \u2013 we will send an additional 475 service members to Iraq.\u201d\n\n3. Cut Off Funding to ISIL\n\n\u201cThird, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding; improve our intelligence; strengthen our defenses; counter its warped ideology; and stem the flow of foreign fighters into \u2013 and out of \u2013 the Middle East.\u201d\n\n4. Ramp Up Humanitarian Efforts\n\n\u201cFourth, we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization. This includes Sunni and Shiite Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities.\u201d\n\n>>> WATCH: Ted Cruz Slams Obama\u2019s \u2018Photo-Op Foreign Policy\u2019\n\n>>> A Primer for Obama\u2019s ISIS Speech: No Easy Answers for a Long Fight", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama addressed the nation Wednesday night in hopes to lay out a strategy to \"destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama addressed the nation Wednesday night in hopes to lay out a strategy to \"destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.\"", "title": "Obama's 4-Point ISIS Strategy Explained in 3 Minutes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140910_ObamaSpeech.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-11T00:22:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xLyAkO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Obama addressed the nation Wednesday night in hopes to lay out a strategy to \"destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.\"", "title": "Obama's 4-Point ISIS Strategy Explained in 3 Minutes", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140910_ObamaSpeech.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-09-10T22:13:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-11T00:22:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "president obama, isis, isil, islamic state, video, speech, white house, terrorism, iraq, middle east"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2744\"", "article_summary": "In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi security forces.\nSend 475 More Troops to Iraq\u201cSecond, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground.\nRamp Up Humanitarian Efforts\u201cFourth, we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization.\nWatch the video above for a full recap of the president\u2019s four-point counterterrorism plan for Iraq and Syria.\nWorking with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions, so that we\u2019re hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense.\u201d2."}
