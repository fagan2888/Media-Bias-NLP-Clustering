For example, at least a few Democrats are fighting back \u2013 using Republican opposition to the health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid as a part of their own campaigns. Indeed, Democratic senators in two states are trying to capitalize on Republican opposition to the health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are kind of counting on Obamacare to bring them control of Congress in November and I don\u2019t think they should be so confident,\u201d says Dean Clancy, a longtime Republican operative and former vice president of FreedomWorks, a conservative group that supports Tea Party candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder now that Obamacare is up and running.\u201d\n\nChris Jennings, a health policy consultant who worked on the issue in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, agrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think health reform is now feeling more and more of an issue of the past, and one thing I learned from Bill Clinton is every election is about the future and not the past and what are you going to do to address it,\u201d Jennings says.\n\nRepublicans face two key problems using the law as a political cudgel, analysts say. One is that with millions of people now signed up for coverage, making the law go away would result in taking away something tangible for a large and growing group of voters. \u201cSo in short order it\u2019s going to be about what you lose as a consequence,\u201d Jennings says.\n\nThe second problem is with the back half of what Republicans have continually branded as a \u201crepeal and replace\u201d strategy, says Clancy. \u201cIn my 20 years of following health care policy, (Republicans) have never been able to coalesce around en electorally inspiring alternative on health care.\u201d\n\nWhich leaves them, Clancy says, \u201con the horns of an insoluble dilemma.\u201d On the one hand, if Republicans do offer an alternative, \u201cit gives their opponents and some in their own ranks something to shoot at. If they fail to offer an alternative, it becomes hard for their supporters to take them seriously.\u201d\n\nBut the health care issue has not shifted entirely in the Democrats\u2019 favor either. The most recent CNN/ORC poll found only 12 percent of respondents said the health law should be left as it is, while 18 percent said they want it repealed and replaced and 20 percent favored repeal without replacement. But as in most polls, the largest plurality, 49 percent, want the law fixed.\n\nA poll by Politico in the states with the most competitive House and Senate races \u2013 those where control of Congress will be decided \u2013 found more opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Close to half (48 percent) of those responding said they supported repealing the law. But again, a majority, although just barely (51 percent), said they supported leaving the law intact (16 percent) or changing it without repealing it (35 percent).\n\nThat\u2019s led at least some embattled Senate Democrats to try to turn the tables on their Republican opponents, using their states\u2019 failure to expand the Medicaid program against them.\n\nIn North Carolina, for example, Sen. Kay Hagan is firing back at her newly minted GOP challenger, State House Speaker Thom Tillis, who led the charge in that state not to expand the program in 2013. \u201cAs a result, about 500,000 people who would have qualified for coverage through Medicaid are now not able to do so,\u201d she said last week at a confirmation hearing for Sylvia Mathews Burwell to be the new Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is also making Medicaid expansion a major part of her campaign, including fighting for a ballot measure that would let voters decide whether to let more people onto the program. (So far that fight has been unsuccessful.)\n\nThat\u2019s necessary in part because Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, seen by many as a possible GOP candidate for president in 2016, remains outspoken \u2013 and out front \u2013 in calling for repeal of the entire Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe country that won two world wars and put a man on the moon cannot, it is believed, repeal a disastrous public policy,\u201d Jindal wrote in a Fox News column. \u201cSays who? Why not?\u201d\n\nBut finding a single alternative could be a near impossible task, Clancy pointed out in a lengthy recent commentary for U.S. News called \u201cWhy the GOP is headed for an Obamcare crack-up.\u201d\n\nThe problem in a nutshell, he says, is that Republicans are \u201cfundamentally divided between pro-market and pro-business factions\u201d when it comes to health care. While they are rhetorically pro-market, he explains, they are often \u201cfunctionally pro-business. They talk about patients but they worry about insurers. The special interests \u2013 doctors, hospitals, insurance companies \u2013 have a huge influence over both political parties.
