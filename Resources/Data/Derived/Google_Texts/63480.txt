HENRICO COUNTY, Va. (WTVR) - Henrico Police arrested a man after they were called to a neighborhood near Libbie Ave. early Monday morning. Neighbors called to report a man peeping through car windows, acting like he may steal items from vehicles.

Police investigators said they arrested Alex Nelson, 18, and charged him with Grand Larceny, Obstruct Justice and Possession of a Concealed Weapon.

CBS 6 received several tips from viewers via social media asking about a large police presence near Libbie Avenue and Argus Lane.

Police said property crimes, like car larcenies, effect more people in Henrico County than any other crime.

There are several steps you can take to keep yourself from being a target, though.

Do not store valuables in your car

Do not store identification cards in your vehicle

When in public, put valuable items in the trunk or hide them under seats

Even at home, always keep your vehicle locked

Park in well lit areas at night time

Always communicate suspicious behavior to police
