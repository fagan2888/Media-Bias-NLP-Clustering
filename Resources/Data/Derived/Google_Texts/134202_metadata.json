Anthony List to erect billboards in opposition to Ohio Democratic Representative Steve Driehaus\u2019 2010 reelection campaign. The billboards pointed to Driehaus\u2019 vote in favor of Obamacare, proclaiming \u201cDriehaus voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\n\nOne month before the election, Driehaus filed a \u201cfalse statement\u201d complaint against the billboards, and a government panel voted 2-1, with the sole Republican dissenting, that there was probable cause the billboards violated the law. The owner of the billboard space refused to put up the ad after Driehaus threatened legal action against them as well.\n\nSusan B. Anthony List argues that the Ohio law \u201cchills\u201d political speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\nAs many might recall, the claim that Obamacare provides taxpayer funding for abortion was a hot political issue in 2010, and the truth of the claim was \u201copen to interpretation,\u201d according to a review of Obamacare \u201cmyths and facts\u201d conducted by Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post. Nearly four years after the law\u2019s passage, the abortion-funding question remains contentious.\n\nDriehaus and other Democrats argued that while Obamacare provides federal dollars to purchase insurance plans covering abortion services, insurers may not use those specific federal dollars on abortions themselves. Pro-life groups countered that the provision is simply an accounting gimmick which still results in federal funds indirectly funding abortion procedures. Serving in its role as final arbiter of political truth, the Ohio Elections Commission panel concluded that Driehaus\u2019 version was the \u201ctruth,\u201d and the billboard likely featured a legally punishable \u201clie.\u201d\n\nThe problems with partisan government panels determining the truthfulness of political speech should be obvious.\n\nTake President Barack Obama\u2019s now infamous Obamacare claim that \u201dif you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\u201d named Politifact\u2019s 2013 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d The same \u201clie\u201d was repeated by dozens of vulnerable Democrats and will almost certainly be featured in political advertisements throughout the 2014 cycle. According to the White House though, the \u201cif you like your plan\u201d promise was \u201ctechnically true,\u201d assuming one is willing to accept a number of significant, never-stated caveats.\n\nJust imagine if Congress were to empower a panel nominated by the Obama administration to criminalize what they view as political falsehoods.\n\nIn a rare alliance, the Ohio ACLU filed a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Susan B. Anthony List, arguing that \u201cthe people have an absolute right to criticize their public officials, the government should not be the arbiter of true or false speech and, in any event, the best answer for bad speech is more speech.\u201d Expect the Supreme Court to agree.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The Supreme Court agreed late last week to hear a First Amendment case involving the government's threatened prosecution of political speakers who allegedly mislead their listeners.", "title": "Supreme Court to hear First Amendment Case on \"False\" Political...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/13/supreme-court-to-hear-first-amendment-case-on-false-political-speech/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "taxpayer-funded-abortion", "published_time": "2014-01-13T11:56:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T13:28:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "At issue is Ohio\u2019s \u201cfalse statement\u201d law, which criminalizes false political speech and empowers the Ohio Elections Commission to determine the truth of the speech and refer offenders to state prosecutors.\nSusan B.
