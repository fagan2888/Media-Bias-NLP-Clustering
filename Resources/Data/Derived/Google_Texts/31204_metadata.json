And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an \u201cinterchangeable\u201d may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.\n\nThe FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates Zarxio is biosimilar to Neupogen.\n\nUnder the brand name Zarzio, the Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim has been marketed in more than 40 countries outside the US, generating nearly 7.5 million patient-exposure days of experience.\n\nNaming\n\nFor the approval, the FDA designated a placeholder nonproprietary name for this product as \u201cfilgrastim-sndz.\u201d The provision of a placeholder nonproprietary name for this product \u201cshould not be viewed as reflective of the agency\u2019s decision on a comprehensive naming policy for biosimilar and other biological products,\u201d the FDA said in a statement. \u201c\n\nWhile the FDA has not yet issued draft guidance on how current and future biological products marketed in the United States should be named, the agency intends to do so in the near future.\u201d\n\nLaunch Date\n\nIn a February court filing, Sandoz agreed to not launch \"until the earlier of April 10, 2015, or a ruling in Sandoz\u2019s favor on Amgen\u2019s Motion,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed in the US District Court of California. \"Amgen is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Sandoz from launching before the Court can decide whose reading of the BPCIA is correct,\" IP attorney Stacie Ropka from Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider told BioPharma-Reporter.com. \"If the preliminary injunction is granted then the Court will order Sandoz to refrain from launching until some benchmark is achieved.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FDA on Friday morning approved Sandoz\u2019s Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product approved in the US.", "copyright": "William Reed Business Media", "author": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "og": {"site_name": "BioPharma-Reporter.com", "description": "The FDA on Friday morning approved Sandoz\u2019s Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product approved in the US.", "title": "FDA approves first US biosimilar from Sandoz", "url": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/FDA-approves-first-US-biosimilar-from-Sandoz", "image": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/fda-approves-first-us-biosimilar-from-sandoz/9733165-1-eng-GB/FDA-approves-first-US-biosimilar-from-Sandoz_medium_vga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "biopharma-reporter.com", "description": "The FDA on Friday morning approved Sandoz\u2019s Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product approved in the US.", "title": "FDA approves first US biosimilar from Sandoz", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "biopharma-reporter://Markets-Regulations/FDA-approves-first-US-biosimilar-from-Sandoz"}, "name": {"iphone": "BioPharma-Reporter"}, "id": {"iphone": "id1023356457"}}, "site": "@BioPharmaReport", "image": {"src": "http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/var/plain_site/storage/images/publications/pharmaceutical-science/biopharma-reporter.com/markets-regulations/fda-approves-first-us-biosimilar-from-sandoz/9733165-1-eng-GB/FDA-approves-first-US-biosimilar-from-Sandoz_medium_vga.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "CEC8ACB0DB9777352167906B78F1EF96", "fb": {"admins": 100000722238608}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "keywords": "biopharmaceutical manufacturing, development, biopharmaceutical process, upstream production, downstream processing, upstream processing, biologics", "verify-v1": "WHomov305bLuKa7U4ALUYG/IcW/V1/nBXyagl4I9gR0=", "news_keywords": "BPCI, FDA, biosimilar, approval, Sandoz, Zarxio, filgrastim  biomanufacturing, manufacturing, Amgen, Neupogen"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2a0\"", "article_summary": "The FDA on Friday morning approved Sandoz\u2019s Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product approved in the US.\nUnder the brand name Zarzio, the Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim has been marketed in more than 40 countries outside the US, generating nearly 7.5 million patient-exposure days of experience.\nBut Zarxio was approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product, the FDA notes.\nSandoz\u2019s Zarxio is biosimilar to Amgen\u2019s Neupogen (filgrastim), which was originally licensed in 1991.\n\"If the preliminary injunction is granted then the Court will order Sandoz to refrain from launching until some benchmark is achieved.\""}
