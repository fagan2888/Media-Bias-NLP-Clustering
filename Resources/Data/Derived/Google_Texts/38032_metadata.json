(Photo: Matthew Glowicki)\n\nA new initiative targeting some of the more criminally active, economically struggling areas in the Louisville metro launched Friday with the goal of reducing homicides and improving outcomes for young black boys and men.\n\nThe concept and the problems it seeks to address are not new, but organizers are hoping the Weekend of Hope will bring about a renewed commitment and innovative ideas.\n\n\u201cWe talk about these big goals, but the solution to each and every one is one person at a time,\u201d Mayor Greg Fischer said to those gathered Friday evening in the Mayor\u2019s Gallery.\n\nHe said the efforts are a pilot, one that he hopes will find success and expand.\n\n\u201cThis is all about you all,\u201d Fischer said, pointing to the young black men in the audience. \u201cWe want to see you flourish.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s event was a kick-off to a weekend of planning a long-term effort called Zones of Hope. The pilot initiative will target the California, Russell, Newburg, Parkland and Shawnee areas and focus on programming and community partnerships.\n\nThe zones were selected based on data showing employment, crime and education levels, said Anthony Smith, director of Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods.\n\nThe initiative received a one year, $226,400 grant from the James Graham Brown Foundation of Louisville, which Smith said will help hire a project manager and support organizers in each of the zones.\n\nSmith said the funding, as well as focused consistency by the more than 50 organizations involved will help differentiate Zones of Hope from past efforts.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe this weekend alone is going to change everything and get people to buy into it,\u201d Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe need to keep showing up. We have to show people this is different.\u201d\n\nSaturday, community members at meetings in four of the neighborhoods will create a work plan for furthering the Zones of Hope initiatives in their neighborhood into the future.\n\n\u201cEach neighborhood is different,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey have different vibes. They have different resources. Some need more than others. They might be experiencing some of the same things, but they\u2019re different.\u201d\n\nEach neighborhood will create a report and share it Sunday at a closing event at the Kentucky African American Heritage Center.\n\nLouisville Metro Chief of Police Steve Conrad said the recent shooting death of toddler Ne\u2019Riah Miller highlights a need for violent crime to stop.\n\n\u201cWe are out there doing what we do,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working. We have to figure out a way to go about this differently.\u201d\n\nHe called on residents to have greater cooperation, trust and respect to help solve the violence problem.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything without your help,\u201d he said. \u201cThese children deserve to have a safe neighborhood so they can have a future.\u201d\n\nCasey Family Programs, a national organization that works to reduce the need for foster care by building up communities, first became involved in Louisville with the Cities United initiative.\n\nThe organization is now partnering with metro government to support Zones of Hope by funding a resource development employee to work on the initiative, said Carol Mizoguchi, director of strategic engagement and initiatives for Casey Family Programs.\n\nElim Baptist Church pastor Vincent James has been involved with the Zones of Hope initiative since its inception.\n\nHe said he hasn\u2019t seen the same level of collaboration involved in the new initiative in former efforts, and that the plans generated by community members will be key in forwarding its goals.\n\n\u201cYou have the opportunity ... to work with people who will put action behind it and boots on the ground to make it happen,\u201d James said of the plans. \u201cTomorrow is where the real work takes place.\u201d\n\nReporter Matthew Glowicki can be reached at (502) 582-4989.
