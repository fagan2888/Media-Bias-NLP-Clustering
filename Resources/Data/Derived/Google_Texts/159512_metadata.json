Conservatives, myself included, were outraged that the Supreme Court had wrongly allowed using eminent domain to take private property from one private property owner and give it to another private owner.\n\nConservatives in my community came together with a local resolution to prevent this from happening. I\u2019ll never forget the response from the local official, who told me: \u201cBut you know me, I would never use eminent domain that way.\u201d I responded: \u201cThe law isn\u2019t about you\u2014it\u2019s about when we get bad representatives and must have the law to restrain them.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis is what we believe as conservatives\u2014that the law must supersede personalities and intentions. As conservatives, we seek to bind government using the rule of law to prevent the abuse of power.\n\nThe law is necessary because, as Madison put it, men will not always be angels. The ordinance preventing the government from taking private property and transferring it to another private property owner passed three to two.\n\nWhere was Donald Trump during this debate? He was busy using eminent domain to take a little old lady\u2019s home and flatten it for a parking lot to park limos at his casino.\n\nWhen asked about the justice of using this bully force against property owners, Trump replied that he had no problem with it and that he supported the Kelo decision.\n\nOf course Trump did\u2014the Kelo decision allows more crony capitalism. It puts big business and big government more and more in bed together, with ordinary Americans left out.\n\nI ran for office in 2010 after spending my life outside of both big business and politics. I ran as a member of the Tea Party who was sick and tired of it all. Of the politicians. Of the people who sought to buy the politicians. Of the entire Washington machine.\n\nDonald Trump cannot fix our problems because he is an integral part of the problem. From using government to seize property to enrich himself, to hiring lobbyists to get what he wanted, Donald Trump has bought access to government at all levels and exploited that access for personal gain.\n\nNow he wants you to give him power. We should ask ourselves\u2014why?\n\nDonald Trump is a fake conservative. Don\u2019t let him destroy the limited government movement with chicanery and bluster. Frankly, you are not a conservative if you support this abuse of eminent domain, or the crony capitalism it enables.\n\nAdd Trump\u2019s support for Obamacare and a single-payer government-run healthcare to his support for higher taxes, and you have nothing that is really conservative at all. Will Trump now change his opinion on the Kelo decision? Perhaps, but do we really want the leader of the ostensibly conservative party to be a fraud?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive\u2013Rand Paul: Real Conservatives Stand For Private Property", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive\u2013Rand Paul: Real Conservatives Stand For Private Property", "title": "Real Conservatives Stand For Private Property", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/rand-paul-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-08-24T15:54:35-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/24/real-conservatives-stand-for-private-property/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive\u2013Rand Paul: Real Conservatives Stand For Private Property", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/rand-paul-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Real Conservatives Stand For Private Property", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "conservatism, Crony Capitalism, cronyism, Donald Trump, eminent domain, Kelo case, private property, Sen.
