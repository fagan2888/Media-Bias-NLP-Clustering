CDOT also has proposed rerouting an existing pedestrian trail on the south side of the property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDan Marcucci, a resident CDOT engineer, said that work on the wetlands restoration project may start in mid-July, depending in part on when the state agency gets its grading permit from the county.\n\nNo one spoke at the conmissioners' public hearing on the CDOT application before they voted unanimously to approve it.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28261738/boulder-county-oks-wetlands-restoration-project", "modificationDate": "2015-06-07T10:25:15-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Boulder County commissioners on Thursday approved the Colorado Department of Transportation's proposal to restore and improve the wetlands and riparian ecosystem at 5665 Valmont Road.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28261738:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-07T12:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28261738/boulder-county-oks-wetlands-restoration-project", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder County commissioners on Thursday approved the Colorado Department of Transportation's proposal to restore and improve the wetlands and riparian ecosystem at 5665 Valmont Road.", "title": "Boulder County OKs wetlands restoration project"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Boulder County commissioners on Thursday approved the Colorado Department of Transportation's proposal to restore and improve the wetlands and riparian ecosystem at 5665 Valmont Road.", "title": "Boulder County OKs wetlands restoration project", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28261738/boulder-county-oks-wetlands-restoration-project", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-07T12:00:00-0600", "endDate": "2025-06-05T19:06:53-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County OKs wetlands restoration project", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John FryarStaff", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-06-05T19:08:27-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc44e\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementDan Marcucci, a resident CDOT engineer, said that work on the wetlands restoration project may start in mid-July, depending in part on when the state agency gets its grading permit from the county.\nBoulder County commissioners on Thursday approved the Colorado Department of Transportation's proposal to restore and improve the wetlands and riparian ecosystem at 5665 Valmont Road.\nThe project, on about 12 acres of land owned by the city of Boulder, results from a CDOT commitment to do a wetlands restoration to offset the compromising of wetlands and riparian areas that occurred elsewhere, during construction of U.S. 36 highway improvements between Denver and Boulder, according to Boulder County's Land Use Department staff.\nCounty staff planner Michelle Hoshide said the parcel where CDOT will be doing the wetlands restoration, about a quarter mile east of the intersection of Valmont and 55th Street, \"has been significantly disturbed through past uses.\"\nNo one spoke at the conmissioners' public hearing on the CDOT application before they voted unanimously to approve it."}
