UnitedHealth and Ochsner Health System say they have an agreement to keep insurance through January for nearly 3,000 south Louisiana residents.

The healthcare giant notified customers last month that it was ending Affordable Care Act health insurance through Ochsner on May 15.

The New Orleans Advocate reports that the two companies announced the “Compass” plan agreement on Friday.

UnitedHealth had told members of that program they could get coverage at six other facilities, but all are at least an hour’s drive from New Orleans.

At the time, Ochsner said it hadn’t been able to agree on terms with UnitedHealth’s public health insurance program.

All 29,000 UnitedHealth customers with coverage through public health insurance exchanges need to find new coverage for next year.
