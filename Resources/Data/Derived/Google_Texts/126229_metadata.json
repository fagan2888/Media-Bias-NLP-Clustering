They are products of advertising \u2014 very sophisticated and subtle advertising.\n\nWhat do patent medicines do for those persuaded to take them? They are palliatives that suppress symptoms. They do nothing to \u201ccure\u201d or in any way enhance the immune system. Nor do they make any claims as such, but the public misses this vital point.\n\nThe federal government, through the Food and Drug Administration, unleashed the pharmaceuticals upon the American people, resulting in massive and unbelievable profits. The American people didn\u2019t stand a dog\u2019s chance in hell against this monstrous and deceptive fraud. What a scam! What a cash cow!\n\nThe trigger happened in 1997 when the FDA relaxed the rules for drug advertising direct to the consumer (DTC). Only the U.S. and New Zealand permit this.\n\nThe new FDA rules allowed the drug companies to make claims unimpeded as long as they offered a phone number or website or referenced a magazine ad where consumers could get the \u201cfine print.\u201d The FDA knows as well as you do that people don\u2019t read the \u201cfine print\u201d and most don\u2019t read at all except a few words at a time. The public was as helpless before this charade as if they were little children.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Americans spent $329.2 billion on prescription drugs in 2013, the equivalent of about $1,000 per person. Of the top 10 drug makers, nine spent more on marketing than on research and development; several of them spent almost twice as much.\n\nThe FDA is now considering new guidelines regarding risk communication in DTC advertising. According to an article in The New England Journal of Medicine, the guidelines respond \u201cto mounting research showing that reprinting highly technical package inserts in print ads does very little to communicate risks to consumers. The goal is to communicate those risks in a new vernacular.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the FDA wants the contraindications and side effects printed prominently in plain English rather than legalese or doctorese. Now the American Medical Association with its 200,000 doctors has decided it wants DTC advertising of drugs and medical devices halted.\n\nWhy the sudden changes of heart? I always say follow the money.\n\nAbout $4.5 billion is spent promoting prescription drugs to consumers. The cost of generic and name brand drugs has been rising for the past several years and has jumped almost 5 percent in 2015. Obamacare is bankrupting people, businesses and the already bankrupt government.\n\nNow that the government is in the medicine business (Obamacare), it\u2019s looking to stem the rising cost of \u201chealthcare\u201d services \u2014 drugs included. So while it appears the FDA is looking out for consumers, it\u2019s really trying to save Obamacare from bankruptcy.\n\nDTC marketing cuts into the marketing budget the drug companies have for marketing drugs to the physicians \u2014 $24 billion was spent in marketing to physicians in 2012. Physicians want an even bigger cut of the pie, especially now that Obamacare is cutting into their profits.\n\nFinally, that list of side effects glossed over at the end of the slick TV ad \u2014 where we see beautiful people enjoying all sorts of activities thanks to the latest miracle cure \u2014 sometimes registers with even the densest of consumers who wouldn\u2019t read the fine print if it were blown up to poster size.\n\nWhen consumers learn that the pill that the ads promise will allow them to swim with their puppy puts them at much greater risk of brain aneurysm, heart attack or stroke, that little pill becomes much less attractive.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "Now that the government is in the medicine business (Obamacare), it\u2019s looking to stem the rising cost of \u201chealthcare\u201d services \u2014 drugs included.", "title": "Why are government and the AMA doing an about face on drug marketing?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/05/drugs052815.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-24T13:00:48+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/why-are-government-and-the-ama-doing-an-about-face-on-drug-marketing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/05/drugs052815.jpg", "description": "Now that the government is in the medicine business (Obamacare), it\u2019s looking to stem the rising cost of \u201chealthcare\u201d services \u2014 drugs included.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why are government and the AMA doing an about face on drug marketing?"}, "description": "Now that the government is in the medicine business (Obamacare), it\u2019s looking to stem the rising cost of \u201chealthcare\u201d services \u2014 drugs included.", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Health Tips", "tag": "FDA", "published_time": "2015-11-24T00:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T13:00:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Food and Drug Administration, American Medical Association, Personal Liberty, Bob Livingston, AMA, FDA, Drugs, Medicine"}, "article_summary": "DTC marketing cuts into the marketing budget the drug companies have for marketing drugs to the physicians \u2014 $24 billion was spent in marketing to physicians in 2012.\nThe trigger happened in 1997 when the FDA relaxed the rules for drug advertising direct to the consumer (DTC).\nOf the top 10 drug makers, nine spent more on marketing than on research and development; several of them spent almost twice as much.\nThe federal government, through the Food and Drug Administration, unleashed the pharmaceuticals upon the American people, resulting in massive and unbelievable profits.\nNow the American Medical Association with its 200,000 doctors has decided it wants DTC advertising of drugs and medical devices halted."}
