Prosecutors said real soldiers don't execute women and babies. The jury took 90 minutes to unanimously decide on the death penalty.\n\nTwenty four hours earlier, jurors took just 30 minutes to return the guilty verdicts for two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\n\"These verdicts are among the quickest that I've ever seen in a death penalty case and particular, a death penalty case of this complexity,\" said Scott Rowland, Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney.\n\nThe case had everything from wiretaps to long term surveillance and testimony from his co-conspirator and girlfriend, Emily Matheson.\n\n\"This was a jury who rolled up their sleeves, went to work and worked hard and I think achieved a very just result,\" said Rowland.\n\nBrown said he plans to appeal. Jessica's mother told News 9, \"Hopefully, no other family will have to go through this at his hand.\"\n\nBrown's formal sentencing is August 11th.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An Oklahoma County jury has sentenced a convicted murderer to death.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25892980/fabion-brown-sentence-to-death-for-murder", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25892980_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oklahoma County jury has sentenced a convicted murderer to death.", "title": "Fabion Brown Sentenced To Death For Murder"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25892980_SA.jpg", "description": "An Oklahoma County jury has sentenced a convicted murderer to death.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fabion Brown Sentenced To Death For Murder"}, "wnreadableurl": "fabion-brown-sentence-to-death-for-murder", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/06/27", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,trial,murder,death,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,trial,murder,death,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0ea\"", "article_summary": "An Oklahoma County jury has sentenced a convicted murderer to death.\nBrown said he was hoping for anything besides death after representing himself in his death penalty case.\n\"These verdicts are among the quickest that I've ever seen in a death penalty case and particular, a death penalty case of this complexity,\" said Scott Rowland, Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney.\n\"I just hope they find something that gives them a reason to give something less than death,\" Brown told News 9 before the sentencing verdict.\nDuring the sentencing phase, Oklahoma County prosecutors said Brown hired a gunman so he could get the $400,000 life insurance policy."}
