He reads you every week. Maybe he\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d\n\nSo here goes: Yes, dear sir, listen to your wife. Slouching is bad. It\u2019s bad not only for your physical health, but also for your emotional and social well-being. More about this in a bit.\n\nWithout delay, get that computer on a proper surface (laps can encourage slouching) and get a supportive chair that enables you to sit up straight with your head aligned directly over your shoulders and hips when your eyes are on the screen.\n\nAs a short person who is prone to back pain, I have long been aware of the value of good posture, and seating that minimizes the stress on my spine and the muscles and ligaments that support it. I know within seconds of sitting in a car whether it will hurt my back or neck; when renting, I test car after car until I find one that suits my diminutive frame.\n\nPoor posture can have ill effects that radiate throughout the body, causing back and neck pain, muscle fatigue, breathing limitations, arthritic joints, digestive problems and mood disturbances. It can also create a bad impression when applying for a job, starting a relationship or making new friends.\n\nWe live in a gravitational field, and when our bodies are out of line with the vertical, certain muscles will have to work harder than others to keep us upright. This can result in undue fatigue and discomfort that can outlast the strain that caused them.\n\nIn a study of 110 students at San Francisco State University, half of whom were told to walk in a slumped position and the other half to skip down a hall, the skippers had a lot more energy throughout the day.\n\nAny repetitive or prolonged position \u201ctrains\u201d the body\u2019s muscles and tendons to shorten or lengthen and places stress on bones and joints that can reshape them more or less permanently. Just as walking in high heels can shorten and tighten the Achilles tendons and calf muscles, slouching while sitting hour after hour can result in a persistent slouch, while standing and walking while slouched can lead to permanently rounded shoulders and upper back.\n\nAlthough early humans spent most of their waking hours walking, running and standing, today in developed countries, 75 percent of work is performed while sitting. Most people sit going to and from work and while relaxing after work. The longer people sit (or stand) without a change in position and movement, the more likely they will be to develop a postural backache, according to a report in The Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics.\n\n\u201cText neck,\u201d a term coined by a Florida chiropractor, Dean L. Fishman, is a repetitive stress injury resulting from hours spent with the head positioned forward and down while using electronic devices. This leads to tight muscles in the back of the neck and upper back.\n\nAnd those who lean forward while sitting may be inclined to clench their jaws and tighten their facial muscles, causing headache and TMJ \u2014 temporomandibular joint syndrome.\n\nLeaning forward or slouching can also curtail lung capacity as much as 30 percent, reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches body tissues, including the brain, according to Dr. Rene Cailliet, a pioneer in the field of musculoskeletal medicine who died in March.\n\nAdditionally, slouching or sitting in a scrunched position compresses the abdominal organs and may reduce peristaltic action that is important to normal digestion and bowel function.\n\nImproving posture requires a conscious effort and often strengthening and flexibility exercises to correct muscular imbalances, according to Nick Sinfield, a British physiotherapist. For example, exercises that strengthen the core, buttocks muscles and back extensors help correct a slouching posture, he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/04/hfwell28.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "For example, exercises that strengthen the core, buttocks muscles and back extensors help correct a slouching posture, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told him repeatedly this is bad for his body \u2014 he should sit up straight \u2014 but he pays no attention to me.\nSlouching is bad.\nAdditionally, slouching or sitting in a scrunched position compresses the abdominal organs and may reduce peristaltic action that is important to normal digestion and bowel function.\nIt can also create a bad impression when applying for a job, starting a relationship or making new friends."}
