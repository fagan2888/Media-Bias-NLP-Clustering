I went to an urgent care center, as advised, but it had no flu tests and the X-ray machine was down. The next urgent center had a three-hour wait, and the receptionist said to go home and wait for them to text me.\n\nEventually, I found a physician\u2019s assistant at a different clinic and got the right antibiotics and steroids. The next week, as my cough persisted, I had to wait another day and a half to see my longtime PA.\n\nIt all worked out, but the experience drove home a phenomenon in health care: the year-end rush.\n\nAccess to care is a huge issue in Texas, because almost 1 in 3 working age adults has no health insurance. But people with coverage and their own doctors can face obstacles, too.\n\nMedical offices are often jammed these days, and patients and providers can feel the stress. Some spike in business is unavoidable, because flu season arrived early and more now have health coverage, thanks to Obamacare. There\u2019s also a doctor shortage.\n\nBut much of the surge stems from the way we design insurance and incentivize treatment. Deductibles, co-payments and pretax spending accounts encourage people to delay elective care in the first half of the year and then rack it up in the last quarter.\n\nHigher deductibles\n\nAnnual deductibles are more common and growing larger. This year, the average deductible for single coverage was $1,217, almost 50 percent higher than five years ago, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.\n\nThe share of workers paying big annual deductibles has nearly doubled since 2009. Once they pay that nut, people are eager to catch up on their care before the meter resets on Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a utilization spike across the board,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Crow, president of Village Health Partners, a family care practice in Plano. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to get mammograms, colonoscopies, knee surgeries, even extra visits for a chronic condition. When flu season hits about the same time, you have a double whammy.\u201d\n\nLast winter, flu didn\u2019t hit hard until the first week of January, when North Texas providers were overwhelmed with patients. This time, flu cases increased sharply around Thanksgiving.\n\nStill, some of the year-end rush is unnecessary. Under the Affordable Care Act, preventive treatments, such as physicals and mammograms, are covered completely, with no deductible required. They cost the same in January as in December \u2014 nothing out of pocket.\n\nThat\u2019s an opportunity to shift customers to early next year, with a big caveat: Roughly 1 in 4 insured workers is still in a plan that doesn\u2019t comply with the ACA, according to Kaiser.\n\nTheir coverage provisions are grandfathered in. Most employers\u2019 insurance pays for annual physicals, Crow said, but many haven\u2019t added colonoscopies. So patients who want that exam may have a real reason to act before the year ends.\n\nMany people also have health spending accounts funded with pretax dollars. In flexible spending accounts, rollovers are limited beyond the calendar year. But HSAs, which are part of high-deductible plans, allow all unspent money to carry over.\n\nHSAs were used by 20 percent of employees this year, up from 4 percent in 2006, Kaiser said. While they eliminate one timing factor, more patients focus on taking advantage of deductibles they already paid.\n\n\u2018Artificial deadline\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating an artificial deadline,\u201d said Sara Collins, vice president of health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund in New York. \u201cWe should be encouraging people to get care when they need it, not when the calendar\u2019s about to turn.\u201d\n\nHigh deductibles have slowed health spending, so they\u2019re likely to keep growing. But other developments could reduce the seasonal squeeze.\n\nMore providers are focused on the retail experience, expanding hours and taking appointments online. One website, zocdoc.com, connects patients with in-network doctors to see them the same day. Village Health, whose brand is built around access, will open a Sunday clinic next month so it can offer appointments all week. Others have online consultations and technology to monitor patients at home.\n\n\u201cProviders are being paid on quality, not just volume,\u201d said Phil Miller of Merritt Hawkins, a physician search firm in Irving and a division of AMN Healthcare.\n\nVolume remains the No. 1 factor in physician pay plans, he said. But quality measures, including customer service, account for a growing share. That\u2019s why patients are often surveyed after procedures.\n\nAt Village Health, employees answer the phones before the clinic opens and for an hour after it closes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t staff for the once-a-year spike,\u201d Crow said. \u201cBut you need a plan to react if you want happy customers.\u201d\n\nFollow Mitchell Schnurman on Twitter at @mitchschnurman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A flu outbreak doesn't help a system that's already stressed by the way we design insurance and incentivize treatment.", "og": {"description": "A flu outbreak doesn't help a system that's already stressed by the way we design insurance and incentivize treatment.", "title": "Schnurman: Doctors' offices jammed during health care\u2019s seasonal spike", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20141215-schnurman-doctors-offices-jammed-during-health-cares-seasonal-spike.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20141215-nb_15waitingroomlede.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_15waitingroomLEDE.jpg", "height": 422}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-12-16T16:04:15Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-12-16T03:18:38Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Schnurman: Doctors' offices jammed during health care\\u2019s seasonal spike\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20141215-schnurman-doctors-offices-jammed-during-health-cares-seasonal-spike.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2094481\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-16T03:18:38Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-12-16T03:18:38Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8e4\"", "article_summary": "It all worked out, but the experience drove home a phenomenon in health care: the year-end rush.\nSome spike in business is unavoidable, because flu season arrived early and more now have health coverage, thanks to Obamacare.\n\u2018Artificial deadline\u2019\u201cWe\u2019re creating an artificial deadline,\u201d said Sara Collins, vice president of health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund in New York.\nMany people also have health spending accounts funded with pretax dollars.\nAccess to care is a huge issue in Texas, because almost 1 in 3 working age adults has no health insurance."}
