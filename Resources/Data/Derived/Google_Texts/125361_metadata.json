Sebelius, \u201chas the potential to be very disastrous,\u201d said Sandra Fluke, the activist attorney and state Senate candidate who became a national name when Rush Limbaugh attacked her advocacy for contraceptive coverage. In an interview late last week, Fluke warned of far-reaching consequences for women\u2019s and workers\u2019 rights; responded to arguments from Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry, and weighed in on California\u2019s intra-Democratic disagreements over fracking, prisons and labor. A condensed version of our conversation follows.\n\nWhat is the worst-case scenario here in terms of what the court could do?\n\nWell, unfortunately, the worst-case scenario is a really frightening scenario \u2026\n\nThis decision by the Supreme Court has the potential to be very disastrous. Not only for the women who could lose access \u2013 affordable access \u2013 to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, because their for-profit bosses could decide to deny that access. But also because it could really damage the careful balance of our religious liberty protections, which we\u2019ve all fought to create for so long.\n\nThere\u2019s real possibility for damage here, in that it could allow for-profit corporations and their owners to decide which types of healthcare are important enough to be covered on insurance for their employees. And given that the vast majority of us get our insurance \u2026 through our employers, this could have grave consequences for health insurance access \u2014 for affordable healthcare access. But also for a host of other legal protections \u2026\n\nThe same reasoning that protects the laws that are at stake on Tuesday is the reasoning that protects our non-discrimination laws. And we\u2019ve seen in the past employers who have said that they should not have to pay women and men equal wages, because that was against their belief \u2026 We\u2019ve seen even recently challenges saying that they should not have to employ persons who are gay.\n\nThere could be wide-ranging impacts.\n\nTed Cruz and a few of his Senate colleagues submitted an amicus brief arguing the Obama administration has been \u201crefusing to enforce\u201d other ACA provisions for \u201cits own secular policy reasons,\u201d and \u201cThe federal government cannot grant special favor to the secular over the religious. Accordingly, the contraception mandate cannot withstand scrutiny under either the First Amendment or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d What do you make of that argument?\n\nI think that the Affordable Care Act is a massive piece of legislation that needs to be implemented in a careful and thoughtful manner. And that\u2019s what all of us as advocates are pushing for. And I believe that that\u2019s what the administration is striving to do. And that any provisions that have been temporarily delayed or altered, that\u2019s to make the law function smoothly and to ensure that the most people have affordable access to health insurance coverage.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not about prioritizing one group of citizens over another. It\u2019s about how to roll out this implementation in a way that is beneficial for the most folks.\n\nThe idea that the government is trying to \u201cgrant special favor to the secular over the religious\u201d \u2013 do you see any grounds for that?\n\nNo.\n\nIn the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen a Supreme Court decision finding that the \u201cministerial exception\u201d protected a church-run school even if it fired a teacher for asserting her rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act; we\u2019ve seen a firestorm of controversy over the vetoed Arizona bill that would have strengthened the right to deny people service due to religious convictions; we\u2019ve seen debates among supporters of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act about how broadly to exempt religious employers; and we see this Supreme Court challenge to the contraception mandate. Is there any guiding principle you bring to bear in considering each of these cases?\n\nI think that we have to protect religious beliefs of individuals, but a corporation does not have religious beliefs. A corporation is not a person.\n\nAnd this \u2014 many of these cases \u2014 are really trying to build upon the damage done by the Citizens United decision. So I believe in protecting the religious beliefs of individuals, but not in corporations.\n\nAnd I believe that when you enter into the marketplace as a corporation, and choose to do business with the public and have employees, then the public and those employees also deserve protection. And it\u2019s about finding the right balance of ensuring everyone\u2019s health and safety and access to healthcare, and that other people are able to access the services and employment that they need, while continuing to protect the religious beliefs of individuals.\n\nShould there be civil rights protection in public accommodation for people who are LGBT?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIs that something that should happen at the state level, or federal level, or both?\n\nI think it should be at both levels. And a number of states have those types of protections. But we need them in every state and federally as well.\n\nIs it good policy to give religious objections greater deference than other kinds of objections someone might have based in moral convictions?\n\nWell, I think we need to look at all moral objections similarly. We should not be in the business of determining which religious convictions are more sincere or more reasonable than others.\n\nAnd that really points to part of the problem here \u2026 If we allow for-profit corporations and owners to have freedom to not follow generally applicable laws that everyone else follows, then we are potentially granting that ability to some folks with very, very extreme and dangerous beliefs.\n\nRush Limbaugh got a lot of attention for calling you a \u201cslut.\u201d Did his comments reveal anything broader about Republican or conservative attitudes about women or about sex?\n\nI think that what was revealed in those comments is that there are still a lot of folks who want to silence particular communities \u2014 not only women, but also people of color and LGBTQ folks. And it\u2019s up to the rest of us, who are members of those communities and allies, to stand up and ensure that everyone\u2019s voices are heard in this country.\n\nTurning then to California: Sen. Leno and Sen. Steinberg are proposing to hike the state minimum wage to $13 an hour in 2017.
