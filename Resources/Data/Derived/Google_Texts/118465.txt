Investigators say this men held up a Dollar General on Red Bank Road on Friday morning. Berkeley County Sheriff’s Office

A suspect in an armed robbery near Goose Creek on Friday morning was arrested just a few hours after his surveillance photo was released.

The firearm was also recovered, Berkeley County spokesman Michael Mule said. The suspect is under 18 and charges were pending, Mule said. The teen’s name was not immediately released.

The robbery of the Dollar General at 1326 Red Bank Road was reported around 10:15 a.m. A man walked into the store, paid for a hoodie, flannel shirt and blue bandanna, displayed a gun, grabbed money from the cash register and fled on foot, Mule said.

Images from the surveillance video were released to media outlets about 1:30 p.m. The images prompted calls that led to the teen’s arrest, Mule said.
