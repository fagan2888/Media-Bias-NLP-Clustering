Adherence is complicated by the fact that patients may miss the mild \"high\" that many associate with periods of creativity, says Kay Redfield Jamison, PhD.\n\nPublished By: Mary K. Caffrey\n\nKay Redfield Jamison, PhD, understands why patients with bipolar disorder resist taking medication. The professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine resisted taking lithium herself to treat her own bipolar disease, which she has written about in her book An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Mood and Madness.It\u2019s not just the usual issues with side effects like weight gain, however. Jamison told attendees Friday at the 28th US Psychiatric and Mental Health Congress, being held in San Diego, California. First, medication adherence is an inherently human problem that is not limited to mental health, where it\u2019s an especially big problem.Second, therapies to control bipolar disorder eliminate the \u201chigh\u201d that some with the disease feel fuels their creativity, propels their work, and is an essential part of their nature. Using medication to take away the dangerous parts of the disease, which make it impossible to hold a job or maintain relationships, can also dull their sense of who they are.\u201cOur major clinical problem is not that we don\u2019t have good treatment,\u201d Jamison said. \u201cThe problem is that people with bipolar disorder don\u2019t take the treatments.\u201d A review of 25 studies found that between 40% and 45% of patients with bipolar disorder do not take medication as prescribed; fortunately, she said, the Affordable Care Act is putting more resources into understanding this problem, since these patients account for a disproportionate share of patients who land in emergency rooms and drive up healthcare costs.Poor adherence is not limited to the mental health arena; it seems to be part of \u201chuman nature,\u201d Jamison said. A study of patients exposed to anthrax in 2001 who were given ciprofloxacin found that only 61% to 64% of the patients in Washington, DC, and New Jersey took the medication as prescribed. Cardiologists and professionals who treat patients with diabetes constantly lament their inability to get patients to stick with proper diets, exercise, and medication routines, she said.When it comes to bipolar disorder, those most at risk of poor adherence experience euphoria and grandiosity. \u201cThe people who are most likely to respond to lithium are those with euphoric, expansive grandiose mania\u2014and they are also the people who are least likely to take it,\u201d Jamison said.Studies show it may take 2 to 4 hospitalizations for the reality to sink in that medication forever is the reality, not just something the doctor is recommending. A big challenge is the age of the patients involved\u2014bipolar disorder first arrives in the late teens or young adulthood, at time of growing independence and risk-taking. (The average age of onset for bipolar I is 18.1 years; for bipolar II, it is 21.7 years.) The positive aspects of mild manic states also interfere with attempts to encourage good adherence, Jamison explained. The \u201chigh\u201d patients experience is \u201cas addictive as it gets, and people will do anything to recapture that,\u201d she said.Side effects are real, and physicians must balance each patient\u2019s tolerance with the medication\u2019s effectiveness. With lithium, for example, a study by Gelenberg,et al, showed that higher doses of 0.8 to 1.0 mmol per liter produced excellent symptom control but more side effects and poorer adherence rates, while doses of 0.4 to 0.6 mmol per liter resulted in fewer side effects and better adherence, but relapse rates were higher.Jamison said that a period of depression often follows a psychotic episode; this is normal in the disease cycle, but patients often blame the medication. But the biggest problem by far is that patients stop medication once they feel better. \u201cThey see no point,\u201d she said.Bipolar disorder is progressive, and \u201cIt has a very real impact on the brain,\u201d Jamison said. Patients who don\u2019t get treatment have very high rates of suicide.\u201cIt can take 8 to 10 years for a good diagnosis\u2014this is when denial is highest and suicide is most likely,\u201d she said. Denial is common at the onset of the disease, because most patients and perhaps physicians will try to rule out other causes for behavior.Statistics from Scandinavian countries, which do a better job at early intervention, show that suicide rates are much higher among patients who were not taking lithium. Suicide is also associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, low socioeconomic status, and alcohol or substance abuse.What can clinicians do? \u201cYou really want to ask patients about their experience of highs,\u201d Jamison said. The euphoria of the disease should not be romanticized, but it must be acknowledged so that the patient is taken seriously, she said.Patients and family members must also be given a clear picture of what\u2019s ahead of they fail to take medication. Parents, in particular, can be \u201chugely important or actively undermining,\u201d in their response. It\u2019s important to encourage patients to take medication and get regular psychotherapy, she said.Bipolar disease is not new, Jamison noted. It may have been called other things over the centuries, but \u201cHippocrates described mania and melancholia. The Chinese were diagnosing it, and had criteria.\u201d The difference, of course, was the absence of therapy.\u201cWe know what happens to people if they don\u2019t get treatment, and it isn\u2019t good.\u201d1.
