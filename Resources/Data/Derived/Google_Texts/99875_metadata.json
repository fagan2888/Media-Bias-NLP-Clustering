She said her grandmother, 73-year-old Maryjean Sartin, was killed, one of four deaths in Columbia and Laurel from likely tornadoes that tore through the area.\n\n\u201cI had left the house to go pick up a friend to go to Hattiesburg and do some Christmas shopping,\u201d Ms. Bordelon said. \u201cBut the weather turned so bad that we decided to wait. By the time I got home, I\u2019d rounded the corner and then saw all the damage.\u201d\n\nMs. Bordelon said her aunt was injured and is hospitalized.\n\nAlthough she identified her grandmother, the authorities had not released the names of the victims as of Wednesday.\n\nChasity Magee, 32, owned the trailer that flipped onto Ms. Sartin\u2019s home. She said she and her two children were at her mother\u2019s home about a mile away while the storm raged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI saw pictures of the trailer park, but it didn\u2019t register to me that that was my trailer,\u201d Ms. Magee said.\n\nShe said when she returned Wednesday, she learned of her neighbor\u2019s death. Ms. Magee climbed through a window of her wrecked mobile home to retrieve some personal items, but that was about all she could save.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t salvage Christmas for them,\u201d she said of her 7-year-old and 5-month-old children, \u201cbut we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll all be O.K.\u201d\n\nThe destructive system damaged communities from Mississippi to Georgia. Flood warnings were issued for several counties in Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Louisiana.\n\nIn Columbia, police officers were stationed at all major intersections after traffic lights were either swept away or destroyed. At least 20 people were injured there, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials.\n\nUtility crews worked Wednesday to restore electricity to the area.\n\nAbout 6,000 people were without power after the storm, Gov. Phil Bryant said at a news conference in Columbia, about 80 miles southeast of the state capital of Jackson.\n\nMr. Bryant toured the stricken area by helicopter and by vehicle. He said state emergency officials believed the destruction was caused by a tornado, although the National Weather Service has yet to confirm that.\n\nState emergency workers were evaluating the damage in Columbia, which is in Marion County, and in Jones County to the northeast. Three of the four people killed were in mobile homes and the fourth at a business.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141224201242, "twitter": {"description": "The destructive system damaged communities from Mississippi to Georgia.
