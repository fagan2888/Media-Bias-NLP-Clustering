An analysis of new data on insurance sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges shows that many people will be facing sizable rate increases unless they switch plans.

The analysis over the weekend by The New York Times, using federal data released hours before the exchanges opened for business Saturday, suggests that while switching may get a better rate, the situation varies widely from state to state.

The possibility of switching to obtain a lower premium seems to be true in Alabama where there is new competition on the exchange, and some less expensive options than were offered last year.

Last year Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama was the only insurer offering plans in all 67 counties. Humana offered and still does offer plans in Jefferson, Shelby and Madison.

This year UnitedHealthcare began offering plans in all counties.

In Alabama, a spot check of counties on the Times interactive map, showed modest to low increases in monthly premiums for the lowest cost Silver plan:

Jefferson County from $255 in 2014 to $262 for 2015, a 2.7 percent increase;

Madison, $252 to $255, 1.1 percent;

Baldwin, $234 to $254, 8.4 percent;

Mobile, $247 to $242, -2.4 percent;

Montgomery, $242 to $255, 5.3 percent;

Tuscaloosa, $224 to $243, 8.4 percent.

AL.com has previously reported that a spot check of three Alabama cities found that BCBSAL did not have any of the lowest or second lowest cost Silver plan - the most widely chosen plan - in any of the cities.

From that previous report:

In Birmingham the lowest Silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker is Humana Silver 4600 with a base rate of $262 per month, up 3 percent from last year's lowest Silver plan. The second lowest Silver plan in the region including Birmingham is the UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 which had a price of $264. That was a 3 percent increase over last year's lowest Silver plan, which was Blue Cross' Blue Saver. The Blue Saver is now priced at $280.

In Huntsville , the lowest priced Silver plan is UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 at $254 per month, a 1 percent increase from the previous year's lowest price. The second lowest Silver is Humana Silver 4600/PPO, a premium which also saw a 1 percent increase from last year's second lowest Silver.

In Mobile, the lowest priced Silver plan is the UnitedHealthcare Silver Compass 3600 at $242, a 2 percent drop from last year's lowest priced Silver. The second lowest Silver is United Healthcare Silver Compass 5000 at $255 per month, a 3 percent drop.

One thing to remember: In general, the lower the premium, the higher the deductible.

For example, in Birmingham the lowest Silver plan for a 40-year-old nonsmoker is Humana Silver 4600 with a base rate of $262 per month. It has a $4,600 deductible. By comparison, BCBSAL's Blue Value Silver has premium of $280 with a $2,400 deductible.

The estimated out of pocket maximums were similar for those two plans, $6,300 for Humana and $6,350 for BCBSAL.

The Times analysis showed in about a fifth of the counties in the United States using the federal insurance exchange, premiums for the lowest-priced silver plans will increase by 10 percent or more.

Maine, Montana , New Hampshire, and parts of Mississippi and South Dakota will see rate decreases, the Times reported.

"Consumers should shop around," Marilyn B. Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the Times. "With new options available this year, they're likely to find a better deal."

Open enrollment at Healthcare.gov continues until Feb. 15.
