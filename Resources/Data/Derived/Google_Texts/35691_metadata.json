It was tough for all of us. We were in a funk for a good 6 months,\u201d says the Congressman.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s come up with a message to revive the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is show the country were not just the opposition party but the proposition party.\u201d\n\nHe spoke on how Obamacare has failed Americans and he blames the Democrats for that. He also cautioned Iowans to be careful of whom they fall for as political season gains momentum.\n\n\u201cSo the next time you have a famous politician coming through Iowa breezing through the towns talking about big government let's be a little more skeptical.\u201d\n\nHowever the Iowa Democratic Party claims the GOP isn't what people want. Party chair, Scott Brennen issued this statement.\n\n'Republicans like Terry Branstad and Paul Ryan keep promising Iowans something fresh and something to celebrate about - but all we keep seeing are the same stale, backwards policies of the past that Iowans don`t like and Republicans don`t win with. Terry Branstad should spend his birthday reflecting on his failed year as governor and simply not wishing that things will get better next year.\u201d\n\nGOP Party Chairman, A.J. Spiker disagreed.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don't have anything good to say about Republicans in general and given the failure of Obamacare I think they're really looking to lash out at any Republican they can.\u201d\n\nCongressman Ryan made no mention of running in the 2016 presidential race but he noted in his speech he should come back to Iowa more often.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday, the Governor will celebrate his 67th birthday but on Saturday night, 700 of his closest friends celebrated a few hours early.
