Your premiums will be going down.\u2019 But, in fact, the letter is completely contradictory to that,\u201d said Cavallaro.\n\nJamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog, said major health insurance companies are simply taking advantage of the confusion surrounding the new health care law to engage in price gouging.\n\n\u201cThis is not the fault of the Affordable Care Act or President Obama. This is the fault of the insurance company. This is a handful of insurance companies that have convinced a very gullible state agency, Covered California, to allow them to drop plans that could very easily\u2026with a few little tweaks\u2026 be compliant under the Affordable Care Act, and people wouldn\u2019t have to leave their plans,\u201d said Court.\n\nCBS2\u2019s Randy Paige reached out to Anthem Blue Cross for comment, but was referred to a health industry trade group.\n\n\u201cThe facts are there are considerable new changes under the Affordable Care Act that will be beneficial to people, but those changes come at a cost. Some people will pay more, some people will pay less, and we need to continue to have a conversation about the affordability of medical care,\u201d said Nicole Evans of the California Association of Health Plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some Anthem Blue Cross members have received letters that their health insurance plans are no longer available due to the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/21/some-anthem-blue-cross-members-say-obamacare-is-not-as-advertised/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deborah-cavallaro.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deborah-cavallaro.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Some Anthem Blue Cross members have received letters that their health insurance plans are no longer available due to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Some Anthem Blue Cross Members Say Obamacare Is Not As Advertised"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deborah-cavallaro.jpg?w=625", "description": "Some Anthem Blue Cross members have received letters that their health insurance plans are no longer available due to the Affordable Care Act.", "site": "CBSLA", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Some Anthem Blue Cross Members Say Obamacare Is Not As Advertised"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of LA/OC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Los Angeles", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "keywords": "local, news, syndicated local, watch + listen, affordable care act, anthem blue cross, consumer watchdog, deborah cavallaro, health insurance, insurance, obamacare, plans, policy", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5c05896c022a6d5696298ac60bad5bcf?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, anthem blue cross, consumer watchdog, deborah cavallaro, health insurance, insurance, obamacare, plans, policy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ae7\"", "article_summary": "CBS2\u2019s Randy Paige reached out to Anthem Blue Cross for comment, but was referred to a health industry trade group.\nPLAYA DEL REY (CBSLA.com) \u2014 Some Anthem Blue Cross members have received letters that their health insurance plans are no longer available due to the Affordable Care Act.\nDeborah Cavallaro got a letter from Anthem Blue Cross which stated, \u201cBecause of the requirements of the new laws, we can no longer offer your current Anthem policy.\u201d\u201cI was infuriated, totally infuriated,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe facts are there are considerable new changes under the Affordable Care Act that will be beneficial to people, but those changes come at a cost.\n\u201cThis is not the fault of the Affordable Care Act or President Obama."}
