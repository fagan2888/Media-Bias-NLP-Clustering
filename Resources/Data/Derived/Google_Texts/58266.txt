On April 6, Melissa Harris-Perry invited a fistful of political pundits to MSNBC's New York City studio to discuss the now-dead #CancelColbert Twitter campaign, Colbert's satiric, albeit offensive, anti-Asian tweet (which launched the hashtag) and, of course, what started it all, the announcement of Washington Redskins' owner Dan Snyder's Original Americans Foundation.

Harris-Perry invited to her table Wall Street Journal columnist Jeff Yang, political analyst Zerlina Maxwell, Rutgers University Women and Gender Studies professor Brittany Cooper, and MSNBC anchor Richard Lui.

Not a single Native American was invited to the discussion.
