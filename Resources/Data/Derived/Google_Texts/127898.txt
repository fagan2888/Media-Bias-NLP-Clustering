Fox News’ Eric Bolling and Geraldo Rivera threw down on The O’Reilly Factor tonight over Bill O’Reilly‘s belief that America has gone way far to the left.

O’Reilly said it’s pretty evident when you look at liberal support of #BlackLivesMatter and abortion and other things. Bolling said liberals’ mantra is “give us the vote, we’ll give you more free stuff.”

Rivera rolled his eyes and said that young people have historically been liberal and want things like immigration reform and abortion rights. He even suggested that there are elements of the far-right just as radical as on the left.

Bolling shot back that it used to be that “socialist” was a derogatory word, but now the Democrats have an openly socialist candidate running for president. He said that if America embraces socialism like that, America will be just “average” and not great.
