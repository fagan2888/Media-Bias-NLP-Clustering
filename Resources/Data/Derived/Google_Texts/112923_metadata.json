The problem we\u2019re trying to solve here is giving people a foundation through which they can then become productive citizens,\u201d Obama said at Rutgers University.\n\nObama is also directing the Office of Personnel Management to modify its rules to delay inquiries into criminal histories until later in the hiring process so that individuals with a record have a chance to move past the first step.\n\nWhile the president cannot fully \u201cban the box\u201d on job applications asking about prior criminal background, he encouraged Congress to continue to pursue legislation that does so for federal agencies and contractors so that people who have served time are not automatically barred from those positions.\n\nHe said that too often, criminal records prevent individuals from getting a foot in the door.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t dismiss people at hand simply because of a mistake that they made in the past,\u201d Obama added.\n\nThe president also announced grant programs to give former inmates job and tech training, including a program based in the nation\u2019s capital that will train and place 200 individuals with prior convictions in tech jobs.\n\nThe White House also released new guidance for the Department of Housing and Urban Development on using arrest records in background checks for federal housing, making it easier for former prisoners to apply.\n\nThe announcement builds upon the rare bipartisan coalition forged over the last few years after incarceration rates exploded following a \u201ctough on crime\u201d push in the 1980s that put in place harsh sentencing policies.\n\nCurrently, 2.2 million people are in U.S. prisons or jails, resulting in $80 billion spent on incarceration every year.\n\nOf those, roughly 600,000 individuals are released back into society. Obama said given this number, policies and programs that help former inmates put their lives back on track \u201cpromote[] not only justice and fairness, but also public safety.\u201d\n\nJohn Malcolm, director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, said while the full details remain to be seen, the president\u2019s actions Monday seem to be a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d\n\nHe said given that 95 percent of those who are presently incarcerated will ultimately be released, the U.S. should focus on equipping former inmates with the skills and stability needed to help them become \u201cproductive members of society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in all of our interests to make sure that these individuals are able to develop positive associations, live in a stable environment, and earn a living through gainful employment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, it is highly likely that many of them will return to a life of crime, continue to pose an ongoing threat to public safety, and end up back in prison.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama announced a string of proposals Monday to help former inmates reintegrate into their communities", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama announced a string of proposals Monday to help former inmates reintegrate into their communities", "title": "Obama Announces Plan to Reintegrate Ex-Inmates Into Society", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151102_ObamaCrimJust_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-03T06:57:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WsoBx0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama announced a string of proposals Monday to help former inmates reintegrate into their communities", "title": "Obama Announces Plan to Reintegrate Ex-Inmates Into Society", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151102_ObamaCrimJust_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2015-11-02T20:27:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T06:57:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, criminal justice reform, incarceration, Newark, mandatory minimum, executive action, prison reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16f4\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama announced a string of proposals Monday to help former inmates reintegrate into their communities in the latest extension of the White House\u2019s push for criminal justice reform.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t dismiss people at hand simply because of a mistake that they made in the past,\u201d Obama added.\n\u201cThe problem we\u2019re trying to solve is not just to keep on catching people and putting them back in jail.\nThe problem we\u2019re trying to solve here is giving people a foundation through which they can then become productive citizens,\u201d Obama said at Rutgers University.\nOf those, roughly 600,000 individuals are released back into society."}
