Rucho, sent back here last week by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 at least not within the time frame that challengers to the state\u2019s redistricting plan want.\n\nThat order by the nation\u2019s highest court came on the heels of its earlier decision in a similar case out of Alabama, in which the justices held that the Voting Rights Act required lawmakers to assess whether minorities had the ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice and to draw voting lines in order to facilitate that goal \u2014 not, as Alabama had done, to achieve specific numerical minority percentages.\n\nNorth Carolina lawmakers operated under the same mistaken premise when designing the state\u2019s 2011 plan, according to challengers.\n\nHere\u2019s Eddie Speas, one of the attorneys representing those challengers:\n\nOne of the things we think is important in the Alabama case is that the Alabama legislature engaged in a mechanical process when drawing districts that is inconsistent with the sensitive, strict scrutiny and narrow tailoring that the Supreme Court said has to happen in these redistricting plans. And North Carolina lawmakers were guilty of this sin twice: First they adopted the rule that they would draw majority \u2013 minority districts in numbers proportional to the state\u2019s black population. And then they drew each of those districts to have at least 50 percent total black voting age population.\n\nJust after the Supreme Court order sending the case back, plan challengers asked the state\u2019s high court to expedite the case \u2014 hoping to get a final resolution and any necessary redistricting changes in place in time for elections in 2016.\n\nLawmakers opposed that request yesterday, arguing that they needed time to fully brief the arguments they managed already to outline for the court and citing, ironically, scheduling conflicts they had with trial dates in the federal voter suppression cases.\n\n(Several of the attorneys for the plan\u2019s challengers are also involved in the federal cases.)\n\nIt\u2019s been rare in recent history for the state Supreme Court to hear cases during the summer months.\n\nHowever, with Chief Justice Mark Martin at the helm, the court has begun taking certain cases directly (bypassing the usual appeal process) and setting quick argument dates.\n\nIn October 2014, the court took up five cases for expedited review, including the challenge to the private school voucher program.\n\nThe court has also expedited argument in the appeal of the Governor\u2019s lawsuit against the legislative leaders concerning commission appointments, setting that down for June 30.\n\nTo read the redistricting plan challengers\u2019 request for expedited review, click here.\n\nTo read the lawmakers\u2019 opposition, click here.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d56\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s been rare in recent history for the state Supreme Court to hear cases during the summer months.\nTo read the redistricting plan challengers\u2019 request for expedited review, click here.\nNorth Carolina lawmakers operated under the same mistaken premise when designing the state\u2019s 2011 plan, according to challengers.\nIn papers filed with the state Supreme Court yesterday, lawmakers told the justices there was no reason to expedite proceedings in the North Carolina redistricting case, Dickson v.
