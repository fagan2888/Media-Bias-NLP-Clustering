I don\u2019t like admitting this, but it\u2019s not because it\u2019s at all analogous to admitting I\u2019m a transphobic bigot; on the contrary, my criticism has more to do with my being a progressive idealist, who simultaneously happens to be a cynic and a skeptic. I don\u2019t trust the Kardashian empire or its apparent motivations (specifically, to get rich/famous). I didn\u2019t trust Jenner because I believed she shared them.\n\nBut lately, Jenner has pressed me \u2014 and likely numerous other LGBTQ advocates who questioned her new role as spokesperson for trans issues \u2014 to change my tune, or at least to reevaluate my skepticism. Her recent ESPYs acceptance speech for the Arthur Ashe Courage Award displayed, with an impressive vocabulary, a call for trans activism that was nascent but still so clear in her April interview with Diane Sawyer, when Jenner came out publicly as transgender. Since then, she hasn\u2019t backed down from an opportunity to educate or try to change minds, contrary to what some (myself included) might have expected or feared.\n\nAnd at first glance, it seems the reality star\u2019s widely talked about E! docu-series, \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d is no different. The premiere, which airs on Sunday, outlines trans issues from its opening, addressing the realities of discrimination, violence and gut-wrenchingly high suicide rates upfront. What is clear from the start is that Jenner, who acted as the series\u2019 executive producer, understands the burdens and blessings that come with being an ambassador for a marginalized group. What is also clear is that she knows her audience.\n\nIn addition to being straightforward, \u201cI Am Cait\u201d is also extraordinarily palatable, especially for an audience that is most certainly not dominated by the likes of me \u2014 which is to say, it\u2019s not composed primarily of outspoken feminists with degrees in women\u2019s studies and copies of \u201cGender Trouble\u201d on their bookshelves, who tend to have inordinately high hopes for the public faces of social issues in which they\u2019re deeply invested. While I might have wondered ever-so-critically what Judith Butler would make of Jenner\u2019s show as I watched it, the fact is that many of the people who will tune in to \u201cI Am Cait\u201d have no idea who the hell Judith Butler is. They might never have met a transgender person or known someone close to them who transitioned, and they might not have known the difference between sex and gender until Jenner herself explained it so aptly earlier this year. They might require the sort of gentle spoon-feeding the show provides by way of introduction to the horrors of trans marginalization \u2014 so it\u2019s good that the unfamiliar are for whom \u201cI Am Cait\u201d was clearly made.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the series so vital and so frustrating at the same time. The issues the show raises, specifically about the transgender community\u2019s excessively high rates of murder and suicide, are far too pressing, far too urgent right now for the wider conversation around them to be so \u2026 basic, for lack of a better word. Of course, the fact that such a massive audience requires a Gender Studies 101 lesson from a reality show (for reference, Jenner received over a million Twitter followers within the first four hours of creating her account, a moment captured in the show\u2019s premiere) is precisely why trans violence is such an immediate threat, and why trans people face disproportionate rates of imprisonment, unemployment, homelessness and poverty. It is also why those problems are not going to be fixed overnight, despite the fact that they very much need to be \u2014 because, as Jenner conveys on the show, people\u2019s lives depend on it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jenner's new E! series isn't going to eradicate trans discrimination -- but it is going to change a lot of minds", "title": "If Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s advocacy is what we\u2019ve got, so be it: On \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d trans issues and the beauty of imperfect activists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jenner's new E! series isn't going to eradicate trans discrimination -- but it is going to change a lot of minds", "title": "If Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s advocacy is what we\u2019ve got, so be it: On \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d trans issues and the beauty of imperfect activists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/if_caitlyn_jenners_advocacy_is_what_weve_got_so_be_it_on_i_am_cait_trans_issues_and_the_beauty_of_imperfect_activists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/AP_392736008709-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jenner's new E! series isn't going to eradicate trans discrimination -- but it is going to change a lot of minds", "title": "If Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s advocacy is what we\u2019ve got, so be it: On \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d trans issues and the beauty of imperfect activists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/AP_392736008709-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, caitlyn jenner, Documentary, e! network, Kardashians, LGBTQ advocacy, lgbtq equality, Television, Transgender, transgender discrimination, transgender issues, transgender people", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3836\"", "article_summary": "network, Kardashians, LGBTQ advocacy, lgbtq equality, Television, Transgender, transgender discrimination, transgender issues, transgender people, Life News, Entertainment NewsCaitlyn Jenner\u2019s very public transition this year was not something I really got behind from the beginning.\nThe premiere, which airs on Sunday, outlines trans issues from its opening, addressing the realities of discrimination, violence and gut-wrenchingly high suicide rates upfront.\nBut lately, Jenner has pressed me \u2014 and likely numerous other LGBTQ advocates who questioned her new role as spokesperson for trans issues \u2014 to change my tune, or at least to reevaluate my skepticism.\nI don\u2019t trust the Kardashian empire or its apparent motivations (specifically, to get rich/famous).\nTopics: caitlyn jenner, Documentary, e!"}
