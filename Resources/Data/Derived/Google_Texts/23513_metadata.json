In spring, they were certain.\n\nIn summer, they changed their minds.\n\nAnd in the fall, they realized not only was the economy contracting, it was in the midst of a crisis of historical proportions.\n\nHere are excerpts from the 2008 transcripts of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, released Friday, showing how officials made up and then changed their minds.\n\nJan. 9, 2008\n\nEconomic data \u2014 on layoffs, consumer confidence, industrial production and many other indicators \u2014 comes in weak at the end of 2007. The Fed\u2019s staff economists warn that a recession is a strong possibility.\n\nCHAIRMAN BEN S. BERNANKE: I think there are a lot of indications that we may soon be in a recession. I think a garden-variety recession is an acceptable risk, but I am also concerned that such a downturn might morph into something more serious. . . . Obviously, ex ante it\u2019s extremely hard to tell, but I do think the risks are at least 50 percent at this point that we will see an N.B.E.R. recession this year.\n\nJan. 29-30\n\nThe Fed believes that a slowdown is happening and a recession is likely. But it predicts that the turmoil will pass quickly \u2014 in a matter of months, not years. That said, some officials are much more pessimistic.\n\nJANET L. YELLEN: The severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession. RICHARD FISHER: While there are tales of woe, none of the 30 C.E.O.\u2019s to whom I talked, outside of housing, see the economy trending into negative territory. They see slower growth. Some of them see much slower growth. None of them at this juncture \u2013 the cover of Newsweek notwithstanding, a great contra-indicator, which by the way shows \u201cthe road to recession\u201d on the issue that is about to come out \u2013 see us going into recession. CHARLES EVANS: Our cumulative actions following this meeting should provide noticeable stimulus to the economy by midyear.\u2026 In the absence of further negative developments, growth should improve in the second half of this year. ERIC ROSENGREN: We could soon be or may already be in a recession.\n\nMarch 18\n\nThe Fed sharply revises down its forecasts, and determines that the economy is heading toward a recession.\n\nMR. ROSENGREN: While most analysts are in the process of downgrading their forecasts from skirting to actually having a mild recession, the risk of a more severe downturn is uncomfortably high.\n\nApril 29-30\n\nOfficials broadly agree that the economy is in or near a recession. The question is how deep it will be, and whether a \u201crecessionary dynamic\u201d will take hold \u2013 with fear holding households back from spending, making the recession worse.\n\nFed officials also believe that its steps to stimulate the economy, as well as new policies from Congress, might help to offset or even reverse the decline. Only four regional presidents use the word \u201crecession\u201d to describe the current state of the economy.\n\nMR. EVANS: I\u2019m a little curious as to why [the Fed is not] forecasting a jobless recovery. In the last two recessions, that has been an important element of what followed. JEFFREY M. LACKER: Will the economy go into a substantially deeper recession than we expect? Or coming out of this recession, will the trailing inflation rate be higher than it was when we went in? Although I hope neither of these occurs, my sense right now is that the chance of an increase in trend inflation is more likely than a much deeper recession.\n\nJune 24-25\n\nSome economic data comes in better than expected \u2014 leading Fed officials to conclude that there might not be a recession after all. Several officials become more worried about stoking inflation than poor economic growth.\n\nMR. FISHER: If Robert Frost will forgive me, the woods are not lovely, and they are indeed deep and dark on the price front. Although the tail risk of economic recession has diminished, I think it still exists. \u2026 But the risk of inflation, in my view, has assumed greater depth and breadth since we last met. MR. LACKER: Even if we avoid outright recession, as now seems probable, the unemployment rate is likely to keep rising for a time. MR. BERNANKE: Notwithstanding the stronger-than-expected performance in the second quarter, I think there is an excellent chance that we will still see a recessionary dynamic. \u2026 I do not agree that systemic risk has gone away. I think it is in abeyance. There is perhaps, if anything, excessive confidence in the ability of the Fed to prevent a crisis situation from metastasizing.\n\nAug. 5\n\nFed officials continue to believe the economy might skirt recession.\n\nJAMES BULLARD: Labor markets have been weak, but I am not as pessimistic as most on this dimension. \u2026 I think the labeling game can mislead us in our thinking about the economy. The main contribution that the [Fed] can make to the economy is to keep inflation low and stable. MR. LACKER: I expect sluggish growth to continue through the remainder of the year, with a pickup beginning sometime next year. Housing is likely to continue to be a drag, though a diminishing one, until then.\n\nSept. 16\n\nFinancial markets are deteriorating rapidly, taking up much of the policy makers\u2019 attention.\n\nELIZABETH A. DUKE: Some small retail centers are showing softness with the small storefronts, and in areas like Michigan, they\u2019re worried about losing the anchor tenants. Other than that, everything is O.K. The other consumer credit feels like a mild recession but, again, is normally cyclical. MR. BERNANKE: I see the prospects for economic growth in the foreseeable future as quite weak, notwithstanding the second quarter\u2019s strength. I think what we saw in the recent labor reports removes any real doubt that we are in a period that will be designated as an official N.B.E.R. recession.\n\nOct. 7\n\nFed officials start to realize the economy is worse than they thought \u2013 but how bad?\n\nEVANS: The only thing keeping us from calling this a recession is the official people who are in charge of doing that. ROBERT H. RASCHE, STANDING IN FOR JAMES BULLARD: There\u2019s still a significant probability that any recession will be quite mild. We have acted pre-emptively, aggressively, and unilaterally since the beginning of the year against the risk of an economic slowdown. We can afford to be patient.\n\nOct. 28-29\n\nFed officials concur: It\u2019s bad. It\u2019s very, very bad. They slash their growth forecasts and recognize that the rest of the world is in for a rocky few quarters as well. Things are so bad that Mr. Fisher of the Dallas Fed declines to describe the economic conditions in his district \u2014 he wants to talk only about what the Fed should do.\n\nMS. YELLEN: In the run-up to Halloween, we have had a witch\u2019s brew of news. Sorry. The downward trajectory of economic data has been hair-raising. \u2026 It is becoming abundantly clear that we are in the midst of a serious global meltdown. THOMAS M. HOENIG: Down is where we\u2019re going. How much, though, is speculation right now. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that anyone does until we begin to see things settle out. CHARLES PLOSSER: We have been lowering the funds rate since January, largely in anticipation of a recession or to mitigate the chances of one occurring. Now, it may finally have arrived. Does that mean we have to lower more? TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER: I don\u2019t see a good case for monetary policy gradualism in the current context. The risks are too great. If we\u2019re too tentative, the damage to the financial system and to the real economy could be much greater and much harder to correct.\n\nDec. 15-16\n\nThe only question is how bad it will be.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140221152353, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Bernanke, Ben S", "org": "Federal Open Market Committee;Federal Reserve System", "keywords": "Bernanke Ben S,Recession and Depression,United States Economy,Federal Open Market Committee,Federal Reserve System,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/How the Fed Saw a Recession, Then Didn't, Then Did ( 20140221 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Annie Lowrey", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Annie Lowrey", "byl": "Annie Lowrey", "twitter": {"description": "In the course of 2008, the policy makers of the Federal Reserve went back and forth on their assessment of the economic climate, even after a recession was in fact under way.", "title": "How the Fed Saw a Recession, Then Didn't, Then Did", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/how-the-fed-saw-a-recession-then-didnt-then-did/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@AnnieLowrey", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002727245, "description": "In the course of 2008, the policy makers of the Federal Reserve went back and forth on their assessment of the economic climate, even after a recession was in fact under way.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 21, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1393014233, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-02-21T20:31:51-05:00"}, "utime": 20140221203151, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140221, "pdate": 20140221, "des": "Recession and Depression;United States Economy", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "In the course of 2008, the policy makers of the Federal Reserve went back and forth on their assessment of the economic climate, even after a recession was in fact under way.", "title": "How the Fed Saw a Recession, Then Didn't, Then Did", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/how-the-fed-saw-a-recession-then-didnt-then-did/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/how-the-fed-saw-a-recession-then-didnt-then-did/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How the Fed Saw a Recession, Then Didn't, Then Did", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 21, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd974c\"", "article_summary": "June 24-25Some economic data comes in better than expected \u2014 leading Fed officials to conclude that there might not be a recession after all.\nJan. 29-30The Fed believes that a slowdown is happening and a recession is likely.\nMarch 18The Fed sharply revises down its forecasts, and determines that the economy is heading toward a recession.\nAlthough the tail risk of economic recession has diminished, I think it still exists.\nFed officials also believe that its steps to stimulate the economy, as well as new policies from Congress, might help to offset or even reverse the decline."}
