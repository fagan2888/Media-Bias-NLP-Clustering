Rand Paul (R-KY) is visiting Guatemala to perform pro bono eye surgeries, a trip his political advisers are saying is strictly charity work but offers an important platform for the Kentucky Republican at the epicenter of the border crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor for me to be able to use my skills as an ophthalmologist to give back to the community,\u201d Paul told Breitbart News. \u201cI am thrilled to join a team of ophthalmologists in Guatemala to perform life changing and sight-restoring surgeries.\u201d\n\nWhile many details of the trip are temporarily withheld for security reasons, Paul\u2019s trip is being run by the Moran Eye Center from the University of Utah. It\u2019s funded by charity\u2013no taxpayer dollars will be used for Paul\u2019s mission. Spokesman Sergio Gor told Breitbart News he\u2019ll be meeting with several patients of his from who can now see after Paul performed surgery on them when they were younger.\n\nThe team of doctors is expected to perform around 300 surgeries, Gor said, over the course of several days in Guatemala.\n\nWhile Paul isn\u2019t pushing a political angle, thousands of unaccompanied children are currently traveling illegally from Guatemala to the U.S., and the nation has hosted several key delegations of American lawmakers in recent weeks.\n\nThe pro bono work also gives Paul a chance to offer an apolitical perspective of himself to voters headed into what\u2019s expected to be a brutal battle for the GOP nomination in 2016.\n\nPaul\u2019s trip allows him to say he supports private charity that isn\u2019t funded by the government, and that he wants to help the people in Central America who are legitimately struggling. But he doesn\u2019t want to do so through encouraging U.S. government intervention, or illegal immigration to the U.S.\n\nBut Paul\u2019s team is adamant the trip is apolitical. When Paul\u2019s hometown paper, the Lexington Herald-Leader, asked him what the political ramifications were for the trip, Paul replied that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something I kind of miss in my life, and I want to be able to give back,\u201d Paul told the local paper.\n\nThe circumstances make it a key political opportunity.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t see him attached to just the ideological or partisan policy debates that take place in Washington,\u201d veteran GOP consultant Kevin Madden told the Kentucky newspaper. \u201cHe can step out of that and let people see him through a different lens, that of a doctor helping people.\u201d\n\nWhile the vast majority of Guatemala\u2019s population suffers from harsh economic conditions, there is a sliver at the top in Guatemala\u2013the \u201cone percent,\u201d or the elites\u2013who are doing more than fine. The disparity between the rich and the poor in this country goes back centuries.\n\n\u201cThis unequal pattern dates back to the colonial era when the Spanish crown granted large extensions of land to colonizers,\u201d the World Bank wrote.\n\nThe income disparity here seems more up-and-down and all over the place when it comes from one person to another than the geography of the nation. In between Guatemala\u2019s two coasts are mountains, valleys, volcanoes and ruins, and laced throughout the peaks and hollows is what appears to the naked eye as a developed nation.\n\nWhile landing at Guatemala City international airport, one can\u2019t help but notice the hundreds, maybe thousands, of residences for inner city families below as the plane gets lower and lower\u2013row upon row of rusted tin roofs lining dusty dirt roads, conditions Americans wouldn\u2019t let happen on U.S. soil. But drive around the nation\u2019s capital city for a while, and you\u2019ll find luxurious casinos, Chuck E. Cheese pizza parlors with video games for kids, brand new McDonald\u2019s and Burger King locations shinier than American counterparts, Shell gas stations, booming supermarkets, big box electronic stores, and billboards pushing the cutting edge of culture\u2013so sharp that if the language weren\u2019t in Spanish, Guatemala City would feel a lot like Los Angeles, California.\n\nPaul raised tens of thousands of dollars through various donors, including real estate magnate Donald Trump, to help cover the Moran Eye Center\u2019s trip costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us to bring attention to the global burden of blindness, because I don\u2019t think people really realize how much of it is out there and how much of it is preventable and curable,\u201d Michael Yei, the Moran Eye Center\u2019s outreach manager, told the Lexington Herald-Leader.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul Heads To Guatemala To Conduct Charity Eye Surgeries", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul Heads To Guatemala To Conduct Charity Eye Surgeries", "title": "Rand Paul Heads To Guatemala To Conduct Charity Eye Surgeries - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Republicans/rand-paul-cpac-2014-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/16/rand-paul-ventures-to-guatemala-to-conduct-charity-eye-surgeries-for-needy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul Heads To Guatemala To Conduct Charity Eye Surgeries", "title": "Rand Paul Heads To Guatemala To Conduct Charity Eye Surgeries - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Congress/Senate-Republicans/rand-paul-cpac-2014-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Rand Paul, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-08-16T19:40:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b36\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is an honor for me to be able to use my skills as an ophthalmologist to give back to the community,\u201d Paul told Breitbart News.\nPaul\u2019s trip allows him to say he supports private charity that isn\u2019t funded by the government, and that he wants to help the people in Central America who are legitimately struggling.\nThe team of doctors is expected to perform around 300 surgeries, Gor said, over the course of several days in Guatemala.\nPaul raised tens of thousands of dollars through various donors, including real estate magnate Donald Trump, to help cover the Moran Eye Center\u2019s trip costs.\nBut Paul\u2019s team is adamant the trip is apolitical."}
