Congratulations.\n\nBut I have some disturbing news for you. You\u2019re paying a big price \u2013 and about to pay far more.\n\nFirst, as you may have noticed, most of your companies aren\u2019t growing nearly as fast as they did before the Great Recession. Your sales are sputtering, and your stock prices are fragile.\n\nThat\u2019s because you forgot that your workers are also consumers. As you\u2019ve pushed wages downward, you\u2019ve also squeezed your customers so tight they can hardly afford to buy what you have to sell.\n\nConsumer spending comprises 70 percent of the American economy. But the typical family is earning less today than it did in 2000, in terms of real purchasing power.\n\nMost of the economic gains have gone to you and others like you who spend only a small fraction of what they rake in. That spells trouble for the economy \u2013 and for you.\n\nYou\u2019ve tried to lift your share prices artificially by borrowing money at low interest rates and using it to buy back your shares of stock. But this party trick works only so long. Besides, interest rates are starting to rise.\n\nSecond, you\u2019ve instructed your Republican lackeys to reduce your and your corporation\u2019s taxes so much over the last three decades \u2013 while expanding subsidies and bailouts going your way \u2013 that the government is running out of money.\n\nThat means many of the things you and your businesses rely on government to do \u2013 build and maintain highways, bridges, tunnels, and other physical infrastructure; produce high-quality basic research; and provide a continuous supply of well-educated young people \u2013 are no longer being done as well as they should. If present trends continue, all will worsen in years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor pens an open letter to the party's elite", "title": "Robert Reich: The GOP establishment has destroyed itself", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor pens an open letter to the party's elite", "title": "Robert Reich: The GOP establishment has destroyed itself", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/01/robert_reich_partner_2/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor pens an open letter to the party's elite", "title": "Robert Reich: The GOP establishment has destroyed itself", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016, GOP, Income inequality, Politics, republican establishment, Republican Party, Robert Reich, RobertReich.org", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016, GOP, Income inequality, Politics, republican establishment, Republican Party, Robert Reich, RobertReich.org, Elections News, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogYou are the captains of American industry, the titans of Wall Street, and the billionaires who for decades have been the backbone of the Republican Party.\nYour sales are sputtering, and your stock prices are fragile.\nAs you\u2019ve pushed wages downward, you\u2019ve also squeezed your customers so tight they can hardly afford to buy what you have to sell.\nBut the typical family is earning less today than it did in 2000, in terms of real purchasing power.\nFirst, as you may have noticed, most of your companies aren\u2019t growing nearly as fast as they did before the Great Recession."}
