His story went viral and lead to a hashtag #IStandWithAhmed.\n\n\u201cHe was not arrested, he was not beaten, he was detained and questioned,\u201d Mr. Maher said, noting on his HBO show that he believed the police did due diligence in the case.\n\nThe comedian returned to the theme of how \u201cClock Boy\u201d became a beacon of liberal outrage while the state of Muslims \u2014 particularly women \u2014 throughout the worldremains so grim and not called out for fear of being seen as politically incorrect.\n\nMr. Maher returned to a familiar theme in his stand-up \u2014 questioning why the U.S. retains a military presence around the world, including in the Middle East and Germany.\n\n\u201cHitler, we got him,\u201d Mr. Maher said, pondering why the U.S. keeps more than 50,000 troops in Germany 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cIf there were 50,000 Guatemalans in [one place] in [the U.S.], Donald Trump himself would become a suicide bomber,\u201d the comedian jested of the GOP presidential candidate, whose tough talk on illegal immigration includes building a wall along the southern border.\n\nHe also said on his show, \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d Friday evening that the U.S.\u2019 presence in the Middle East incenses Islamists to actions like the Paris attacks.\n\n\u201cWhy do they hate us? \u2026 They hate us because we\u2019re there,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comedian and talk show host Bill Maher took liberals to task Saturday evening for cherry-picking when to call out Islamic extremism.", "Author": "Eric Althoff", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Comedian and talk show host Bill Maher took liberals to task Saturday evening for cherry-picking when to call out Islamic extremism.", "title": "Bill Maher jokes Donald Trump would be a suicide bomber against illegal immigrants", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/15/bill-maher-jokes-donald-trump-would-be-a-suicide-b/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/15/maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/15/maher.jpg", "title": "Bill Maher jokes Donald Trump would be a suicide bomber against illega", "description": "Comedian and talk show host Bill Maher took liberals to task Saturday evening for cherry-picking when to call out Islamic extremism.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Entertainment Culture, Bill Maher"}, "article_summary": "Comedian and talk show host Bill Maher took liberals to task Saturday evening for cherry-picking when to call out Islamic extremism.\nHe also said on his show, \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d Friday evening that the U.S.\u2019 presence in the Middle East incenses Islamists to actions like the Paris attacks.\n\u201cHitler, we got him,\u201d Mr. Maher said, pondering why the U.S. keeps more than 50,000 troops in Germany 70 years after the end of World War II.\nMr. Maher returned to a familiar theme in his stand-up \u2014 questioning why the U.S. retains a military presence around the world, including in the Middle East and Germany.\n\u201cIf there were 50,000 Guatemalans in [one place] in [the U.S.], Donald Trump himself would become a suicide bomber,\u201d the comedian jested of the GOP presidential candidate, whose tough talk on illegal immigration includes building a wall along the southern border."}
