Researchers at Rice University and the University of Houston found the law may have discouraged as many as 9 percent of registered voters from casting a ballot in the state\u2019s most-competitive congressional race last November.\n\nThe Latino-majority 23rd Congressional District covers much of Southwest Texas. Roughly 118,000 voters registered in the district cast a ballot in the November 2014 election, but more than 271,000 registered voters stayed home.\n\n\u201cAnd in that race, Republican Will Hurd narrowly defeated the Democratic incumbent Pete Gallego,\u201d says Mark Jones, a fellow in political science at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.\n\nResearchers for the Baker Institute and the University of Houston\u2019s Hobby Center for Public Policy surveyed a random sample of those who didn\u2019t vote to find out why. While 13 percent of respondents cited the voter ID law as a reason they didn\u2019t vote, less than 3 percent lacked an acceptable photo ID.\n\n\u201cSo the biggest impact of the law wasn\u2019t to prevent people who didn\u2019t have an ID from voting,\u201d Jones says, \u201cit was to cause people who actually had one of the IDs to not turn out because they thought they didn\u2019t have the right ID.\u201d\n\nJones says such confusion could have been avoided with a more robust public education campaign.\n\nAmong registered voters who did not cast a ballot because they believed they lacked an acceptable photo ID, the study found that supporters of Pete Gallego outnumbered those of Will Hurd by more than 4-to-1.\n\nThe U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Wednesday that the voter ID law violates the Voting Rights Act. Governor Greg Abbott said the state will continue to fight in support of the law.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The law discouraged thousands of eligible voters in Texas' 23rd Congressional District from going to the polls, according to a joint study by Rice University's Baker Institute and the University of Houston's Hobby Center for Public Policy.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "The law discouraged thousands of eligible voters in Texas' 23rd Congressional District from going to the polls, according to a joint study by Rice University's Baker Institute and the University of Houston's Hobby Center for Public Policy.", "title": "Texas Voter ID Law Held Down Turnout In Key 2014 Congressional Race | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/08/06/121107/texas-voter-id-law-held-down-turnout-in-key-2014-congressional-race/", "image": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/06170500/tx-gavel-drivers-license-400px.png", "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/06170500/tx-gavel-drivers-license-400px.png"}, "type": "article"}, "wordCount": 356, "twitter": {"description": "The law discouraged thousands of eligible voters in Texas' 23rd Congressional District from going to the polls, according to a joint study by Rice University's Baker Institute and the University of Houston's Hobby Center for Public Policy.", "title": "Texas Voter ID Law Held Down Turnout In Key 2014 Congressional Race", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/08/06/121107/texas-voter-id-law-held-down-turnout-in-key-2014-congressional-race/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/06170500/tx-gavel-drivers-license-400px.png", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Schneider", "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-08-06T12:05:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "voter id", "published_time": "2015-08-06T12:05:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "News, 5th circuit, election 2015, news, voter id", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14c7\"", "article_summary": "Roughly 118,000 voters registered in the district cast a ballot in the November 2014 election, but more than 271,000 registered voters stayed home.\nThe U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Wednesday that the voter ID law violates the Voting Rights Act.\n/ DownloadOn the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, a new study today finds that Texas\u2019 voter ID law may have kept some from voting.\nWhile 13 percent of respondents cited the voter ID law as a reason they didn\u2019t vote, less than 3 percent lacked an acceptable photo ID.\nResearchers at Rice University and the University of Houston found the law may have discouraged as many as 9 percent of registered voters from casting a ballot in the state\u2019s most-competitive congressional race last November."}
