The negative comments and cyberbulling Cassey Ho encounters on a daily basis can be defeating. For as many people who praise her for the fitness advice she gives on her YouTube channel blogilates, there’s an equal amount of people telling her she’s “so fat” and can’t call herself a trainer with “belly fat and love handles.”

“It’s something that’s been eating away at me for a while now,” she said in a video addressing body shaming. “The hatred and the mean comments that have been swirling around lately, I can’t shake it off.” Ho wondered, too, who ever said fitness instructors all had to look a certain way in the first place.

Ho noticed even as she advocated for people to respect one another, she still received a mixed bag of comments. And when commenters took a promotional, photoshopped picture of her “perfect body” too seriously, she decided to make a second video. Surrounded by the negative and rude comments she’s personally received, Ho essentially photoshops her body on camera; she shaves inches from her thighs and abs; increases the shape of her breasts and butt; even changes her eye color.

What’s interesting is these changes still don't seem to make Ho happy, the point being chasing someone else's idea of perfection may not be as satisfying as you think.

“It's tough knowing what's real and what's not when magazine covers and music videos are Photoshopped (yes, music videos), Instagram pics are Photoshopped, and so many women are getting surgery,” Ho said. “How are we to know what kind of beauty can be naturally achieved when everything around us is so deceiving?”
