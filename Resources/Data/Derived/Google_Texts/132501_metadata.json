Further, it underscores the efforts of the New Jersey equine industry to maintain the beauty of the Garden State.\n\nThe award recognizes Lord Stirling Stable\u2019s accomplishments including a new Nutrient Management plan developed to benefit the stable and the entire park system. The on-site composting facility transforms manure and stable waste into an organic, nutrient-rich material which is used to fertilize the pastures and plants at all Somerset County Park locations\n\n\n\nAdditional management practices include non-chemical control of weeds, dragging pastures to break up manure, pasture renovation, and daily removal of manure from smaller paddocks and turnouts.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are honored to be recognized for providing proper care of our horses, protecting our land, and delivering a rewarding riding experience for our guests,\u201d Stable Manager Marge Margentino said.\n\n\n\nEstablished in 1968, Lord Stirling Stable is located on the site of the former John Jacob Astor estate within the Great Swamp Watershed. It is home to 80 horses and ponies and serves the recreational equestrian needs of Somerset and nearby counties.\n\n\n\nLord Stirling Stable joins Woodhollow Farm (2014), D\u2019Arrigo Racing Stable LLC (2013) and Showplace Farms (2012) as the state\u2019s only Gold Medal Horse Farms.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1Hx5Kuk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lord Stirling Stable (LSS) has been selected as a \u201cGold Medal Horse Farm.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Lord Stirling Stable (LSS) has been selected as a \u201cGold Medal Horse Farm.\u201d", "title": "Lord Stirling Stable earns state Gold Medal award", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/11/29/lord-stirling-stable-gold-medal-award/76328246/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lord Stirling Stable (LSS) has been selected as a \u201cGold Medal Horse Farm.\u201d", "title": "Lord Stirling Stable earns state Gold Medal award", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6bb2c72b179c308c368bc44508d919631deb9a82/c=792-0-3960-3168&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/24/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635839773832329195-Gold-Medla-Awarded.JPG", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Lord Stirling Stable, Somerset County, Gold Medal Horse farm"}, "article_summary": "Lord Stirling Stable joins Woodhollow Farm (2014), D\u2019Arrigo Racing Stable LLC (2013) and Showplace Farms (2012) as the state\u2019s only Gold Medal Horse Farms.\nLord Stirling Stable is only the fourth facility in the state to earn this honor.\nEstablished in 1968, Lord Stirling Stable is located on the site of the former John Jacob Astor estate within the Great Swamp Watershed.\n(Photo: Somerset County Parks Commission) Story Highlights Lord Stirling Stable is only the fourth facility in the state to earn Gold Medal Horse FarmLord Stirling Stable is located on the site of the former John Jacob Astor estateLord Stirling Stable (LSS), located at 256 South Maple Avenue in Basking Ridge, has been selected as a \u201cGold Medal Horse Farm\u201d by the New Jersey Equine Environmental Stewardship Program (NJEESP).\nThe award recognizes Lord Stirling Stable\u2019s accomplishments including a new Nutrient Management plan developed to benefit the stable and the entire park system."}
