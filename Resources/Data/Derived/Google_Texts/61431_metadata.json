Several right-wing groups filed amicus briefs in favor of the crafts chain arguing that women simply shouldn\u2019t be having consequence-free sex. But where exactly does this idea come from? One research paper offers a theory.\n\nAccording to new research published in Archives of Sexual Behavior, the attitude that women shouldn\u2019t be having sex can at least partly be traced back to the idea that women are supposed to be economically dependent on men. The researchers suggest that this link may drive conservative religious communities\u2019 insistence on sexual purity.\n\nAfter surveying Americans about their attitudes toward promiscuity \u2014 asking them whether they agreed with statements like \u201cIt is fine for a woman to have sex with a man she has just met, if they both want to\u201d \u2014 the researchers also asked them whether they believed women tend to rely on income from their male partner. They found that the people who believe that casual sex is wrong also tend to believe that women need a partner to support them financially. Within that worldview, sex outside of a serious monogamous relationship is simply too risky. If women don\u2019t have \u201cpaternity certainty,\u201d then how will they know who they need to rely on to support them and their future child?\n\nThe researchers conclude that this outdated attitude toward women\u2019s pregnancy risks and financial needs hasn\u2019t totally gone away, despite the fact that modern contraception, legal abortion rights, and greater workplace equality have created an entirely different society.\n\n\u201cThe beliefs may persist due to cultural evolutionary adaptive lag, that is, because the environment has changed faster than the moral system,\u201d the paper concludes. \u201cReligious and conservative moral systems may be anti-promiscuity because they themselves arose in environments where females depended heavily on male investment.\u201d\n\nIn response to the right-wing claims that women who support Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate are \u201csluts\u201d who want the government to fund their sex lives, many birth control proponents have focused on the medical reasons that women need access to contraception. But there\u2019s also a growing push to confront the deep-seated resistance to acknowledging women\u2019s sex lives. \u201cWomen like sex. Stop making \u2018health\u2019 excuses for why we use birth control,\u201d feminist writer Jessica Valenti argues in a Guardian column published this week.\n\nOn top of the changing societal norms that ensure women don\u2019t actually have to be guided by \u201cpaternity certainy\u201d anymore, there\u2019s also scientific evidence that increasing access to birth control doesn\u2019t have any relationship to promiscuity. A large study published in the Obstetrics & Gynecology journal earlier this year found that giving women access to no-cost contraception doesn\u2019t lead them to make riskier sexual choices. The researchers noted their results should dispel social conservatives\u2019 fears that the risk of pregnancy is \u201cthe only thing standing between women and promiscuity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The attitude that women shouldn't be having sex can at least partly be traced back to the idea that women are supposed to be economically dependent on men.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The attitude that women shouldn't be having sex can at least partly be traced back to the idea that women are supposed to be economically dependent on men.", "title": "New Study Helps Explain Why Hobby Lobby Supporters Are So Fiercely Opposed To Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/09/3458058/new-study-hobby-lobby-birth-control/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The attitude that women shouldn't be having sex can at least partly be traced back to the idea that women are supposed to be economically dependent on men.", "title": "New Study Helps Explain Why Hobby Lobby Supporters Are So Fiercely Opposed To Birth Control", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_160160765.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-09T09:10:37+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce648\"", "article_summary": "Health New Study Helps Explain Why Hobby Lobby Supporters Are So Fiercely Opposed To Birth Control CREDIT: ShutterstockThroughout the ongoing debate over Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive coverage requirement, a common theme has emerged among many of Hobby Lobby\u2019s supporters: the idea that ensuring access to affordable birth control is harmful to society because it leads to promiscuity and infidelity.\nStop making \u2018health\u2019 excuses for why we use birth control,\u201d feminist writer Jessica Valenti argues in a Guardian column published this week.\nA large study published in the Obstetrics & Gynecology journal earlier this year found that giving women access to no-cost contraception doesn\u2019t lead them to make riskier sexual choices.\nSeveral right-wing groups filed amicus briefs in favor of the crafts chain arguing that women simply shouldn\u2019t be having consequence-free sex.\nThe researchers noted their results should dispel social conservatives\u2019 fears that the risk of pregnancy is \u201cthe only thing standing between women and promiscuity.\u201d"}
