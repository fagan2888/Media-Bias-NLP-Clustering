The iconic Augusta restaurant officially began a new chapter under new ownership.\n\nMiller's 5 had closed in March 2013. after being open for more than 49 years. Judy and Lee Miller originally opened Miller's 5 in 1964.\n\n\"It's very exciting. I've been looking forward to it ever since we found out,\" Socha said. \"I've got to have the ice cream!\"\n\nThe ice cream is exactly what Lisa Marache fell in love with after her husband Curtis introduced her to Miller's 5. For 30 years, Curtis would make the short drive up from his hometown of Douglass to enjoy the great food.\n\n\"We'd love coming here,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhen Miller's 5 closed, it was a difficult time. Judy Miller had decided to step back because of her battle with cancer. She had been keeping the restaurant going since her husband died about three years earlier.\n\nJudy passed away in August 2013. The Marache's wanted to find a way to keep her tradition of Miller's 5 alive.\n\n\"When we saw it go up for sale, we watched it for a while. At one point we decided we are just going to go for it,\" Lisa said.\n\nThey went for it with a very simple principle in mind:\n\n\"I told (Lisa) that if we get it, we need to keep it the same,\" Curtis said. \"(I said) We need to find out where they ordered all their food, how to make all their food, so everything pretty much stays the same.\"\n\nThey've done just that.\n\nThey've kept the same food items, the same signs, many of the same employees. The only visible difference is a little rearranging of cooking equipment inside.\n\n\"It worked for all those years, so why change it?\" Lisa said.\n\nThat mentality is something the Miller family says it can really appreciate.\n\n\"I think it's great and I'm so glad I can help them get started,\" said Tearie Shipman, one of Judy's daughters.\n\nTearie was in the back cooking up the burgers Sunday afternoon. She and other members of the Miller family have volunteered to help show the Marache's the ropes to ease the transition.\n\n\"We have to give a lot of credit to the family that is so willing to come in and help us on their time,\" Lisa said.\n\nThe continued close connection to the Miller family is something that also means a lot to the customers of Miller's 5.\n\n\"I think it's great that it's coming back,\" said Christina Keen of Leon. \"A lot of people are looking forward to it.\"\n\nCustomers say it's been worth the wait and it was worth braving the cold Sunday for a taste of the future of what has been such a staple of their past.\n\n\"Yes, it's wonderful!\" Socha said as she ate her vanilla ice cream. \"It's great. It's totally worth it!\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Miller's 5 closed its doors in March 2013 after more than 49 years in business.
