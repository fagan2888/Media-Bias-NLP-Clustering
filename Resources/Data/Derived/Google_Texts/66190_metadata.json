Some 500 were detained, police said.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTwo policemen were slightly injured, but there were no reports of injured among the protesters, police spokesman Lambert Maute said.\n\nBuoyed by the migrant crisis, which saw the arrival of more than one million migrants in Germany last year, the AfD has upended German party politics.\n\nAfter the congress started late, more than 2,000 AfD members listened to their party leaders\u2019 call for an end to Merkel\u2019s refugee-friendly politics and a return to Christian values.\n\n\u201cWe always wondered when the brave child will finally appear to voice the thoughts of the silent majority and declare that the \u2018Chancellor of no alternatives\u2019 is nothing but naked,\u201d said party leader Frauke Petry, 40, in her opening speech.\n\n\u201cAnd I think, this brave child is us,\u201d Petry added.\n\nThe violence began around dawn and clashes continued for several hours. Police used pepper spray and threatened to use water cannons to stop protesters, some of whom were masked, from getting onto the grounds of the conference. Some demonstrators still managed to assault several party members, they said.\n\nThe AfD has mainly run on an anti-migrant and Islam-critical agenda, but now struggles to unite its various fractions under one party programme that could put it on a broader footing.\n\nIt currently has representatives in half of Germany\u2019s sixteen federal state parliaments and the party has its eyes set on next year\u2019s federal elections.\n\nOpinion polls see the party coming in at between 10 and 14 percent, a serious challenge to established party politics, though these have ruled out forming any coalition with the AfD.\n\nThe AfD however considers itself in good company on a European level, following election gains by far-right parties across the continent.\n\nPetry used her oratorical skills to denounce what she termed the hypocrisy of the ruling elite whose policies, she said, were directed against the interest of ordinary German citizens.\n\n(Reporting by Tina Bellon in Stuttgart and Michael Nienaber in Berlin; Editing by Richard Balmforth)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Left-wing demonstrators clashed with police as they tried to break up the first full conference of the anti-immigration AfD party.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Left-wing demonstrators clashed with police as they tried to break up the first full conference of the anti-immigration AfD party.", "title": "Germany's Merkel Under Attack At Anti-Immigration Rally Marred By Left-Wing Clashes", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Police-forces-escort-a-party-member-past-protesters-to-a-party-congress-of-the-German-right-wing-party-AfD-Getty.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-01T01:52:24-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/05/01/germanys-merkel-attack-anti-immigration-rally-marred-left-wing-clashes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Left-wing demonstrators clashed with police as they tried to break up the first full conference of the anti-immigration AfD party.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Police-forces-escort-a-party-member-past-protesters-to-a-party-congress-of-the-German-right-wing-party-AfD-Getty.png", "title": "Germany's Merkel Under Attack At Anti-Immigration Rally Marred By Left-Wing Clashes", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "left-wing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-05-01T01:32:41-07:00", "section": "Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2016-05-01T01:52:24-07:00", "tag": "Germany", "categories": "Breitbart London,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Buoyed by the migrant crisis, which saw the arrival of more than one million migrants in Germany last year, the AfD has upended German party politics.\nPolice used pepper spray and threatened to use water cannons to stop protesters, some of whom were masked, from getting onto the grounds of the conference.\nOpinion polls see the party coming in at between 10 and 14 percent, a serious challenge to established party politics, though these have ruled out forming any coalition with the AfD.\nPolice counted up to 2,000 left-wing protesters, some of whom burnt tyres and hurled stones and fireworks to try to stop the AfD\u2019s congress going ahead in Stuttgart.\nIt currently has representatives in half of Germany\u2019s sixteen federal state parliaments and the party has its eyes set on next year\u2019s federal elections."}
