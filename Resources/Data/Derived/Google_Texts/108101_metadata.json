Even if these benefits materialize, a potential side effect is that the larger group gains stronger footing when negotiating prices,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Eric Sun, MD, an instructor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine.\n\nSun and senior author Laurence Baker, PhD, professor of health research and policy, examined the fees orthopedic surgeons billed for knee replacements between 2001 and 2010. They correlated these fees with the concentration of physician groups using a measurement known as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, which is commonly used by regulators, Sun said.\n\nEven though the overall number of markets considered \u201cmoderately\u201d or \u201chighly\u201d concentrated remained about the same during the study period, the nationwide average cost of knee replacements fell $261. However, physicians\u2019 fees in the most concentrated markets ended the study period $168 higher than fees in the least concentrated markets \u2014 a jump of 7 percent.\n\n\n\nThe point is not to say that consolidation is a bad thing.\n\nThis finding could have implications for the Affordable Care Act, which encourages physicians to coordinate care in an effort to improve patient health. But such collaboration could also allow physicians to bargain for higher fees from insurers, Sun said.\n\n\u201cThe point is not to say that consolidation is a bad thing,\u201d Sun said. \u201cBut as we think about encouraging these kinds of mergers, we really want to weigh the costs against the benefits.\u201d\n\nIn the future, Sun said he and Baker plan to investigate whether a higher concentration of physician groups improves patient outcomes.\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institute of Health Care Management and the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research.\n\nInformation about Stanford\u2019s Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine and the Department of Medicine, which also supported the work, is available at http://med.stanford.edu/anesthesia/ and http://medicine.stanford.edu.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/06/higher-concentration-of-physicians-groups-could-increase-medical.html", "image": "http://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm-news/images/2014/10/health-costs-stock.jpg", "site_name": "News Center", "description": "Orthopedic surgeons in concentrated markets charged 7 percent more for knee replacements than physicians in less concentrated markets, a new study shows.", "title": "Higher concentration of physician groups could increase medical costs, researchers say"}, "description": "Orthopedic surgeons in concentrated markets charged 7 percent more for knee replacements than physicians in less concentrated markets, a new study shows.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24fb\"", "article_summary": "They correlated these fees with the concentration of physician groups using a measurement known as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, which is commonly used by regulators, Sun said.\nHowever, physicians\u2019 fees in the most concentrated markets ended the study period $168 higher than fees in the least concentrated markets \u2014 a jump of 7 percent.\n\u201cWhen physician groups and health systems merge, a key justification is that patients will benefit from better coordination between physicians and expanded access to specialists.\nThe study was funded by the National Institute of Health Care Management and the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research.\nBut such collaboration could also allow physicians to bargain for higher fees from insurers, Sun said."}
