The consequence is missed opportunities \u201cto represent something different than the old Soviet-style aggression.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s interview with the website came on the same day that he spoke with Putin by phone to discuss escalating violence in Eastern Ukraine. The White House is considering sending lethal military aid to Ukraine, where government forces are locked in an intensifying battle with pro-Russian separatists, although Obama said he continues to hold out hopes for a diplomatic resolution.\n\nObama said Russia\u2019s economy, which has suffered amid a drop in oil prices and sanctions enacted last year by the U.S. and other countries, is \u201cnot an economy that\u2019s built for the 21st century.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bad for Russia and, over time, it\u2019s bad for the United States, because if Russia is doing badly, the concern is that they revert to old expansionist ideas that really shouldn\u2019t have any application in the 21st century,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin was an officer in the KGB, the Russian spy agency, for 16 years before entering politics. He became acting president in 1999 and was elected in 2000, serving until 2008 and being elected again in 2012.\n\n\u2018Soviet Past\u2019\n\n\u201cI will say that he has a foot very much in the Soviet past,\u201d Obama said of Putin\u2019s background. \u201cThat\u2019s how he came of age. He ran the KGB. Those were his formative experiences.\u201d\n\nDuring the 22-minute interview, Obama also reiterated his belief that same-sex marriage should be legal in all 50 states, and he criticized companies that haven\u2019t supported his signature health-care law.\n\nBuzzFeed News reported this week that employees of office-supply company Staples Inc. were being forced to limit their hours so that the company wouldn\u2019t have to provide health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t looked at Staples stock lately or what the compensation of the CEO is, but I suspect that they could well afford to treat their workers favorably and give them some basic financial security, and if they can\u2019t, then they should be willing to allow those workers to get the Affordable Care Act without cutting wages,\u201d he said.\n\nObama \u201cappears not to have all the facts,\u201d Staples spokesman Kirk Saville, said in an e-mail. The company\u2019s policy regulating hours for part-time workers is more than 10 years old and \u201cpredates the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the president is attacking a company that provides more than 85,000 jobs and is a major taxpayer,\u201d Saville said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Toluse Olorunnipa", "twitter": {"description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to diversify his nation\u2019s economy due to a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality that\u2019s isolated Russia from Ukraine and other neighbors, President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.", "title": "Obama Says \u2018Cold War Lens\u2019 Is Putin\u2019s Error in BuzzFeed Chat", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/obama-says-cold-war-lens-clouds-putin-s-mind-in-buzzfeed-chat", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i.AD9lHH1TGw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Toluse Olorunnipa", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Ukraine,Russia,Cold War,Vladimir Putin,Barack H Obama", "news_keywords": "Ukraine,Russia,Cold War,Vladimir Putin,Barack H Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/obama-says-cold-war-lens-clouds-putin-s-mind-in-buzzfeed-chat", "parsely-title": "Obama Says \u2018Cold War Lens\u2019 Is Putin\u2019s Error in BuzzFeed Chat", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-11T13:20:08.747Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to diversify his nation\u2019s economy due to a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality that\u2019s isolated Russia from Ukraine and other neighbors, President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.", "parsely-tags": "Ukraine,Russia,Cold War,Vladimir Putin,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-02-11T13:20:08.747Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to diversify his nation\u2019s economy due to a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality that\u2019s isolated Russia from Ukraine and other neighbors, President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.", "title": "Obama Says \u2018Cold War Lens\u2019 Is Putin\u2019s Error in BuzzFeed Chat", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/obama-says-cold-war-lens-clouds-putin-s-mind-in-buzzfeed-chat", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i.AD9lHH1TGw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to diversify his nation\u2019s economy due to a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality that\u2019s isolated Russia from Ukraine and other neighbors, President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed News."}, "parsely-post-id": "NJLY196TTDS301", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i.AD9lHH1TGw/v2/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce591\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think he looks at problems through this Cold War lens,\u201d Obama said in the interview Tuesday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin failed to diversify his nation\u2019s economy due to a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality that\u2019s isolated Russia from Ukraine and other neighbors, President Barack Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.\n\u2018Soviet Past\u2019\u201cI will say that he has a foot very much in the Soviet past,\u201d Obama said of Putin\u2019s background.\nThose were his formative experiences.\u201dDuring the 22-minute interview, Obama also reiterated his belief that same-sex marriage should be legal in all 50 states, and he criticized companies that haven\u2019t supported his signature health-care law.\nThe company\u2019s policy regulating hours for part-time workers is more than 10 years old and \u201cpredates the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said."}
