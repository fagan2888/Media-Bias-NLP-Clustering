The worst-case scenario would leave the public hospital $190 million in debt next year.\n\nHospital officials were quick to reassure the board that Parkland was not planning to spend money it didn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think this is inevitable,\u201d said Dr. Fred Cerise, chief executive. \u201cWe obviously will bring in a plan and interventions so we don\u2019t go below zero.\u201d\n\nThe spending uncertainty relates mainly to the estimated cost of staffing and operating the new 862-bed hospital. Next May, Parkland will move across Harry Hines Boulevard into the 2.5 million-square-foot facility. It is twice the size of the current hospital.\n\nThe costliest budget projection was generated by spending requests from hospital department heads. To staff the new facility, they asked for 1,214 full-time positions, in addition to the current staff of 10,446. That budget would total about $1.5 billion, a 21 percent boost over current spending.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s got a lot of wishes, and some of them are necessary,\u201d said Mark Erath, interim chief financial officer.\n\nThe Parkland board must decide how many positions the hospital can afford to fill while paying other operational costs required by a larger facility. It is possible that portions of the new building will not be used if they cannot be staffed, Cerise said.\n\n\u201cThat is part of the equation we will consider,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the budget process we\u2019re in right now.\u201d\n\nParkland also will look for better ways to \u201cleverage\u201d the local taxes that the hospital relies on, Cerise said. Currently, a portion of the county hospital\u2019s taxes is used to match federal Medicaid funds that go to private hospitals in the Dallas area.\n\nThe matching process was set up years ago when Parkland had maxed out the amount of Medicaid funding it could claim as a safety-net hospital. Now, hospital officials say, it\u2019s time for Parkland to claim a greater share of the federal funding to cover the cost of indigent care.\n\nParkland and other Texas public hospitals are anticipating financial troubles because Texas did not expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. State leaders said the expansion, which would have covered many Parkland patients, would end up costing the state too much money.\n\nCerise noted that Medicaid reimburses Parkland only 57 percent of its actual cost of caring for patients. The hospital can\u2019t make up the difference with private-paying patients because it has relatively few of them.\n\n\u201cWe need to get 100 percent of our costs covered,\u201d he told the board. \u201cEighty percent of our business is Medicaid or the uninsured. We have to get paid our cost.\u201d\n\nCounty taxpayers contributed about $448 million toward Parkland\u2019s current $1.3 billion budget.\n\nUnder the best spending scenario for next year, local taxpayers would contribute about $478 million, including $17 million generated by a 1-cent hike in the tax rate. The rest would be generated by the rising value of the local tax base.\n\nWith the 1-cent increase, the Dallas County Hospital District\u2019s tax rate would be 28.6 cents per $100 of appraised value, a 5 percent increase.\n\nThe average county homeowner would pay an additional $18 in property taxes next year. The estimated cost is based on last year\u2019s average county home being valued $128,865 for tax purposes, including a homestead exemption. (The county has not yet calculated the average home value for 2014.)\n\nDallas County commissioners must approve Parkland\u2019s new tax rate in August and its 2015 budget by late September.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The best-case scenario calls for a 1-cent tax rate hike and a balanced bottom line for the year its new hospital opens.", "og": {"description": "The best-case scenario calls for a 1-cent tax rate hike and a balanced bottom line for the year its new hospital opens.", "title": "Dallas County's Parkland puts pencil to 2015 hospital budgets", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140625-dallas-county-s-parkland-puts-pencil-to-2015-hospital-budgets.ece", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140611-parkland-exterior.ece/BINARY/original/Parkland+exterior", "height": 697}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-06-26T05:26:41Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-06-26T03:39:29Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dallas County's Parkland puts pencil to 2015 hospital budgets\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140625-dallas-county-s-parkland-puts-pencil-to-2015-hospital-budgets.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140611-parkland-exterior.ece/BINARY/original/Parkland+exterior\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1768505\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-26T03:39:29Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140611-parkland-exterior.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Parkland+exterior", "publishtime": "2014-06-26T03:39:29Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde85d\"", "article_summary": "With the 1-cent increase, the Dallas County Hospital District\u2019s tax rate would be 28.6 cents per $100 of appraised value, a 5 percent increase.\nIt is twice the size of the current hospital.\nParkland Memorial Hospital board members got their first look Wednesday at budget projections for 2015, when a new, larger public facility will open.\nHospital officials were quick to reassure the board that Parkland was not planning to spend money it didn\u2019t have.\nDallas County commissioners must approve Parkland\u2019s new tax rate in August and its 2015 budget by late September."}
