(AP) \u2014 Meghan Klingenberg figured she could go above and beyond to further build team camaraderie, and it involved a box of beautiful gourmet doughnuts for her teammates before a recent World Cup tuneup.\n\nSuch gestures mean a lot for a group still getting to know each other.\n\nWith each match the Americans play and through every rigorous training session, Klingenberg and the defense become more comfortable together on a new-look back line ahead of their World Cup opener 2 1/2 weeks from now against Australia in Winnipeg.\n\n\u201cStep 1 to becoming the most popular girl on the team,\u201d wrote Klingenberg, who posted on Twitter a photo of the doughnuts from a popular San Jose spot.\n\nThe U.S. foursome that started in a 5-1 victory against Mexico in last weekend\u2019s send-off match in Carson featured nobody with more than 80 appearances for the national team, yet that certainly doesn\u2019t seem to have coach Jill Ellis overly concerned heading to Canada. Especially with veteran defender and captain Christie Rampone helping lead this young group in her fifth World Cup. She has the second-most international caps in U.S. women\u2019s soccer history with 305 behind Kristine Lilly and will turn 40 during the tournament, too.\n\nAli Krieger started all six matches of the 2011 tournament in Germany, while Becky Sauerbrunn earned a start. Add newcomer Julie Johnston and Klingenberg to the mix and Ellis acknowledges she has a uniquely skilled defense that loves to push forward on the attack whenever possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking more of them in the attack than we have in the past,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cBut I certainly think that defensively we\u2019re coming together. We read the game collectively very well. I still think individually there are things we can improve upon.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper Hope Solo has needed time to adjust to different players\u2019 tendencies as Ellis mixed and matched combinations to find her best lineup heading into the World Cup Group D opener on June 8.\n\nEverybody involved understands there is unfinished business after the United States lost to Japan on penalty kicks in the 2011 World Cup final.\n\n\u201cEach game we\u2019re ironing out the details in the back. We have our clean sheets,\u201d Krieger said. \u201cAs of right now, we\u2019re golden. We\u2019ve done really well together and we have a great understanding, a great communication in the back four. It\u2019s super strong. We also have so much depth for a back line. Anybody that has to come in and jump in is right there on the same page, and I think we\u2019ve done such a great job in the last two games to solidify that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans\u2019 new defense will be in attack mode when possible", "title": "Americans\u2019 new defense will be in attack mode when possible", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Americans\u2019 new defense will be in attack mode when possible", "title": "Americans\u2019 new defense will be in attack mode when possible", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/americans_new_defense_will_be_in_attack_mode_when_possible/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/soccer-wwcup-us-new-look-defense.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Americans\u2019 new defense will be in attack mode when possible", "title": "Americans\u2019 new defense will be in attack mode when possible", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/soccer-wwcup-us-new-look-defense.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "JANIE McCAULEY", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3088\"", "article_summary": "Everybody involved understands there is unfinished business after the United States lost to Japan on penalty kicks in the 2011 World Cup final.\nEspecially with veteran defender and captain Christie Rampone helping lead this young group in her fifth World Cup.\nAdd newcomer Julie Johnston and Klingenberg to the mix and Ellis acknowledges she has a uniquely skilled defense that loves to push forward on the attack whenever possible.\nWith each match the Americans play and through every rigorous training session, Klingenberg and the defense become more comfortable together on a new-look back line ahead of their World Cup opener 2 1/2 weeks from now against Australia in Winnipeg.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking more of them in the attack than we have in the past,\u201d Ellis said."}
