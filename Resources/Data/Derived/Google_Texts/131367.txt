Jeremiah James Thomas was a ninth grader at East High School the day he stood at a bus stop.

The bus stop was near the intersection of East Colfax Avenue and Colorado Boulevard.

It was 11:20 p.m., Aug. 1, 1997.

A small red car passed by the busy street. Several young people were in the car. They yelled at the 15-year-old Jeremiah, taunting him.

It’s not known if there was recognition or if this was a random, chance encounter between complete strangers.

Jeremiah yelled back.

The occupants of the car flashed gang signs.

A witness saw Jeremiah also making a gang sign.

The driver of the red car spun the car around, got into the westbound lanes and drove past Jeremiah, did a U-turn and then sped down the sidewalk towards the boy.

It’s unclear what Jeremiah did to try to get out of the way, whether he jumped or was frozen in fear.

The red car mowed him down.

The teen was snagged in the undercarriage of the car, which veered back onto East Colfax Avenue, speeding down the 4100 block of the street.

Pinned under the car, Jeremiah was dragged for several hundred feet.

Jeremiah was pronounced dead at the scene. His violent death was noted in brief stories in The Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News.
