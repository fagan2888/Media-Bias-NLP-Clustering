REUTERS/Joshua Lott (UNITED STATES) - RTR1KC8G\n\n4420297\n\nThen-Senator Barack Obama took a cigarette break during his first \u201ceducational\u201d meeting with Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber on health care reform.\n\nThe Daily Caller extensively reported on Obama\u2019s 2009 Oval Office meeting with Gruber to design the Obamacare bill. Obama famously called Gruber, who called the American people \u201cstupid,\u201d just \u201csome adviser who was never on our staff.\u201d But their relationship pre-dated that meeting by several years. (RELATED: Obama, Gruber Worked Together To Deceive)\n\nAs Gruber faces a call-back from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the new year, and continues to withhold documents about his work for Obama, records show that Gruber served as Obama\u2019s early health care mentor in a 2006 meeting in Obama\u2019s Senate office. Gruber, who was linked to the Ted Kennedy-led health reform push in Massachusetts, got Obama up to speed before the Illinois senator ran for president.\n\n\u201cSo the first time was in, I don\u2019t know exactly. You know, if I knew at the time how important it would be, I would have written down the date. It is like late 2006 maybe,\u201d Gruber said in an extensive PBS Frontline interview in 2012. \u201cIt was right before he announced he was running. So maybe it was earlier than that, maybe spring 2006, right before he \u2014 when people sort of knew he was thinking about it but he hadn\u2019t announced yet. I went down, basically did a tutorial for him on what we had done in Massachusetts and how it would work and basically thinking about expanding it to the national stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was in his Senate offices,\u201d Gruber confirmed.\n\n\u201cHe was very interested. It was really just an information session. He was really interested in learning. He clearly was not interested in little incremental things. He wanted to be bold. That was clear. He said, \u2018Look, I want to do big changes.\u2019\u2026Obama, it was purely a sort of educational meeting. He was not the expert on health care that, say, Hillary Clinton was. He was there to learn.\u201d \u201cAnd I just felt a more relaxed around \u2014 Obama was a little more relaxed,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cI think he took a cigarette break halfway through. That is back when he was smoking a lot. He would check his BlackBerry occasionally. He was just kind of casual, interested in learning, very humble. Obama is very humble.\u201d \u201cAnd yeah, he was a super-quick study. He really understood it. Very good in terms of \u2014 if I was saying something he already knew, he could cut me off without seeming rude, you know, kind of like, \u2018Yeah, I know that,\u2019 but not in the kind of \u2018Shut up,\u2019 very kind of like: \u2018OK, I know that. Now what about this?\u2019 I mean, very much kind of debating, interested but absorbing and not trying to act like he knew more than he knew, and just really interested in learning.\u201d Gruber also discussed Obama\u2019s major policy flip-flop: campaigning against an individual mandate, and then changing his mind after getting elected. Gruber credited himself as the adviser that got Obama to change course. \u201cWhereas Obama, who was opposed to the mandate in the election \u2014 I mean, Hillary [Clinton] adopted it. And in the election \u2014 in the campaign, to be fair, I was a Hillary supporter, not an Obama supporter, because I liked Hillary\u2019s plan better because I believed in the mandate. Hillary had the mandate in her plan; Obama did not. He was explicitly opposed to it. He actually criticized her for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he gets elected. And to his credit he gets a lot of people, including myself, telling him, \u2018Look, you cannot make this work without the mandate.\u201d And he says, \u2018OK, let\u2019s do the mandate.\u2019 And his advisers say, \u2018This might not be the right thing to do.\u2019 And he says: \u2018You know, this is what the experts are telling me needs to be done. Let\u2019s make this happen.\u2019 And so Ted Kennedy, who had been opposed to it, he came into that side. Obama came to that side because they saw it working. And ultimately that is what pragmatism is. You see what works, and you do it. \u2026\u201d\n\nSenator Obama said in a 2006 speech captured on video that he had begun stealing ideas \u201cliberally\u201d from Gruber.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Jonathan Gruber mentored then-Senator Obama on health care reform", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Then-Senator Barack Obama took a cigarette break during his first \"educational\" meeting with Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber on health care reform.
