It shouldn\u2019t be a challenge\n\nVoters waiting to vote in polling place (Photo: Getty Images/Blend Images )\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t want you to vote.\n\nOK, that\u2019s not totally true. Unless you\u2019re young. Or unless you\u2019re black (especially) or Hispanic. Or unless if you\u2019re a Democrat or if you have Democratic tendencies, as many of the folks in these groups do. Then Republicans really don\u2019t want you to vote.\n\nBut if Republicans can\u2019t completely prevent you from voting, they\u2019ll do everything they can to make it as difficult as possible.\n\nWhich is why Republicans nationwide have been so busy over the last few years, passing legislation that cuts back or eliminates same-day voter registration, curtails access to local clerks\u2019 offices and polling places, severely restricts early voting and limits the availability of absentee ballots.\n\nOf course, these measures are in addition to the requirement instituted by Republicans in a number of states, including Wisconsin, that a voter must present an approved photo ID before casting a ballot.\n\nSince the \u201cvoter fraud\u201d that Republicans say is the main reason for the photo ID requirement simply doesn\u2019t exist in any meaningful or demonstrable way, and since research shows that this requirement has no effect on the confidence or trust in the electoral process, it\u2019s clear that the requirement is only intended to suppress voter participation.\n\nWe\u2019ll pause here briefly to note the latest demonstration of hypocrisy by Wisconsin Republicans, namely the lawsuit by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald against the state\u2019s non-partisan Government Accountability Board.\n\nAccording to news reports, the lawsuit argues \u201cthat the model ballot drafted by the GAB is confusing, gives undue prominence to Democratic candidates and makes it difficult for voters to tell which office the candidates are seeking.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the ballot design is unfair because Democratic candidates are listed first, based on the results of the 2012 election, as mandated by state law, \u201cunder the name of the office being sought and Republican candidates are separated by a line, the lawsuit said.\u201d\n\nWithout a hint of irony, Vos and Fitzgerald nonetheless went ahead and made the ridiculously ironic and completely unsubstantiated claim that the GAB\u2019s model ballot is \u201cextremely likely to violate the right to vote of thousands, if not millions of Wisconsin electors.\u201d Of course, without explaining how.\n\nFor the hundreds of early voters who had already cast and returned an absentee ballot, however, there seemed to be no violation, no confusion and, until the recent decision by a panel of three Republican judges to reinstate the photo ID requirement, no difficulties.\n\nThere has got to be a better way, Well, in The Post-Crescent\u2019s own editorial pages, a letter to the editor recently offered a solution that was breathtakingly inane: \u201cThe plan would be to change voting laws, making it illegal for citizens to vote if they don\u2019t pay a reasonable amount of income tax.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of points to consider as you let that the implications of \u201cthe plan\u201d sink in. (I predict that it will make your head hurt.)\n\nApparently, the idea came to writer because there are \u201c... more people evading income taxes, qualifying for welfare and receiving assistance for health care, food stamps, education, housing, etc., than there are taxpayers to support these programs.\u201d In particular, he claims \u201cthat 47 percent of voters paid no taxes,\u201d and goes on to blame them for all the problems.\n\nHmmm. Does that sound familiar? Of course it does. In 2012, Mitt Romney infamously made a similar claim. The letter writer\u2019s claim, though, is even more misguided and inaccurate than Romney\u2019s.\n\nIn 2011, nearly 47 percent of Americans paid no federal income tax. However, nearly two-thirds did pay payroll taxes and most all also paid some combination of state and local sales, gas and property taxes, not to mention numerous user and other fees.\n\nSo when the letter writer complains about \u201cvoters who don\u2019t contribute to society\u201d but who continue \u201cto obtain \u2018free\u2019 services\u201d and \u201cmore \u2018stuff,\u2019\u201d I can\u2019t help but wonder who he\u2019s referring to.\n\nIs it low-income and middle-class voters and their children? Is it the elderly? Women? Students? Small business owners? Large corporations? Sports team owners? Veterans? He doesn\u2019t say.\n\nIn any case, voting is a right and a privilege. It shouldn\u2019t be a challenge.\n\n\u2014 David Hovde is an Appleton resident.
