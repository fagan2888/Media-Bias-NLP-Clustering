disparaging the candidates and their policies.\n\n\u2018Just like Obama, he doesn\u2019t really appreciate this country,\u2019 she said of Sanders.\n\nSafe word: Kate Bornstein decided to use a safe word to keep Cait from ranting at the debate\n\nWhen asked what she thought about Sanders\u2019 comment that climate change was the \u2018biggest threat to national security\u2019 she gawped: \u2018He\u2019s an idiot\u2019.\n\nShe later complained about Obamacare.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in the top one percent, I don\u2019t even have Obamacare and I had to put $450,000 in there, the health care

how to protect her from that,\u2019 fretted her friend Kate Bornstein, who made the safety word \u2018God Bless America\u2019.\n\nSafety word: The group decided to use 'God Bless America' as their safety word\n\nThe show had opened with Cait wondering if they should all wear the same colour \u2018for solidarity\u2019 on their political journey.\n\nThey began at Chicago House, a charity that helps homeless trans people.\n\nOutside the convention center a group of people were protesting Cait, saying that she did not represent their community.\n\nGroup protest: A group of protesters targeted Cait saying she did not represent their community\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t care about the real trans women of America, you don\u2019t represent us, you have no idea what it\u2019s really like,\u2019 screamed a women wearing a mask in the throng, as others waved banners.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m only representing myself,\u2019 said Cait.\n\nOne of Cait\u2019s posse decided that it was \u2018good for her\u2019 to hear people\u2019s objections to her immensely \u2018privileged\u2019 transition.\n\nGood for her: Jenny Boylan believed that it would be good for Cait to hear people's objections to her 'privileged' transition\n\n\u2018She needs to pay attention,\u2019 Jenny Boylan said sternly.\n\nTo lift their spirits the ladies went lingerie shopping in Dubuque, Iowa.\n\n\u2018I think there\u2019s some wild things going on in Dubuque,\u2019 said Cait before they hit the casino to meet the locals.\n\nDrake University, where the Democratic debate was being held, was also where Bruce Jenner ran his first decathlon.\n\nTrack star: Caitlyn returned to Drake University where she ran her first decathlon as Bruce Jenner\n\n\u2018I\u2019m proud of that part of my life,\u2019 she recalled.\n\nThe last stop was Cait\u2019s alma mater Graceland University where she became extremely nervous and tearful.\n\n\u2018I never wore heels at Graceland,\u2019 she sighed.\n\nAlma mater: Graceland University named it campus sports complex after Bruce Jenner\n\nWearing all white Cait hit the stage with her friends to answer questions from the youngsters.\n\nHer friend Chandi Moore discussed the relationship between religion and gender identity.\n\n\u2018God knew who I was before I did,\u2019 she explained, while Kate Bornstein explained how her Scientologist daughter had ostracised her for being trans.\n\nGood answer: Chandi Moore answered a question about religion and gender identity\n\nCait cried when describing her \u2018struggle\u2019 and her newfound joie de vivre\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t wait for the day to get started, I\u2019ve got things to do, I love myself,\u2019 she sobbed.\n\nI Am Cait continues next week on the E! network.", "article_metadata":
