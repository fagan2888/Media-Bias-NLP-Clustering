The leadership of the Republican Study Committee privately decided Thursday they would push top House lawmakers to abandon the 2015 budget deal and push for steep cuts, the group’s chairman wrote in an email to colleagues.

The decision by the prominent conservative caucus casts serious doubt on whether the House will be able to pass a 2017 budget.

“The following position passed with over a 2/3rds vote,” Chairman Bill Flores of Texas wrote to his colleagues Thursday. “The House budget should cap discretionary spending at $1.04 trillion dollars; an amount below the levels allowed in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, with offsetting savings achieved through reductions in non-defense discretionary spending or through enacted mandatory spending reforms of sufficient magnitude.”
