That guy should be doing this.\u2019 All right, Dad. You suit up and go out there and see how easy it is.\u201d\n\nYou know how dads are. Dads can be tough on their sons. Jodie Jackson used to coach the Pop Warner teams for his twin sons, Marquis and Malik Jackson.\n\n\u201cMy dad was around every second,\u201d said Malik Jackson, a Broncos defensive end and tackle. \u201cTeaching me the game. I liked to be around my friends, but my dad was out there, day in and day out. It kind of (stunk) in a way because he would yell at you a lot. But it made me a better person. You take it and be quiet. I\u2019m glad I learned that early.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 defensive line \u2014 ordinarily, a rowdy, chatty group \u2014 was rocked with sorrow this season as the fathers of Jackson and Austin died within three weeks of each other at shockingly young ages.\n\nMarvin Austin Sr. was 49 when he died of injuries suffered in a car accident in Washington, D.C. Five days later, on Sept. 19, his only son gave doctors consent to take his father off life support.\n\nHe was buried last Saturday in a Washington cemetery with his plot facing FedEx Field.\n\n\u201cHe was a diehard Redskins fan,\u201d Austin said. \u201cEven when I played for Dallas (last season), he would not wear a Cowboys jersey. He said, \u2018I support you, but I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019s got your name on the back!\u2019 He said, \u2018That\u2019s your name on the back.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTo honor his father, Marvin Austin will add \u201cJr.\u201d on his jersey nameplate, starting with Sunday\u2019s game against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nJodie Jackson was 47 when he died unexpectedly in his Greensboro, N.C., apartment in late August. Malik learned of his father\u2019s passing during the second half of the Broncos\u2019 preseason game Aug. 23 against the Houston Texans.\n\nThe family is still waiting for the coroner\u2019s report, but the early indication is he died from complications of a stroke.\n\n\u201cI try to be strong, not let my dad\u2019s passing get to me,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI think it hit me in the Seattle game. It was everything. Magnitude of the situation. It was a big game. You wanted to be great. He wasn\u2019t there to watch the game, so I couldn\u2019t talk to him about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe game goes on\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that people forget professional football players are people too. It\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t occur to them. Rare is the American kid who doesn\u2019t want to play sports for a living. Kids may not grasp the concept of six- or seven- or eight-figure incomes, but they gawk at the fame.\n\nTo play a sport and then have people ask for an autograph? It can\u2019t get any better.\n\nFame and money, though, don\u2019t prevent the annoyance of a traffic jam or poor restaurant service. And, the life of an NFL player can\u2019t heal the hurt from the loss of a loved one. Rich or poor, famous or fan, only time can heal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be strong, not have any bad feelings, money will take care of everything,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOne thing about that is people don\u2019t understand how taxes work. And two, we can\u2019t take a week off or days off to grieve. You come in to work, put that game face on, leave your problems at home, stay strong.\u201d\n\nJackson missed one day of practice to attend his father\u2019s funeral in New Jersey but was back with the Broncos the next day.\n\nAustin needed to take two separate trips back to the nation\u2019s capital. He missed just two non-bye-week practices. Neither Jackson nor Austin missed a game.\n\n\u201cLook at Robin Williams, look at some of these famous actors, they\u2019ve got it all,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMoney, fame. But it doesn\u2019t equate into happiness. No matter what you have, family is the most important thing. I saw that when I went home (last) weekend for my father\u2019s going-home celebration. Being around my family. \u2026 I\u2019m just so motivated. And not just about football. Motivated to be a good example in any and everything I do.\u201d\n\nBecause they are human, Jackson and Austin will make the occasional mistake on the football field. Which would seem to put their coaches in an awkward predicament. How can you yell at a guy knowing his father just died?\n\nAustin said coaches don\u2019t really yell, anyway. These are grown men playing the game. NFL coaches use a different teaching tactic.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting it done \u2014 \u2018Excuse me, get him off please. Take a seat over there, bro,\u2019 \u201d Austin said. \u201cI\u2019d rather they yell at me if they\u2019d let me stay in there.\u201d\n\nBroncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio said the scolding part of coaching is usually reserved for those who don\u2019t put forth maximum effort. That\u2019s not a problem with Jackson or Austin.\n\n\u201cBeing a part of a football team, it really is a microcosm of life because things happen like this,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cYou have to deal with it. You can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s a grieving process that takes place, but yet the game goes on. Sometimes getting back amongst your buddies is the best thing you can do to get your mind off it and your mind back into your work. In both cases, they wanted to get back with their teammates.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen arms\u201d upon return\n\nJohn Fox, the Broncos\u2019 head coach, has always been kindhearted to his players when they\u2019ve dealt with serious personal matters. Star receiver Demaryius Thomas missed the first five days of training camp after his grandmother died. Fox insisted on excusing Lonie Paxton from a January 2012 playoff game so the long snapper could be with his wife as she was enduring complications from her pregnancy with twins.\n\n\u201cWe preach family is first,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create that atmosphere and culture here within our football team. To do that you can\u2019t talk out both sides of your mouth. We tell guys take what you need, and when you get done we want you back.\u201d\n\nAustin and Jackson each said they were humbled and grateful for the support they received from their coaches and teammates. You know how guys are. Many struggle to show a sentimental side, especially around other men. They don\u2019t really know what to say, or if they should say anything.\n\nThe fear is to bring a guy down when interior defensive line play demands a frenzy.\n\n\u201cOur D-line is so close to each other,\u201d Terrance Knighton said. \u201cWe group text. We talk a lot. When Malik came back from his dad\u2019s funeral and Marvin came back from the funeral, it was open arms. We didn\u2019t want to make them feel bad. We wanted to energize them, give life to them.\u201d\n\nJackson had just gone through accepting condolences for his father when it was his turn to deliver for Austin.\n\n\u201cI know how I felt. I appreciated all the condolences. But the more people said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 the more upset I\u2019d get,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI went up to Marvin and said something like: \u2018I know what you\u2019re going through, man. I\u2019m here.\u2019 Keep it short, light. We\u2019re all grown men, and we all have our ways of handling our problems. I\u2019m not secretive, but I don\u2019t really talk about things.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not Austin. He\u2019s a friendly sort. It was cathartic for him to talk about his father\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cLast night I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Austin said Wednesday. \u201cI kept thinking of him. I had to make that decision when he was on his deathbed.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t tearing up or nothing. I was thinking about the time I spent with him at the hospital (as his father was on life support). Thinking about the time we used to go fishing. I had talked to him a couple days before the accident \u2014 he was going to come out here and enjoy the games.\n\n\u201cMy father is the reason I\u2019m here right now. He\u2019s the reason I have this confidence, this swagger. He (instilled) all those things in me. I made him proud. My family told me before he passed away that I was like a hero to him.\n\n\u201cThe doctors said, \u2018What do you want to do?\u2019 I pretty much had to let my father go rest. I told him it was OK.\u201d\n\nFamily ties that bind\n\nJackson is extremely introspective. He grew up in a family unit household in Northridge, Calif., just outside Los Angeles. His mom, Robin, and dad were together until they separated in Malik and Marquis\u2019 senior year. They were both large men like their father. Marquis was an all-conference defensive end at Texas Southern University.\n\n\u201cThe boys were the closest of friends, but they were also their worst enemies,\u201d Robin Jackson said.\n\nMalik and Marquis might call each other a so-so. But who are you to say that to my brother? Dad so loved his sons but he pushed them. He spoiled his daughter, Starra, who is 18.\n\n\u201cShe was daddy\u2019s little girl,\u201d Robin Jackson said. \u201cWhen Jodie passed, everybody was focused on her. Marquis, because he\u2019s the oldest twin, he focused on all the arrangements.\u201d\n\nMalik Jackson is wrestling with dedicating this season to his father, but he wants to make sure he\u2019s doing it from the heart and not a script.\n\n\u201cYou do that, but if I have a bad game, you say, \u2018This isn\u2019t what dad would have wanted,\u2019 \u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou know what I mean? I\u2019m dedicating it to him, but I don\u2019t want to do it just to say it. Can\u2019t dedicate a season and be average.\u201d\n\nAustin grew up in a rough section of D.C. He was an only child. Mom and dad separated before he reached school age, but Marvin Austin Sr. was not an absentee father.\n\n\u201cBest decision he ever made was not allowing me to play when I was 10 years old,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI had to play the 125 (pound) division, full of 13-, 14-year-olds. I was so hot with him, too. My dad said, \u2018Nah, can\u2019t play. Not going to let you get out there and get beat up.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMarvin Austin Jr. will be out there Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, sometimes lining up alongside Jackson, a defensive end who moves in to tackle during passing situations.\n\n\u201cI look at it like this: My father, he\u2019s resting,\u201d Austin said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be with me at all times now. But I\u2019m going to say this as blunt as I can: Nobody gives a (bleep). In this league, they don\u2019t a (bleep) about your daddy. You think the Cardinals care? No. They\u2019ll try to take your head off.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is you go through, you\u2019ve got to understand this is your livelihood. What better thing to do than go out there and play on Sundays.\u201d\n\nMalik Jackson, DE\n\nBorn: Jan. 11, 1990, in Northridge, Calif.
