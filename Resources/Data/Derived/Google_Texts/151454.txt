Blood Feud (8/22 3:00 AM)

Why You Should Watch – When Mr. Burns desperately needs a blood transfusion to survive "hypohemia," Bart Simpson is the only donor who matches. One of the first episodes to really establish Mr. Burns as deliciously evil and Homer as wonderfully stupid.

Classic Moment – Homer tries to recover an angry letter from the post office by pretending to be Mr. Burns - yet he doesn’t know his first name.
