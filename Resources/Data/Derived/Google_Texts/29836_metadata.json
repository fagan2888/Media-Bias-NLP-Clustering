Under Lolo Health\u2019s model, doctors and therapists work for a community that supports a locally controlled health center. Members have access to a personal health team that includes everything from acupuncture to yoga, at prices lower than most insurance copays. \u201cCostCo meets Whole Foods\u201d is how one happy patient describes it.\n\nCalifornia-based Lolo Health has been pioneering their new brand of home-grown health care reform. Described as an ObamaCare alternative that promises to make primary care more affordable and more effective, while creating a much more successful business model for physicians. While many Americans have their worries about ObamaCare, it may be doctors who are feeling the least optimistic about the new law. According to a recent survey, as many as 83 percent of private physicians are considering leaving practice due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLolo Health\u2019s first location in Oakland is nearly full, and plans are underway to license the concept to doctors around the country. \u201cOakland has been our test kitchen,\u201d says Lolo Health founder Lorenzo Puertas. \u201cOakland\u2019s a very tough health care market, but we chose it to make sure we had something that worked \u2013 not just in a fancy neighborhood, but for working people and families. We plan to take this model national.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrimary care is important, the foundation of a working health care system,\u201d said Puertas. \u201cBut America\u2019s doctors spend their days fighting with insurance companies and trying to pay the bills. With ObamaCare on the horizon, it\u2019s only going to get worse. It\u2019s time to abandon that model.\u201d \u201cThe Lolo cooperative health model is a completely redesigned primary care experience,\u201d said Puertas, \u201cbased on freedom and consumer choice. Our clinic is supported by the membership fees of a small community of members. Our doctors are free to practice as they wish. No insurance company restrictions, no government interference.\u201d\n\nLolo Health members pay a monthly fee in return for unlimited access to a variety of services. Members pay small fees for each visit, for example $19 for a doctor\u2019s visit, a massage, chiropractic, or acupuncture treatment.\n\n\u201cBest of all, doctors get a business model that produces stable, recurrent income from satisfied patients,\u201d said Puertas. \u201cOur cooperative health model lets us put control back in the hands of doctors and patients, where it belongs.\u201d\n\nLolo had previously attempted to run a crowdfunding campaign on health crowdfunding platform Medstartr.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, lolo, lorenzo puertas, medical, medstartr, finance, fintech, crowdfunding, marketplace lending, peer to peer lending", "ca_image": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lolo-Cooperative-Health-150x110.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Crowdfund Insider", "description": "Called Obamacare Alternative for Doctors and Patients Launched in 2012, Lolo Health\u2019s \u201ccooperative health\u201d model offers doctors a consumer-driven alternati", "title": "Lolo Health Pushes Crowdfunded Health Care Model -\u00a0Crowdfund Insider", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lolo-Cooperative-Health.jpg", "url": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2013/10/24221-lolo-health-pushes-crowdfunded-health-care-model/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Called Obamacare Alternative for Doctors and Patients Launched in 2012, Lolo Health\u2019s \u201ccooperative health\u201d model offers doctors a consumer-driven alternative and the chance to make more money than from an insurance-based practice with a lot less paperwork. \u00a0Under Lolo Health's model, doctors and therapists work for a community that supports a locally controlled health center.
