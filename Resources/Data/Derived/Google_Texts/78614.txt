Update at 2:13 p.m.: Revised to include details about the bus passengers from MedStar.

Ten people, most of them U.S. military personnel, suffered minor injuries Saturday in a crash involving two charter buses and another vehicle on Interstate 35W in North Fort Worth.

About 110 service members, most of whom had completed basic training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and graduated Friday, were traveling to Fort Sam Houston in South Texas, MedStar spokesman Matt Zavadsky said.

Zavadsky said it was unclear what caused the crash, which was reported about 11:30 a.m. on southbound I-35W near Meacham Boulevard.

He said the two buses apparently collided after one of them rear-ended a car in front of it.

Two people from the car and eight people from the buses were taken to hospitals with minor injuries.

The remaining service members were taken to a nearby travel center, where they waited for different buses to take them to South Texas.
