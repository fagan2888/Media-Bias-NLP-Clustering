So let\u2019s check in on Charlie Sheen\u2019s Twitter.\n\nHe Has A Hunting Knife And A Fun-Sized Thing Of Tabasco And He\u2019s Not Afraid To Use Them\n\nSheen\u2019s ongoing feud with ex-wife #DuhNeese Richards escalated this week, when she refused to let him come on a family Christmas vacation.\n\nHis response was to chop up this baseball bat souvenir from their wedding and arrange the pieces in a somewhat threatening manner, posted with a threatening \u2026poem?\n\nMaybe the miniature thing of Tabasco has personal significance for Charlie and #DuhNeese, or maybe he just really likes Tabasco because it cools his tiger blood. Does anyone else have a craving for chili fries right now?\n\n\u2013\n\nHe Calls Forth The Judgement Of Almighty God On The Duck Dynasty Guy\n\nDuck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson made an absolute prick of himself last week with an anti-gay tirade in a GQ interview.\n\nCharlie Sheen is right on the case and is not letting go, writing menacing poems and quoting scripture.\n\nThat link leads to this essay:\n\nAnd then of course, this:\n\nBecause the best way to fight religious insanity is with more religious insanity.\n\n\u2013\n\nDon\u2019t Even Get Him Started On The Department Of Children And Family Services\n\nSheen\u2019s other ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, recently lost custody of their twin boys. If you really want to, you can read the sad tale here, but suffice to say it starts with the words \u2018crack binge\u2019 and doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nSheen himself can\u2019t take them, because he posts pictures like the one with the knife and the baseball bat. At this point, it looks like Denise Richards might be taking the boys on for the holidays, even though they\u2019re prone to attacking her and her pets.\n\nAt this point, Sheen is reduced to attacking the DCFS through the medium of Twitter acrostics. The Dungeness crab reference might be due to the fact that it\u2019s a bottom feeder. Or maybe the secret to understanding Charlie Sheen\u2019s Twitter is that he mostly updates it at lunch time.\n\n\u2013\n\nHe Doesn\u2019t Quite Grasp The Concept Of Obamacare\n\n\n\nTo be fair, nobody does \u2014 including Obama.\n\n\u2013\n\nBut At Least He\u2019s Maintaining Good Oral Hygiene\n\nWinners look after their teeth and gums.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "charlie sheen", "og": {"site_name": "Junkee", "description": "Has anyone checked in on Charlie Sheen lately?
