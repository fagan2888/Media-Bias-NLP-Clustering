Closer still is the corner of Pearl at Louisiana, where TRI Pointe neighbors in Platt Park North head for coffee and famous Duffeyrolls by morning \u2013 Village Cork and Hanson\u2019s Grill by night; on the way to walkable eateries further south: Stella\u2019s, Sushi Den, Uno Mas, Kaos Pizza and Gaia.\n\nThat\u2019s just the start of what\u2019s happening now in Platt Park, says Stephanie Graham with TRI Pointe, who\u2019ll show you those two appealing models \u2013 both with two-car garages, very private outdoor living spaces, in a choice of historic architecture: English Revival, Craftsman, Mid-Century Modern. \u201cWe\u2019re getting prospects that start out looking at older homes in West Wash Park, that are actually further from the park and from Whole Foods and Pub-on-Pearl than we are,\u201d she added.\n\nMeanwhile, TRI Pointe Sales Director Tina Martelon-Braunthal, who actually grew up in the neighborhood, points west to huge changes taking place on the Gates Rubber redevelopment site along South Broadway \u2013 Maria Empanada already open, a totally new streetscape coming to Broadway and Arizona, and new apartments all along the corridor.\n\nRenters looking at the latter need to be checking out the pricing of Platt Park North, says Graham. \u201cRentals range from $2,200 to $3,000 a month, and at that range they should be considering buying here,\u201d she adds. TRI-Pointe\u2019s prices, which Graham says end up centered between the $600s and mid-$700s, will look particularly appealing to buyers who are shopping neighborhoods around Highlands, where these kinds of prices get you only a townhome without this space and features.\n\nYou\u2019ll see VERY creative interiors \u2013 one imagined around male tastes, the other feminine \u2013 along with slab granite counters, large areas of engineered wood floors, spacious \u2018owner\u2019s entries\u2019 from the garages, and upstairs laundries, all at the standard price. Buyers get some semi-custom options: one for a master retreat with a \u2018spa\u2019 bath with giant shower and designer tub; another for finished basement space that\u2019ll take these designs to over 3,000 square feet finished.\n\nGraham also has homes that can deliver soon \u2013 one that can be ready right away at $660,000. To put today\u2019s opening together with South Pearl\u2019s Sunday Farmer\u2019s Market (9-to-1), exit I-25 southbound at Washington or northbound at Downing/Emerson and turn west on Louisiana, three blocks to S.
