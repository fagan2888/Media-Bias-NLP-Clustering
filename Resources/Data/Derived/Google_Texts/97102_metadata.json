But the fight isn\u2019t over.\n\nA U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet lists Kratom as an addictive substance that\u2019s mildly stimulating or, in large doses, \u201cprofoundly euphoric.\u201d\n\nSusan Ash, executive director of the American Kratom Association -- and a Lyme disease sufferer -- calls it a lifesaver.\n\n\u201cI rarely left the house, I didn\u2019t have a job, I wasn\u2019t doing anything. I felt like I was just lost and sick, and like I was going to be like that forever.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Kristi Jacobs of Coconut Creek calls kratom a potential killer. Jacobs says she talked to grieving parents who blame kratom for their children\u2019s death.\n\nKratom is not banned or blessed by the federal government, so hard evidence is hard to come by. The National Institutes of Health warns of rare cases of acute liver damage by recreational use.\n\nJacobs\u2019 bill called for a study by state law enforcement and health officials, but it died after intense lobbying by Ash. Jacobs is vowing to file the bill again in January. Ash says she\u2019ll be back too, to defend something she believes is a panacea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about people with chronic pain, people that suffer from addiction, people with severe depression and anxiety. It just makes it all worth the effort, watching people turn their lives around.\u201d\n\nKratom is sold on the internet or in smoke shops as gel caps or tea. It\u2019s illegal in four states.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Kratom users are celebrating after the Florida Legislature failed to begin a crackdown on the controversial Southeast Asian plant.
