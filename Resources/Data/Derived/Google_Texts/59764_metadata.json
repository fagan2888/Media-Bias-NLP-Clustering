In the film, he was a truck driver with a sick son who needed life-saving surgery and he couldn\u2019t get it because he lost his job and thus, his insurance.\n\nThat was so 1990s.\n\nNow, I\u2019m a working stiff in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century who just needs a new CPAP machine. If you\u2019re a longtime reader, you know of my sleep apnea and how I think the CPAP is a miraculous time machine that makes me feel 18 by blowing pressurized air up my schnozz and keeping my throat open, thus keeping me breathing through the night and keeping my stupid brain from doing what it does in not sending me the \"You're not breathing. Wake up!\" signal.\n\nDuring the 15 or so years I\u2019ve been dealing with sleep apnea, I\u2019ve been through countless masks that I usually buy out of my own pocket instead of dealing with the red tape and increased costs associated with the insurance scamdustry\u2019s handling of the situation. I\u2019m blessed with work and the convenience and lower cost of ordering from one of the on-line apnea warehouses works great for me.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve tapped into the insurance exactly twice for my apnea supplies. The first time, 15 years ago, came after diagnosis, when a big basic machine was delivered and paid in part by the insurance and the other part by convenient installments from my wallet.\n\nThe second time came about seven years ago when it was time to replace the first machine.\n\nFast forward to 2015. That second machine is experiencing a sticky on-off switch, which got me to thinking it was time to replace the machine with something more modern. Except you need a prescription to buy a new CPAP from anyone, even the online warehouses.\n\nDid the meth-heads and heroin shooters figure out a way to use CPAPs for some illegal purpose? Because I cannot imagine anyone willfully strapping on a mask and turning on a machine to go to sleep. It\u2019s life-saving, but it\u2019s not exactly natural, and it squishes any shot I have at cuddling with the wife that may remain after 30 years of marriage. So, why the prescription?\n\nAnyway, my local supplier (yes, I have a medical \u201cguy\u201d for CPAPs) says, that indeed I\u2019m due, but due to new regulations, I need a new sleep study.\n\nBuhwah? My machine\u2019s switch is bad. My switch is not bad.\n\nSo, it\u2019s off to the doctor. Who then says that yes, thanks to more modern awareness of sleep apnea, it\u2019s advisable to get a new sleep study and get the need for air pressure adjusted to new poundage. Every change in weight and age affects apnea.\n\nExcept.\n\nThey make these wonderful automatic CPAP machines now that read your need and hone in on the necessary air pressure to be blown up your schnozz with every breath. Seems to me that obliterates the need for more study. I'm not sick, I feel fine, my switch needs replaced, so why spend a few thousand extra dollars to study what a $800 to $1,000 or so machine can do and would do for another several years? By the way, what I've read says these machines adjust for weight gains and losses and even allergies and stuffy noses and colds. No damned hospital sleep study will be able to do that on a day to day basis.\n\nSo all that seems to matter here is the system wanting me to get an unnecessary study at a cost to somebody (me and whoever else has my insurance). Wasn't that what Obamacare was supposed to fix?\n\nHere's where John Q. starts boiling in me.\n\nThe insurers say you need a sleep study to get a new machine and it\u2019s been too long without a sleep study for me. The health goods providers say maybe they can get me a machine, but I should go see the doc. Then they say I\u2019ve been a customer for 15 years, and an automated CPAP can do the job. But the insurer, after my doc\u2019s wonderful staff fights for a week, gets a sleep study approved.\n\nMeanwhile, the supplier, apparently, has found something that says I can get an APAP, no problem.\n\nAnd so now, the question is, with all that in my health record (the doc had to emphasize my need for a sleep study assessing my air pressure needs because it was believed that was what would be needed to get a new CPAP machine) can I really turn down the sleep study and get a new machine?\u2019\n\nOr will Barry\u2019s healthcare minions be upset and come to take away my machines, fine the doctor, the insurer, the healthcare provider and \u201cHouse M.D.\u201d? (\u201cHouse\u201d is what I watch when I want to really take an afternoon nap.)\n\nThe late U.S. Rep. Charlie Wilson of Ohio used to say humorously that nobody ever accepts the statement, \u201cI\u2019m from the federal government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d He got that.\n\nBut then he voted in favor of Obamacare and now I can\u2019t figure out how to replace a machine that\u2019s simply a blowdryer with a few circuit boards attached.\n\nI\u2019m not committing a federal crime. I just need to replace my CPAP because my switch went bad. Logically, I\u2019d like to do that and save myself a bunch of deductible payments, as well as not cost the system a gazillion extra dollars for a machine that costs about as much as a good TV, which I\u2019m blessed enough to be able to afford, at least for now.\n\nStay tuned.
