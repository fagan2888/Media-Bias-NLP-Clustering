They opted to join a Christian health-care sharing ministry instead.\n\nBut some critics say these ministries don\u2019t do enough to protect consumers.\n\nSherri Myers was at a dance class in 2009 when she felt something tear in her leg. The Bolingbrook woman went to the hospital, and soon learned her leg was bleeding internally, and she needed surgery. Her bills started mounting. Myers was worried, her family had switched from traditional insurance to a new way to pay health care costs just months before.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was cheaper, truthfully,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need a lot of the bells and whistles of insurance, and with our insurance it didn\u2019t take care of that anyway, and it felt like instead of just sending for your insurance, it seemed like such a way to minister to other people.\u201d\n\n\n\nMyers had signed up for a cost-sharing ministry, and this was the first big test. People from all over the country sent her checks to cover her medical bills, and cards to encourage her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a gift in a way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re praying for them, they\u2019re praying for you, at different times. And that God in all of it gets glorified.\u201d\n\nMyers is a customer of Samaritan Ministries, based in Peoria. As is her pastor, the Rev. Timothy Greene, at Living Word Bible Church in Morris. He said Samaritan\u2019s health care plan is based on the Biblical principle of carrying your own load, and helping others bear their burdens too.\n\n\u201cOur bodies are created by God, we need to take care of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real sense of responsibility that we feel. We don\u2019t just want to rush off to the doctor for everything.\u201d\n\nThe pastor estimates nearly 20 percent of his 150-member congregation is part of Samaritan.\n\nEarlier this year, thousands of people joined them during the rush to sign up for traditional health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. While millions bought private plans on the new health exchanges, others opted to join a Christian health-care sharing ministry. With about 37,000 families enrolled, Samaritan is one of the three largest cost-sharing programs in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\u201cHealth care sharing ministries are a mechanism for people of faith to band together to share medical bills without using insurance,\u201d said Executive Vice President James Lansberry.\n\n\n\nMany didn\u2019t want to buy insurance that covered abortion or some types of contraception.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say people were attracted to us because they wanted a way (out) from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Lansberry said. \u201cI think there were particular facets in plans in the Affordable Care Act that caused them to have some moral concerns that drove them toward health care sharing.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn fact, members are required to lead an evangelical Christian lifestyle and share certain religious beliefs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe members all agree to attend church, they agree to abstain from illegal drugs, they agree not to abuse tobacco or alcohol,\u201d Lansberry said, adding they also agree to abstain from sex outside of \u201ctraditional marriage.\u201d (The plan won\u2019t cover pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases if they happen outside of marriage.)\n\n\n\nMembers sign a pledge each year, and their pastors sign off that they\u2019re following the tenets of the plan. At Samaritan, the monthly cost ranges from $180 for a single person to $405 for a family. Members pay for routine care like doctor\u2019s visits out of pocket. When big things happen, like baby deliveries or broken legs, customers help repay each other\u2019s bills. Samaritan coordinates who pays whom.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery month we send our check in, but we\u2019re not just sending it to a big company somewhere in Omaha or Providence, we\u2019re sending it to an actual person,\u201d Lansberry said. Once a year, members send their checks directly to the company to help with administrative costs.\n\n\n\nBut not everyone thinks this system works. Some consumer advocates like Kevin Lucia have misgivings.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have concerns in part because some of the important consumer protections that apply to the individual market do not apply to health care sharing ministries,\u201d said Lucia, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\n\n\nThese companies don\u2019t have to meet protections provided by the Affordable Care Act because they\u2019re exempted as religious ministries. That\u2019s why people who sign up for them don\u2019t pay a penalty for not having traditional insurance. The ministries are also exempt from many state and federal laws, Lucia said. For instance, the ministries can cap reimbursements; and they don\u2019t have to cover pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\nBoth of these things are true of Samaritan, which caps reimbursements for a single need at $250,000, and qualifies how it covers pre-existing conditions. Some members are in an additional program to save up money and share higher costs for expensive things like cancer treatment that can easily top $250,000.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn most states, there are reserve requirements because if a plan takes on too much risk and they can\u2019t pay out the claims for their members, there is this possibility the insurance company will go under,\u201d Lucia said. Ministries don\u2019t have to hold such reserves in case health needs outpace contributions.\n\n\n\nWhen that happens at Samaritan, the company prorates how much people get paid back for their bills. After three months of this, it asks members to vote on increasing their monthly contributions.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re not covered in many states under insurance law, (members) don\u2019t have this kind of army of consumer regulators that are available to protect them in case something goes wrong,\u201d Lucia said.\n\n\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem, Lucia said, the only remedy is the Attorney General\u2019s Office or the courts. The Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office reports one complaint back in 2000, and no lawsuits show up in federal or Cook County court records.\n\n\n\nSamaritan\u2019s James Lansberry said members regulate themselves: \u201cThere\u2019s no direct regulation from any state or federal agency because there\u2019s no need for it. If we make our members upset, we won\u2019t have an organization.\u201d\n\n\n\n20 years after it started, Lansberry\u2019s organization is still here and growing stronger because of people like John Appleton. The West Chicago man\u2019s been a member of Samaritan Ministries for 15 years. He likens it to an Amish barn raising, where everyone voluntarily helps each other. But he acknowledges not everyone will be comfortable with health care sharing ministries.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about where you put your faith,\u201d he said. \u201cIf some people would rather put their faith in the government or an insurance company, for us, we put our faith in Christ and his people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "State News", "description": "Earlier this year as people rushed to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, thousands found an unusual alternative.
