With prices surging all over town, first-time buyers have a challenging time getting into home ownership \u2013 but opportunity knocks at Stapleton today, where two new models by KB Home offer uncommon affordability in terms of size and features.\n\nIn Stapleton\u2019s new Willow Park East neighborhood, north of The Shops at Northfield Stapleton, you can tour two new Paired Homes by KB Home \u2013 duplex-styled plans that are more open and alluring than any duplex or townhome you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. They have wide-open entertaining spaces and appealing kitchens, options for expanding the bedroom levels to three-plus-a-loft, and masters that look and feel like luxury single-family suites with extra-large walk-in closets. Two-car garages and fenced side yards for a garden or pet are included, and you get the option of adding finished basement space up front.\n\nAll KB Homes are Energy Star certified; yet these are priced from just over $300,000. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing buyers coming out of apartments, but also older Denver neighborhoods like Washington Park and Mayfair, where they\u2019re living in homes nowhere near this size, not even counting the basement finish option,\u201d says Randy Carpenter, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at KB Home Colorado. With FHA 3%-down loans available again, KB Home is making many of those buyers happy \u2013 but Stapleton\u2019s rapid sales means that few homes are ready for quick move-in.\n\nKB Home\u2019s Todd Middendorp and Patrick Sleeper can show you two exceptions \u2013 including a \u2018Cedar\u2019 with 1,700 square feet in a 3-bedroom, 2-1/2 bath plan, plus full basement, at $360,000 \u2013 well below the price of an average home in Denver County this year. It\u2019s close to three planned pocket parks, and a new high school that Denver Public Schools will open this fall. Stapleton\u2019s schools are rapidly achieving high marks in statewide rankings, Carpenter adds. \u201cPeople who come in rarely realize just how good they are.\u201d\n\nCarpenter notes another affordable advantage of these Paired Designs \u2013 no expensive HOA (the master HOA fee is only $40 a month). Of course, there\u2019s the added advantage of Stapleton\u2019s commuter rail location \u2013 accessible to downtown, but also to DIA. Stapleton\u2019s popular Town Center shopping area on Quebec Street is now paralleled by The Shops at Northfield Stapleton, with a main street-styled restaurant row, plus theaters, Macy\u2019s and more.\n\nTo reach KB Home and other builders in Stapleton\u2019s Willow Park East and Conservatory Green neighborhoods, take MLK Blvd east to Central Park Blvd, turn north across I-70 to Northfield Blvd, turn left on Northfield 0.3 mi. to Uinta, and turn right, head north.\n\nKB Home Paired Homes in Stapleton\u2019s Willow Park East; 2 furnished models, options for larger bedroom level; close to new parks, to high school opening this fall, The Shops at Northfield Stapleton; some homes for quick delivery. 8187 E. 53rd Dr., Denver; from central Stapleton take MLK Blvd east to Central Park Blvd, turn north 1.9 mi.
