Researchers who study the disease and health care providers have too long focused their work on the final chapter, he said.\n\n\u201cThe best treatment is prevention and early detection,\u201d Dr. Sotomayor told the audience at the Jack Morton Auditorium Monday morning for the panel discussion, \u201c21st Century Research: At the Crossroads Between Clinical and Population Sciences.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently most of the investment is in the last chapter of this book, so we are investing our dollars in treatment, diagnosis and survivorship, but we need to start focusing on prevention, lifestyle and diet.\u201d\n\nDr. Sotomayor joined moderator and Milken Institute School of Public Health Dean Lynn Goldman and National Cancer Institute Director of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences Robert Croyle for the quarterly conversation hosted by GW and ICF International.\n\nThe event was a product of the partnership between GW and ICF International to explore research opportunities in federal health programs such as genetics and genomics and survey methods. The GW Office of the Vice President for Research helped to coordinate the event. GW President Steven Knapp said the partnership is \u201ca model for working relationships between academia and the private sector.\u201d\n\n\"We need to start focusing on prevention, lifestyle and diet,\" George Washington University Cancer Center Director Eduardo Sotomayor said. (Logan Werlinger/GW Today)\n\n\u201cI believe this kind of partnership will become increasingly important as the challenges of rising health care costs continue to emerge, and the entire system is redefined because of the changing market dynamics brought about by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Dr. Knapp said.\n\nPanelists discussed the importance of collaborative \u201cteam science\u201d across disciplines, holistic data collection and health care information management systems in improving cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment, especially in underserved communities\n\nAccording to Dr. Goldman, the conversation comes at a critical time for cancer research at GW, which is on the verge of a campus-wide \u201cunified effort\u201d to address the disease led by the GW Cancer Center. The national conversation also has changed following the launch of the federal government\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative last January.\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced the initiative during the 2015 State of the Union address. It aims to develop medical treatment and patient care programs based on personalized data, including genetics, lifestyle and environment.\n\nWhen applied to cancer screenings, the \u201cprecision\u201d approach would redefine how a patient\u2019s risk of cancer is classified and evaluated, Dr. Croyle said.\n\n\u201cWe will probably look back on this era and laugh about the fact that our cancer risk screening and prediction models did not include factors beyond age,\u201d Dr. Croyle said.\n\nDr. Sotomayor recounted how the Moffitt Cancer Center found success using a personalized approach to data collection. The center launched the Total Cancer Care Initiative in 2006 and has collected long-term data from tens of thousands of patients to build a comprehensive database.\n\nThe program\u2014which stores the data for future research\u2014became a basis for the Orion Cancer ID Consortium. To date, 10 centers have joined the consortium to pool their data for research.\n\nPatients receiving treatment were asked for permission to have their medical history tracked, their personal data collected and their cancer tissue studied. To manage privacy concerns, the center consulted with a patient advocacy group and an ethics committee, Dr. Sotomayor said.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep patients a part of these initiatives because at the end of the day, it is their data,\u201d Dr. Sotomayor said. \u201cThey are donating it to us so that we can better address their concerns\u2014better treatment and better care.\u201d\n\nPanelists agreed that improved data collection could spur many changes, including a greater need for health research information systems and a better understanding of how factors such as nutrition, demographic data and genetic trends affect cancer risk.\n\nThis wealth of information is also a spark for cross-disciplinary \u201cteam science\u201d that calls for training researchers\u2014especially those from unexpected disciplines\u2014to work in large, collaborative teams, according to Dr. Croyle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to look across the university and leverage the expertise in arts and sciences, because it is something often underutilized at cancer centers,\u201d Dr. Croyle said. \u201cWe need geographers to be involved in cancer control. We need people with experience in cultural anthropology. We need economists, and we need mathematicians.\n\nICF International Chairman Sudhakar Kesavan offered closing remarks. (Logan Werlinger/GW Today)\n\n\u201cA cancer center can be a catalytic force and a convening force, but it is also a bridge to the community,\u201d Dr. Croyle said.\n\nDr. Sotomayor emphasized how the GW Cancer Center is working to prioritize \u201cservice to the community\u201d and build cross-disciplinary partnerships campus wide.\n\nHe and School of Engineering and Applied Science Biomedical Engineering Department Chair Igor Efimov are brainstorming opportunities to engage biomedical engineering students and faculty in developing nanotechnology tools for cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\nHe added that the Cancer Center location on the eighth floor of Science and Engineering Hall will offer the necessary proximity to other research disciplines to promote cross-disciplinary research.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Dr. Sotomayor said. \u201cThere are so many great opportunities for us to collaborate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "George washington university, gwu, gw, gw university, george washington, dc universities, dc colleges, education, higher education", "MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "By Brittney DunkinsGeorge Washington University Cancer Center Director Eduardo Sotomayor likens the progressive stages of cancer to reading the chapters of a book.\nDr. Sotomayor emphasized how the GW Cancer Center is working to prioritize \u201cservice to the community\u201d and build cross-disciplinary partnerships campus wide.\nHe added that the Cancer Center location on the eighth floor of Science and Engineering Hall will offer the necessary proximity to other research disciplines to promote cross-disciplinary research.\n\u201cWe have to keep patients a part of these initiatives because at the end of the day, it is their data,\u201d Dr. Sotomayor said.\nDr. Sotomayor recounted how the Moffitt Cancer Center found success using a personalized approach to data collection."}
