Democracy cannot succeed without people`s participation in government and this participation should not be limited only during elections,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nBesides Modi, Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth, DEITY Secretary R S Sharma were also present at the launch of the portal.\n\nNational Informatics Centre (NIC) of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) will implement and manage the platform.\n\nThere are multiple theme-based discussions on MyGov where a wide range of people can share their thoughts and ideas with the government, Sharma told reporters after the launch.\n\n\"It is also an initiative to build a digital knowledge library. We will guide the people on the topics of national importance on which the government would like to know their views and ideas,\" he added.\n\nThe platform presents an opportunity for the citizens to both `Discuss` and `Do`, Sharma said, adding, any idea shared by a contributor will also be discussed on the discussion forums, allowing constructive feedback and interaction.\n\nAt present, there are six groups on the platform -- Clean Ganga, Girl Child Education, Clean India, Skilled India, Digital India and Job Creation.\n\n\"Citizens can also volunteer for various tasks and submit their entries. These tasks would be reviewed by other members and experts. Once approved, these tasks can be shared by those who complete the task and by other members on MyGov,\" Sharma said.\n\nEach group consists of online and on-ground tasks that can be taken up by the contributors. The objective of each group is to bring about a qualitative change in that sphere through people`s participation, he said.\n\n\"We will review the working on MyGov in three months and over time the number of groups, tasks and discussions will increase. The platform will also be used as a comprehensive knowledge repository,\" Sharma added.\n\nThe portal can even be extended to act like public audit platform for government projects like citizens giving feedback on status of completed infrastructure projects or availability of various social sector programmes, he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, MyGov, citizens, Governance,", "og": {"site_name": "Zee News", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday launched a website mygov.nic.in that aims to help citizens contribute in governance by giving their opinions and views on important issues like Clean Ganga or skill development.", "title": "PM launches `MyGov` portal for citizens to contribute in governance", "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/pm-launches-mygov-portal-for-citizens-to-contribute-in-governance_950300.html", "updated_time": "2014-07-26T13:48:04+05:30", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/pm-launches-mygov-portal-for-citizens-to-contribute-in-governance_950300.html", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday launched a website mygov.nic.in that aims to help citizens contribute in governance by giving their opinions and views on important issues like Clean Ganga or skill development.", "card": "summary", "title": "PM launches `MyGov` portal for citizens to contribute in governance"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-26T13:48:04+05:30", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T13:48:04+05:30"}, "verify-v1": "90soTS2GMMKllaVY8vtJNQKzGSgcoEhkVtoFlmAwpOw=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday launched a website mygov.nic.in that aims to help citizens contribute in governance by giving their opinions and views on important issues like Clean Ganga or skill development."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b03\"", "article_summary": "Modi said MyGov (mygov.nic.in) is a technology-driven medium that will provide citizens an opportunity to contribute towards good governance, the statement added.\nNew Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday launched a website mygov.nic.in that aims to help citizens contribute in governance by giving their opinions and views on important issues like Clean Ganga or skill development.\nOnce approved, these tasks can be shared by those who complete the task and by other members on MyGov,\" Sharma said.\nDemocracy cannot succeed without people`s participation in government and this participation should not be limited only during elections,\" the Prime Minister said.\nAt present, there are six groups on the platform -- Clean Ganga, Girl Child Education, Clean India, Skilled India, Digital India and Job Creation."}
