The descendants of the Anawalt family, who founded Anawalt Lumber, have listed their Craftsman-style family estate in Brentwood for $11.25 million, Fox News reports.

The 4,310-square-foot home was built in 1965 with hand-selected lumber. It features a two-story living room with a poured concrete fireplace that has been waxed and stained, and there are posts and beams and oak plank floors throughout.



Anawalt Lumber was founded in 1923 in West Los Angeles.
