Employers are taking few risks with their pharmacy benefit designs as they await full implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, with little change in benefit design trends reported between 2012 and 2013, observes a new survey from the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute (PBMI). For example, use of prior authorization and step therapy, which rose from 2011 to 2012, remains relatively unchanged, while cost-sharing amounts are generally consistent across three and four-tier plans, suggests the 2013-2014 Prescription Drug Benefit Cost and Plan Design Report.

The use of narrow or limited pharmacy networks also remains consistent, according to the report, which was sponsored by Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. and is based on a survey conducted in March and April 2013 of 478 employers representing 22.5 million insured lives. While 18% of respondents offered a preferred pharmacy network, 11% offered a limited network — defined as eliminating at least one major pharmacy chain from the network — which is consistent with the previous year’s 19% and 11%, respectively.

“Narrow networks may become increasingly valuable as an alternative to mandatory or incentivized mail-service pharmacy, which has become less cost-competitive and therefore less popular with consumers as a result of retail pharmacy initiatives (e.g., discount programs, 90-day dispensing),” observed PBMI. Slightly more than one-half (55%) of respondents offer a 90-day retail program, according to the report. Among those, 26% offer limited networks for their retail 90 benefit, down from 38% in 2012.

New to this year’s survey were detailed questions about step therapy and medication adherence programs. While prior authorization continues to be employed by 86% of employers, 67% report using step therapy, up slightly from 65% the year before. When asked for the first time which drug classes require step therapy, rheumatoid arthritis (50%) and cholesterol-lowering agents (49%) were most commonly named. Among employers using at least one “therapy adherence program,” mail was identified as the most common outreach method (used by 72%), followed by pharmacist intervention (65%) and outbound live call (57%). Both text messaging and mobile apps show very little adoption to date (at 12% and 11%, respectively), said the report.

Step Therapy Is Common Coupon Tool

Employers were also queried about copay coupons. While only 34 employers (7%) report using any strategies to manage the effect of copay coupons, 53% of those said they employed step therapy as a top-line strategy. More than half (53%) also said they were ramping up member education efforts around trying generics first and 50% said they were turning to prior authorization to combat the coupons. Other tactics identified include the implementation of a “member pays the difference” policy, increasing the copay tier differential between preferred and nonpreferred brands, and the adoption of a restricted/closed formulary.

Moreover, the report offers what PBMI says is to the best of its knowledge the only survey data collected by plan sponsors about their pharmacy discount rates, such as average wholesale price (AWP) discounts by pharmacy channel. Employers reported an average of 65% off AWP for 30-day generic supplies at retail, 63% off AWP for 90-day generics at retail and 61% off AWP for generics filled via mail order.

For the 62% of respondents who were willing to share drug rebate data, 32% said they receive a flat guaranteed amount per prescription, 22% receive a percentage share of rebates with no guarantee, and 17% receive a percentage share with a minimum guarantee. The flat guaranteed rebate amount averaged $17.21 for 30-day brand-name retail prescriptions.

Other survey findings include:

Similar to 2012, the most commonly used cost-sharing approach is a three-tier plan design, representing 64% of all respondents, while four-tier designs represent 22% of respondents.

Among plans with three or four tiers, average 30-day supply copayments for generic, preferred brand, and nonpreferred brand drugs, respectively, are $11, $30-$32, and $56. Specialty copayments average $107, ranging from $40 to $275.

In plans with a three-tier cost-sharing benefit, the average copayment for a 90-day supply of generic medication filled at the retail pharmacy is $23.32 while the average 90-day copay at mail is $20.83. Preferred brand drugs had an average copay of $58.30 when filled via mail order, compared to $67.37 at retail.

Plans with a four-tier design offered 90-day supplies of a generic medication at an average retail copay of $23.05 and an average mail copay of $21.23 , while preferred brands were available for $73.63 and $62.21, respectively.

While one-half of respondents continue to report the use of at least one value-based incentive program, the percentage of employers tying rewards to participation in health risk assessments has risen sharply from 21% in 2011 to 26% in 2012 and 30% in 2013.
