In Obama's Unrealpolitik, you don't actually solve problems. You just come up with some spin that explains why you're winning, even when you're losing, and the other side is losing even when they're winning.

China? Totally isolated.

The United States is not looking for conflict with China but steps it is taking in the South China Sea are self-isolating and prompting other countries to seek help from Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said on Friday.

China has a global infrastructure network encompassing parts of Africa and the Middle East. It's also one of three major world powers.

Obama Inc. also claims that Russia is isolated. If two out of the three world powers are isolated, what does the word "isolated" even mean? Nothing. Russia carved up Ukraine and is set to win in Syria. China is expanding its territory and Obama has failed to either stop it or even meaningfully defy it. Instead Obama Inc. apologized for overflying one of China's new islands.

Oh yes. China is isolated all-right. Everyone except Obama is isolated. Or maybe it's the other way around.
