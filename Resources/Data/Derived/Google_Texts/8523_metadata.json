( Kristoffer Tripplaar-Pool/Getty Images )\n\nThe recent breach of Anthem\u2019s health insurance computer network provides a compelling backdrop for President Barack Obama\u2019s Friday appearance at a White House cybersecurity conference on the Stanford campus.\n\nThe high-profile attacks on Sony Pictures, Target and Home Depot, to name just a few, show the various ways corporations and their customers are vulnerable.\n\nIn an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last year, FBI Chief James Comey described the international threat posed by cyberhackers as \u201can evil layer cake.\u201d At the top are nation-state actors, most notably the Chinese, along with terrorists and international crime syndicates. Then you\u2019ve got your garden-variety hacktavists.\n\nYeah, the Internet has turned into a pretty rough neighborhood. And the bad guys are pretty much everywhere. And even if you think you\u2019re not vulnerable, well, you are. We all are, really.\n\nOn San Francisco\u2019s Valencia Street this week, there were mixed reactions to the question, \u201cDo you feel that your information online is safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really, not really,\u201d said Robert Fujii. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s inevitable, so we just need to come up with a better security system. But, no, I never feel that it\u2019s safe, my information.\u201d\n\nFujii\u2019s biggest concern? \u201cThat they might hack into our cars, things we cannot have any control over, that\u2019s what I\u2019m very, very concerned about. But big companies, I think they do have their backup. I think we\u2019re doing pretty well with security in this country. So I\u2019m not really that paranoid, but I know it\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\nJohn Martin of San Francisco was also somewhat sanguine.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I worry about it [getting hacked], but I can say it\u2019s a real possibility,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe way I manage it is, I\u2019m pretty good about passwords, I\u2019m pretty good about keeping passwords different for different websites. Either you participate in this world that has a lot of stuff happening online or you don\u2019t. And I prefer to participate.\u201d\n\nThat said, Martin admitted he\u2019s on the lookout for vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIf I go to a restaurant and hand somebody my credit card, what\u2019s going to happen to the credit card, you know?,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI think if you\u2019re going to live in a world where you\u2019re not paying with cash in this kind of an exchange, then there\u2019s a certain amount of risk and you have to accept that risk. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\nNear the top of Obama\u2019s agenda at the Friday summit on cybersecurity is getting companies that are hacked to share that information with the federal government and each other. The idea: a coordinated effort to prevent cybercriminals from disrupting their networks.\n\nBut Jennifer Granick, with the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, says before that can happen the president needs to build trust. She sees a huge disconnect between Washington and California.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to people in D.C.,\u201d Granick said, \u201cthey really do approach the cybersecurity issue with a default belief that government has something to offer and that government\u2019s going to be helping. And when you talk to people out here in Silicon Valley, they approach it with the default belief that the government has no idea what they\u2019re doing when it comes to computer security and can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nExhibits A & B \u2014 that little debacle called healthcare.gov and the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act website, and revelations by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor, that one of the biggest cyberhackers around is the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe tech libertarian instincts about government have been reinforced by the government\u2019s inability to improve its own security and by the news that the NSA is hacking American Internet companies,\u201d Granick notes.\n\nThe Stanford law professor says the White House needs to convince tech companies that if they share information, the government will use it responsibly. In other words, be part of the solution and not part of the problem.\n\nOf course, not everyone sees the government as a hostile threat. Hitesh Sheth, CEO of Vectra Networks in San Jose, thinks the federal government \u2014 with all its reach and resources \u2014 can add a lot of muscle in the fight against cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cThat said, we should not for a second delude ourselves into thinking that the government is going to be the answer to this problem,\u201d Hitesh adds. \u201cIt really is not. Ultimately, the people that are going to have to solve this are going to be the private enterprise.\u201d\n\nSheth, whose company helps clients understand and combat their cybervulnerabilities, says there are basically two kinds of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that have been hacked but don\u2019t know it.\n\n\u201cPeople like Sony and Home Depot and Target, they hired smart people,\u201d Sheth says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the security organizations they had were inept. On the contrary, they were really hard-working, smart people. But fundamentally, they are completely outgunned.\u201d\n\nLet alone, says Sheth, small- and medium-size companies that are also vulnerable to hackers but don\u2019t have the ability to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cAnd they will never have either the resources or the means to hire an army of cybersecurity experts,\u201d Sheth notes. \u201cWhat are they to do?\u201d\n\nAnd what are we to do, since many of those corporate vulnerabilities trickle down to us? Sheth compares our personal vulnerability to a social disease that finds its way into our lives not just from enemies but also via clueless friends whose networks are infected without knowing it.\n\nNonetheless, Sheth is confident this problem represents such a huge business opportunity for Silicon Valley companies that they\u2019ll find an innovative solution to make this global neighborhood safer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama will appear at Stanford Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Stanford Summit on the 'Evil Layer Cake' of Cyberthreats\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2015\\/02\\/13\\/stanford-summit-on-evil-layer-cake-of-cyber-threats\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-13 08:00:09\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-13 16:58:12\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10431627,\"author_id\":\"255\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"author_display_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"tags\":[\"Barack Obama\",\"cybersecurity\",\"hacking\"],\"categories\":[\"News\",\"Politics and Government\",\"Technology\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2015\\/02\\/461493558.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "President Obama will appear at Stanford Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection.", "title": "Stanford Summit on the \u2018Evil Layer Cake\u2019 of Cyberthreats", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/02/13/stanford-summit-on-evil-layer-cake-of-cyber-threats/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/02/461493558.jpg?fit=640%2C427", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scottshafer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "barack obama,cybersecurity,hacking", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe way I manage it is, I\u2019m pretty good about passwords, I\u2019m pretty good about keeping passwords different for different websites.\n\u201cAnd they will never have either the resources or the means to hire an army of cybersecurity experts,\u201d Sheth notes.\nSo I\u2019m not really that paranoid, but I know it\u2019s not safe.\u201dJohn Martin of San Francisco was also somewhat sanguine.\nOn San Francisco\u2019s Valencia Street this week, there were mixed reactions to the question, \u201cDo you feel that your information online is safe?\u201d\u201cNot really, not really,\u201d said Robert Fujii.\nThe Stanford law professor says the White House needs to convince tech companies that if they share information, the government will use it responsibly."}
