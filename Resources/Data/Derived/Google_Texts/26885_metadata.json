Martha Roby\u2019s opponents in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary want to turn the contest into a referendum \u2013 not just on Roby, but what they see as problems with Washington\u2019s governing structure.\n\nU.S. Capitol at Night (Photo: Fuse, Getty Images/Fuse)\n\n\u201cShe has a failed voting record,\u201d says Becky Gerritson, a consultant and Tea Party activist challenging the three-term Montgomery Republican, citing votes on items such as the Highway Bill and the Farm Bill. \u201cHer record is worse than the Democrat she replaced.\u201d\n\nBob Rogers, an electrician from Montgomery, says he\u2019s running against \u201ccareer politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need someone who\u2019s going to stand up to Congress and stand up to interest groups, and I will be a more assertive voice,\u201d he said.\n\nRoby, for her part, welcomes those debate terms, accusing Gerritson of putting more stock in ideological scores compiled by \u201coutside Washington groups\u201d than the practical needs of her southeastern Alabama district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on continuing to do my job,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s what people want. I am a conservative who wants to solve problems, not someone who wants to cause problems for conservatives.\u201d\n\nThe winner will face Democrat Nathan Mathis in the general election.\n\nAs with most primaries, the candidates differ less over ideology than execution. Roby, Gerritson, and Rogers are all anti-abortion, pro-gun rights and anti-Obamacare, with an approach to immigration issues focused mainly on security.\n\nBuy Photo U.S. Rep Martha Roby meets with representatives of the VA hospitals and Alabama hospitals to discuss how to build a network of community health care providers to improve services offered to Alabama veterans on Thursday morning January 21, 2016 in Montgomery, Ala. (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser)\n\nNo one could mistake the Second Congressional District for a blue area, and any shades of purple are subtle. Embracing Montgomery and the Wiregrass \u2013 and shaped like an iron holding a picket sign \u2013 the region has been a Republican stronghold for decades. Only one Democrat \u2013 former Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright \u2013 has represented the area in Congress in the last 50 years.\n\nBuy Photo Becky Gerritson (Photo: Shannon Heupel/Advertiser file)\n\nIn a phone interview, Roby stressed her work within the district, including efforts to maintain Maxwell-Gunter Air Force base in Montgomery and Fort Rucker in Dale County, as well as ongoing efforts to investigate and correct abuse and dysfunction in the Veterans Affairs Administration. In early February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed her bill to require the VA to identify and intervene in hospitals with failing records. Roby has pushed for greater scrutiny of the system and the removal of personnel.\n\nBob Rogers (Photo: PATRICIAWHITE)\n\n\u201cWhat we uncovered in the Central Alabama VA was an absolute disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cNow the entire chain of command has been replaced. That\u2019s a sign of progress.\u201d\n\nGerritson argues the firings are \u201cnot good enough for what these veterans have gone through,\u201d and like Roby wants to see additional improvements in services, like bringing more doctors into the system.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a perfect plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be open to looking at everything.\u201d\n\nGerritson\u2019s strongest criticism of Roby come on votes taken on federal bills, including the $305 billion Highway Bill last December and the Farm Bill in 2014. Both votes have drawn tea party anger, with some groups accusing Congress putting unnecessary projects in the items. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, criticized the Highway Bill for failing to \u201creform the bloated, unsustainable federal highway and transit system.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaxes are collected and are allowed to be collected for roads and bridges,\u201d Gerritson said. \u201cBut with a transportation program like that that is full of all kinds of non-necessary items, that\u2019s where we draw the line.\u201d\n\nGerritson also critiques the Farm Bill for not pulling out food stamps.\n\nRoby says the services provided in both bills are critical to agricultural and infrastructure needs in the district, with the highway bill funding being particularly important for local officials. The representative criticizes votes taken for ideological purity.\n\n\u201cSome put other agendas ahead of the local interest in Alabama, and quite frankly, common sense,\u201d she said.\n\nRoby also suggested that votes on budgets, as graded by some groups, would have a detrimental effect on the district, particularly the military bases.\n\n\u201cIf I had voted the way these outsider Washington groups wanted me to, I would have voted to cut $35 billion from military budgets in 2014 and 2015,\u201d she said.\n\nRogers said he entered the race over the passage of the Affordable Care Act and says he wants to \u201ccut the strings of government\u201d from insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you have it in the private sector and in the free market, that\u2019s going to give everyone an equal playing field on which to compete,\u201d he said.\n\nRoby and Gerritson also favor a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, although like Rogers they have few specifics of what would replace the program for the estimated 195,000 Alabamians who signed up for or renewed a plan through the federal health insurance exchange in the most recent round of enrollment.\n\n\u201cI certainly would not want to throw them under the bus,\u201d said Gerritson, while saying that Congress should explore block grants to the states and free market principles for health care.\n\nRoby said there would be a \u201cgrace period\u201d for those in ACA plans should a repeal take place. She praised a proposal from U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a mix of tax credits and reduced benefits. Critics have said that plan Could add to the federal deficit.\n\nThe candidates also want to see efforts toward immigration reform that go toward security. Roby said in the interview that her priority was \u201csecuring the border\u201d before addressing any other immigration reform. Gerritson also prefers a border-first approach to the issue. Rogers said he wants a \u201chumane way of removing (undocumented immigrants), documenting them . . . put on the fast train so to speak\u201d to determine status.\n\nRoby has a significant fundraising advantage over both her opponents. From Jan. 1 to Feb. 10, she raised $853,998, with a little more than half that total coming from political action committees. She ended with $678,453 on hand.\n\nGerritson raised $146,418 from July 1 to Feb. 10during the same period, finishing with $2,351 on hand. About two-thirds of Gerritson's funds came from individual donations.\n\nRogers, funding his campaign mostly through loans, finished with about $7,110 on hand.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/211QGIw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Roby, three-term incumbent, stresses work in district; opponents criticize votes", "og": {"site_name": "The Montgomery Advertiser", "description": "Roby, three-term incumbent, stresses work in district; opponents criticize votes", "title": "Roby, Gerritson, Rogers square off in GOP primary", "url": "http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2016/02/27/roby-gerritson-rogers-square-off-gop-primary/80990914/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/montgomeryadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roby, three-term incumbent, stresses work in district; opponents criticize votes", "creator": "@mgmadvertiser", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b57b6bb2f84024eb6cf4deb5a0dba1337f30afba/c=85-0-423-338&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/27/Montgomery/Montgomery/635921668302085794-U.S.-Capitol.jpg", "title": "Roby, Gerritson, Rogers square off in GOP primary", "site": "@mgmadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=790279910", "fb": {"app_id": 163677993677689}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/southunionstreet"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Martha Roby, Becky Gerritson, Bob Rogers, U.S. Congress, Alabama Second Congressional District, primary, Republican Party, March 1, Super Tuesday"}, "article_summary": "Roby, Gerritson, and Rogers are all anti-abortion, pro-gun rights and anti-Obamacare, with an approach to immigration issues focused mainly on security.\nRoby says the services provided in both bills are critical to agricultural and infrastructure needs in the district, with the highway bill funding being particularly important for local officials.\nThat\u2019s a sign of progress.\u201dGerritson argues the firings are \u201cnot good enough for what these veterans have gone through,\u201d and like Roby wants to see additional improvements in services, like bringing more doctors into the system.\nBob Rogers (Photo: PATRICIAWHITE)\u201cWhat we uncovered in the Central Alabama VA was an absolute disaster,\u201d she said.\nGerritson raised $146,418 from July 1 to Feb. 10during the same period, finishing with $2,351 on hand."}
