But what she found may be disturbing for proponents of family dinners \u2014 the meals were often times of worry and strife. And, she argues, we can\u2019t expect moms alone to change the way America eats.\n\n\u201cThe vision of the family meal that today\u2019s food experts are whipping up is alluring,\u201d Ms. Bowen told Op-Talk in an email. \u201cMost people would agree that it would be nice to slow down, eat healthfully, and enjoy a home-cooked meal.\u201d\n\nBut that vision isn\u2019t what Ms. Bowen and the other co-authors of a recent paper about the research, Sinikka Elliott and Joslyn Brenton, saw. They spent time with 12 families, and interviewed 150 other moms from different socioeconomic strata, and found that between time pressures, money worries and picky family members, parents often struggled to squeeze meaningful togetherness out of dinnertime.\n\nAnd, they argue in their paper, published in the journal Contexts, expectations about family dinner still disproportionately affect moms: \u201cThe message that good parents \u2014 and in particular, good mothers \u2014 cook for their families dovetails with increasingly intensive and unrealistic standards of \u2018good\u2019 mothering.\u201d Of one mother\u2019s efforts to get dinner on the table, they write:\n\n\u201cLeanne\u2019s 1-year-old daughter gets fussy when her mom cooks, and looks for attention. Her husband doesn\u2019t offer much help; his contribution involves pouring barbecue sauce on the ribs, which Leanne calls \u2018working his magic.\u2019 Leanne wipes her brow and mutters to herself about the $80 she spent on ingredients. By the time she\u2019s finished cooking, she says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to eat!\u2019\u201d\n\nLeanne wasn\u2019t the only mom who found dinner stressful and exhausting. The authors note that \u201ccontrary to the stereotype that poor families mainly eat fast food,\u201d the parents they studied actually cooked a lot. \u201cPoor families couldn\u2019t afford to eat out,\u201d Ms. Bowen told Op-Talk. However, \u201cthey lacked the resources to be able to make the foodie ideal of a home-cooked meal.\u201d\n\nOne problem was the cost of fresh foods: \u201cHealthy ingredients like fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains are more expensive.\u201d But Ms. Bowen noted: \u201cMany of the poor mothers we met also lacked reliable transportation, and therefore typically shopped just once a month. As a result, they avoided buying fresh produce, which spoiled quickly.\u201d\n\nTime was an issue, too: \u201cPoor families often had unpredictable, nonstandard schedules that changed from week to week. This made it a challenge to find and organize child care and also complicated preparing and eating family meals, because everyone might not be home at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe middle-class moms they talked to were less hampered by time and money pressures, but they had problems, too \u2014 Ms. Bowen said they \u201cstill said they lacked the time to cook the way they felt they should\u201d and \u201ctalked about not being able to afford the foods they wanted to be able to provide the best meals for their families.\u201d\n\nAnd everyone dealt with what Ms. Bowen called the \u201cburden of pleasing others\u201d: \u201cMiddle-class mothers felt that offering new foods was crucial for developing their kids\u2019 palates \u2014 even if the process sometimes leads to food fights. But the process was time-consuming and stressful. For poor mothers, the stakes are high: They felt they couldn\u2019t afford to waste food if their families didn\u2019t like it. They reasoned that it was better to stick with foods (often processed) that they knew their families would eat, rather than risk wasting money and food.\u201d\n\nMs. Bowen and her co-authors write that \u201cwe rarely observed a meal in which at least one family member didn\u2019t complain about the food they were served.\u201d\n\nAt Slate, Amanda Marcotte sees the research as evidence that just telling parents to make dinner more often won\u2019t do families any good:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive and time-consuming and often done for a bunch of ingrates who would rather just be eating fast food anyway. If we want women \u2014 or gosh, men, too \u2014 to see cooking as fun, then these obstacles need to be fixed first. And whatever burden is left needs to be shared.\u201d\n\nAt The Billfold, meanwhile, Ester Bloom offers some ideas for making family dinners less fraught \u2014 and for redistributing the work so that moms aren\u2019t expected to do it all. She recommends that families \u201cpick recipes together. Choose a variety of ingredients, frozen foods, and prepared foods, so that everyone\u2019s expectations remain reasonable.\u201d And she proposes a rule: \u201cLimited negativity, period. Everybody\u2019s in this together, everybody benefits, and that means everybody says \u2018thank you\u2019 and means it.\u201d\n\nThe poet Kima Jones recently conducted her own survey of family food traditions: For an essay at Scratch, she asked 29 poets, \u201cWhat did your mother teach you to always have in the house in case of hunger and no money?\u201d The answers she got ranged from bologna to cassava bread to \u201cSavings. You can always turn that into food.\u201d\n\nMany of the poets she talked to grew up poor, but her survey painted a more optimistic picture than Ms. Bowen\u2019s research. She told Op-Talk that a lot of the stories she heard involved extended families coming together \u2014 the poets \u201ctalked about their grandmothers, their aunts, their uncles. There were always these reservoirs to tap into and this community where, we don\u2019t have a potato, but we have some rice, some string beans, we have some stew meat, and we\u2019re going to make a meal out of this.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever not eating and not eating well, even though we were definitely working poor.\u201d Now she lives far away from her mother, and eating dinner with her \u201cis the thing I miss most.\u201d And when she visits her mother in New York, she never eats out: \u201cAs long as my mother\u2019s on the face of this earth, and as long as she\u2019s making dinner, I\u2019m eating dinner.\u201d\n\nShe noted, though, that dinner for her family didn\u2019t necessarily mean everyone sitting down at a table together: Her siblings all had different after-school activities, and her mother worked, so often \u201cyou just ate when you came in, but the food was always there.\u201d\n\nAnd, to her, eating well doesn\u2019t mean everything has to be perfect. \u201cWith families nowadays,\u201d she said, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of shame\u201d around failing to live up to a high-end, organic standard. But \u201cI don\u2019t think beef has to necessarily be grass-fed for a child to eat it, especially when you\u2019re talking about meat that\u2019s $12.99 or $13.99 a pound.\u201d Instead, she said, \u201cDo the best with what you have.\u201d\n\nShe also offered a way to help families do so: Support school lunch programs, which, she said, many low-income families budget around. \u201cMore needs to be said about providing healthy meals for kids in school and making sure those programs are available to them.\u201d\n\nMs. Bowen, too, calls for broad-based change to help families eat together. If family dinner is important to us, she told Op-Talk, \u201clet\u2019s start talking about what needs to happen \u2014 outside of home kitchens \u2014 in order for people to be able to eat healthy meals.\u201d This might include looking at \u201cwages and schedules for service work (like working in fast food restaurants, which quite a few of the poor families did).\u201d It might also include thinking \u201ccreatively about sharing the work of cooking\u201d \u2014 developing programs around community kitchens, food trucks or co-workers having meals together.\n\nWhatever these changes are, she argued, they can\u2019t stop with telling moms to cook more: \u201cOur research leads us to question why the frontline in reforming the food system has to be in someone\u2019s kitchen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140908144721, "twitter": {"description": "The pressures of dinner are causing stress for poor and middle-class families alike, say a team of sociologists.
