Go. Be gone. Vamoose. Get out of our lives. More important: Stop endangering all of us with your self-indulgent vacations and self-absorbed dithering, along with unconstitutional domestic power plays while the whole world burns.\n\nBarack Obama already is derelict in his duties as commander in chief. He ought to abdicate and just step off his self-made throne.\n\nKnowledgeable people were calling for Obama to begin air strikes against the Islamic State barbarians months before Obama could rouse himself to admit that the brutes were something other than \u201cjayvee\u201d terrorists. Because he didn\u2019t, thousands of innocents died, villages were razed, churches were destroyed, thousands more were left homeless, and vast swaths of territory were lost to purveyors of pure, unadulterated evil.\n\nAnd now, after several years of the Islamic State rising, after half a year of its being obvious that the Islamic State is a new sort of threat, after a couple of months of vicious terror of a sort even this troubled modern world has rarely seen, and after the Islamic State beheaded an American journalist on camera, we have a man pretending to be president who tells the world that the leaders of the globe\u2019s most powerful nation still \u201cdon\u2019t have a strategy yet\u201d for the situation.\n\nWords fail.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia invades the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Barack Obama can\u2019t even bring himself to acknowledge that it\u2019s an invasion, much less do anything effective about it. But we can\u2019t say we weren\u2019t warned that Obama would be so compliant with Putin: It was in March 2012, speaking on an open mic to Russian apparatchik-cum-president Dmitry Medvedev, that Obama promised, \u201cAfter my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d Little did Ukraine know that such \u201cflexibility\u201d would include turning a blind eye to the loss of major parts of its own territory. The West has not even provided military aid to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nKiev might be in Ukraine, but the chicken is in the White House.\n\nEven worse than his failure to help a sovereign nation stand up to a bully is Obama\u2019s betrayal of another ally, one of our most crucial partners on the world stage \u2014 Israel. But that\u2019s what Obama and his pompous secretary of state, John Kerry, have done with relation to Israel, on multiple counts. First Kerry had the gall to threaten Israel with boycotts if his own ill-advised \u201cpeace talks\u201d met with failure, as they were certain to do, given how poorly conceived they were. What Kerry called \u201cpeace\u201d amounted to Israeli abandonment of the Jordan Valley and establishment of an Arab capital in East Jerusalem, though both arrangements would be scandalously dangerous for Israel\u2019s security. Then, while Israel was being bombarded with thousands of Hamas rockets, an Obama-Kerry spokesman had the temerity to label an Israeli response \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and \u201ctotally unacceptable and totally indefensible.\u201d Perhaps Kerry and his morally bankrupt mouthpiece might themselves want to spend time in Ashkelon or Beersheba during a Hamas rocket attack \u2014 maybe in the middle of the night, when sleep makes it difficult to respond to sirens in time to seek adequate shelter.\n\nAs Israel achieves the unprecedented \u2014 and encouraging \u2014 status of a tacit alliance with Egypt, Jordan, other \u201cmoderate\u201d Arab states, and even (to some degree) Saudi Arabia, leave it to the Obamites to demand the intercession of terrorist-supporting Turkey and Qatar. This isn\u2019t misguided; it\u2019s depraved.\n\nIsrael warns that Iran is processing uranium that can be used only for bombs and developing missiles specifically usable for nuclear-bomb delivery, the ayatollahs continue to repeat their assertion that the United States is the Great Satan, and Obama\u2019s response . . . is to relax sanctions on Iran. Amazingly, the administration is even playing footsie with Iran as a possible \u201cally\u201d against the Islamic State in Iraq. This is jaw-droppingly inane, if not insane.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only the security of allies that Obama endangers. His deliberate creation of an ever-more-porous southern border is allowing criminals in by the score, or maybe by the hundreds, alongside, almost assuredly, terrorists as well.\n\nObama, though, keeps whining and dining and vacationing and playing golf, with his weak-looking swing, either oblivious or indifferent to the dangers to which he is subjecting Americans.\n\nEven if one assumes that our supposedly earth-healing president has the best of intentions rather than a mere desire for power and a deep animus against anyone who disagrees with him \u2014 not necessarily a reasonable assumption at this point \u2014 his record is one of astonishing ineptness. Everything he does creates disaster. Obamacare is deeply unpopular as it forces premiums through the roof, raises multiple taxes, severely harms important industries, fails to process claims and enrollments, narrows patient choices, forces consumers from their preferred plans and doctors, and adds hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt.\n\nThe economy continues on its path of the slowest \u201crecovery\u201d since World War II, Obama\u2019s \u201cstimulus\u201d never having stimulated a thing (other than more debt) \u2014 largely because, as Obama admitted, in a joking tone, \u201cshovel-ready wasn\u2019t as shovel-ready as we expected.\u201d\n\nObama promised a politics of reconciliation but has produced only more division. He promised transparency, only to run an administration of such deliberate secrecy that even a lapdog media feels compelled to lodge a formal protest. He promised racial harmony, only to join a corrupt attorney general in exacerbating racial tensions again and again. He promised to elevate political discourse but instead ran one of the most vicious reelection campaigns in memory, while repeatedly, throughout his presidency, attacking the patriotism and basic decency of his adversaries.\n\nFood-stamp use is way up; the percentage of the work force currently employed remains at or near record lows. Energy costs, especially for gasoline, have skyrocketed since his first inauguration. Disaster relief has been bungled (or worse). And, of course, religious freedoms are constantly under assault, while political enemies are harassed and discriminated against by a corrupt IRS.\n\nScandals abound: Fast and Furious; the New Black Panthers, Benghazi; the NSA\u2019s domestic spying; the IRS; mistreated inspectors general; race-based \u201cjustice.\u201d Cover-ups aplenty; contempt of court; judicial smackdowns galore: The list goes on.\n\nBut all Obama can do, when he is not greatly exacerbating whatever problem he chooses to create, is retreat further into his princeling world, hobnobbing with the rich and famous, shifting blame to everyone else, and acting as if somehow he wafts above the ordinary world of politics that in truth he has done so much to pollute.\n\nRather than leading from behind \u2014 an absurdity \u2014 he should leave behind the office that seems alternately to annoy and bore him.
