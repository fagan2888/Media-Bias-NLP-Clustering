Freedom, Ind. -- Andrew McNeil of Freedom, Ind. has announced that he will be running against Rep. Larry Bucshon in the 2014 Republican primary.

"Today I stand before you in the spirit of 1776," said McNeil. "Now is not the time for timidity. It is not the time to cower in fear. Today we must lead. We must stand and fight with dependence upon the same God who saw us through 237 years ago, albeit with humility."

McNeil will focus his campaign on listening to the voice of the people of the 8th district and representing their concerns as opposed to the interests of the political structure in Washington. He will also highlight the responsibility of leaving a prosperous and free nation for future generations.

Issues that McNeil has placed at the top of his priorities include repealing Obamacare, fiscal responsibility, returning America to Constitutional government, and reviving a stagnant economy.

"Obamacare is an unprecedented betrayal of all that we are as a nation," said McNeil, "from its violation of our religious freedoms to its unconstitutional control over every area of our lives. This fight should have been fought a long time ago, but now that we are engaged, it must be seen through until there is a clear victory."
