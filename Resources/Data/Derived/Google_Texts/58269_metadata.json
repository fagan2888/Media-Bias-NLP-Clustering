Describing HIV as \u201ca virus that has touched lives,\u201d he announced that he was ending a ban based on \u201cfear rather than fact.\u201d\n\nObama didn\u2019t specify what new facts about AIDS had been discovered that made it no longer infectious or a threat to public health. Instead he just had the CDC remove HIV from the list of \u201ccommunicable diseases of public health significance.\u201d Was HIV no longer of \u201cpublic health significance\u201d? The amount of money being lavished on it indicated otherwise. Was it then suddenly no longer communicable?\n\nThe CDC awkwardly tried to explain why syphilis, gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted diseases were still on the list, but HIV wasn\u2019t. The answer could be summed as \u201cbecause Obama said so.\u201d The CDC did promise to \u201cconsider other diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases, for scientific review.\u201d But most STDs don\u2019t have their own billion-dollar lobby that can make or break politicians.\n\nIn a cage match between public health and politically correct cash, the winner was AIDS. And so the ban was lifted and immigrants no longer had to be tested for HIV.\n\nBut Obama was not a one-disease politician. He was also open to being touched by other viruses. The same year that his CDC decided that AIDS was no longer a communicable disease, Bush era quarantine regs were also scrapped. The regs had been part of an Avian Flu response that Senator Obama had demanded when he was cynically maneuvering for political advantage. But that was then. This is now.\n\nIn a bid for amnesty, Obama opened the southern border and flooded America with dangerous diseases.\n\nThe commitment to open borders had clear viral consequences. Border agents have already come down with antibiotic resistant infections carried by illegal aliens and in some cases passed these diseases on to their children. Also along for the ride was Swine Flu, a potentially fatal and communicable disease.\n\nObama had declared Swine Flu a \u201cnational emergency\u201d around the same time that he was putting out the welcome mat for AIDS. But in his push for amnesty, he also welcomed Swine Flu into the country.\n\nAnd that was just the beginning.\n\nAn Enterovirus D68 outbreak, that has now claimed the life of an American child, followed. The death took place in New Jersey, which has one of the highest rates of unaccompanied alien minor placements and possibly the highest rate when accounting for territorial size. Some D68 cases appeared to be linked to a mysterious condition in Colorado causing paralysis and spinal cord abnormalities in children.\n\nAs horrifying as these public health crises caused by Obama\u2019s open borders policy are, the real nightmare may still be coming.\n\nEven though Ebola doesn\u2019t have its own lobby yet, it\u2019s getting the AIDS treatment. The White House has been firm about rejecting any Ebola travel ban. Instead arriving visitors from Ebolaland are getting flyers at airports telling them to report any symptoms to their doctor. The CDC is claiming that the source screenings, which can be fooled by an Ebola carrier taking Advil, are good enough.\n\nAnd if not, well, the Democratic Party\u2019s voters have to come from somewhere. Who cares if they happen to be vomiting up blood while they\u2019re casting their vote?\n\nIf AIDS can magically stop being a \u201ccommunicable disease of public health significance,\u201d why not Ebola? Why not any and every epidemic that might potentially keep a future Democrat out of Chicago?\n\nAs with AIDS, Obama is taking the line that Ebola has to be stopped at its source in Africa and that keeping the infected out of America will somehow interfere with this mission. It\u2019s the sort of reasoning that makes a lot of sense to someone who views borders and nations as outdated relics. It doesn\u2019t, however, make much sense to most Americans who still think there is such a thing as the United States.\n\nThe media, which can stir up a mass panic over a fly in a restaurant, is warning of \u201cEbola-phobia\u201d and assuring the country that there\u2019s no reason to fear an outbreak. Ebola isn\u2019t really all that contagious, say all the same media outlets which have been claiming that AIDS and leprosy aren\u2019t all that contagious. But then again no disease carried by Democratic Party voters can be considered truly contagious.\n\nExcept maybe leftism.\n\nNow that we know that we don\u2019t have to worry, it\u2019s only a question of which outbreak we don\u2019t have to worry about first.\n\nDue to Obama\u2019s policies, we have so many contagious and deadly diseases waiting in line to infect Americans that it\u2019s not clear which outbreak we should be worrying about the least. Should we be getting unready for an Ebola outbreak, a Swine Flu outbreak or an Enterovirus B68 outbreak?\n\nBut that\u2019s what happens when the border security of a nation vanishes into thin air.\n\nISIS fighters who returned to the United States were allowed in. Illegal aliens with every possible disease were allowed in. Any other course of action would be Islamophobia and Ebolaphobia.\n\nObamaCare has a menu of exotic disease outbreaks to cope with. Even as Ebola enriches our airports, Virginia has become \u201cGround Zero\u201d for Chagas disease which kills 11,000 people a year, a mysterious paralyzing virus is spreading across Colorado and the border patrol even caught a case of leprosy.\n\nWhere does one go to find leprosy in the age of Obama? New York City. While the United States is overwhelmed with foreign leprosy cases, it is now possible to be born in New York City and live your entire life there and still come down with leprosy because it\u2019s become an endemic disease. Leprosy cases really took off after Ted Kennedy\u2019s Immigration and Nationality Act did to public health what he had done to Mary Jo Kopechne. The top source countries for the disease are Mexico, Vietnam and Cuba.\n\nSo much for socialized medicine.\n\nOpen borders means a constantly shifting menu of diseases and terrorist threats that never go away because the door is open. It\u2019s as open to an Ebola patient as it is to an ISIS Jihadist. AIDS is as welcome as the next Anwar Al-Awlaki. They are all part of the great multicultural future of the Democratic Party in which Islamic terrorists and Third World diseases battle it out for the opportunity to destroy America.\n\nIf an Ebola outbreak does happen, this disastrous administration and its leader may go down in history as President Ebola. But even if it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s always President Swine Flu or President B68.\n\nAnd there are always the classics. Three years after Obama took down the HIV travel ban, foreign-born Latinos AIDS cases in New York had risen to 31%. There\u2019s a lot of talk about the importance of spreading awareness of the disease, but we could start by spreading awareness of the fact that allowing people with infectious diseases into the United States has deadly consequences.\n\n*\n\nDon't miss Shillman Journalism Fellow Daniel Greenfield on The Glazov Gang discussing \"ISIS Rising\":\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nSubscribe to Frontpage's TV show, The Glazov Gang, and LIKE it on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Why open borders are the real disease.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Why open borders are the real disease.", "title": "President Ebola", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/242427/president-ebola-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:37:29-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/242427/president-ebola-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Why open borders are the real disease.", "card": "summary", "title": "President Ebola"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-05T20:50:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:37:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcae2\"", "article_summary": "If an Ebola outbreak does happen, this disastrous administration and its leader may go down in history as President Ebola.\nShould we be getting unready for an Ebola outbreak, a Swine Flu outbreak or an Enterovirus B68 outbreak?\nBut even if it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s always President Swine Flu or President B68.\nIf AIDS can magically stop being a \u201ccommunicable disease of public health significance,\u201d why not Ebola?\nInstead he just had the CDC remove HIV from the list of \u201ccommunicable diseases of public health significance.\u201d Was HIV no longer of \u201cpublic health significance\u201d?"}
