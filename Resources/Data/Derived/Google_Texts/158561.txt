Maya Angelou Chester Higgins Jr.

Maya Angelou got the last word at her own memorial service earlier this month in New York, thanks to a new musical version of her poem “Still I Rise” that played at the end. The track, from an upcoming album featuring her poetry set to music, gets a wider hearing today in a Speakeasy exclusive.

“We really felt like it was fitting,” says Colin A. Johnson, Angelou’s grandson and co-founder of the new family enterprise Caged Bird Legacy. “‘Still I Rise’ was a really central piece for her.” Angelou, an acclaimed poet, actress, dancer and singer, died in May. She was 86.

Angelou “loved the concept,” Johnson says, and recorded new readings of some of the works on the album, including “Still I Rise.” Angelou first published the poem in her 1978 collection “And Still I Rise.” Her matter-of-fact voice carries the track, which features a simple, stomping beat, a rich chorus of backing vocals and a lean blues riff. The piece is the last of 13 songs on “Caged Bird Songs,” produced by Shawn Rivera and RoccStarr, who has worked on music by Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Hudson and Cee Lo Green.

Angelou had released previous albums: her lengthy list of career awards includes three Grammys for various spoken-word projects, and she began her career as a nightclub singer in the 1950s, releasing the LP “Miss Calypso” in 1957. Decades later, Angelou also collaborated with Ashford & Simpson on their 1996 album “Been Found.” Johnson hopes that pairing Angelou’s words and voice with more hip-hop-centric music will keep her work alive for a new, younger audience.

“This transcends some generational gaps,” Johnson says. “My grandma was 86. How do you reach someone who’s my daughter’s age, 16? Music is one of the best ways to do that.”

“Caged Bird Songs” is due Nov. 4 on Smooch Music. What do you think of “Still I Rise?” Leave your thoughts in the comments.
