Dodgers games on KCAL, U.S. Open tennis on CBS, and hit shows like Under the Dome. Photo by Susan E. Adams via Flickr Creative Commons\n\nIt\u2019s been about a month since CBS, KCAL and Showtime have been blacked out for more than 1 million Time Warner Cable customers in Los Angeles.\n\nSubscribers have missed L.A. Dodgers games on KCAL, U.S. Open tennis on CBS and hit shows such as \"Under the Dome.\"\n\nAnd the total refund will be: $0.00.\n\n\u201cCBS is carried as part of a programming package,\u201d said Bret Picciolo, a Time Warner spokesman. \u201cWe don\u2019t make it policy to credit customers for any individual channel change to that package because, as a whole, that package continues to carry a value.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s better news for Showtime customers. They\u2019ll be getting a credit for whatever they would normally pay for the channel, usually about $15 a month.\n\nIf all this tempts you to leave Time Warner, its argument is essentially: \u201cYeah, this is bad, but it\u2019s going to be just as bad with the other guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and large our customers understand that switching isn\u2019t the answer, because sooner or later all are other providers are going to face the same situation,\u201d said Picciolo.\n\nBut that\u2019s not good enough for Todd O\u2019Boyle, a consumer advocate at the Washington-based Common Cause. He says Congress and the FCC should step-in and help resolve the dispute.\n\n\u201cThey could really inconvenience the parties involved and add some urgency to the issue,\u201d said O\u2019Boyle. \u201cWithout clear direction from Washington, we\u2019ll just see more of these blackout fights in the future.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Boyle says both CBS and Time Warner are at fault, but he says CBS blocking access to its website is particularly egregious, and violates net neutrality rules.\n\nThe FCC says it\u2019s working at the highest levels to resolve the dispute.\n\nBut a more powerful force may be the NFL. The closer it gets to the regular season opener, the less leverage Time Warner has.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "It\u2019s been about a month since CBS, KCAL and Showtime have been blacked out for more than 1 million Time Warner Cable customers in Los Angeles.", "title": "A refund for Time Warner CBS blackout in LA?
