It is an arrogance suffused with a self-aggrandizing worldview that begins and ends with the simplest premise: You either agree with us, or you\u2019re wrong. But not just wrong in the sense of having a different opinion. Wrong in the sense that you\u2019re a knuckle-dragging Neanderthal at best, or the embodiment of evil itself at worst. In other words, you\u2019re either on board with us, or you\u2019re completely illegitimate.\n\nThe above explanation fits Hillary Clinton to a tee. At the sixth annual Women in the World Summit, Clinton brought up one of the Left\u2019s most cherished planks, abortion on demand. \u201cFar too many women are denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth,\u201d she insisted, \u201cand laws don\u2019t count for much if they\u2019re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper.\u201d\n\nOne is left to wonder what denial of access Clinton bemoans. It can\u2019t be Planned Parenthood (PP), an organization whose name completely belies its true function. As its 2013-2014 Annual Report reveals, PP received more than $528 million in taxpayer funds in the form of government grants, contracts and Medicaid reimbursements that accounted for 41% of its total resources. And despite its ostensible non-profit status, the abortion giant has $127 million in excess revenue and more than $1.4 billion in net assets.\n\nWhere does the money go? According to a fact sheet disseminated by the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, PP devoted 94% of 2013 \u201cpregnancy services\u201d to performing abortions. Prenatal care and adoption services accounted for 5% and 0.05% of its activities, respectively. Moreover, between the years 2011-2013 for which figures are available, PP performed 988,783 abortions.\n\nPP chair Alexis McGill Johnson and president Cecile Richards couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since Margaret Sanger was jailed in 1916 for opening America\u2019s very first birth control clinic,\u201d they explained at the report\u2019s release. \u201cToday, 99 percent of sexually active American women at some point in their lives use birth control \u2014 and, thanks to Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act, more than 48 million women are now eligible to receive it with no copay.\u201d\n\nSounds like a boatload of access, at least to \u201creproductive\u201d health care. Safe childbirth? Not so much, a reality that deeply troubles people of faith \u2014 a group with this \u201ccrazy\u201d notion that abortion constitutes the wrongful termination of a human life.\n\nNot to worry, though. Hillary has a \u201csolution\u201d for their concerns. \u201cLaws have to be backed up with resources and political will,\u201d she declared. \u201cAnd deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed. As I have said and as I believe, the advancement of the full participation of women and girls in every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the 21st century and not just for women but for everyone \u2014 and not just in far away countries but right here in the United States.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds like people of faith must either abandon that faith or be considered wholly illegitimate, or \u201cstructurally biased\u201d as it were, it\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what Clinton proposes. In short, you\u2019re either pro-abortion or a \u201cbitter clinger.\u201d That euphemism entered the national zeitgeist courtesy of Barack Obama, whose administration has made it clear that the only thing standing between it and the evisceration of the First Amendment\u2019s Freedom of Religion clause is a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in the Hobby Lobby v. Burwell case. The Court decided corporations with sincerely held religious beliefs are under no obligation to provide a full range of contraceptives \u2014 including abortifacients \u2014 at no cost to their employees as mandated by ObamaCare.\n\nYet abortion is only one arena where people of faith are being steamrolled. As Solicitor General Donald Verrilli made clear during oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the subject of same-sex marriage, the heavy hand of government will be imposed on those who refuse to embrace progressive \u201cvalues.\u201d When asked by Justice Samuel Alito if the Obama administration would be willing to impose penalties on institutions that refuse to abide same-sex marriage, Verrilli admitted as much. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be an issue,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI don\u2019t deny that.\u201d\n\nFamily Research Council\u2019s Tony Perkins spells out the inevitable, writing, \u201cTranslation: If churches, religious groups, schools, or nonprofits won\u2019t surrender their beliefs on marriage, the government will make it hurt.\u201d And regardless of what the Court decides, Justice Anthony Kennedy illuminated the stakes with a simple remark, noting the definition of marriage as between a man and a women \u201chas been with us for millennia.\u201d Therefore, he said, \u201c[I]t\u2019s very difficult for the Court to say, \u2018Oh well, we know better.\u2019\u201d\n\nProgressives have no such inhibitions. And that would be fine were it not for the reality that they are determined to forcibly impose their worldview by any means necessary on those who disagree.\n\nHow arrogant is Clinton in that regard? As recently as 2013 she opposed same-sex marriage, and in 2004 she called traditional marriage a \u201cfundamental bedrock principle.\u201d How hypocritical? \u201cI am sick and tired of people who say that if you debate and you disagree with this administration somehow you\u2019re not patriotic,\u201d she huffed in 2003.\n\nNot patriotic? Now if you disagree with the leftist onslaught, you\u2019re a homophobic, religiously impaired bigot who must abandon millennia of traditional beliefs \u2014 or be deliberately targeted if you don\u2019t.\n\nLive and let live? A concept for which those who profess to be the most tolerant among us have zero tolerance. \u201cEvolving\u201d on issues as Clinton and Obama have on same-sex marriage? Embrace progressive ideology right now or be penalized in every way possible.\n\nA number of Christian leaders are fighting back with a pledge defending traditional marriage. One of their reasons for doing so stands out. \u201cFamily is the first vital cell of society, the first government, and the first mediating institution of our social order,\u201d the pledge states. \u201cThe future of a free and healthy society passes through marriage and the family.\u201d Anyone else think this is a message that might resonate in Baltimore right about now?\n\nOne last thought regarding abortion: Perhaps the debate on the issue might be imbued with far more honesty if the phrase \u201ca woman\u2019s right to choose\u201d included the first choice, as in the decision to have unprotected and/or irresponsible sex leading to an unwanted pregnancy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You're either on board with the Left, or you're completely illegitimate.", "csrf-token": "206UwT6Dyfdg3jgPEuQl58PL89iqFXAqJsCX0Y3YKng=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "You\u2019re either on board with the Left, or you\u2019re completely illegitimate.", "title": "Clinton: Religion Must Surrender to Progressive Ideology", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/34968", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-05-04-c037aac5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd221e\"", "article_summary": "Culture, Science & Faith Clinton: Religion Must Surrender to Progressive IdeologyThere is little question the American Left is arrogant.\nAs recently as 2013 she opposed same-sex marriage, and in 2004 she called traditional marriage a \u201cfundamental bedrock principle.\u201d How hypocritical?\n\u201cEvolving\u201d on issues as Clinton and Obama have on same-sex marriage?\nAt the sixth annual Women in the World Summit, Clinton brought up one of the Left\u2019s most cherished planks, abortion on demand.\nRights have to exist in practice, not just on paper.\u201dOne is left to wonder what denial of access Clinton bemoans."}
