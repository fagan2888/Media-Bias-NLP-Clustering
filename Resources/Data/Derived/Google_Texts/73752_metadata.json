Ubl said. \u201cAs a result of the medical device tax, we have seen an unprecedented impact on jobs and key investments in R&D. The findings of the report underscore the need to repeal this tax.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican and frequent critic of Obamacare, said the report \u201creconfirms what we\u2019ve already known about the tax.\u201d\n\nThe medical device tax is one of several taxes built into the Affordable Care Act to help pay for the reforms. But it has been attacked by both sides of the political aisle as a job killer that harms a growing business sector.\n\nSenate Democrats, from states like Minnesota and Indiana, have been particularly vocal about their opposition, due to the large number of affected manufacturers in their states. The chamber voted 79-20 in March to repeal the tax, but it was part of budget talks and did not have the force of law.\n\nCongress has not found the roughly $30 billion dollars needed to repeal the tax over the next 10 years. Lawmakers came close to scrapping the tax during the debate over federal spending and debt reduction in October, but those talks ultimately stalled.\n\nTrade groups say they are just as passionate about eliminating the tax as they were last year, but critics of the repeal crowd say the outcry is much ado about nothing.\n\n\u201cNot only can the medical-device industry easily afford the tax without compromising innovation, but the industry\u2019s enormous profits are a result of anticompetitive practices that themselves drive up medical-device costs unnecessarily,\u201d the New York Times editorial board said in October.\n\nRyan Ellis, director of tax policy for the Americans for Tax Reform, said in an interview last month that opponents of the tax seem to think they can repeal it by pressuring Senate Democrats alone. But even if enough Democrats join every Republican lawmaker in voting to repeal the tax, he said a broader strategy may be needed to get the measure to the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cThis is a fairly regional issue,\u201d Mr. Ellis said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new survey says Obamacare's tax on medical device manufacturers forced companies to lay off or avoid hiring 33,000 workers last year \u2014 adding another arrow to the GOP's quiver as Republicans aim to portray the health care law as a job-killing program.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A new survey says Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical device manufacturers forced companies to lay off or avoid hiring 33,000 workers last year \u2014 adding another arrow to the GOP\u2019s quiver as Republicans aim to portray the health care law as a job-killing program.", "title": "Obamacare medical device tax led to loss of 33,000 jobs, report says", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/23/obamacare-medical-device-tax-led-to-loss-of-33000-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/27/df02cfd7d1ef25034a0f6a7067000d85.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/27/df02cfd7d1ef25034a0f6a7067000d85.jpg", "title": "Obamacare medical device tax led to loss of 33,000 jobs, report says", "description": "A new survey says Obamacare's tax on medical device manufacturers forced companies to lay off or avoid hiring 33,000 workers last year \u2014 adding another arrow to the GOP's quiver as Republicans aim to", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Labor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf42f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs a result of the medical device tax, we have seen an unprecedented impact on jobs and key investments in R&D.\nThe AdvaMed report said companies cut about 14,000 workers and decided not to hire about 19,000 workers because of the tax, which took effect in 2013.\nCongress has not found the roughly $30 billion dollars needed to repeal the tax over the next 10 years.\nA new survey says Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical device manufacturers forced companies to lay off or avoid hiring 33,000 workers last year \u2014 adding another arrow to the GOP\u2019s quiver as Republicans aim to portray the health care law as a job-killing program.\nThe chamber voted 79-20 in March to repeal the tax, but it was part of budget talks and did not have the force of law."}
