No one has ever suggested that to me, I love that, wow,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe may have a few other things to do, but I tell you that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nThis hypothetical raises three questions: Would putting Obama on the Court be a good thing for President Clinton to do, would his nomination be approved by the Senate, and would he take the job?\n\nAs to the first question, the answer is clearly \u201cmaybe.\u201d Obama has what have come to be thought of as typical qualifications for being on the Court \u2013 he was the head of the Harvard Law Review, he taught constitutional law at an elite university \u2013 but he also has something else: significant experience as an elected official.\n\nIt used to be considered a major plus for Supreme Court nominees to have personal experience in electoral politics. For example, Earl Warren, considered by many to be the greatest justice of the 20th century, was governor of California before joining the Court. And there\u2019s even a precedent for the appointment a former president: William Howard Taft was Chief Justice during the 1920s.\n\nIn recent decades, the practice of appointing former politicians to the Court has lapsed: the last justice with any experience in elected office was Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who joined the Court 35 years ago. Nominating Obama would be a good way of moving back toward the healthy custom of having at least one justice on the Court who has seen the political world from the inside.\n\nBut putting Obama on the Court has downsides for progressives as well. Justice Obama wouldn\u2019t be able to campaign for candidates; he couldn\u2019t play the role of an ambassador for the Democrats; he wouldn\u2019t, in short, be able to do all sorts of things that ex-presidents can do to help the political causes they support.\n\nFurthermore, he would have to recuse himself \u2013 not vote \u2013 in cases involving decisions he had taken while president. (Consider the irony of Obama not being able to provide the deciding vote to keep the Affordable Care Act from being gutted by yet another lawsuit attacking it, because he had signed the original legislation).", "article_metadata": {"description": "He'd be underpaid, bored, and have to recuse himself on Obamacare cases.
