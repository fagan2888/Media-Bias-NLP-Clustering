"We're actually filming season two, episode seven now, so right now we're in it -- I know what's going on. I just wanna tell you,” Yazz teased, before continuing: "I can just tell you this. The storyline is going to increase, the drama is going to get more impactful, the music is gonna get better and better. You're just gonna see brothers fight for success."

"Our writers trust in us, and they trust that we're gonna take what they give us and we're gonna make it a great creation, you know. So, we know … we're just not gonna tell you," he said with a laugh.

Yazz went on to talk about the evolution of his character Hakeem’s music.

"This season, you can expect from Hakeem just to have music that's gonna evolve better than last season. You're gonna see him grow,” he said. “The music gets better. We have Ne-Yo working, we have Swizz Beatz working with us, so it's great. It's a very dynamic team we have right now.

“So what you can expect from Yazz … you never know,” he added. “I could drop a single here, I could drop a single there. Just stay tuned. Really. Anything with Yazz is a secret. It's unpredictable."
