In fact, the price tag of \u201cfree\u201d single-payer health insurance for all would cost the country $15 trillion over the course of 10 years, according to a study conducted by Gerald Friedman, Ph.D. Bernie has said this statement is \u201cexaggerated,\u201d but still he believes it will save this country money in the long run. Granted, there are reasons why the US spends so much more on healthcare than the rest of the world, but the primary one is because of the growth of administrative staff in our medical field. But, before you swipe left at the voter booth come election day, there\u2019s something you should know about who\u2019s paying for this $15 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBernie\u2019s plan claims he\u2019s going to eliminate that awful corporate bureaucracy and save your family a bundle on health insurance. If you evenly divide healthcare costs of the $1.5 trillion over 320 million Americans, you get something like $4,600 a person ($1,500,000,000,000/320,000,000). Wow, what a deal! Quality health insurance for only $4,600 a year? How could you be against that?\n\n\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is that it completely ignores our progressive tax code. If our country had a flat tax, like Rand Paul wants, the math would actually come out the way described previously. Instead, we have a system that demands you pay more as you make more.\n\nAccording to the CBO, the top 20% of Americans, meaning anyone who makes over $100k a year, pay about 84% of this country\u2019s taxes. That means, under our current system, 84% of that $1.5 trillion a year would be placed on those greedy top 20%\u2019ers. That\u2019s approximately $1.2 trillion dollars.\n\nHow many Americans are in that top 20%? About 64 million Americans, actually (320,000,000 X 0.2). Dividing that $1.2 trillion a year among these 64 million elitist scumbags gives us with an average of $18,750 a year (1,200,000,000,000/ 64,000,000). That means if you or your family makes over $100k a year, your taxes will go up from the average American family\u2019s healthcare bill of roughly $402 a month, to $1,500 a month ($1,8750/12). Serves you right for being successful.\n\nThe important thing to remember is, that this is calculated using the progressive tax model leftists love so much. It\u2019s most conceivable that this is the way Bernie would divie up his bill. And that\u2019s just the single payer. How much is he going to charge you for free public education? Free childcare? Family medical leave? You begin to see how eventually, these costs would destroy this country\u2019s great upper middle class under the current progressive tax model.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just going to hit people like doctors and lawyers, either. The math used in the previous paragraphs took into account couples and families with a combined income of over $100k a year. That\u2019s a lot of families. Two teachers, for example, both making $50k a year, would be hit by this in the ways described. How much more are you willing to let your family be robbed by the government before you realize this man is a con artist? Don\u2019t be fooled. If you \u201cFeel the Bern,\u201dgo to a doctor and get an icepack while you still can. It\u2019ll be cheaper now than Bernie\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d healthcare plan.\n\nFollow Chris on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "If your family makes over 100k a year, prepare for some VERY bad news...", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "If your family makes over 100k a year, prepare for some VERY bad news...", "title": "What Universal Healthcare Could Cost Your Family", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HealthCareCartoon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-08T14:43:26+00:00", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/what-universal-healthcare-could-cost-your-family/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If your family makes over 100k a year, prepare for some VERY bad news...", "creator": "@ChrisJohncox", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HealthCareCartoon.jpg", "title": "What Universal Healthcare Could Cost Your Family", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "published_time": "2015-12-08T10:17:01+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ChrisJohncoxTheWriter?ref=tn_tnmn", "section": "Gov't Incompetence", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T14:43:26+00:00", "tag": "Universal Healthcare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "What Universal Healthcare Could Cost Your FamilyIf Your Family Makes Over $100k a Year, You Should Be VERY Worried About BernieBy Chris JohncoxThe universal, single payer healthcare for all plan proposed by socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t cheap.\nIf you evenly divide healthcare costs of the $1.5 trillion over 320 million Americans, you get something like $4,600 a person ($1,500,000,000,000/320,000,000).\nIt\u2019ll be cheaper now than Bernie\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d healthcare plan.\nThat means, under our current system, 84% of that $1.5 trillion a year would be placed on those greedy top 20%\u2019ers.\nThe important thing to remember is, that this is calculated using the progressive tax model leftists love so much."}
