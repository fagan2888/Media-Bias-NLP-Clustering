The Giffords have now decided against challenging that ruling.\n\nThat decision upheld an earlier ruling handed down by the New York Division of Human Rights in 2014, where an administrative law judge for the state fined the Giffords $10,000 and ordered them to pay the couple, Melisa Erwin and Jennifer McCarthy, $1,500 each. The judge, Magdalia Pares, also ordered the Giffords to implement \u201canti-discrimination training and procedures.\u201d\n\nMelisa Erwin and Jennifer McCarthy have since married at a different location.\n\nCynthia and Robert Gifford are the owners of Liberty Ridge Farm in Schaghticoke, N.Y., about 30 miles north of Albany. They live full-time at the farm and occasionally open their home for public events like fall festivals and private weddings and receptions.\n\n\n\nTheir legal battle has been ongoing since 2012, when, citing her Christian beliefs about marriage, Cynthia Gifford told Melisa Erwin and Jennifer McCarthy that they couldn\u2019t host their wedding at Liberty Ridge Farm.\n\nAt the time of the refusal, Cynthia Gifford did not know that the phone call was being recorded.\n\nTrainor said the Giffords faced a difficult legal climate in New York\u2014a state that he believes is \u201cwed\u201d to its Human Rights Law.\n\n\u201cNew York is pretty wedded to its Human Rights Law and finding discrimination where they can, so that probably makes it more difficult of a climb here in New York than some places elsewhere,\u201d Trainor said, adding:\n\n[B]ut I think it\u2019s a difficult climb throughout the country right now, particularly in light of recent rulings in New Mexico and Colorado\u2014the photographer case and the baker case.\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court of New Mexico ruled that a Christian photographer does not have the right to decline to take pictures of a same-sex commitment ceremony because of her religious beliefs. More recently, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that Masterpiece Cakeshop must bake cakes for a same-sex wedding, despite the baker\u2019s Christian view on marriage. In Oct. 2015, the baker, Jack Phillips, and his attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom asked the Colorado Supreme Court to review that decision.\n\nTrainor said the Giffords are now in the process of figuring out how they can operate their business in accordance to the law and their religious convictions and said that it\u2019s likely the couple will have to rework some of its business practices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Trainor said.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Melisa Erwin and Jennifer McCarthy in the lawsuit, for comment.\n\nTrainor added that although they chose against pursuing their case, the Giffords \u201chaven\u2019t changed their mind in this whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is still very near and dear to their heart, and they still feel very strongly about their religious convictions and their right to be able to exercise their religious liberties through their work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that the climate is such that our state and the federal government don\u2019t allow us to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "liberty ridge farm, giffords, new york farmers, same sex marraige, lgbt, religious liberty, religious freedom, alliance defending freedom", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Cynthia and Robert Gifford, the owners of a small farm in upstate New York who were ordered to pay $13,000 for refusing to host a...
