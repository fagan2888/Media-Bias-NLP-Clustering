BALTIMORE — Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco will miss the remainder of the season after tearing ligaments in his knee.

The injury occurred late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s 16-13 win over the St. Louis Rams. Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Flacco “tore at his ACL and I think, his MCL as well,” but did not disclose which knee.

Flacco has never missed a game since starting the season opener in 2008. His run of 122 straight starts will end next week.

He played the final series Sunday despite being injured and moved the offense to set up the winning field goal by Justin Tucker. Flacco went 27 for 44 for 299 yards.

The Ravens also lost running back Justin Forsett, who broke his right arm.
