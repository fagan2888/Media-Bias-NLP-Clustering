Later, the Republican House Speaker clarified the lawsuit, saying he would sue the president for delaying the employer mandate required by the new health insurance law, the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit will take Obama to task for his alleged failure to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d of the United States, Boehner said.\n\nBoehner\u2019s lawsuit idea was widely ridiculed, including by Obama himself, who waved off the proposed Boehner lawsuit as a \u201cstunt.\u201d Even conservative legal scholars, most of them no friends of Obama, derided the lawsuit.\n\nBut now, Boehner may have suffered the unkindest cut of all, when a friend of the Ohio rep who says he has known the 64-year-old Republican leader for 50 years, ripped him in his own hometown newspaper, The Cincinnati Enquirer.\n\n\u201cWhat The Hell, Pal?\u201d ran the headline over an \u201copen letter\u201d to John Boehner from Jerry Mouch, that ran in the Enquirer earlier this week.\n\n\u201cJohn, I consider you a friend of mine. We\u2019ve known one another for well over 50 years. Our parents knew \u201ceach other, were friends and neighbors in Reading. Our family businesses were directly across the street from each other for over 70 years,\u201d Mouch wrote. \u201cBut John, what the hell are you doing?\u201d\n\nThe letter from Mouch came in response to an op-ed in the same newspaper under Boehner\u2019s byline, in which Boehner attempted to explain the reasons behind the lawsuit, saying that Obama has been \u201ctrampling the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is no joke, Mr. President,\u201d Boehner wrote. \u201cThe American people are frustrated.\u201d\n\nMouch wrote in response:\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018the majority of Americans are frustrated.\u2019 I agree, but not with this president. They\u2019re frustrated with the childishness of those purporting to serve all the American people. \u201cThe majority of Republicans are frustrated. Sure, I get that. But everything shouldn\u2019t come to a halt because you don\u2019t control the White House. By the way, you better get used to that too. You won\u2019t get that back by appealing to Old White Guys.\u201d\n\nMouch also scolded Boehner for wasting time with the lawsuit. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing more pressing to do than sue a president who was elected twice by the majority of voting Americans?\u201d he asked.\n\nBut Mouch concluded his letter on a friendly note.\n\n\u201cNow, how about a round of golf at Sharon Woods on Sunday? On me. I\u2019ll need 2 a side.\n\n\u201cYour pal, Mooch\u201d\n\nA recent poll showed that 51 percent of Americans consider the John Boehner lawsuit illegitimate, and 57 percent say the lawsuit is just a waste.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, says he will bring a lawsuit against President Obama.
