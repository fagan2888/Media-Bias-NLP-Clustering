After all, it was difficult to imagine why else the Republican congressman \u2013 who\u2019s no doubt aware of the 2016 chatter surrounding his name \u2013 would deliberately cause such a splash.\n\nSuch speculation, the Speaker and his team argue, gets it all wrong. The New York Times reported yesterday that Ryan is eagerly crafting his own policy agenda and national platform, not in anticipation of a 2016 presidential campaign, but rather to create \u201ca personality and policy alternative to run alongside\u201d the Republicans\u2019 presidential ticket \u2013 especially given the likelihood that the GOP will nominate an unpopular candidate who\u2019s likely to lose.\n\n\u201cThese moves could prove useful to rank-and-file Republicans seeking a life raft in Trumpian seas,\u201d the Times added.\n\nIt\u2019s still an open question whether this explanation is sincere, but the same Times piece also highlighted just how far Paul Ryan is prepared to go while creating this GOP life raft.\n\n[E]ven if [Ted Cruz] prevails, Mr. Ryan may still offer a supplemental set of talking points for the rest of his party to follow. For example, if the Republican nominee does not provide an alternative to the Affordable Care Act \u2013 something Republicans have failed to do since it passed in 2010 \u2013 Mr. Ryan intends to do so, just as he will lay out an anti-poverty plan.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe parallels with Lucy telling Charlie Brown that this time he really will kick the football should be obvious.\n\nHouse Republicans have been in the majority for nearly six years, and in that time, Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders have said repeatedly that they\u2019ll definitely get around to creating a policy agenda one of these days. Many of those same Republicans have been vowing to come up with an \u201cObamacare\u201d alternative for seven years.\n\nNow, however, the far-right House Speaker \u201cintends\u201d to follow through. It\u2019s probably fair to say Ryan\u2019s intentions are irrelevant.\n\nWe\u2019ve been down this road many, many times . Paul Ryan was going to unveil his ACA alternative in 2014 . That didn\u2019t happen. Then he was going to finally produce a reform bill in 2015 . That didn\u2019t happen, either.\n\nEvery time House Republicans assure the public their amazing new health care package is on the way, they end up unveiling nothing . That has been ongoing since June 2009\n\nIf I had to guess, the problem isn\u2019t necessarily dishonesty. In all likelihood, GOP lawmakers would love to have a health care plan of their own \u2013 no one likes to appear ridiculous while breaking promises \u2013 but haven\u2019t because they don\u2019t know how to craft one.\n\nAs New York\u2019s Jon Chait explained yesterday, \u201cThe reason the dog keeps eating the Republicans\u2019 health-care homework is very simple: It is impossible to design a health-care plan that is both consistent with conservative ideology and acceptable to the broader public. People who can\u2019t afford health insurance are either unusually sick (meaning their health-care costs are high), unusually poor (their incomes are low), or both. Covering them means finding the money to pay for the cost of their medical treatment. You can cover poor people by giving them money. And you can cover sick people by requiring insurers to sell plans to people regardless of age or preexisting conditions. Obamacare uses both of these methods. But Republicans oppose spending more money on the poor, and they oppose regulation, which means they don\u2019t want to do either of them.\u201d\n\nOr as a Republican Hill staffer famously put it in 2014, \u201cAs far as repeal and replace goes, the problem with replace is that if you really want people to have these new benefits, it looks a hell of a lot like the Affordable Care Act\u2026. To make something like that work, you have to move in the direction of the ACA.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Paul Ryan said he \"intends\" to unveil a Republican alternative to Obamacare this year.
