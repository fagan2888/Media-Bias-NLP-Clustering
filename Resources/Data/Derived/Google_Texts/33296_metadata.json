A group called Fishers of Men said it would march downtown to celebrate fathers and connect them to entrepreneurs. It was exactly what Bailey thought he needed.\n\nA boy and his father should be close.\n\nBailey and his father are not close. His dad, a Navy man, lived far away in Virginia, while Bailey grew up in Jacksonville in what he calls a rough neighborhood not far from Andrew Jackson High School. He dropped out of that high school, and after he turned 20, he found out his ex-girlfriend had a 6-month-old son, Michael.\n\nBailey was a father, whether he knew how to be or not.\n\nSince then, Bailey moved to a nicer neighborhood on the Southside. He worked a job serving wealthy people in the club suites at EverBank Field. Seven years passed. Bailey earned his GED, and his son enrolled in a nice elementary school. Three weeks ago, another ex-girlfriend gave birth to his daughter, Telaysia. Bailey dreamed bigger. He enrolled in college and started a clothing line. He admits no one ever taught him how to run a business.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event organizers said the march was connected with President Barack Obama\u2019s fatherhood initiative, and the leader of the group, Alvin King, said he was tired of hearing about deadbeat dads. He wanted to do something to celebrate the good patriarchs. The march would end at a lot next to an organization that helps entrepreneurs. The dads would recite the president\u2019s fatherhood pledge, and then they would pray together, and then they\u2019d network with a few business owners.\n\nIt was exactly what Bailey needed.\n\nSo on a Saturday with Father\u2019s Day approaching, he woke early, and he walked 4 miles.\n\nHe was the only one.\n\nNo one, except the march\u2019s few leaders and Bailey, showed.\n\nHow could people not march and celebrate fathers. Where, he asked, are their priorities? What do they take pride in?\n\nBailey marched anyway.\n\nHe wore faded green jeans and two wristwatches and a 1990s-style Jacksonville Jaguars cap with his slogan written in gold marker under the bill of the cap: \u201c$ makes \u00a2.\u201d Money, he explained, makes sense.\n\nHe talked to the leaders and explained that he wanted to get his business going. He paints individual T-shirts and sells them for $25 to $30. He also paints murals, and apartment buildings and businesses pay him for it. He takes fashion management classes at the Art Institute of Jacksonville. Though the for-profit school is closing, the school promised to finish his education.\n\nAs Bailey walked to the networking event, a former college basketball player who started a few businesses stopped him.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a marketing plan,\u201d the man told Bailey. \u201cThe essence of the march is about the empowering of men to influence the things they can touch. One of the things that\u2019s missing is the mental approach of doing that.\u201d\n\nAnthony Butler, the director of E3 Business Group, the entrepreneurship organization, asked if anyone had questions. Bailey did.\n\n\u201cI want to know,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cHow do I get involved in the program?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you follow up and take the initiative to call me, I\u2019ll take the initiative to try to help you. Is that fair?\u201d Butler said.\n\nHis organization, Butler explained, gives financial and marketing advice for business owners. For new startups, he said, he usually charges them $225. The membership helps them figure out the organization of running a business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just starting a business,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn every aspect of it. How can I?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome out to events like this,\u201d Butler said. \u201cJust shadow us.\u201d\n\nButler collected business cards from the woman selling energy drinks and the woman who said she has a business of connecting people with Obamacare. He talked to multiple men who said they were financial advisers or life coaches or marketing consultants.\n\nHe pitched his idea to anyone who\u2019d listen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of doing clothing on a massive scale,\u201d Bailey said. Once he starts getting orders for 100 shirts, he figures he\u2019ll have to stop painting the shirts by hand and use screen prints.\n\n\u201cI have connections and contacts,\u201d said Alvin King, a financial adviser.\n\nBailey wants to teach his kids how to be a success. He didn\u2019t plan on becoming a father at 20, but he said it made him learn he had to mature. He learned he had to leave his friends who he said were a negative influence. He had to work hard, and he had to earn respect.\n\nDuring the school year, his son stays with him. During the summer, Michael stays with his mom.\n\nBailey wants his business to succeed, in part, because he wants to send his son to a private school and then to college.\n\n\u201cEvery child needs that male influence,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I missed out on, I can give to my son.\u201d\n\nAndrew Pantazi: (904) 359-4310", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Saturday, 27-year-old Antwan Bailey walked more than 4 miles from his home off Emerson Street to Hemming Park.
