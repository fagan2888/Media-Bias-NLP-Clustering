Has anyone here woken up to the fact that we are always the last ones to be considered in the equation of change?\u201d\n\nRoughly 20,000 of 650,000 doctors responded to the Physicians Foundation\u2019s survey, and voluntary surveys are prone to finding those with strong opinions. But of those strong opinions, 46 percent of doctors gave the Affordable Care Act (ACA) a \u201cD\u201d or \u201cF,\u201d while only 25 percent gave it an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB.\u201d\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

And many doctors exhibited ignorance about health insurance. Roughly 29 percent of doctors didn\u2019t know if their practice or employer participated in Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe data also showed accelerating trends in the way doctors practice. Doctors complained about spending 20 percent of their time filling out paperwork and said Obamacare rules often turn the patient-doctor relationship into a factory-based formula. Owners of their own practices\u2014those who deal most directly with paperwork and insurers\u2014were 56 percent more likely to grade the ACA poorly than other doctors.\n\nSome of those disgruntled doctors have responded by leaving their practices for hospitals. Roughly 53 percent of physicians described themselves as employees of a hospital or medical group, up from 44 percent two years ago. But nearly 63 percent of doctors don\u2019t think that trend bodes well for healthcare quality and cost.\n\nOthers are have headed the other direction\u2014off the insurance grid altogether. Plastic surgery specialist Dr. William Wennen told The World and Everything In It\u2019s Jim Henry that he plans to close his Fairbanks, Ala., practice because of Obamacare and meager Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement payments.\n\n\u201cFor the last several years I have been having to write off upwards of $750,000 in free, uncompensated care,\u201d said Wennen, who hasn\u2019t taken a paycheck since February. He specializes in reconstructive surgery for cancer patients, and by going cash-only from now on, he said he can lower his overhead and his fees.\n\nIn fact, the Physicians Foundation said 13 percent of doctors\u2014and 17 percent of those under 45\u2014are exploring a cash-only or other concierge-type practice, like the Boylan Clinic in Raleigh, N.C. The primary care concierge practice started this year, and patients pay a flat fee of $1,650 for 24-7 access to a doctor for a year. One of the doctors, Todd Helton, cited \u201cchanges in medicine\u201d and \u201cmore uncertainty ahead\u201d for the business move.\n\nAnd just as doctors are abandoning insurance, some insurance companies are abandoning Obamacare.\n\nLast week, Minnesota\u2019s largest and cheapest Obamacare insurer announced it will end its coverage at the end of this year. According to The Wall Street Journal, about 13 insurers nationwide have decided to pull out of exchanges. Citing a semblance of stability in the exchanges, though, 77 insurers applied to join. Only California will see a net decrease in available plans, though as in Minnesota, the prices likely will be higher.\n\nObamacare administrator Marilyn Tavenner told Congress recently that more than 6 million people signed up for Medicaid and other poverty-related programs under Obamacare. But she has admitted that roughly 700,000 people on the exchange marketplaces have dropped their coverage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "A survey of American physicians released this week paints a restless picture of the nation\u2019s doctors\u2014especially when it comes to Obamacare.", "title": "WORLD | Survey: Doctors don\u2019t like Obamacare | Andrew Branch | Sept. 24, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/09/survey_doctors_don_t_like_obamacare", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/istock_000011852148_medium.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "A survey of American physicians released this week paints a restless picture of the nation\u2019s doctors\u2014especially when it comes to Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a6f\"", "article_summary": "A survey of American physicians released this week paints a restless picture of the nation\u2019s doctors\u2014especially when it comes to Obamacare.\nAnd just as doctors are abandoning insurance, some insurance companies are abandoning Obamacare.\nRoughly 29 percent of doctors didn\u2019t know if their practice or employer participated in Obamacare exchanges.\nObamacare administrator Marilyn Tavenner told Congress recently that more than 6 million people signed up for Medicaid and other poverty-related programs under Obamacare.\nThe data also showed accelerating trends in the way doctors practice."}
