Here are the others: Self-Funding Health Benefits Could Kill Your Company For small companies, acting on the temptation to save some money by dumping an insured plan could blow up in their faces.\n\nThree Ways Broad PPO Networks Can Cost You To insurance carriers, the more providers in the network, the merrier. But that might not be the right solution for your company.\n\nThe ABCs of Self-Funding Your Health Plan More employers are moving to self-funding. Here's what you need to know to make the switch.\n\nEven as increases in the cost of health care have moderated significantly in recent years, for finance departments the issue remains a festering wound.\n\nAfter many years of shifting costs to employees and promoting programs designed to keep them healthier, employers \u2014 large ones, that is \u2014 are still experiencing average annual cost hikes of about 4%.\n\nSmaller firms are faring even worse. And more complications loom, thanks to the 40% excise tax imposed on high-cost health plans by the Affordable Care Act. In December Congress delayed the tax\u2019s effective date from 2018 to 2020, but nevertheless the reprieve is only temporary.\n\nMany studies have shown that, because scheduled increases in the tax are tied to the Consumer Price Index rather than the perpetually higher rate of medical cost inflation, virtually all companies will likely be subject to the tax within a few years of 2020. In a recent study by Willis Towers Watson, 70% of the 467 responding employers said the delay will have a small or negligible impact on their health-care strategies for 2017.\n\nIndeed, the discussion about companies having to get their health costs down specifically in order to avoid the excise tax is an \u201codd\u201d one, observes Randy Abbott, senior health and benefits strategist for Willis Towers Watson.\n\n\u201cThe survey result is not surprising, because employers have been managing health-care costs aggressively for many years,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cThe mindset that the excise tax [is driving that effort] kind of presumes that employers hadn\u2019t been doing anything in the meantime.\u201d\n\nGoing Holistic\n\nThere\u2019s always a cutting edge in health-care cost management, and over time the companies that are most progressive in that arena tend to have a 2.5 percentage point advantage over the field, according to Brian Marcotte, CEO of the National Business Group on Health (NBGH), which represents the perspectives of its 425 employer members on health policy issues.\n\nThat is, if the trend in health cost increases is 4.5%, the progressive employers will be around 2% \u2014 and will remain immune to the excise tax for much longer.\n\nTo Marcotte, the cutting edge is about addressing employees\u2019 health needs from a holistic standpoint.\n\nWith traditional corporate wellness programs, he notes, someone who\u2019s at risk for high blood pressure or cholesterol, say, merely gets incentives to see a doctor, work with a health coach, or follow a treatment regime\n\n\u201cNow some companies are beginning to evolve those strategies,\u201d Marcotte says. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at social determinants of health, including individuals\u2019 emotional well-being, financial well-being, community well-being, and social connectedness. For example, someone at risk for high blood pressure who happens to be heavily in debt is probably thinking more about putting food on the table than about blood pressure.\u201d\n\nTo address such situations, a company that has historically offered programs to help employees prepare for retirement may now implement financial well-being programs tailored to various stages of life, Marcotte suggests. The point is that employees need more help staying healthy than they\u2019ve typically been able to obtain from wellness programs.\n\nAnother major effort by companies to cut health care spending \u2014 requiring or encouraging employees to select a high-deductible health plan in a bid to transform them into sophisticated consumers of health care \u2014 has not yielded optimal results either.\n\n\u201cEmployees are never really going to be sophisticated consumers of health care,\u201d he says. \u201cThe system is too complicated, and they don\u2019t touch it enough. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing concierge services emerge that support employees end to end, whether for benefits questions, health-care issues, health improvement coaching, or navigating the health-care system.\u201d\n\nMarcotte is referring to a group of companies led by Accolade, Quantum Health, and more recently, Compass Professional Health Services. Each offers a single entry point to all things health care and easy access to health clinicians.\n\nThe greatest cost savings from the use of such providers are realized when employees (or their dependents) that need high levels of care form a relationship with a knowledgeable person who understands their health profile as well as their employer\u2019s health benefits.\n\nSomething Different\n\nTemple University Health System launched a relationship with Accolade at the beginning of its 2016 fiscal year, on July 1, 2015. The arrangement does not address the organization\u2019s role as a health-care services provider, but rather provides services to the 6,400 employees (and more than twice that many dependents of those employees) participating in the system\u2019s health benefits programs.\n\nAmong other goals of the program, the opportunity to save money by increasing employees\u2019 engagement in their own health is crucial, says Robert Lux, CFO of the four-hospital system. In its last fiscal year, Temple racked up more than $80 million in internal health care costs, which amounted to about 4% of the $2 billion in revenue the company generated, Lux says. Temple is experiencing health cost inflation of 3% to 5% per year.\n\n\u201cI had run the gamut on being able to get savings from changing benefit plan design, switching to self-insurance, and better managing drug costs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe needed to do something different\u2014something that was going to engage employees and their families in a more active world of wellness.\u201d\n\nWhile Accolade\u2019s usual revenue model currently is a per-member, per-month fee, Lux spent an entire year negotiating a deal under which the parties set a budget for Temple\u2019s internal medical and pharmaceutical spending for fiscal 2016. To the extent actual spending comes in below that threshold, Accolade will share in the savings.\n\nAnd if spending goes over the budget, \u201cwe will both feel the pain,\u201d he says. \u201cSo this is not a relationship where I just pay a bunch of fees to a vendor who\u2019s fulfilling its \u2018service\u2019 as long as they answer the phone.\u201d\n\nThrough the first six months of the fiscal year, spending was \u201ca couple of million dollars\u201d below the budget for that period, Lux says. He declines to say what spending level the budget calls for but claims that it represents a smaller increase from prior-year spending than the national average for employers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was an easy bar to meet,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Lux acknowledges that health costs are volatile and that he doesn\u2019t yet know the full year\u2019s results, he\u2019s confident that the spending will be under budget.\n\nIf you have better management of a person\u2019s health before it reaches a crisis state, \u201cyou\u2019ll end up with fewer emergency room visits and fewer in-patient admissions,\u201d Lux says. \u201cIt\u2019s about engagement, the development of a relationship between the health coaches and people who are dealing with medical issues. They develop a trust that allows them to make the right decisions about what to do and when to do it.\u201d\n\nEngaging the Audience\n\nServices like Accolade and Quantum Health have been in business for a number of years, but they haven\u2019t \u201ctaken off in a huge way,\u201d says Jordan Silvergleid, a vice president at The Advisory Board Company, a health care research firm. That\u2019s because the services they provide, with clinicians getting very involved in patient care \u2014 even showing up at the hospital to coordinate episodes of multiple-provider care \u2014 are expensive, Silvergleid says.\n\nNow, with leading-edge companies focusing on engagement as a tool to rein in health-care costs, the engagement services providers may be primed for that takeoff. \u201cThey\u2019re great services that deliver results,\u201d Silvergleid says. \u201cThe savings often can make up for the per-member, per-month cost. They are best-suited for companies with older or sicker populations that have more complex cases.\u201d\n\nCompass Professional Health Services has a slightly different model that depends somewhat less on clinicians\u2019 expertise and somewhat more on technology services to help employees solve medical issues. Another, newer provider in that category is Zest Health.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to recognize the value these services provide, and more companies should learn about that value proposition,\u201d says Silvergleid.\n\nGetting Results\n\nConsulting firm Aon Hewitt partnered with an unnamed provider of health engagement services on an extensive, seven-year study of how health-care engagement services affected a large national employer. The study, which focused on heart disease and diabetes patients, showed the following:\n\nA decline in the hospital admission rate from 70.5 per 1,000 plan members in 2006 to 52.3 in 2013.\n\nHospital days per 1,000 members fell from 309 to 240.\n\nAverage in-patient admissions costs for acute care increased by just 1.8% during the seven years, compared with a national benchmark of 6.9%.\n\nUnder the arrangement between the employer and the engagement services firm, the latter offered to act as adjunct members of physicians\u2019 staffs, keeping the doctors\u2019 costs down while providing cost-saving services to employers, says David Fortosis, senior vice president of health strategy for Aon Hewitt.\n\n\u201cNeither primary care doctors nor specialists have the time to follow up directly with patients to make sure, for example, that they\u2019re adhering to their care plan,\u201d Fortosis says. \u201cIn this situation the doctor gets paid something for that telephonic consultation. There aren\u2019t a lot of insurance carriers that will do that. So it\u2019s a win-win for the employer, the patient, and the doctor.\u201d\n\nOnly the most forward-thinking employers will consider such arrangements at present, he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re talking with clients about it a lot. Many of them still believe their carrier is doing a good job. Also, the employer has to front some money to pay for the third party in order to bring the benefits on the back end.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most significantly, employers may be skeptical that the interventions will actually change people\u2019s behavior, notes Jason Mahler, Aon Hewitt\u2019s senior vice president of health and benefits.\n\nA key to making the seven-year program pay off was the identification up front of about 3% of employees with cardiac issues and diabetes as primary drivers of claims costs. Organizations like Accolade and Quantum Health typically don\u2019t carve out chronic and complex cases, Fortosis notes, instead providing a blanket advisory approach to the full spectrum of health plan members.\n\nEmbracing Technology\n\nSome hardened finance types might consider \u201cengagement\u201d to be a soft concept with no bottom-life benefit, but it\u2019s a powerful one when it comes to health care, says Marcotte.\n\nNBGH hosts two summits per year for its employer members. At the most recent one, attendees were asked to text a word one two-word phrase representing what \u201ckeeps them up at night\u201d regarding the provision of health care benefits. The more often a particular word was typed, the larger that word appeared on a screen in the conference room. The word \u201cengagement\u201d dwarfed everything else on the screen.\n\n\u201cEngagement came up in every session we had during the say,\u201d Marcotte says. \u201cCompanies are struggling with how to engage people in the use of resources they are making available.\u201d\n\nFor instance, if a company offers a new program for people contemplating knee or hip surgery, it may put out a communication that sweeps in people considering surgery at that time. But someone who begins to have a knee or hip problem six months later probably has forgotten that the service is available.\n\nIn response to that issue, NBGH has formed a health innovations forum in which member companies like Boeing, Lowes, and WalMart vet startup health technology vendors, especially those that combine data with technology and push communications to employees at the time they have a need.\n\nThe vendor that has generated the most buzz is Livongo, which provides a glucose-monitoring unit to diabetes patients and communicates with the unit just after patients take a finger-prick test. \u201cIf you\u2019re hypoglycemic, you get a communication right then about the things you can do correct that,\u201d Marcotte says. \u201cWhat makes the difference is that you receive that communication at a moment when you\u2019re not feeling well.\u201d\n\nLowes conducted a pilot test with 742 diabetic health plan members starting in December 2015 and considered it successful enough to make it available to all 120,000 employees, about 5% of whom are diabetic, according to Bob Ihrie, senior vice president of compensation and benefits.\n\nThe company took action after its health care \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 employees of Accolade and Quantum Health, both of which it has contracts with \u2014 informed Ihrie that many diabetic employees weren\u2019t controlling their glucose levels because they couldn\u2019t afford the tests.\n\nThat prompted Lowes to hire Livongo and also to provide the employees with free test strips, saving them $60 a week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t offer a lot of broad-based incentives to our employees, but it makes sense to offer one like this to people that we know are likely to end up with claims,\u201d Ihrie says.\n\nIhrie also recently expanded nationwide with an application from Omada Health that\u2019s aimed at controlling the weight of pre-diabetics.\n\nMarcotte of NBGH also cites Hello Heart, an application for controlling blood pressure, as a promising tool. And Silvergleid suggests companies look into Zipongo, a new nutrition app, Sleepio, which helps with sleep management, and Healthiest You, an easy-to-use alternative to telemedicine providers like Teladoc and American Well.\n\n\u201cThere are just a huge number of these apps, because Silicon Valley folks are getting tons of money to fund health-care startups,\u201d says Silvergleid. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s a big question for employers now: How do we figure out which of these things makes sense for our population?\u201d\n\nSo, do companies that employ such highly personalized engagement strategies have a chance to fend off the impending Affordable Care Act excise tax? Yes, says Marcotte\u2014with a big caveat. \u201cThe cutting edge is not doing just one of these things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s doing everything you can to look at the health of your work force as part of your overall business strategy.\u201d\n\nDavid McCann is a deputy editor at CFO.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSIDEBAR\n\nCost-Trend Mirage?\n\nHealth care costs for large employers are once again moderate this year, estimated to rise an average of only 4% from the 2015 level, according to Willis Towers Watson.\n\nThis year\u2019s annual Emerging Trends in Health Care survey \u2014 which counted 467 respondents, all from companies with at least 500 full-time employees \u2014 was the fourth consecutive one showing an increase of less than 5%. Those four annual increases were also the four smallest of this century.\n\nBut the recent, relatively modest upward cost ticks may not warrant much celebration, as a more salient statistic is the difference between health-cost inflation and general inflation. We wouldn\u2019t be hearing so much about the former if it weren\u2019t far outpacing the latter.\n\nThe CPI-U \u2014 which tracks inflation experienced by urban consumers \u2014 inched up by only 0.1% in 2015, the second-lowest since 1962. The CPI-U climbed at rates lower than historical norms the previous two years as well, at 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively.\n\nHealth cost inflation can grow at a greater rate than seen last year but still represent a rosier outcome. For example, in 2008, the CPI-U was up by 3.8%, or more than two-thirds of the 5.3% health care cost hike.\n\nBy comparison, last year\u2019s 0.1% consumer inflation was just one-fortieth of health cost inflation.", "article_metadata": {"date": 20160525, "description": "Innovative ways to engage employees offer hope for bringing health costs under control.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New Cures for Health Costs\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2016\\/05\\/new-cures-health-costs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-05-25 10:21:22\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-05-25 15:27:22\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":490789,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Accolade\",\"Advisory Board Company\",\"Aon Hewitt\",\"Bob Ihrie\",\"Brian Marcotte\"],\"categories\":[\"Accounting &amp; Tax\",\"Budgeting\",\"Business Planning\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Health Care\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/16Jun_SR_Chart_625.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Innovative ways to engage employees offer hope for bringing health costs under control.", "title": "New Cures for Health Costs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2016/05/16Jun_SR_Chart_625.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-25T15:27:22+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2016/05/new-cures-health-costs/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Innovative ways to engage employees offer hope for bringing health costs under control.", "title": "New Cures for Health Costs", "creator": "@cfo", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Special Report: Managing Health Care Costs", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Workplace Issues", "tag": "Willis Towers Watson", "published_time": "2016-05-25T10:21:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T15:27:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "accolade, advisory board company, aon hewitt, bob ihrie, brian marcotte, david fortosis, employer-sponsored plan, excise tax, hccostsr, health benefits, health benefits plan, jordan silvergleid, livongo, lowes, national business group on health, nbgh, quantum health, randy abbott, richard lux, special report, temple university health system, willis towers watson"}, "article_summary": "This is one of four stories in a special report on managing health care costs.\nEach offers a single entry point to all things health care and easy access to health clinicians.\nFor example, in 2008, the CPI-U was up by 3.8%, or more than two-thirds of the 5.3% health care cost hike.\nAnother major effort by companies to cut health care spending \u2014 requiring or encouraging employees to select a high-deductible health plan in a bid to transform them into sophisticated consumers of health care \u2014 has not yielded optimal results either.\nGetting ResultsConsulting firm Aon Hewitt partnered with an unnamed provider of health engagement services on an extensive, seven-year study of how health-care engagement services affected a large national employer."}
