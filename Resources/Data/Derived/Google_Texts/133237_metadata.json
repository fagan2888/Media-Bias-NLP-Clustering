During this restructuring the laboratory operations at Helomics, including the processing of its ChemoFx, GeneFX, BioSpeciFx, CellFx and DEFENDER tumor profiling tests, will continue at full capacity.\n\nAs part of this second realignment phase, Helomics will restructure its R&D, operations, and sales and marketing to refocus its efforts on the central buying and decision-making processes of Medicare, Commercial Payer\u2019s and hospital systems. To reflect this realignment, a reduction-in-force was also completed, primarily sales professionals calling on individual oncologists.\n\nThis strategic shift was brought on primarily by changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which have made cost the sole driver for healthcare decision-making, to the determent of new technologies and diagnostics in the personalized medicine arena. Due to this, the decision-making process for the utilization of new technologies has shifted into a more centralized process.\n\nIn parallel, Helomics is forming a new research products division that will focus on the pharmaceutical, biotech and clinical research sectors. The company\u2019s clinical products business will also be restructured into a new division focused on advanced lab developed tests (ALDT) and preparation for products in the FDA diagnostics markets as the regulatory oversight begins to shift in the personalized medicine marketplace.\n\nNeil J. Campbell, President & CEO of Helomics, said, \u201cHelomics\u2019 objective in this second phase of realignment is to provide an even greater focus on leveraging our comprehensive tumor profiling technologies and expertise, and aligning our resources to best serve the current Payer environment is critical at this stage. Comprehensive tumor profiling through PCAP\u2122 done properly will focus on the life cycle of the patients\u2019 tumor during all stages such as cell oncogenesis, proliferation, metastasis, apoptotic cascade. Helomics\u2019 broad set of proprietary platforms and products can provide an in depth understanding of tumor biology and the effects pharmaceutical and immunotherapeutic interventions can have on the personalized treatments of patients.\u201d\n\nTo access a CEO letter from Neil Campbell discussing this second phase of realignment further, please visit http://www.helomics.com/\n\nAbout PCAP\u2122\n\nThe PCAP\u2122 platform is the basis of Helomics\u2019 comprehensive tumor profiling capability.
