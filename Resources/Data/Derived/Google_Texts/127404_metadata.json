In affordable cities, wage growth and health care costs are in balance.\n\nJacksonville, for instance, scores slightly below average on affordability. Omaha and Birmingham, Ala., score much better than average.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? How can more cities improve their results?\n\nWe need more answers to these questions if costs are going to be reduced.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE\n\nMeanwhile, a group of senior citizens will be receiving no increases in Social Security benefits and big increases in Medicare premiums.\n\nThe premium increases were called \u201cunprecedented\u201d by an expert in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDue to rapidly falling gas prices, there will be no cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients.\n\nThis has happened just twice previously since 1975 (2010 and 2011), reports The New York Times.\n\nMost Medicare recipients will be held harmless against premium increases because those payments are linked to Social Security payments.\n\nBut for about a third of Medicare recipients, premiums could increase by up to 50 percent.\n\nAs for that Social Security COLA, seniors say that gas prices don\u2019t affect them that much. Once retired, there is less need to drive.\n\nIn fact, prescription drug prices represent one of the major uncontrolled costs for seniors.\n\nThe broad consumer price index used to calculate the Social Security COLA includes food, housing, clothing, transportation, energy, transportation, medical care, recreation and education.\n\nSeniors argue that this does not accurately represent their expenses. The federal government has been experimenting with another price index for seniors, but even if this one were used, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference for next year.\n\nAbout 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children receive Social Security benefits. The average monthly benefit is $1,224.\n\nCHECK MEDICARE COVERAGE\n\nHowever, now is the time for seniors to do something about their medical costs. It\u2019s open enrollment time for Medicare Part D, the prescription drug plan, and private Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSeniors should review their plans to ensure that their prescription drugs are still covered \u2014 and that their deductibles have not gone up.\n\nIn addition, this is a good time to shop for better prices.\n\nConsumers in Medicare Part D plans face an average 13 percent increase in premiums, reports Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn metro areas like Jacksonville, there often are many different kinds of prescription drug plans.\n\nThe average client nationally can choose from 26 assorted plans.\n\nThe website medicare.gov has lots of helpful information. And consumers may call (800) MEDICARE to have a representative run a search and mail the results. Open enrollment is in effect and ends on Dec. 7.\n\nDEALING WITH COSTS\n\nMany seniors resent the reference to Social Security and Medicare as \u201centitlements\u201d since they paid into these funds during their working lives.\n\nBut both programs were always set up as generational transfers from workers to retirees.\n\nThis was fine until the numbers of children declined. Now there are many more retirees than workers.\n\nWhile there are trust funds in both Social Security and Medicare, they are not sufficient to pay all benefits. And if nothing is changed, there will have to big cuts in benefits.\n\nOne solution is to use a progressive system that asks the more fortunate to take benefit cuts and payroll tax increases for Social Security.\n\nIn a thought-provoking piece for the Brookings Institution, economist Douglas Elmendorf wrote that it would be unfair to raise the retirement age for low-income workers.\n\n\u201cWe should protect people of modest means by imposing most of the burden of changes on those who are more affluent,\u201d Elmendorf wrote.\n\nThere is no free lunch.\n\nBut that\u2019s a reality that America\u2019s health care system has ignored for too long.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was apparent from the start that the Affordable Care Act did a lot for access but far too little about high costs of health care in America.Since the United States spends far more than any nation on health care, then it stands to reason that costs can be reduced without major impacts on quality.In fact, more efficiency often leads to better outcomes for patients.To truly address costs would mean taking actions that neither Republicans nor Democrats would entirely support.
