But a new study finds that human milk fat, when used in a cream supplement, could improve the growth and development of premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nFeeding a premature baby an exclusive human milk diet has been shown to protect the infant\u2019s intestines, as well as provide other health benefits. Breast milk provides all babies \u2014 and especially premature ones \u2014 with crucial calories, vitamins, and protein. Preemies also face a higher risk of infection due to an under-developed immune system, and the live cells in breast milk help strengthen them against infection. Baby formulas or supplements designed for preemies aren\u2019t as effective. Often, babies born too early are too immature to suckle milk from the breast directly, so NICU infants are given breast milk through a nasogastric tube.\n\nThe study, carried out at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, was published in Journal of Pediatrics. Researchers found that in addition to providing premature babies with a mother\u2019s breast milk or a \u201cfortifier\u201d containing protein and minerals from human donor milk, adding a byproduct from pasteurized donor milk \u2014 milk fat \u2014 to the mix could significantly boost the child\u2019s growth. In short, providing premature babies with a mix of protein and fat \u2014 most of which can be found in human milk \u2014 could help them grow into regular kids.\n\n\u201cFor premature babies who weigh less than 1,000 grams (about 2 pounds, 2 ounces), one of the problems is that their lungs and other organs are still developing when they are born,\u201d Dr. Amy Hair, assistant professor of pediatrics at Baylor and an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cIf the infant gains weight and increases in length at a good rate while in the NICU, this helps improve their outcomes.\u201d\n\nPreviously, scientists attempted to give premature infants oils or infant formula in the hopes of them growing. \u201cThis is a natural way to give them fat,\u201d Hair said, noting that premature babies can\u2019t be given more volume necessarily; but rather they need more calories in lesser volumes. \u201c[W]e can now use a natural source from donor milk.\u201d She added that babies were growing in both weight and length when given milk fat.\n\nAny baby born before the 37th week is considered premature. The earlier a baby is born, the higher the chance the baby will have serious health complications, such as respiratory distress syndrome, apnea, anemia, infection, or retinopathy. If a baby is born between 28 and 33 weeks, he or she will have a much greater chance of survival \u2014 up to 95 percent.\n\nHair urges mothers to donate extra breast milk to a milk bank: \u201cIt can help nourish our tiniest and most vulnerable infants,\u201d she said in the press release.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "premature babies, breastfeeding, breast milk fat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers found that giving premature babies human breast milk, as well as fat from pasteurized breast milk, greatly improved their growth and chances for survival.", "title": "Breast Milk Fat Helps Premature Babies Grow And Stay Healthy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/increasing-calories-and-not-volume-breast-milk-fat-helps-protect-premature-babies-boosts-298306", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/premature-baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers found that giving premature babies human breast milk, as well as fat from pasteurized breast milk, greatly improved their growth and chances for survival.", "title": "Breast Milk Fat Helps Premature Babies Grow And Stay Healthy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/increasing-calories-and-not-volume-breast-milk-fat-helps-protect-premature-babies-boosts-298306", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/premature-baby.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/premature-baby.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-15T16:17:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T16:17:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers found that giving premature babies human breast milk, as well as fat from pasteurized breast milk, greatly improved their growth and chances for survival."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbb5\"", "article_summary": "Premature babies will be more likely to grow and develop if they're given more calories and protein from human breast milk and milk fat.\nOften, babies born too early are too immature to suckle milk from the breast directly, so NICU infants are given breast milk through a nasogastric tube.\nResearchers found that in addition to providing premature babies with a mother\u2019s breast milk or a \u201cfortifier\u201d containing protein and minerals from human donor milk, adding a byproduct from pasteurized donor milk \u2014 milk fat \u2014 to the mix could significantly boost the child\u2019s growth.\nBreast milk provides all babies \u2014 and especially premature ones \u2014 with crucial calories, vitamins, and protein.\n\u201c[W]e can now use a natural source from donor milk.\u201d She added that babies were growing in both weight and length when given milk fat."}
