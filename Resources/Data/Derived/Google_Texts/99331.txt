The Hospital Corporation of America and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the state’s largest insurer, have reached an impasse on contract negotiations that could result in the Tennessee chain’s 40 Texas hospitals being removed from the insurer’s in-network plans.

Mitchell Schnurman of The Dallas Morning News had the story first over the weekend, and Gustavo Bujanda, a spokesman for Richardson-based BCBSTX, said there had been no updates since Friday. Blue Cross customers have been notified that the HCA-owned hospitals could be removed from their in-network plans by the end of the month if the two don’t come to an agreement. Bujanda said postcards went out to about 117,000 Texans who used an HCA facility in 2015. It could affect many more: about 3.9 million Texans live near one. Doctors with admitting privileges also got notice.

“It’s not something that happens often, and it doesn’t usually get to crunch time like we are at this point,” said Bujanda in an interview with D Healthcare Daily.

HCA is seeking price increases for its procedures from Blue Cross, which is pushing back after years of losses mounted on the back of the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace. BCBSTX embraced the federal marketplaces like no other insurer, and suffered correlating losses. Last year, its parent company, Chicago’s Health Care Services Corporation, paid $1.22 for every $1 it brought in. Since 2014, its plans in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Illinois, and Montana have lost more than $2 billion in that sphere, about $720 million of which is attributable to just Texas.

HCA, meanwhile, brought in a record $4 billion. Locally, it’s made headlines for the purchase of the upscale acute care hospital formerly known as Forest Park Medical Center at Frisco, which has been rebranded as Medical City Frisco and is operating under Medical Center of Plano’s license.

HCA sent the below statement on the matter:
