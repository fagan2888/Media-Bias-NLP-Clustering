McKee was chair of BJC HealthCare\u2019s Board of Trustees and was looking for a fresh look at the challenges facing Christian Hospital.\n\nBoth Westbrook and his wife, Valerie Bell, are Harvard Law School graduates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly creative in my approach to finding solutions,\u201d said Westbrook, president and CEO of the consulting firm KRW Advisors. \u201cMcKee came to appreciate my approach to problem-solving. I did not know how much interest I had in health care until it was front and center.\u201d\n\nFor more than 15 years, Westbrook has volunteered as a problem-solver for BJC HealthCare system \u2013 serving as a board trustee for 12 years and a Christian Hospital board member prior to that. And at the beginning of January, Westbrook became the health system\u2019s new board chair \u2013 making him the first African-American or minority to chair the board of trustees at BJC.\n\nWestbrook\u2019s five-year term puts him at the helm of the region\u2019s largest employer, with a network of 13 hospitals and reported revenue of $3.8 billion in 2012. Westbrook succeeded Don Ross, vice chairman of Enterprise Holdings Inc.\n\n\u201cKelvin knows BJC, and he knows the St Louis community,\u201d said Steven Lipstein, BJC president and CEO. \u201cKelvin has always encouraged BJC\u2019s board and leaders to make health care more available, more affordable, endlessly in pursuit of even better patient outcomes. He wants St. Louis to be a healthier community.\u201d\n\nLipstein also said that BJC must be an inclusive environment. Out of 17 board trustees, there are three women and three people of color, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not yet where we will be someday, as openings arise and opportunities present, we will continue to seek out more women and minority leaders of BJC HealthCare,\u201d Lipstein said.\n\nSense of responsibility\n\nGrowing up in Tacoma, Washington, Westbrook was one of 11 siblings and the son of a bishop for the Church of God in Christ. Being involved in that larger community, he saw how the lack of quality health care and economic resources affected some of the church members\u2019 lives, he said. He also saw how some others would step up to help those in need.\n\n\u201cWe saw firsthand how the church and my parents would give their time and other resources to help the lives of those less fortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nWestbrook attended middle and high school in the suburbs of Tacoma during the late \u201860s and \u201870s \u2013 when more of society started to be transformed during the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement, he said.\n\n\u201cI have been fortunate to benefit from all the hard work and efforts of the generation before us,\u201d he said. \u201cMy access to opportunity \u2013 educational and others \u2013 are the direct products of those efforts. There is a sense of responsibility that I feel and my family feels as a result of the sacrifice of others. It\u2019s coupled with church teachings I learned growing up.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Valerie Bell, grew up in Brooklyn, and she still considers New York a second home.\n\nThe power couple met at Harvard, where their three children \u2013 Lauren, Erinn and Brent \u2013 have also attended. Both practiced law in New York for more than a decade. Shortly prior to moving to St. Louis, Westbrook got involved in the \u201ctelecommunications explosion\u201d by becoming a partner in a limited partnership that purchased a Charter Communications affiliate. He ultimately wanted to start his own business, and subsequently he did that.\n\nBut first, he sold his partnership interest and took a year off to volunteer by mentoring young African-American teens in St. Louis. He then co-founded the cable and telecommunications provider Millennium Digital Media, LLC, where he served as president and CEO from 1997 to 2006.\n\nWestbrook serves on the corporate board of Archer Daniel Midland, a Fortune 500 company whose headquarters in Decatur Ill. will soon move to Chicago. He\u2019s also a board member at Commerce Bank (St. Louis) and Stifel Financial Corp. (headquartered in St. Louis), among others.\n\nWhen he and Bell moved to St. Louis almost 20 years ago, their children were 9, 6 and 1. They both have always believed: To whom much is given, much will be required.\n\n\u201cWe quickly identified that our passions galvanized around education and health care,\u201d said Kelvin, who has also served as board chair at St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nSoon after arriving in St. Louis, Dr. William Danforth, chancellor emeritus of Washington University, asked Bell to be an attorney in the St. Louis Public Schools desegregation case. Both Bell and Westbrook strongly believe that the two pillars of success are health and education.\n\nHealth isn\u2019t just what happens in the exam room, and Westbrook understands this, said Jason Purnell, assistant professor at the George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University.\n\n\u201cHe understands how important education is as a predictor of health outcomes,\u201d said Purnell, who leads a team currently researching health disparities among African Americans in the region. \u201cThe fact that he is focused on both of those issues is crucially important. Westbrook is an accomplished business executive and also somebody who cares about the community.\u201d\n\nWorkforce diversity\n\nWestbrook said he also will work towards expanding opportunities for young people, including African Americans and other minorities, to pursue careers in healthcare.\n\nLee F. Fetter, group president for BJC, said Westbrook had a strong influence on increasing workforce diversity as board chair of St. Louis Children Hospital.\n\n\u201cKelvin\u2019s philosophy in this regard is simple and direct \u2013 effort is important, but results are the only true measure of intent,\u201d Fetter said. \u201cKelvin played a key role in the creation of a new leadership position, vice president for diversity inclusion and equity at SLCH and BJH \u2013 a first for the two BJC teaching hospitals.\u201d\n\nHe has also been a strong advocate for increasing St. Louis Children's financial commitment to community-outreach programs and improvement of hospital care programs that directly benefit minorities and low-income families, Fetter said. Westbrook said he is proud that BJC is now reaching into the community through piloting initiatives such as Raising St. Louis, which provides pregnancy and early childhood services to residents in five North St. Louis zip codes (call 314-747-7785 for information).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time in health care, as you know,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThroughout my careers, I have learned that I do my best work when there are no obvious solutions. Some people run to the fire, and some people freeze. I would rather embrace the situation.\u201d\n\nWith the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Westbrook said BJC has a number of new regulatory issues to consider. Overall, the changing landscape in health care is going to present a number of new challenges, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something \u2013 and the \u2018something\u2019 is the big question mark,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to make some inroads. We\u2019ve been blessed as a system with great leadership. Our platform is not broken; it\u2019s very strong. We are well-positioned to withstand the changes ahead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the late 1990s, entrepreneur Kelvin Westbrook met developer Paul McKee Jr., and soon thereafter they had a long conversation about health care access and inequities.", "og": {"site_name": "St. Louis American", "description": "In the late 1990s, entrepreneur Kelvin Westbrook met developer Paul McKee Jr., and soon thereafter they had a long conversation about health care access and inequities.", "title": "BJC appoints first black board chair", "url": "http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/article_9d980e78-8ecf-11e3-aff0-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/stlamerican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/77/c7705766-8eaf-11e3-9d4a-001a4bcf887a/52f2b290e65bf.preview-500.jpg?resize=450%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@stlouisamerican", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157786209183}, "keywords": "local_news", "news_keywords": "local_news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6ea\"", "article_summary": "And at the beginning of January, Westbrook became the health system\u2019s new board chair \u2013 making him the first African-American or minority to chair the board of trustees at BJC.\nHe\u2019s also a board member at Commerce Bank (St. Louis) and Stifel Financial Corp.
