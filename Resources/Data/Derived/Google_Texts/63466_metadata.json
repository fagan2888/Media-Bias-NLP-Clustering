The budget would partly privatize Medicare, turn Medicaid into block grants to the states and repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting in place cuts that would balance the budget in a decade.\n\nMr. Gentile is hoping voters in the 11th Congressional District\u2013a swing seat roping in Staten Island and southern Brooklyn\u2013will see Mr. Donovan as a tool of Washington Republicans, who control all of Congress. Approval ratings of Congress are at historical lows.\n\n\u201cMy opponent has chosen to run and hide, hoping that no one is paying attention, while his party turns their back on the very Americans who need them most,\u201d Mr. Gentile said in a statement. (He continued the attack at a Staten Island press conference today.)\n\n\u201cAverage Americans have a hard enough time trying to make ends meet, and Congress should be working to create jobs and put money in people\u2019s pockets,\u201d he continued. \u201cInstead, the Republicans have proposed an extreme budget that would support the super-rich while sticking it to seniors and hardworking New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nMr. Donovan, who rose to prominence after a Staten Island grand jury voted not to indict a NYPD officer in the death of Eric Garner, has distanced himself from national Republicans already, even though he has articulated little in the way of a detailed policy platform. Mr. Donovan criticized House Republicans for holding up funding for the Department of Homeland Security last month after conservatives hoped to use the bill as a way to cripple President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nBut on the budget, Mr. Donovan was less dismissive, though his campaign said it was \u201cnot perfect.\u201d Through a spokeswoman, Jessica Proud, he accused Mr. Gentile of \u201cscaring seniors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising Mr. Gentile is resorting to trying to scare seniors. He has already voted to raise taxes on the middle class so it\u2019s scary to think what he\u2019d do with the federal budget,\u201d Mr. Proud said, referencing a City Council resolution Mr. Gentile voted for in 2003.\n\n\u201cThis budget is not perfect, however it is just a starting point for negotiations. Dan\u2019s top priority is protecting the commitments government has already made to our seniors while finding a balance between what taxpayers can afford and ensuring we have a strong safety net for those truly in need,\u201d she added.\n\nMr. Gentile is the underdog in the special election, set for May 5. He is looking to galvanize older voters, who are expected to make up a large chunk of the electorate, to reject Mr. Donovan for aligning himself to closely with unpopular national Republicans.\n\nThe National Republican Campaign Committee, unlike their Democratic counterpart, has been active in the race so far, however. The NRCC challenged Mr. Gentile to decide which budget proposal he supports: Mr. Obama\u2019s, the House Democrats\u2019, the House progressives\u2019, or the Congressional Black Caucus budget.\n\nThe GOP proposal is expected to pass the House but could have trouble in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrower grip on the majority and some GOP senators want more robust spending on the military. A spokesman for Mr. Gentile ripped the NRCC for trying to \u201cdistract voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the NRCC is trying to distract voters while Dan Donovan hides in the dugout and refuses to step up to the plate,\u201d said the spokesman, Justin Brannan.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_7512.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_7512.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Daniel Donovan, ny-11, Staten Island, Vincent Gentile, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "dan donovan, vincent gentile, ny-11, staten island, brooklyn, house republican budget, special election", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_7512.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "dan donovan, vincent gentile, ny-11, staten island, brooklyn, house republican budget, special election", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Congressional Contenders Tussle Over House Republican Budget", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_7512.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Daniel Donovan and Vincent Gentile clashed today over the House Republican budget proposal.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-03-17T18:47:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T18:56:18+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "Daniel Donovan and Vincent Gentile clashed today over the House Republican budget proposal.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Daniel Donovan and Vincent Gentile clashed today over the House Republican budget proposal.", "title": "Congressional Contenders Tussle Over House Republican Budget", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/03/congressional-contenders-tussle-over-house-republican-budget/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_7512.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 900}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
