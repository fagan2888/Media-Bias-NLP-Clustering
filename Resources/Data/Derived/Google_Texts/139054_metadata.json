The Act, which Congress passed late last week, will alter Medicare reimbursement for new off-campus hospital-owned facilities that have heretofore been treated as \"hospital-based.\" Off-campus facilities for which a hospital was not billing as \"hospital-based\" as of the date of the enactment of the Act will not be treated as \"hospital-based,\" and the physician or other provider's fee schedule rate, instead of the hospital outpatient rate, will apply.\n\nPrior to the Act, covered out-patient department (\"OPD\") services included services provided by facilities meeting the complex hospital-based rules, even if the facility was not physically-located on the campus of the hospital. Subject to the grandfather provision discussed below, the Act adds a specific exclusion to the definition of covered OPD services, making services furnished by an off-campus outpatient department of a hospital ineligible. The Act provides that a facility is \"off-campus\" if it is not within 250 yards of the hospital's main buildings (including for this purpose, a \"remote location of a hospital,\" meaning a separate in-patient campus of the hospital, which is a helpful clarification in an otherwise problematic law). Facilities deemed \"off-campus\" are ineligible for Medicare reimbursement at the hospital outpatient rate.\n\nThe inclusion of a grandfather provision will mitigate some of the Act's impact, as facilities currently treated as \"hospital-based\" will not be impacted by the change in law. Only facilities that are not billing as \"hospital-based\" as of the date of enactment will be ineligible for reimbursement at the hospital outpatient rate. It is unclear whether a conveyance of an off-campus grandfathered facility would eliminate the grandfathered status and the ability of the buyer to bill for the services as \"hospital-based.\" The Congressional Budget Office (\"CBO\") forecasts that the government will reap significant cost savings from the lower rates that will apply; an October 28, 2015 analysis from the CBO projects that the change in reimbursement policy will provide $9.3 billion in relief by 2025.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On November 2, 2015, President Obama signed into law H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which significantly changes Medicare reimbursement for off campus hospital services.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On November 2, 2015, President Obama signed into law H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which significantly changes Medicare reimbursement for off-campus hospital serv", "title": "Budget Deal Alters Reimbursement to Off-Campus Hospital-Owned Facilities", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/budget-deal-alters-reimbursement-to-campus-hospital-owned-facilities", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/hospital%20equipment_4.jpg?itok=N4-47K6k", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legislation, Health, HR 1314, BIpartisan Budget Act, Medicare, Reimbursement, off-campus, hospital services", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, Legislation, Health, HR 1314, BIpartisan Budget Act, Medicare, Reimbursement, off-campus, hospital services"}, "article_summary": "1314, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the \"Act\"), which significantly changes Medicare reimbursement for off-campus hospital services.\nFacilities deemed \"off-campus\" are ineligible for Medicare reimbursement at the hospital outpatient rate.\nThe Act, which Congress passed late last week, will alter Medicare reimbursement for new off-campus hospital-owned facilities that have heretofore been treated as \"hospital-based.\"\nOnly facilities that are not billing as \"hospital-based\" as of the date of enactment will be ineligible for reimbursement at the hospital outpatient rate.\nThe inclusion of a grandfather provision will mitigate some of the Act's impact, as facilities currently treated as \"hospital-based\" will not be impacted by the change in law."}
