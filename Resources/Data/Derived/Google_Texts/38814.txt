Former Secretary of State and current Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been under criminal investigation by the FBI for nearly a year. At this point, it's been reported Clinton hosted thousands of emails containing classified information on her private email server. Worse, at least 22-emails contain the most sensitive of all top secret information about human sources, putting lives at risk in addition to compromising U.S. national security.

Yesterday on The Intelligence Report, former House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa explained why FBI Direct James Comey has no choice but to refer Clinton for indictment.

"The Director is somebody who cares a great deal about national security and with the body of evidence, he really has no choice but to refer this for indictment," Issa said. "We have communications back and forth to the President from Hillary Clinton's private email, we have 1300 sensitive documents, 22 classified at the highest level, this is well past anyone claiming that they didn't know."

"In this case she made a choice. She made a choice to have a private server, she made a choice to use it with highly sensitive material, she made a choice to receive and re-transmit documents that should have been classified and have later been classified," he added. "These choices are what the prosecution will really be about."
