Rand Paul has been calling former President Clinton a sexual predator for weeks, but he is telling his fellow Republicans not to call President Obama names.\n\nVideo:\n\nAt a Tea Party Patriots event, Sen. Paul (R-KY) said:\n\nIn order for us to be a bigger party though, we have to reach out to more people, not just those of us here. It has to be a bigger party. It has to be a bigger movement. There are times, and I don\u2019t think it is our movement, but there are times when people are using language that shouldn\u2019t be used.\n\nI recently criticized someone for using some of than language, and I\u2019m not going to bring it up, but I will say that we can disagree with the president without calling him names. We can disagree. I disagree almost all of the time with the president, okay? But I don\u2019t call him names, and I am polite to him when I meet him. I\u2019m not saying that our problem, but are people out in the public, and that\u2019s taking away from our message, so let\u2019s try not to be part of that.\n\nHere is the problem with what Sen. Paul was saying. He has been running around for weeks telling anyone who would listen that former president Bill Clinton is a sexual predator.\n\nOn Meet The Press, Paul said, \u201cWell, you know, I mean the Democrats one of their big issues is they have concocted and says Republicans are committing a war on women. One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses shouldn\u2019t prey on young interns in their office, and I think really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this.\u201d\n\nUsing Rand Paul\u2019s logic, it\u2019s okay to call the former president, whose wife he may be running against in 2016, a sexual predator, but the current president is off limits. To put it another way, racism is bad, but sexism is good.\n\nRand Paul doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on when it comes to lecturing others about name calling. It also speaks volumes that Paul had to tell an audience of adults the same thing that a grown up would tell a small child. One would think that adults already knew that it isn\u2019t nice to call people names, but he was addressing a group of people who thought wearing tea bags on their heads was a serious form of political protest, so there\u2019s that.\n\nThe quick and dirty summary of Paul\u2019s point is that name calling is bad if hurts Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, but perfectly acceptable if it helps.\n\nKentucky senators who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t be throwing such large stones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
