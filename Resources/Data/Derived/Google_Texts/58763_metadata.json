When Miles, 68, awoke on a wintry February morning and the pain had not subsided, she decided to see a doctor.\n\nSo she turned on her computer and logged on to www.livehealth.com, a service offered by her Medicare Advantage plan, Anthem BlueCross BlueShield of Ohio. She spoke to a physician, who used her computer\u2019s camera to peer into her mouth and who then sent a prescription to her pharmacy.\n\n\u201cThis was so easy,\u201d Miles said.\n\nFor Medicare patients, it\u2019s also incredibly rare.\n\nNearly 20 years after such videoconferencing technology has been available for health services, fewer than 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries use it. Anthem and a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health plan in western Pennsylvania are the only two Medicare Advantage insurers offering the virtual visits, and the traditional Medicare program has tightly limited telemedicine payments to certain rural areas. And even there, the beneficiary must already be at a clinic, a rule that often defeats the goal of making care more convenient.\n\nCongress has maintained such restrictions out of concern that the service might increase Medicare expenses. The Congressional Budget Office and other analysts have said giving seniors access to doctors online will encourage them to use more services, not replace costly visits to emergency rooms and urgent care centers.\n\nIn 2012, the latest year for which data are available, Medicare paid about $5 million for telemedicine services \u2014 barely a blip compared with the program\u2019s total spending of $466 billion, according to a study in the journal Telemedicine.\n\n\u201cThe very advantage of telehealth, its ability to make care convenient, is also potentially its Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d Ateev Mehrotra, a Rand Corp. analyst, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last year. \u201cTelehealth may be \u2018too convenient.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut the telemedicine industry says letting more beneficiaries get care online would reduce doctor visits and emergency care. Industry officials as well as the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and other health experts say it\u2019s time for Congress to expand use of telemedicine in Medicare.\n\nPopular Outside Medicare\n\n\u201cThere is no question that telemedicine is going to be an increasingly important portal for doctors and other providers to stay connected with patients,\u201d former Surgeon General Richard Carmona said in an interview.\n\nSome health experts say it\u2019s disappointing that most seniors can\u2019t take advantage of the benefit that many of their children have.\n\n\u201cMedicare beneficiaries are paying a huge price\u201d for not having this benefit, said Jay Wolfson, a professor of public health, medicine and pharmacy at the University of South Florida in Tampa. For example, he said, telemedicine could help seniors with follow-up appointments that might be missed because of transportation problems.\n\nAetna and UnitedHealthcare cover telemedicine services for members younger than 65, regardless of whether enrollees live in the city or in the country.\n\nAbout 37 percent of large employers said that they expect to offer their employees a telemedicine benefit this year, according to a survey last year by Towers Watson, an employee benefits firm. About 800,000 online medical consultations will be done in 2015, according to the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group.\n\nMedicare\u2019s tight lid on telemedicine is showing signs of changing. In addition to Medicare Advantage plans, several Medicare accountable care organizations, or ACOs \u2014 groups of doctors and hospitals that coordinate patient care for at least 5,000 enrollees \u2014 have begun using the service.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans have the option to offer telemedicine without the tight restrictions in the traditional Medicare program because they are paid a fixed amount by the federal government to care for seniors. As a result, Medicare is not directly paying for the telemedicine services; instead, the services are paid for through plan revenue.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress are also considering broadening the use of telemedicine; some of them tried unsuccessfully to add such provisions to the recent law that revamped Medicare doctor payment rules and to the House bill that seeks to streamline drug approvals.\n\n\u2018Changing This Dynamic\u2019\n\nThis year, Medicare expanded telemedicine coverage for mental health services and annual wellness visits \u2014 when done in certain rural areas and when the patient is at a doctor\u2019s office or health clinic.\n\n\u201cMedicare . . . is still laboring under a number of limitations that disincentivize telemedicine use,\u201d said Jonathan Neufeld, clinical director of the Upper Midwest Telehealth Resource Center, an Indiana-based consortium of organizations involved in telemedicine. \u201cBut ACOs and other alternative payment methods have the possibility of changing this dynamic.\u201d\n\nAARP wants Congress to allow all Medicare beneficiaries to have coverage for telemedicine services, said Andrew Scholnick, a senior legislative representative for the lobbying group. \u201cWe would like to see a broader use of this service,\u201d he said. He stressed that AARP prefers that Medicare patients use telemedicine in conjunction with seeing their regular doctor.\n\nThe American Medical Association has endorsed congressional efforts to change Medicare\u2019s policy on telemedicine, as has the American Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cWe see the potential for it . . . to improve quality and lower costs,\u201d said Robert Wergin, president of the academy and a family doctor in Milford, Neb. He said such technology can help patients who are disabled or don\u2019t have easy transportation to the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nAnthem, which provides its telemedicine option to about 350,000 Medicare Advantage members in 12 states, expects the system to improve care and make it more affordable. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the consumer experience and giving consumers convenience to be able to be face to face with a doctor in less than 10 minutes, 365 days a year,\u201d said John Jesser, an Anthem vice president. Anthem provides the service at no extra charge to its Medicare Advantage members.\n\nWhile seniors are more likely to have more complicated health issues, telemedicine for them is no riskier than for younger patients, said Mia Finkelston, a family physician in Leonardtown, Md., who works with American Well, a firm that provides the technology behind Livehealth.com. That\u2019s because the online doctors know when they can handle health issues and know when to advise people to seek an in-person visit or head to the emergency room, she said.\n\n\u201cOur intent is not to replace their primary care physician, but to augment their care,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Donna Miles didn\u2019t feel like getting dressed and driving to her physician\u2019s office or to a retailer\u2019s health clinic near her Cincinnati home.
