And he\u2019s physical. Plus, I really believe that he brings great leadership to our team. Guys like Holden, (Tyson) Barrie, (Zach) Redmond, they look up to him. When we made the trade, I was pretty excited to have a guy like him and I think it\u2019s a good step in the right direction to make our defense better.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Roy responded to a question about Barrie with a spirited defense of, and praise for, Stuart, who came to the Avalanche in a trade with San Jose last summer for two draft choices and later was signed to a two-year contract extension that ties him up through 2016-17. So Roy\u2019s comments Saturday, in response to a question about Stuart and Holden\u2019s role as a pairing, was a followup to that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played a lot together this year and I think we\u2019re at a point where we understand each other\u2019s games without having to necessarily talk about it all the time,\u201d Stuart said Saturday morning. \u201cThe only difference lately is that we\u2019ve been playing against the other team\u2019s top line, but I\u2019m still killing penalties and doing a lot of the same things. It\u2019s just playing against different players a little more consistently. \u2026 I\u2019m at a point where I know my game, I know what I bring to the table and what I don\u2019t bring to the table and I just try and keep it simple and consistent and bring the same things every night.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche also showed considerable faith in Holden, who is making $600,000 this season. Colorado last summer also signed him to a three-year, $4.95 million extension, taking him through 2017-18.\n\nHolden said Saturday of the pairing going against top lines: \u201cI don\u2019t think things have changed much. Obviously, you have to be a little more responsible, thinking about D coverage because if you press a little bit too much, their top players will make you pay. Besides that, I think Stewie and I have done a good job of playing against top lines and trying to move pucks to your forwards, getting the puck of our D-zone so the top lines can\u2019t play in our zone. It\u2019s a great challenge every night and kind of an honor because you always want to push yourself to be the best you can be.\u201d\n\nAt 73 points, Colorado will go into Saturday\u2019s games six points behind Los Angeles, which is in the final wild-card spot in the West. Dallas (74), San Jose (76) and Winnipeg (78) are between the Avalanche and Kings, making this more than a chase of one team for Colorado.\n\nAfter facing the Flames, the Avalanche has the next five at Arizona, Anaheim, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brad Stuart, Nick Holden facing Avalanche opponents\u2019 top lines", "title": "Brad Stuart, Nick Holden facing Avalanche opponents\u2019 top lines", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/14/brad-stuart-nick-holden-facing-avalanche-opponents-top-lines/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314_122902_brad-stuart.jpg", "height": 499}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314_122902_brad-stuart.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-14T12:28:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:05:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05af\"", "article_summary": "Holden said Saturday of the pairing going against top lines: \u201cI don\u2019t think things have changed much.\n\u201cI knew what they could do, and that\u2019s the reason we went after Brad Stuart in the offseason,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said after Colorado\u2019s morning skate.\nAfter facing the Flames, the Avalanche has the next five at Arizona, Anaheim, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.\nSo Roy\u2019s comments Saturday, in response to a question about Stuart and Holden\u2019s role as a pairing, was a followup to that.\nDallas (74), San Jose (76) and Winnipeg (78) are between the Avalanche and Kings, making this more than a chase of one team for Colorado."}
