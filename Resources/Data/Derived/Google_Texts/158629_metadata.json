They will make decisions in the coming days.\u201d\n\nAccording to a CNN/ORC poll, 71 percent of Americans believe keeping the government open is more important than defunding Planed Parenthood.\n\nCongress faced a similar situation in 2013, when it chose to shut down the government over a continuing resolution that attached funding for Obamacare to the legislation.\n\nSeveral members who voted against the CR said they regretted their decision shortly after.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows said in a 2014 interview with the Citizen-Times that he would have gone with a different strategy to address the situation.\n\nA source from Meadows\u2019 office said the congressman is weighing his options while working with a handful of moderate Republicans on different strategies to avert closing down the government while staying committed to conservative principles.\n\nOne option under consideration is budget reconciliation, a rare measure that cannot be filibustered by the upper chamber. Reconciliation can only be used once a year and allows a bill to be passed on to the executive branch with just a majority vote in the House and Senate.\n\nNearly 80 Democrats sent a letter to the House speaker calling for Congress to stay in session until it hammers out a plan to prevent the government form closing.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
