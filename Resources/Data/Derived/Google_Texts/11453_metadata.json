The administration announced on June 26 that those currently enrolled would be automatically renewed in the same plan for 2015. There is a growing concern this will cause many who received subsidies through the federal exchange to see sharp rises in after-subsidy insurance premiums due to the way subsidies are calculated.\n\n\u201cMany who are auto-enrolled will end up paying more than they needed to for coverage because they will not realize that last year\u2019s best choice won\u2019t be this year\u2019s best choice\u2014either because HealthCare.gov has failed to educate them on this point or because they don\u2019t have hours to squander on the Exchange trying to make price comparisons,\u201d explained Christopher Conover, PhD, a Research Scholar at Duke University\u2019s Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research.\n\nAutomatic Renewal = Automatic Premium Increase?\n\nThe automatic renewal of plans for people already enrolled through the federal exchange was intended to allow greater focus on enrolling the uninsured as well as easing pressure on the Healthcare.gov web site, which suffered catastrophic failure when it first launched in October 2013.\n\nBut many people who do nothing and allow their plans to be automatically renewed will likely face a substantial increase in what they have to pay. Subsidies for plans sold through the exchanges are determined according to a person\u2019s income and the premium of the second-lowest \u2018silver\u2019 level plan available in each market, called the benchmark plan.\n\nThe 2014 benchmark plan in most states will be replaced with a different benchmark plan in 2015, some of which have lower premiums than the 2014 plan. At the same time, most of the 2014 benchmark plans have higher premiums in 2015. This combination will lead to much higher out-of-pocket costs for many of those who are auto-enrolled in the same plan, as the Obama administration intends to do.\n\nFor example, in Indiana the 2014 benchmark plan for the Indianapolis area was from Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield, with a monthly premium of $354 for a 40-year old. In 2015 the same plan will cost approximately $363 according to rate approval information available on the Indiana Department of Insurance web site.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what will be the benchmark plan in 2015 but it won\u2019t be Anthem\u2019s. Two other insurers offering coverage in the Indianapolis region, CareSource and Coordinated Care, have both filed rates for silver plans lower than Anthem. Writing in the Indiana Business Journal on September 12, reporter JK Wall noted that depending on which plans are offered and what the final approved rates are, \u201cthe value of tax credits available in the exchange could fall by $20 to $90 per month.\u201d\n\nIf the value drops by $90, then someone automatically re-enrolled in the 2014 benchmark plan from Anthem could see their monthly premium skyrocket by nearly $100 or more once the premium increase for the former benchmark plan is included.\n\nCritics fault auto-enrollment plan\n\n\u201cEvery time the Obama administration has changed the law to make it less onerous for consumers \u2013 like automatic re-enrollment \u2013 it winds up creating new pitfalls for consumers. In this case, millions of consumers could face higher premium and out-of-pocket costs because the plan they selected for this year might not qualify for extra subsidies next year,\u201d said Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a market-oriented health policy think tank located in Alexandria, Virginia. \u201cThe law\u2019s endless administrative complexity shows the impossibility of trying to centrally plan one-sixth of the economy. We need to put the market and consumers in charge of choices, not bureaucrats, politicians, and regulators.\u201d\n\nSome point out that the auto-enrollment plan goes against the idea that people should be actively involved in the selection of their own health insurance plans. \u201cA passive auto re-enrollment can be useful, but we shouldn\u2019t coddle consumers,\u201d said Yevgeniy Feyman, a health policy fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cIf we want patients to be good consumers when it comes to purchasing health insurance, some level of administrative burden will be necessary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Automatic renewal = automatic premium increase?", "title": "Obamacare auto-renewal plan could cause costs to soar | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/485332969.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/09/22/obamacare-auto-renewal-plan-could-cause-costs-to-soar/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Automatic renewal = automatic premium increase?", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/485332969.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Automatic renewal = automatic premium increase?"}}, "article_summary": "The 2014 benchmark plan in most states will be replaced with a different benchmark plan in 2015, some of which have lower premiums than the 2014 plan.\nIt\u2019s unclear what will be the benchmark plan in 2015 but it won\u2019t be Anthem\u2019s.\nThe administration announced on June 26 that those currently enrolled would be automatically renewed in the same plan for 2015.\n\u201cIf we want patients to be good consumers when it comes to purchasing health insurance, some level of administrative burden will be necessary.\u201d\nSubsidies for plans sold through the exchanges are determined according to a person\u2019s income and the premium of the second-lowest \u2018silver\u2019 level plan available in each market, called the benchmark plan."}
