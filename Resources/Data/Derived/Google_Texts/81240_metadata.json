A sister gave birth to her children there. A medical resident was proud to say he works there and lives in Brooklyn. A registered nurse told me she said she doesn\u2019t know what her patients would do without SUNY Downstate/UHB.\n\nThey made it abundantly obvious the role this hospital plays in the health, well-being and economy of Brooklyn, as its fourth-largest employer. Less obvious but equally important is its role as a source of physicians for all of New York.\n\nNew York has some of the nation\u2019s best schools of medicine, anchored in some of its best hospitals. But the Affordable Care Act challenges our medical system to rethink how to provide quality, affordable, accessible medical care to current and future patients.\n\nAll of this is taking place in the context of painful financial realities facing public hospitals like SUNY Downstate/UHB that cater to low-income families. Many years of underpayment have left these institutions without reserves, the ability to be flexible when the number of in-patients declines or the ability to find funding absent state assistance.\n\nThere is a path that would help secure this vital institution and put New York in a leadership position in graduate medical education: Modernizing and transforming the hospital, including the way it trains medical residents.\n\nSUNY Downstate, the only medical school in Brooklyn, and its teaching hospital, UHB, are jewels, serving 2.5 million people. The hospital trains nearly 1,000 medical residents at any given time \u2014 and graduates the largest number of minority doctors in the country. They typically go on to serve the medically underserved.\n\nThe problem, simply put, is that SUNY Downstate/UHB, like so many other hospitals around the country, has too many expenses on the in-patient side of the ledger and not enough revenue on the out-patient side.\n\nPhysicians at SUNY Downstate/UHB, some of whom are AFT members, have come up with a sensible, innovative way to address this situation. The hospital would remain an in-patient facility \u2014 but would also train physicians in several new, comprehensive ambulatory care centers throughout Brooklyn.\n\nThese centers would provide team-based care that would be well-staffed, well-equipped and capable of coordinating high volumes of patients with enough sophistication to deal with both acute and chronic conditions.\n\nThis not only would provide more accessible healthcare throughout Brooklyn \u2014 but would move medical education into the 21st century and provide just the kind of training future doctors need.\n\nNow is the perfect time to consider this new model for graduate medical education. SUNY Downstate\u2019s acquisition of Long Island College Hospital turned out to be a bad financial investment. With the imminent sale of LICH, SUNY Downstate has a real chance to get on economic sound footing \u2014 and to set an example for other struggling hospitals.\n\nYou can\u2019t change the way medicine is practiced and the way services are provided without changing the way doctors are trained. It just won\u2019t work. The education of physicians depends on having teaching hospitals linked to schools of medicine. And it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked that New York gets about $2 billion in federal funds to train doctors \u2014 money that should be used to train 21st-century physicians in 21st-century facilities.\n\nSaving and investing in SUNY Downstate/UHB and providing additional care throughout the Brooklyn community is the right prescription for reclaiming the promise of quality healthcare for the Brooklyn community.\n\nWeingarten is president of the American Federation of Teachers.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Randi Weingarten", "twitter": {"description": "Weingarten: After the Brooklyn rally last Sunday, where hundreds of people pleaded for the state to save and invest in SUNY Downstate\u2019s University Hospital of Brooklyn, I was swarmed by folks who wanted to tell me stories about what the hospital has meant to them.", "title": "Nursing a hospital back to health", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/nursing-hospital-back-health-article-1.1722043", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1722042.1394829950!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/weingarten16e-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Randi Weingarten", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-16T08:20:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/nursing-hospital-back-health-article-1.1722043", "parsely-title": "Nursing a hospital back to health", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-16T04:20:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Nursing a hospital back to health", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1722042.1394829950!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/weingarten16e-1-web.jpg", "description": "Weingarten: After the Brooklyn rally last Sunday, where hundreds of people pleaded for the state to save and invest in SUNY Downstate\u2019s University Hospital of Brooklyn, I was swarmed by folks who wanted to tell me stories about what the hospital has meant to them.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Weingarten: After the Brooklyn rally last Sunday, where hundreds of people pleaded for the state to save and invest in SUNY Downstate\u2019s University Hospital of Brooklyn, I was swarmed by folks who wanted to tell me stories about what the hospital has meant to them.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Weingarten: After the Brooklyn rally last Sunday, where hundreds of people pleaded for the state to save and invest in SUNY Downstate\u2019s University Hospital of Brooklyn, I was swarmed by folks who wanted to tell me stories about what the hospital has meant to them.", "title": "Nursing a hospital back to health", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/nursing-hospital-back-health-article-1.1722043", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1722042.1394829950!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/weingarten16e-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Randi Weingarten", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1722042.1394829950!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/weingarten16e-1-web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfdaa\"", "article_summary": "They made it abundantly obvious the role this hospital plays in the health, well-being and economy of Brooklyn, as its fourth-largest employer.\nA registered nurse told me she said she doesn\u2019t know what her patients would do without SUNY Downstate/UHB.\nSUNY Downstate, the only medical school in Brooklyn, and its teaching hospital, UHB, are jewels, serving 2.5 million people.\nThe hospital would remain an in-patient facility \u2014 but would also train physicians in several new, comprehensive ambulatory care centers throughout Brooklyn.\nBut the Affordable Care Act challenges our medical system to rethink how to provide quality, affordable, accessible medical care to current and future patients."}
