Using the Hubble Space Telescope, two teams of scientists found faint but clear signatures of water in the atmospheres of five exoplanets. All five are so-called \u2018hot Jupiters,\u2019 massive worlds that orbit close to their host stars.\n\n'); } //-->\n\n\u201cTo actually detect the atmosphere of an exoplanet is extraordinarily difficult. But we were able to pull out a very clear signal, and it is water,\u201d said Drake Deming from the University of Maryland, who led a study characterizing the atmospheres of two of the five planets.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that we see a water signature for multiple planets,\u201d said Avi Mandell, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, and lead author of another paper on the remaining three exoplanets. \u201cThis work really opens the door for comparing how much water is present in atmospheres on different kinds of exoplanets, for example hotter versus cooler ones.\u201d\n\nThe five planets are all well-studied, and would not be friendly places for life as we know it \u2014 with blazing temperatures and unusual conditions. WASP-17b is an unusual planet in a retrograde orbit, and sodium had already been detected in its atmosphere.\n\nHD209458b is much-studied windy world, with raging storms, and organic molecules and water had already been detected on this planet in previous studies.\n\nThe atmosphere of WASP-12b already has been found to hold vast amounts of carbon as well as water. WASP-19b orbits a nearby star, and has one of the shortest orbital periods of any known planetary body, about 0.7888399 days or approximately 18.932 hours. XO-1b has the distinction of being discovered by amateur astronomers\n\nThe astronomers involved in the new studies say the strengths of the water signatures in each world varied, with WASP-17b and HD209458b having the strongest signals.\n\nCurrently, studying exoplanet atmospheres can be done when the planets are passing in front of their stars. Researchers can identify the gases in a planet\u2019s atmosphere by determining which wavelengths of the star\u2019s light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed. Deming\u2019s team employed a new technique with longer exposure times, which increased the sensitivity of their measurements.\n\nIn both studies, scientists used Hubble\u2019s Wide Field Camera 3 to explore the details of absorption of light through the planets\u2019 atmospheres. The observations were made in a range of infrared wavelengths where a pattern that signifies the presence of water would appear if water were present. The teams compared the shapes and intensities of the absorption profiles, and the consistency of the signatures gave them confidence they saw water.\n\n\u201cThese studies, combined with other Hubble observations, are showing us that there are a surprisingly large number of systems for which the signal of water is either attenuated or completely absent,\u201d said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology, a co-author on Deming\u2019s paper. \u201cThis suggests that cloudy or hazy atmospheres may in fact be rather common for hot Jupiters.\u201d\n\nRead the teams paper: Deming et al, Mandell et al.\n\nSources: HubbleSite, University of Maryland.\n\n'); } //-->\n\nRelated\n\nBy Nancy Atkinson -\n\nNancy Atkinson is currently Universe Today's Contributing Editor.
