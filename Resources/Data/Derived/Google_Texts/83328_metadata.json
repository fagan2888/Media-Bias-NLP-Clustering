They graduated from George Mason University at age 19, earning them a profile in The Washington Post. Since then they have reportedly been trying to make a name for themselves in both the hacking and computer security worlds. That is most likely what landed them in such hot water.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Eastern Virginia Department of Justice, the district attorney plans to prove that the brothers hacked into a cosmetic company's network and stole private credit-card data.\n\nThey allegedly used these credentials to \"purchase goods and services, including flights, hotel reservations, and attendance at professional conferences.\"\n\nTargeting government computers\n\nAnd their alleged cybercrime ring goes even deeper. The indictment, which was filed late last week, weaves a long and bizarre tale in which the brothers are accused of planning to break in to computers at the State Department to access private information.\n\nSohaib was assigned to a contract position inside the State Department, the indictment reads. This reportedly gave him access to a government web program called \"Lockbox,\" which \"performs payment processing, scanning of applications, and initial data entry for US passport applications.\"\n\nGiven this access, the brothers allegedly hatched a detailed plan. They, along with other accused co-conspirators, \"engaged in a series of computer intrusions and attempted computer intrusions against the State Department to obtain sensitive passport and visa information and other related and valuable information about State Department computer systems,\" according to the indictment.\n\nAdditionally, Sohaib supposedly had plans to set up a physical device somewhere inside the State Department\u2019s building. This device, a small computer called a \"gumstix,\" would provide remote access to State Department computers.\n\nThe two allegedly brought on other co-conspirators to help facilitate these operations, two of whom are quoted in the indictment but not named or charged.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that the brother considered selling the private data they obtained from State Department computers \u2014 including the passport information of a Homeland Security special agent \u2014 on marketplaces on the dark web.\n\nHacking whiz kids\n\nThe Akhters were originally suspected of foul play by the authorities last year when Muneeb boasted about being able to receive unlimited funds from gift cards through his hacking finesse. This story was later said to be fabricated by Muneeb. The new indictment, however, says Muneeb's hacking tale was meant as a rouse to cover up his deeper and more nefarious cybercrimes.\n\nEven after being questioned by authorities last July, both brothers were able to obtain high-level cyber-related positions. Muneeb accepted a job last October with the defense contractor Booz-Allen Hamilton.\n\nThe investigation has reportedly been ongoing for months, beginning with the initial claims that Muneeb had hacked gift cards.\n\nIf convicted, Sohaib could face as much as 39 years in prison, with 59 for Muneeb.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Cale Guthrie Weissman", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "If convicted, they could face decades in prison.", "creator": "caleweissman", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/akhter-hackers-arrested-by-doj-2015-5", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/554929e66da8115905347b37-506-253/23-year-old-twins-allegedly-tried-to-rip-off-the-state-department-and-sell-a-bunch-of-passport-data.jpg", "title": "23-year-old twins allegedly tried to rip off the State Department and sell a bunch of passport data", "site": "sai", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "sai,law,defense", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Hackers, State Department, Passport, Department of Justice, Cale Guthrie Weissman", "description": "If convicted, they could face decades in prison.", "author": "Cale Guthrie Weissman", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-06", "sailthru.title": "23-year-old twins allegedly tried to rip off the State Department and sell a bunch of passport data", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5548ee6feab8ea9b08f3a0b0-50-50/23-year-old-twins-allegedly-tried-to-rip-off-the-state-department-and-sell-a-bunch-of-passport-data.jpg", "news_keywords": "Hackers, State Department, Passport, Department of Justice, Cale Guthrie Weissman", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5548ee6feab8ea9b08f3a0b0/23-year-old-twins-allegedly-tried-to-rip-off-the-state-department-and-sell-a-bunch-of-passport-data.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-05-06", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/cale-guthrie-weissman"}, "sailthru.description": "If convicted, they could face decades in prison.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "If convicted, they could face decades in prison.", "title": "23-year-old twins allegedly tried to rip off the State Department and sell a bunch of passport data", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/akhter-hackers-arrested-by-doj-2015-5", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/554929e66da8115905347b37-1190-625/23-year-old-twins-allegedly-tried-to-rip-off-the-state-department-and-sell-a-bunch-of-passport-data.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "23-year-old twins allegedly tried to rip off the State Department and sell a bunch of passport data", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5548ee6feab8ea9b08f3a0b0/23-year-old-twins-allegedly-tried-to-rip-off-the-state-department-and-sell-a-bunch-of-passport-data.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "sai"}, "article_summary": "Muneeb and Sohaib Akhter are twin 23-year-old computer whizzes who live in Springfield, Virginia.\nThis device, a small computer called a \"gumstix,\" would provide remote access to State Department computers.\nSohaib was assigned to a contract position inside the State Department, the indictment reads.\nSince then they have reportedly been trying to make a name for themselves in both the hacking and computer security worlds.\nThe investigation has reportedly been ongoing for months, beginning with the initial claims that Muneeb had hacked gift cards."}
