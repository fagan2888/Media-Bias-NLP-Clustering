Hansen was the state runner-up in the event, and the 200 individual medley as well. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 By all accounts, Brooke Hansen is the most decorated girls swimmer to come through the halls of Loveland High School.\n\nHer first swim in an individual event as an Indian was in a school-record time. Her last swim in an individual event as an Indian was in a school-record time. In between, Hansen broke and rebroke all of her eight individual records. She has been a transcendent talent for four years.\n\nIn her farewell weekend donning the red and black, the senior had a mixed bag of results by her lofty standards. At the 5A State Swimming and Diving Championships at the Edora Pool Ice Center in Fort Collins, Hansen was the state runner-up in two events, the 200-yard individual medley and the 100 freestyle.\n\nWhile the soon-to-be Texas Longhorn had an eye on blistering times more than state crowns in her final go around, the fierce competitor admittedly walked away wanting more.\n\n\"The IM I wanted to win of course, but you just learn from it,\" Hansen reflected. \"I knew going into the 100 free it was going to be a close race.\"\n\nIn the 200 IM, Fossil Ridge senior Bailey Nero shot off the blocks and took a lead she never relinquished while winning in a blistering time of 1:59.20. She became only the third girl in Colorado history to swim sub 2-minutes in the event. Hansen, the defending IM champion, wanted to go sub-2 herself, but settled for second in 2:01.58. She did break her own city record by .10 and posted another All-American mark though.\n\nThen in the 100 freestyle, Hansen dropped a time of 49.97, becoming the first city girl to ever clip 50 seconds. Her mark was the fifth fastest in Colorado history for any classification and was another All-American time. But, once again, runner-up was in the cards as ThunderRidge's Annie Ochitwa, the 2015 5A swimmer of the year, went 49.60, the second fastest time ever behind only Missy Franklin.\n\nLoveland coach Sharra Schleiger knew the showdown between Ochitwa and Hansen had a chance at being unforgettable.\n\nLoveland's Kelly Hatanaka swims in the 500-yard freestyle finals during the Class 5A State Swimming and Diving Championships at the Edora Pool Ice Center in Fort Collins. Hatanaka placed sixth (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"Coaches and officials were actually coming up to me and saying, 'your girls look good,\" Schleiger said. \"The funny part was that they were all saying that they were looking forward to the 100 free. She went a 49 and that's what we wanted to see. We said at conference that if she goes 49, everybody wins.\"\n\nDespite a championship Saturday that was both spectacular and, at times, frustrating for Hansen, the senior walks away with quite a resume for the Indians.\n\n\"She left some pretty big shoes to fill,\" Schleiger said. \"Not only did she set that leadership standard high and she left big shoes to fill with her races and her speed and her talent, but also the face she has given to Loveland High swimming is great.\"\n\nKelly Hatanaka, another senior with impressive credentials and a long-time presence in the Loveland lineup, placed sixth in the 200 IM and came within a few seconds, for the second straight day, of breaking Hansen's 500 freestyle school record time of 5:05. In the championship finals, Hatanaka's 5:07.34 earned her sixth place in that event, as well.\n\n\"Kelly had some big shoes with the name Hatanaka with what her brothers accomplished,\" Schleiger noted. \"She definitely kept that name loud and proud for Loveland High School swimming.\"\n\nThe Indians won the consolation finals of the 200-medley relay in 1:49.85, a season best. They also placed 10th in the 400-yard freestyle relay in another season tops of 3:35.04.\n\nLoveland placed in the top 10 as a team for the fourth consecutive season with a seventh-place showing. Fossil Ridge won the title in dominant fashion.\n\nBrock Laue: twitter.com/BrockLaue\n\n5A State Swimming and Diving Championships\n\nAt EPIC\n\nTeam scores \u2014 1.
