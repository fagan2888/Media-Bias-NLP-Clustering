Once a sitting congressman has declared embryology and evolution to be \u201clies straight from the pit of Hell,\u201d offered an AR-15 rifle as a sweepstakes giveaway for campaign supporters, labeled President Obama a Marxist and called for the president\u2019s impeachment, it\u2019s hard to ignore the crazy tag in the Acela corridor.\n\nBut to write off Paul Broun as a factor in the race to fill Georgia\u2019s open Senate seat is to misunderstand both the doctor-turned-congressman and the state he is trying to represent.\n\nWhile Georgia\u2019s changing demographics may be sending the state toward more purple-than-red territory eventually, it remains decidedly Republican (with no statewide Democratic officials), deeply religious, and dominated by so many Tea Party groups that candidates often complain they can\u2019t keep track of them all.\n\nEnter U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Paul Broun, who also has deep ties to Tea Party groups and a voting record so conservative that the Club for Growth named him its No. 1 Defender of Freedom in all of Congress. Not to mention his religious conviction as a strong born-again Christian saw him declaring on the floor of the House that \u201cthe Holy Bible is true, it is literal, and it is God\u2019s direction for all of us.\u201d (See \u201cpit of Hell\u201d above for Broun\u2019s biblical interpretation of evolution.)\n\nWith three months left to go until the state\u2019s Republican primary, Broun (pronounced \u201cBrown\u201d) is badly underfunded, yet still sitting near (but not at the top) of several polls that show none of the candidates in the crowded Republican field breaking away from the pack.\n\nA poll of likely GOP primary voters released Tuesday shows Rep. Phil Gingrey leading with 19 percent support. Former secretary of state Karen Handel ranks second with 14 percent, while Broun places third with 13 percent. The remaining candidates, including Rep. Jack Kingston, trail behind for now.\n\nBut that same poll, which was commissioned by Citizens United\u2019s PAC and conducted by the Polling Company, also reveals important details about who the GOP primary voters are likely to be in May: 82 percent self-identify as conservative, with 48 percent calling themselves \u201cvery conservative.\u201d Of all of the candidates, Broun was picked as \u201cthe most conservative candidate in the race.\u201d And a significant majority, 62 percent, said they want the next Senator from Georgia \u201cto work closely with Sen. Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf an electorate is looking for a Ted Cruz compadre, it wouldn\u2019t have to look much further than Broun, who sponsored the bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act; declares \u201cno room for compromise\u201d on the Second Amendment; and boasts a Washington office so full of taxidermy he shot himself that it\u2019s been called a \u201ccross between a zoo and a pet cemetery.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith Georgia conservatives on the hunt for one of their own, Republican Party insiders are increasingly worried that the outspoken Broun could run a competitive race against the better funded, more business friendly candidates like Rep. Jack Kingston or businessman David Perdue. If Broun were to win, Republicans worry he\u2019d lose to likely Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn, whose father, Sam Nunn, represented Georgia in the Senate for 24 years.\n\nEven if Broun doesn\u2019t win the primary, party strategists worry he\u2019s hurting Republicans in the process. \u201cThe concern is that he could pull the whole field to the right,\u201d said a long-time Republican fundraiser.\n\nThat worry came to fruition Monday when Broun, days after declaring he would vote to impeach the President, issued a statement taking the other candidates to task for not doing the same. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand, is how a candidate can claim to be a proven conservative, and yet if such a resolution was brought up for a vote, they would oppose it,\u201d he said. Last year, Broun hammered Kingston for saying he wanted to fix Obamacare, but stopped short of calling for its repeal.\n\nDebbie Dooley, an original Tea Party founder based in Georgia who is not endorsing a Senate candidate, rejects the doomsday scenarios that Washington Republicans are painting of Broun\u2019s chances in a general election.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an external misreading of the state,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cFor over a year, Karl Rove and the Republican establishment told us that Mitt Romney would win the presidency, that he was the only one who could beat Barack Obama, and look how that turned out.\u201d\n\nDooley says Tea Partiers in the state appear to be coalescing around two candidates: Karen Handel and Paul Broun, with most of the support going to Broun. Dooley describes Broun as \u201cvery friendly, not at all elitist\u201d and very, very conservative.\n\n\u201cIf he were the nominee I think he would definitely be elected. I think they would all be elected. The only candidate who would be unacceptable is Michelle Nunn,\u201d Dooley said.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!
