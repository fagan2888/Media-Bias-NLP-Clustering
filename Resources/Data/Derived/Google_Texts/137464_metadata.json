Col. Joni Ernst on Saturday blasted Obamacare and out-of-control government spending just hours before she deployed for two weeks of duty with the Iowa National Guard.\n\nIn the GOP weekly address, Ms. Ernst, the Republican candidate for Iowa\u2019s U.S. Senate seat, touted her military service and took pointed shots at the \u201cliberals\u201d in Washington and elsewhere across the country.\n\nMs. Ernst will face off against Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in the race to fill the retiring Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s seat.\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\n\u201cThe problem with America today is that Washington is full of liberals who think government is the solution to every problem. They think that nothing can be solved unless Washington is involved,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so they grow our government, every year making it more intrusive and more involved in our lives. Today, government tells us what doctors to see, what kind of light bulbs to use, and in some places, even how much soda we can drink.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csoda\u201d comment apparently is a reference to New York City\u2019s failed attempt to ban large soft drinks. The proposed ban has been thrown out by a judge.\n\nMs. Ernst also cited her military service in taking aim at the \u201cbureaucracy\u201d inside the Veterans Affairs Department.\n\n\u201cPart of that bureaucracy is failing our veterans, and the stories we\u2019ve heard about the failures of the VA are heartbreaking.\u201d she said. \u201cAs an active member of the Iowa National Guard and the wife of a retired U.S. Army ranger, I believe this isn\u2019t a partisan issue. It\u2019s an American problem that must be solved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lt. Col.
