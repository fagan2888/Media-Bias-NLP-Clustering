This Season of Unreason will end with the elections of November 2016, but its consequences \u2013 validation of the idea that belief without evidence is a virtue, that religion, and especially Christianity, deserves a place in our politics, our Constitutionally enshrined secularism notwithstanding \u2013 will live on and damage the progressive cause.\n\nBut it does not have to be this way.\n\nThere will almost certainly be no (declared) atheist or even agnostic among the candidates. This is scandalous, given the electorate\u2019s gradual, relentless ditching of religion. A survey just out shows that 7.5 million Americans have abandoned their faith since 2012, the year of the Pew Research Center poll that established that one out of five have no religious affiliation. Nonbelief is trending, and among a sizable, growing demographic.\n\nProfessing belief in a fictitious celestial deity says a lot about the content of a person\u2019s character, and what sort of policies he or she would likely favor. So, we should take a look at those who have announced so far, and what sort of religious views they hold. Let\u2019s start with the Republicans. Rand Paul, the eye-surgeon senator from Kentucky, is officially a \u201cdevout\u201d Christian, but he has subtly hinted that he really does not believe. He finds it tough to see \u201cGod\u2019s hand\u201d in the suffering he encounters as a doctor, citing an example any New Atheist could have chosen to dispel the notion that a benevolent deity watches over humanity: \u201csmall children dying from brain tumors.\u201d This gives Paul to wonder if one needs to be \u201csaved more than once,\u201d which implies his faith has failed him at times. Nevertheless, he says, he always does \u201ccome back\u201d to Jesus. He closed his announcement speech asking for \u201cGod\u2019s help\u201d in getting elected. Whether he meant it, we don\u2019t really know.\n\nWith the dapper Florida Sen. Marco Rubio we move into the more disturbing category of Republicans we might charitably diagnose as \u201cfaith-deranged\u201d \u2013 in other words, as likely to do fine among the unwashed \u201ccrazies\u201d in the red-state primaries, but whose religious beliefs would (or should) render them unfit for civilized company anywhere else.\n\nAmong the faith-deranged, Rubio stands out. He briefly dumped one magic book for another, converting from Roman Catholicism to Mormonism and then back again. (Reporters take note: This is faith-fueled flip-flopping, which surely indicates a damning character flaw to be investigated. Flip-flopping of a different sort helped sink John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid.) Yet even as a re-minted Catholic, Rubio cheats on the Pope with a megachurch in Miami called Christ Fellowship. As religion and politics blogger Bruce Wilson points out, Christ Fellowship is a hotbed of \u201cdemonology and exorcism, Young Earth creationism, and denial of evolution,\u201d and is so intolerant it demands its prospective employees certify they are not \u201cpracticing homosexuals\u201d and don\u2019t cheat on their spouses. (Check out its manifesto under \u201cAbout Us \u2013 What We Believe.\u201d) As regards evolution, Rubio confesses that he\u2019s \u201cnot a scientist\u201d and so cannot presume to judge the fact of evolution on its merits, and holds that creationism should be taught in schools as just one of many \u201cmultiple theories\u201d about our origins.\n\nThough he magnanimously acknowledges that atheists \u201chave a right to not believe in God,\u201d Rubio has called the Almighty the \u201csource of all we have,\u201d and, worse, stated that \u201cour national motto is \u2018In God We Trust,\u2019\u201d which reminds us that \u201cfaith in our Creator is the most important American value of all.\u201d According to this logic, atheists are not fully \u201cAmerican.\u201d Rubio also believes \u201cYou cannot do anything without God,\u201d which he terms \u201ca profound and elemental truth.\u201d Stephen Hawking, the theoretical physicist known for, among other things, his far more profound and elemental accomplishments in melding the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, and, most recently, for publicly declaring his atheism, would beg to differ. It\u2019s a safe bet, in fact, that most scientists have a better grasp on the vital verities than anyone rummaging around in Rubio\u2019s beloved \u201csacred\u201d tome of far-fetched fiction and foolish figments.\n\nYet of the Republicans, the most flagrant irrationalist is clearly Texas junior Sen. Ted Cruz. For starters, Cruz pandered fulsomely to the faith-deranged by choosing to announce at Liberty University, that bastion of darkness located in Lynchburg, Virginia. Once administered by the late Jerry Falwell, Liberty promises a \u201cWorld Class Christian education\u201d and boasts that it has been \u201ctraining champions for Christ since 1971\u201d \u2013 grounds enough, in my view, to revoke the institution\u2019s charter and subject it to immediate quarantine until sanity breaks out.\n\nAllow me a brief yet significant digression. One wonders, in Cruz\u2019s case, if the malady of faith isn\u2019t acquired, but transmitted genetically. In 2013, his father, Rafael, an Evangelical pastor, spoke at a Second Amendment advocacy meeting in Oklahoma. He declared atheism amounts to a lack of moral absolutes. Hence, \u201cIf there\u2019s no god,\u201d then no moral absolutes can exist, \u201cand you can change the rules.\u201d This \u201cleads us to sexual immorality, leads us to sexual abuse, leads us to perversion, and of course, no hope!\u201d At least one of Ted Cruz\u2019s own direr musings \u2014 that gays are waging a \u201djihad . . . in Indiana and Arkansas, and going after people of faith who respect the biblical teaching that marriage is the union of one man and one woman\u201d \u2014 prompt the question: if Cruz is elected, will he classify homosexuality as terrorism and dispatch gay \u201cjihadis\u201d to Guantanamo?\n\nDuring his 31-minute announcement address, Cruz recounts how his once-truant dad found Jesus and returned home. Otherwise, peppering his talk with references to God, Cruz informs us he will restore a United States brought low under Obama\u2019s maleficent rein by uniting \u201cmillions of courageous conservatives\u201d who will rise up \u201ctogether to say in unison \u2018we demand our liberty!\u2019\u201d From whom, exactly? He doesn\u2019t say.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton all spout pious religious lies.
