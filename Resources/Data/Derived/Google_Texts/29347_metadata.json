Bevin was elected by a nine-point margin after campaigning on making Kentucky a right-to-work state.\n\nRepublicans control the Kentucky Senate, and the Democratic majority in the Kentucky House shrank to six when Louisville Rep. Denny Butler switched parties.\n\nKentucky Senate President Robert Stivers told the Louisville Courier-Journal more than a dozen other House Democrats have flirted with the idea of jumping ship. Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo is a firm opponent of right-to-work.\n\nBecause all of the House members hoping to remain in office are up for re-election next November, Bevin\u2019s big victory will loom over Democrats during the state legislative session starting Jan. 5.\n\nIn a right-to-work debate with Jim Waters of the free-market Bluegrass Institute on WEKU 88.9 after the election, Kentucky AFL-CIO president Bill Londrigan insisted forced union dues were necessary to cover unions\u2019 representation costs.\n\nCalling right-to-work \u201ca way for big business to try and strangle unions so we can make less wages and bargain less contracts,\u201d Londrigan suggested workers who don\u2019t want to be forced to pay unions should quit their jobs and find work with non-union employers.\n\nRight-to-work is \u201call about whether you can control the political system so you can turn back the clock on workers,\u201d said Londrigan \u2014 who was paid $77,079 in 2012, based on the latest available Kentucky AFL-CIO IRS return.\n\nAs part of the Kentucky AFL-CIO\u2019s efforts to bolster the Stumbo wing of the Kentucky House, the union federation is circulating an online petition mimicking Londrigan\u2019s accusations about right-to-work.\n\nSign the petition: STOP Matt Bevins \"Right to Work\" in Kentucky https://t.co/AhcKeTr5nH \u2014 Kentucky AFL-CIO (@aflcioky) November 17, 2015\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal of \u2018Right to Work\u2019 is to break unions so businesses can lower pay and benefits to workers,\u201d the petition claims. \u201cIt has nothing to do with your right to work!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes away benefits and opportunities from our family, pension, retirement, etc.,\u201d the petition to stop right-to-work continues.\n\nRight-to-work laws in no way prevent workers from organizing unions, joining unions or negotiating for pay and benefits. The creator of the petition did not respond to questions from Watchdog.org.\n\nRELATED: Labor bosses\u2019 big loss could bring right-to-work to Kentucky\n\nJulia Crigler, state director of free-market activist group Americans for Prosperity, told Watchdog.org right-to-work should be supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\n\u201cRight-to-work is supported by more than 58 percent of Kentuckians, on both sides of the aisle; lawmakers should be eager to support a policy that has popular support across party lines and is proven to grow jobs,\u201d Crigler said.\n\nIn an AFP Kentucky poll conducted in March, 80 percent of respondents said workers \u201cshould not be forced to join a union or pay dues to one they don\u2019t support.\u201d\n\nFrom January 1995 through August, six of the 10 states with the worst private-sector job growth were states without right-to-work laws. Indiana and Michigan \u2014 which both passed right-to-work in 2012 \u2014 were in the bottom 10, as well.\n\nThe seven states with the fastest private-sector job growth from January 1995 through August were all right-to-work states, a review of seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows.\n\nDuring the same period, Kentucky\u2019s job growth ranked 34th of the 50 states and Kentucky\u2019s labor force had the second-worst decline in the nation.\n\n\u201cFrankfort needs to realize that November was Kentuckians demanding more opportunity and if legislators cannot deliver pro-growth policies they should be prepared to play musical chairs, because seats will change,\u201d Crigler added.\n\nContrary to heated union rhetoric and warnings of political fallout for right-to-work backers, voters in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin have continued supporting lawmakers who helped pass right-to-work laws in each state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky labor leaders are trying to slow the state's momentum toward a right-to-work law that would let Kentuckians opt out of paying union dues.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Kentucky labor leaders are trying to slow the state's momentum toward a right-to-work law that would let Kentuckians opt out of paying union dues.", "title": "Kentucky labor unions try to slow right-to-work momentum - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/kentucky-aflcio-facebook-cecil-roberts-umwa-2015-10-22.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-30T08:31:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/248654/kentucky-unions-rtw/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Kentucky labor leaders are trying to slow the state's momentum toward a right-to-work law that would let Kentuckians opt out of paying union dues.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/kentucky-aflcio-facebook-cecil-roberts-umwa-2015-10-22.jpg"}, "title": "Kentucky labor unions try to slow right-to-work momentum - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Kentucky", "published_time": "2015-11-30T04:00:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-30T08:31:12+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "kentucky unions, kentucky right-to-work, kentucky afl-cio, bill londrigan, matt bevin, forced unionism, forced union dues, rtw, worker freedom"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky labor leaders are trying to slow the state\u2019s momentum toward a right-to-work law that would let Kentuckians opt out of paying union dues.\nRepublicans control the Kentucky Senate, and the Democratic majority in the Kentucky House shrank to six when Louisville Rep.
