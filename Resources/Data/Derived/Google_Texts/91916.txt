Boulder's homeless population, many of whom had to spend time outside during recent flooding, need clean, dry clothes, advocates said Sunday.

Bridge House, Boulder's day shelter and a social service provider for the homeless, will open to take donations starting 7 a.m. Monday. They particularly need shoes, socks and outerwear.

Bridge House is located at 1120 1/2 Pine St., in the alley behind the First Congregational Church.

In addition, Boulder Outreach for Homeless Overflow has operated emergency warming shelters every night starting on Wednesday, the first night of flooding. They will be at Pine Street Church, 1237 Pine Street, on Sunday night. Doors open at 7 p.m.

Operating so early in the season is eating into BOHO's cash reserves for the winter. If you want to make a monetary donation to BOHO, go to www.bohocommunity.org.
