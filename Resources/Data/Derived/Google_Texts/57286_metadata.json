The owner lives in Wichita but Fergus stays on property in Sedgwick county, several miles away from where the bull was found.\n\nTuesday, December 31, 2013\n\nThe Sumner County Sheriff's Office is asking for help tracking down the owner of a bull found wandering on the road in Sumner County.\n\nThe long-haired bull was first spotted about midnight at the Kansas Star Casino exit on the Turnpike. Sumner County Sheriff Darren Chambers said he responded to the call and found the bull about a mile away near 140th and Hydraulic, walking in the middle of the road.\n\nSheriff Chambers said they have the bull in a pasture now but they have not been able to track down its owner. Deputies called farmers and went door to door but have not found anyone who recognizes the bull.\n\nSheriff Chambers believes the animal is most likely a pet because it is very calm and friendly around people. If you have any information about the bull or its owner, you're asked to call the Sumner County Sheriff's Office at (620) 326-8941.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "UPDATE: A lost, unique looking bull is now back with his owner.", "language": "english", "author": "Parrish Alleman", "og": {"description": "UPDATE: A lost, unique looking bull is now back with his owner.", "title": "Wandering bull found in Sumner county now back with owner", "url": "http://www.kake.com/findit/tuesdayheadlines/Sumner-county-sheriff-looking-for-missing-bulls-owner-238303521.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/92F/947/92F947759B1B4ADEA3AA777975687F5F", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/128/FA0/128FA056DCF4456FB99899B87EE2B467.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "UPDATE: A lost, unique looking bull is now back with his owner.", "title": "Wandering bull found in Sumner county now back with owner", "url": "http://www.kake.com/findit/tuesdayheadlines/Sumner-county-sheriff-looking-for-missing-bulls-owner-238303521.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/lost-bull-thumb.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Wandering bull found in Sumner county now back with owner", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wandering bull found in Sumner, county now back with owner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc983\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday, December 31, 2013The Sumner County Sheriff's Office is asking for help tracking down the owner of a bull found wandering on the road in Sumner County.\nIf you have any information about the bull or its owner, you're asked to call the Sumner County Sheriff's Office at (620) 326-8941.\nThe long-haired, white bull was found wandering in the middle of the road in Sumner county early yesterday morning.\nThe Sumner county sheriff turned to KAKE news after they couldn't find anyone who recognized the animal.\nUPDATE:We have an update on the lost, unique looking bull found in Sumner county Tuesday."}
