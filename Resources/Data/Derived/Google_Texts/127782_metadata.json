He remains adept at subtly recasting his catalog, and songs such as \u201cBeer For My Horses,\u201d with its call-and-response choruses, and the medley of \u201cFunny How Time Just Slips Away,\u201d \u201cCrazy\u201d and \u201cNight Life\u201d were treated with slightly different textures and cadences, but always with their familiar melodies intact.\n\nNelson pulled out other totems such as \u201cGood Hearted Woman,\u201d \u201cMama Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\u201d and \u201cOn the Road Again,\u201d while he let sister and pianist Bobbie Nelson lead the group through \u201cDown Yonder\u201d and son Lukas Nelson front a rendition of Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s \u201cTexas Flood\u201d juiced up with solos by all three guitarists and harmonica player Mickey Raphael. The night\u2019s surprise was \u201ca new gospel song\u201d called \u201cRoll Me Up and Smoke Me when I\u2019m Dead\u201d \u2013 which Nelson and company followed with the more reverent \u201cI Saw the Light.\u201d\n\nUrban, meanwhile, closed the evening with his high-octatne, arena-sized bombast, mixing virtuoistic guitar work and earthy charm across a catalog-spanning 17-song, 90-minute set. A muscular instrumental intro led into equally uptempo opening of \u201cLong Hot Summer\u201d and \u201cSweet Thing,\u201d the latter featuring an extended Urban solo. \u201cStupid Boy\u201d was an early showstopper, while quieter tracks such as \u201cCome Back to Me\u201d and \u201cWithout You\u201d \u2013 whose video images of Urban shirtless and on his wedding day with actress Nicole Kidman drew big cheers \u2013 slipped in amidst torqued-up versions of \u201cEven the stars Fall For You,\u201d \u201cKiss a Girl,\u201d \u201cGood Thing,\u201d \u201cPut You in a Song\u201d and a lusty \u201cSomebody Like You.\u201d\n\nDuring \u201cYou Gonna Fly\u201d Urban came off the stage to perform it and part of \u201cBetter Life\u201d from the middle of the Moody Theater\u2019s floor, while he finished the night spending most of \u201cYou Look Good in My Shirt\u201d in the venue\u2019s mezzanine, making the already intimate setting a bit a more up-close-and-personal.\n\nAll of the iTunes Festival performances were streamed live and will reside in the iTunes store as on-demand features.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "A sampler plate of country music closed out the inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival on Saturday (March 15) at South By Southwest, giving the genre a wide and varied berth after four previous days of rock, pop and rap.", "title": "Willie Nelson and Keith Urban Wrap Inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival at SXSW with Classics", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5937563/willie-nelson-and-keith-urban-wrap-inaugural-us-itunes-music-festival", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/willie-nelson-jazz-fest-2013_15.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A sampler plate of country music closed out the inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival on Saturday (March 15) at South By Southwest, giving the genre a wide and varied berth after four previous days of rock, pop and rap.", "title": "Willie Nelson and Keith Urban Wrap Inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival at SXSW with Classics", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5937563/willie-nelson-and-keith-urban-wrap-inaugural-us-itunes-music-festival", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/willie-nelson-jazz-fest-2013_15.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A sampler plate of country music closed out the inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival on Saturday (March 15) at South By Southwest, giving the genre a wide and varied berth after four previous days of rock, pop and rap.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Willie Nelson and Keith Urban Wrap Inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival at SXSW with Classics | Billboard"}, "article_summary": "All of the iTunes Festival performances were streamed live and will reside in the iTunes store as on-demand features.\nA sampler plate of country music closed out the inaugural U.S. iTunes Music Festival on Saturday (March 15) at South By Southwest, giving the genre a wide and varied berth after four previous days of rock, pop and rap.\nA muscular instrumental intro led into equally uptempo opening of \u201cLong Hot Summer\u201d and \u201cSweet Thing,\u201d the latter featuring an extended Urban solo.\nNelson and his eight-piece band did nothing more or less than what they always do, opening the 45-minute, 15-song set with the traditional \u201cWhiskey River\u201d and then rolling through a selection of favorites either written or interpreted by Nelson during his many decades making music.\nThe night\u2019s surprise was \u201ca new gospel song\u201d called \u201cRoll Me Up and Smoke Me when I\u2019m Dead\u201d \u2013 which Nelson and company followed with the more reverent \u201cI Saw the Light.\u201dUrban, meanwhile, closed the evening with his high-octatne, arena-sized bombast, mixing virtuoistic guitar work and earthy charm across a catalog-spanning 17-song, 90-minute set."}
