Dogs put athletic skills to the test in Libertyville

hello

Dogs of all breeds, from miniature dachshunds to Bernese mountain dogs, leapt over hurdles, climbed ramps, ran through tunnels and put their athletic skills to the test Sunday in Libertyville during the final day of the Wisconsin-Illinois Agility Group American Kennel Club dog agility trials.

More than 300 dogs competed in the three-day event over the weekend at the Libertyville Sports Complex.

"We've got various levels of dogs running agility," said Patti Jo Yuswak, co-chairwoman for the trials. "It's a lot of fun. (Owners) get to be on a team with their dogs and it helps build a dog's confidence."

Each course featured between 18 and 22 obstacles, with dogs timed and measured on any faults, such as knocking down a bar.

"The relationship between you and your dog and the training involved is what is important," Heather Green of Libertyville said after directing her retriever, June, around the course. "It doesn't matter what breed of dog you have, the standards are the same for all dogs."
