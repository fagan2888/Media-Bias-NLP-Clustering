Instead, they were frustrated when they couldn\u2019t find a doctor who suited their needs and ended up turning to an alternative method of paying for medical expenses that\u2019s been gaining interest since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\n\nRachel Robinson, who lives in Dallas with her husband and children, flipped from wanting an insurance-paid hospital delivery to a home delivery with a midwife, paid for through a medical cost-sharing program.\n\nRobinson remembered when she initially wrote off a friend who had suggested a home birth after Robinson voiced that she was having a hard time finding a doctor and hospital to accept her Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance purchased through Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t quite ready to hear all the no\u2019s I was hearing,\u201d Robinson told TheBlaze. Starting down the list of insurance-approved doctors, \u201cthey would say things like, \u2018Well we have to pay these high premiums so we can\u2019t always take the Obamacare patients. \u2026 It was all very vague. Some would come out and say, \u2018We just don\u2019t take Obamacare even though we\u2019re on the list.\u2019 It was very weird.\u201d\n\nAfter two days of calling and not finding a doctor that would accept her insurance or be in an area where she was willing to travel, Robinson and her husband wondered: \u201cWhy am I paying all this money a month for basically nothing?\u201d\n\nDropping Obamacare and Daring to Share\n\nThat\u2019s when the Robinsons dropped their insurance plan, selected a midwife and prepared for a medication-less home birth that was just a few weeks away.\n\nLooking back, Robinson said she wouldn\u2019t change it: not only her home birth, but the choice they made to join the cost-sharing program, Samaritan Ministries.\n\n\u201cWe love it so much because we don\u2019t go to the doctor that often. With the sharing program, you only have to pay up to $300 for regular visits,\u201d Robinson explained.\n\nThe Robinsons pay $375 every month for the program. If a medical bill exceeds the $300 cap that they would pay at the doctor\u2019s office, that\u2019s when the cost-sharing component comes into play.\n\nAnthony Hopp, Samaritan Ministries\u2019 director of membership development, told TheBlaze that if someone had a $100,000 medical bill, there would first be a strict process to vet the medical need and accuracy of the billing. After that, the organization allocates various members to send their monthly checks directly to the recipient, making sure the right amount gets to that person to pay off their bills. The recipient knows who is supposed to be supporting them with their monthly membership fees (the Robinsons, for example, send their $375 check to a specific person) and keeps a log of who they\u2019ve received money from to report back to the organization as well.\n\nHopp said that there has \u201ccertainly been an uptick\u201d of a least interest, if not membership, in Samaritan Ministries after Obamacare\u2019s changes to the health system went into effect. But he said it\u2019s not the only driver.\n\nHopp called it a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d\n\nCost-sharing programs use to be \u201csomewhat of a new concept, but I think the fact that it has been established for 20 years, it has taken people a while to see it as a viable option.\u201d\n\nSamaritan Ministries has about 35,000 households or families representing about 115,000 individuals, and Hopp said they\u2019ve seen their net growth hover around 18 to 24 percent in the last few years. Hopp said Samaritan Ministries is one of three Christian-oriented cost-sharing programs.\n\nLiberty HealthShare, while based on a religious tradition, more loosely adheres to a set of shared beliefs that it asks its members to have without specifying religion.\n\n\u201cWe are just simply making ourselves available to like-minded Americans so long as they agree with our shared beliefs. Whereas the other groups do require you be active Christian, we just simply say, \u2018Here\u2019s our set of shared beliefs,\u2019\u201d Liberty HealthShare Executive Director Dale Bellis said.\n\nBellis said he believes Obamacare has been a driver in such cost-sharing programs.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act obviously has raised awareness regarding health costs but also options and opportunities for ways to do so on a grassroots level. That\u2019s really what Liberty HealthShare represents,\u201d Bellis said.\n\n\u2018The Financial Part Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg\u2019\n\nHopp said it\u2019s not just religious or political factors that have people turning to a cost-sharing program either.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are questioning where their health care dollars are being sent,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know.\u201d\n\nWith Samaritan Health Ministries, members know exactly where their money is going, because they write a check to a specific person each month. For some people, he thinks, this personal support aspect is attractive for sharing programs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing a check directly to another Samaritan member, I feel good about that,\u201d Hopp said. \u201cThe financial part is just tip of iceberg. The concept, the intent is to go much deeper than just financial need. Our members are sending cards, notes of encouragement. Community is what makes this whole thing spin.\u201d\n\nBut Hopp pointed out that even if the demand of such cost-sharing programs increases as people seek options outside of traditional health care for whatever reason, new programs will not be started due to a provision preventing them in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCost-sharing programs, like Samaritan Ministries and Liberty HealthShare, were an exemption because they were in operation before Dec. 31, 1999. Bellis speculated that keeping cost-sharing programs \u201cas limited as possible \u2026 would seem to be the motivation\u201d of the government setting this date.\n\nAs for the Robinsons, they plan to stick with Samaritan Ministries for now and hope to continue in the future, even if her husband\u2019s job takes them elsewhere where traditional insurance options are available.\n\n\u201cWe really want to talk to his next employer, want to talk about insurance, because we want to stay on cost-sharing. We like to know where our money is,\u201d Robinson said.\n\n\u2014\n\nFront page image via Gil C/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nThis story has been updated to correct Samaritan Ministries name and to add clarification.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A Texas couple expecting their third child turned to Obamacare earlier this year, thinking it was the answer to their lack of insurance.
