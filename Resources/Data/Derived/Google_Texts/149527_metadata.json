If the case is won, the government can recover over three times the amount defrauded, and successful whistleblowers can receive between 15 and 30 percent of the governments' recovery.\n\n\"It's all about incentivizing integrity,\" says Bothwell. \"Chiselers are always incentivized to cheat. The False Claims Act sets things right by providing a countervailing incentive to do the right thing.\"\n\nThere's no question the False Claims Act works. Last year, the U.S. government and the states recovered well over $6 billion thanks to whistleblower-initiated cases.\n\nBothwell notes that a lot of False Claims Act cases involve health care \u2013 a situation likely to continue as the Affordable Care Act kicks in.\n\nThe Macon hospital settlement involved allegation of upcoding for more expensive inpatient services when the billing should have been for less costly outpatient or observation services.\n\nIn the Irwin County Hospital case, the allegations involved kickbacks for patient referrals and for billing for improperly performed imaging services.\n\nBothwell notes that it looks like a real fraud-fighting partnership is forming between Georgia Attorney General Sam Olen's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the U.S. Department of Justice, and Georgia whistleblowers and their attorneys.\n\n\"We're seeing a real public/private partnership that is bringing a real dividend for the American people. That's exactly how the law is supposed to work.\"\n\nAbout the Bothwell Law Group:\n\nSince 1996, the Bothwell Law Group has earned a national reputation for successful representation of whistleblowers in federal and state courts across the United States, and is one of only a handful of firms exclusively representing whistleblowers.
