It is also a time of worry for parents, both for the welfare of the mother and child. But the culture of the parents has a big impact on what their biggest concerns during pregnancy may be, and Google search is the perfect tool to give us a bit of insight on what pregnant couples throughout the world are really thinking about.\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nPregnant women may say that the health of their child is their top concern, but their Google searches reveal otherwise. New York Times contributing Op-Ed writer Seth Stephens-Davidowitz used Google to find the top five most searched terms to complete the sentence \u201cHow to ___ during pregnancy,\u201d and the answers varied greatly depending on geographic location. The number one concern of pregnant American women is how to prevent stretch marks. In fact, four of the top five searches for how to X when pregnant in America were related to physical appearance. This included: \"how to lose weight,\" \"how to avoid stretch marks,\" and \"how to stay fit.\" These concerns were shared by pregnant women in Australia and Great Britain as well, although these countries, unlike America, managed to also squeeze \u201chow to sleep\u201d into their top five.\n\nAccording to Stephens-Davidowitz's analysis, women in South America are equally concerned with their physical appearance when pregnant, but in a more glamorous way. For example, the fifth most asked question in Mexico was: \u201cCan pregnant women wear heels?\u201d In Brazil, an overwhelming concern for pregnant women was whether or not they could still get their hair dyed.\n\nSex\n\nThe Google search revealed that pregnant women throughout the world are worried about their sex life. In India, however, three out of four of the top searched terms for \u201cHow to ___ during pregnancy\u201d were centered on sex: \u201chow to do sex,\u201d \u201chow to have sex,\u201d and simply, \u201chow to sex,\u201d took the second, third, and fourth spot, respectively, with sleeping and taking care filling the last two remaining spots. Sex was also the number one concern for African women, filling up two of the five top spots in Nigeria.\n\nWhat Not to Eat\n\nIn the United States, Great Britain, and Australia, people seem to have an overwhelming concern over whether or not women should consume fish when pregnant. Shrimp, sushi, and smoked salmon filled the top five spots in all three countries. In the United States, Nigeria, and Mexico, people are wondering if pregnant women can have alcohol, a concern that isn\u2019t shared by Europeans. British and Australian women were more concerned with their dairy consumption, with eating cream cheese and cheese cake filling the top spot of \u201cCan pregnant women ___?\u201d The New York Times revealed that in Nigeria the top concern on what not to have when pregnant was cold water. This most likely comes from the belief that the consumption of cool water could give your baby pneumonia. Those in India and Singapore are concerned over how specific fruit such as pineapples, mangos, and banana might affect a pregnant woman.\n\nLifestyles\n\nIn some areas of the world, people are more concerned over what pregnant women can and can\u2019t do, than what they should be eating. \u201cCan pregnant women fly?\u201d and \u201cCan pregnant women go in saunas?\u201d are top search terms in Germany. Brazilian women are equally curious if they can still fly or ride a bike when pregnant. Laid-back Spaniards want to know if women are still able to soak up the sun when with child. Sex was also a top search term to finish the sentences \u201cCan pregnant women ___\u201d in India and Nigeria.\n\nExpectant Fathers' Concerns\n\nIt\u2019s not just women who use Google to find out answers about what to expect when expecting. Men are just as anxious. Stephens-Davidowitz revealed that in Mexico the top searches about \u201cmy pregnant wife\u201d included \u201cwords of love\u201d or \u201cpoems for my pregnant wife.\u201d American husbands were a bit more straightforward, searching phrases such as \u201c my wife is pregnant now what?\u201d and \u201cmy wife is pregnant what do I do?\u201d Men in India have a slightly different strange question to ask the Internet about their pregnant wives. In India, the top searched term to finish the sentence \u201cmy husband wants\u201d is \u201cmy husband wants me to breastfeed him.\u201d Also in India, the most common search to contain the phrases \u201chow to\u201d and \u201cmy husband\u201d is \u201chow to breastfeed my husband.\u201d It does not seem that other countries share the same enthusiasm when it comes to spousal breastfeeding.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "high, heels, hair, dye, how, concerns, pregnant, women, differ, around, world", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A New York Times contributing Op-Ed writer analyzed Google search data and found different countries' top pregnancy-related search terms.
