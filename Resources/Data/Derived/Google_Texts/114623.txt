NRF promotes policies that encourage workforce investment and support retail careers – including workforce training, career development and programs that encourage the hiring of veterans and low-income Americans. Restoring the 40-hour work week would benefit retail employees with more income, encourage more full-time employment and overcome a principle concern with the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate. The association has fought efforts by the National Labor Relations Board to tilt the balance of union organizing efforts against retailers and our employees. Recent NLRB decisions, such as “ambush” organizing elections or “micro-unions,” have placed the interests of union organizers ahead of everyone else. Opportunities for retail are also at risk in the debate over a federal minimum wage hike that will slow the creation of starting jobs for younger workers and make it harder for small retailers to expand. Meanwhile, proposed changes in federal overtime rules will keep retail managers doing more paperwork and prevent them from ensuring that customers are served better. And with competition for the best workers increasingly global, the broken immigration system needs reform so that retailers can hire highly-skilled workers.

Health Care – The Affordable Care Act requirement to provide health insurance to “full-time” workers should apply only to those working 40 hours a week or more rather than 30 hours.

Labor Relations – The National Labor Relations Board should be returned to its intended role as an objective arbiter of labor issues and should rescind rulings, and regulations on issues such as “ambush” elections and “micro-unions” that are intended to make it easier to organize traditionally non-union industries like retail.

Minimum Wage – The federal minimum wage is a “starting wage” intended to help bring young and inexperienced individuals into the workforce, and raising it would hamper efforts at jobs creation.

Overtime – An Obama Administration plan to expand overtime could take away retail managers’ discretion to put in the extra hours sometimes needed to make their stores successful, and could ultimately limit opportunities for career advancement.

Right to Work – Workers should be free to decide whether to join a union, but should not be rushed with “ambush” elections that allow only the union to present its side or have their right to a secret ballot taken away through “card check” elections that require only that a union card be signed.

Scheduling – NRF believes one-size-fits-all government intervention in the scheduling of employees intrudes on the employer-employee relationship and creates unnecessary mandates on how a business should operate.

Skilled Worker Visas – Practical, comprehensive reform is needed in order to address the needs of both employers and today’s transient workforce, particularly when businesses seek to hire highly skilled workers whose talents are a commodity in the global economy.
