Free safety Rahim Moore is scheduled to visit with the Houston Texans, an NFL source confirmed.

The Broncos are monitoring Mooreâ€™s negotiations in free agency, but it appears less and less likely that they will have the budget room to make a competitive offer.

Moore, a second-round draft pick by the Broncos in 2011, was a three-season starter who had four interceptions and six unassisted tackles in 2014-15.
