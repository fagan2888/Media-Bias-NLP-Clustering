He is seeking $75 million in damages over money lost in a failed headphone venture. Jefferson Siegel/Associated Press\n\nThe lesson here: Sometimes it\u2019s best to just forget about Dre.\n\nBut back in 2009, that wasn\u2019t an easy task for fellow hip-hop artist 50 Cent, who watched as Dr. Dre raked it in with his Beats by Dre headphones. By the following year, 50 Cent thought, \u201cI can do that,\u201d a decision that has since cost him millions of dollars.\n\nCourt documents explain that when \u201cDr. Dre introduced Beats by Dr. Dre, a wired headphone, which enjoyed success in the market,\u201d 50 Cent recognized \u201cthe financial success of these other hip-hop artists.\u201d So he \u201cdecided to market his own line of headphones to take advantage of his status as a music celebrity and the value of his 50 Cent brand.\u201d\n\nThe artist, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, partnered with a company called Sleek Audio to make is own headphones called Sleek by 50. (Take that, Dre.)\n\nThe hip-hop artist invested more than $2 million in Sleek, according to court papers, but his branded headphones never hit the market. So Mr. Jackson abandoned the idea of partnering with Sleek and decided to make his own headphones\u2014Street by 50\u2014under a brand he called SMS Audio. And that is when Mr. Jackson got in legal hot water.\n\nUnfortunately, the brand hit a little too close to home for Sleek. The company, which specializes in custom earbuds, sued Mr. Jackson for violating a brand-licensing agreement, among other things, ultimately resulting in a $17.2 million arbitration award against the rapper.\n\nNow that Mr. Jackson has filed for bankruptcy, he says the whole fiasco is the fault of the lawyers who represented him in the deal. He says he should have been warned not to invest with Sleek and, after the deal fell apart, should have been advised that his SMS headphones would infringe on the Sleek deal.\n\nMr. Jackson\u2019s lawyer said the rapper \u201cbecame saddled with liabilities\u201d exceeding $18 million, not including the millions he spent in legal fees.\n\n\u201cMr. Jackson\u2019s decision to file this action came only after it was determined that a settlement could not be reached between the parties,\u201d said Craig Weiner, Mr. Jackson\u2019s lawyer at the law firm Robins Kaplan.\n\nMr. Jackson said in court documents that his lawyers\u2019 actions \u201crose to the level of malpractice.\u201d He is seeking $25 million in actual damages and another $50 million in punitive damages.\n\nIn a statement to Bankruptcy Beat, law firm Garvey Schubert Barer responded to the allegations, saying the firm understands Mr. Jackson\u2019s disappointment in the outcome of the Sleek arbitration. However, \u201cour attorneys properly counseled Mr. Jackson and his sophisticated team of financial and operational advisors about the transactions and the arbitrations with Sleek,\u201d a spokesman for the law firm said.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Gleason at stephanie.gleason@wsj.com.
