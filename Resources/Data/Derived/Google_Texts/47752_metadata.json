(AP) - Former TierOne Bank President James Laphen testified in federal court that he, the bank\u2019s former CEO and other bank officers deliberately stalled ordering new and more realistic appraisals of construction developments starting in 2008 to keep bank and market regulators at bay.\n\nLaphen\u2019s testimony came Friday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of TierOne Bank\u2019s former CEO and chairman, Gil Lundstrom, the Lincoln Journal Star reported (http://bit.ly/1GoJBOg ). The trial began Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors say Lundstrom, 74, and other bank officers hid million-dollar losses from regulators and shareholders. Regulators took over Lincoln-based TierOne in 2010, saying the bank had too many bad loans on its books and lacked sufficient capital to cushion losses. The bank\u2019s assets were sold to South Dakota-based Great Western Bank.\n\nLaphen testified Friday that the bank\u2019s troubles started to show up late in 2007 in Florida, and that by 2009, bank officials were preoccupied with trying to hold off recognizing the rapidly declining value of construction projects, which could have had regulators requiring the bank to come up with reserves for loans that were no longer performing.\n\nLaphen has pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud. He acknowledged from the stand that he hoped his testimony against Lundstrom would result in his getting a more lenient sentence.\n\nFormer chief credit officer, Don Langford, also has pleaded guilty to similar charges.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former TierOne Bank President James Laphen testified in federal court that he, the bank's former CEO and other bank officers deliberately stalled ordering new and more realistic appraisals of construction developments starting in 2008 to keep bank and market regulators at bay.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/24/former-tierone-bank-president-testifies-against-ex/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Former TierOne Bank President James Laphen testified in federal court that he, the bank\u2019s former CEO and other bank officers deliberately stalled ordering new and more realistic appraisals of construction developments starting in 2008 to keep bank and market regulators at bay.", "title": "Former TierOne Bank president testifies against ex-CEO"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former TierOne Bank President James Laphen testified in federal court that he, the bank's former CEO and other bank officers deliberately stalled ordering new and more realistic appraisals of construc", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Former TierOne Bank president testifies against ex-CEO"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb56\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Former TierOne Bank President James Laphen testified in federal court that he, the bank\u2019s former CEO and other bank officers deliberately stalled ordering new and more realistic appraisals of construction developments starting in 2008 to keep bank and market regulators at bay.\nLaphen\u2019s testimony came Friday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of TierOne Bank\u2019s former CEO and chairman, Gil Lundstrom, the Lincoln Journal Star reported (http://bit.ly/1GoJBOg ).\nRegulators took over Lincoln-based TierOne in 2010, saying the bank had too many bad loans on its books and lacked sufficient capital to cushion losses.\nProsecutors say Lundstrom, 74, and other bank officers hid million-dollar losses from regulators and shareholders.\nHe acknowledged from the stand that he hoped his testimony against Lundstrom would result in his getting a more lenient sentence."}
