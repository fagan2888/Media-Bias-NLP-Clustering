On Tuesday, Blue Cross Blue Shield Nebraska (BCBSNE) announced a plan to terminate its arrangement with Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI).\n\nCHI includes Alegent Health -- along with several other Nebraska hospitals.\n\nIf a deal isn't reached by August 31, BCBSNE members will face out-of-network rates for medical care at any Alegent facility. BCBSNE tells KETV NewsWatch 7 a termination would mean higher costs for some 500,000 people who seek care with Alegent.\n\n\"While other providers have worked with us to reduce or hold the line on costs, Alegent Creighton providers, in particular, cost significantly more than others in Omaha -- and they continue to ask for annual increases,\" Lee Handke, senior vice president at BCBSNE said in a statement.\n\nCHI is affiliated with more than 3,000 Omaha-area providers and owns the following hospitals: Alegent Creighton Health in Omaha, Council Bluffs, Schuyler and Plainview, Good Samaritan in Kearney, Nebraska Heart Hospital in Lincoln, Saint Elizabeth Regional Medical Center in Lincoln, Saint Francis Medical Center in Grand Island, and St. Mary's Community Hospital in Nebraska City.\n\nCalls for comment from Alegent Health were not immediately returned Tuesday morning. We will update this story with those comments, when available.
