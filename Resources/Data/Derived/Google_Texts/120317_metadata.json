The failure in 2013 of the launch of the president\u2019s health care plan was a perfect example of an unacceptable failure, especially given the $2.1 billion spent to date on the website. This month we learned that the IRS cannot protect Americans\u2019 Social Security numbers and will likely lose $21 billion taxpayer dollars to fraud. Then there\u2019s \u201cthe list\u201d that seems to grow every day.\n\nThe scandal at Veterans Affairs\n\nThe NSA spying scandal\n\nThe billions wasted on the failed F-35 by the Pentagon\n\nA loss of $22 billion on student loan plans\n\nThe IRS hires the incompetent contractor that built the failed Healthcare.gov website\n\n$104 billion in failing Afghanistan reconstruction\n\n$100 billion in improper entitlement payments\n\n$1 billion in \u201cadministrative leave\u201d for federal workers\n\n\n\nThe United States government no longer works the way the American people need it to. Like an old computer trying to run the latest software, its archaic internal systems \u2013 from personnel policies to regulatory regimes to the budgeting process \u2013 are ill suited to a fast-moving 21st Century world. Something has to change if Washington is to help the single largest economy on the planet continue to function smoothly while keeping its people safe and prosperous.\n\nThe United States needs a Reboot.\n\nStarting today, The Fiscal Times launches the \u201cReboot America\u201d project, a year-long conversation that will bring together some of the smartest minds from around the country to explore ways to reshape the U.S. government into the set of systems and institutions its citizens need to endure and thrive.\n\nWith insights from people who have been in the trenches of the U.S. government, as well as ideas from our readers who will be invited to participate in a special forum to share their solutions for improving government, \u201cReboot America\u201d offers cutting-edge and practical solutions to the myriad problems facing the U.S. government today.\n\nRebootAmerica\n\nAmerica's 21st Century Challenge: Restoring Faith in Government \u2013 Eric Pianin and Rob Garver, The Fiscal Times\n\nHow the Federal Budget Process Mutated from a Civil Process to a Political Weapon - Robert D.
