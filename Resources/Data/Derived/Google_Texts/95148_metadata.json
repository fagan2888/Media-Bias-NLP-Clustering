It reopened the route just before 5 p.m.\n\nEven before the U.S. 6 shut-down, traffic on I-70 already had become slow-and-go due to volume at Georgetown. But by 7:30 p.m., volume had eased and motorists were able to travel at posted speeds.\n\nWhile drivers might be tempted to try to bypass slowdowns on the interstate by taking the route over the pass, authorities institute the holds to reduce the chances of congestion on U.S. 6, where potential avalanche slide paths pose a hazard.\n\nCDOT also imposed safety metering on I-70 between Silverthorne and the Eisenhower tunnel, making periodic traffic stops due to high volume, until shortly after 5 p.m.\n\nElsewhere around Colorado, the State Patrol closed U.S. 285 between Fairplay and Kenosha Pass due to high winds and ground blizzards that had produced multiple accidents by mid-afternoon.\n\nIn the Denver metro area, westbound U.S. 36 between Federal and Sheridan boulevards will feature lane diversions and single-lane closures beginning at 7 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThe changes accommodate the construction of a tolling station as part of the ongoing U.S. 36 Express Lanes project.\n\nMeanwhile, the ramp from southbound I-25 to eastbound U.S. 6 began a six-month closure on Friday night due to work on bridges over Bryant Street and the South Platte River.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Heavy eastbound I-70 traffic prompts hold on Loveland Pass", "title": "Heavy eastbound I-70 traffic prompts hold on Loveland Pass", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/24/heavy-eastbound-i-70-traffic-prompts-hold-on-loveland-pass/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T15:34:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-24T15:34:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde762\"", "article_summary": "The Colorado Department of Transportation and State Patrol stopped eastbound traffic on the pass at 4 p.m. for safety concerns \u2014 a routine measure when weekend travelers trigger congestion along I-70 in the same direction.\nEven before the U.S. 6 shut-down, traffic on I-70 already had become slow-and-go due to volume at Georgetown.\nA combination of nice weather and no local football prompted state authorities to brace for heavier than usual mountain traffic on eastbound Interstate 70 and impose a Saturday afternoon hold on U.S. 6 over Loveland Pass.\nElsewhere around Colorado, the State Patrol closed U.S. 285 between Fairplay and Kenosha Pass due to high winds and ground blizzards that had produced multiple accidents by mid-afternoon.\nCDOT also imposed safety metering on I-70 between Silverthorne and the Eisenhower tunnel, making periodic traffic stops due to high volume, until shortly after 5 p.m."}
