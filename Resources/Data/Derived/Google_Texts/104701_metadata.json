The founder and CEO of Wynn Resorts told KNPB\u2018s John Ralston that labor statistics are inaccurate.\n\nWell, the idea that America is in the grips of a great recovery is pure fiction. It\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a jobless recovery because recoveries are marked by the amount of real employment. And if you count the people who have left the work force, real unemployment is 15 to 20 percent.\n\nMr. Wynn said that he intends on waiting until the general election before he endorses any of the candidates for president; yet he acknowledged that the next president is going to have a monumental challenge.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nI\u2019m not endorsing anybody for president. What I do know is that we\u2019ve got a mess in terms of the global economy, geopolitically, Mid-Eastern foreign policy, immigration \u2013 beyond disgrace.\n\nMr. Wynn weighed in on the impact that Obamacare has had on his business and his employees.\n\nI may not agree with things like the Affordable Healthcare Act which was the single worse piece of junk in my lifetime that ever got passed. It was all wrong. And I\u2019m a healthcare provider. It made things worse, not better. I hope to God we can fix it for the sake of my employees. And my union hates it.

Not to mention race relations have gone to an all-time low.\n\nMr. Wynn commented that the $18 trillion debt, the devaluation of the dollar, and real inflation is impacting every working American and making it very difficult for the middle class to prosper.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The idea that America is in the grips of a great recovery is pure fiction.\"", "author": "Tom Hinchey", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"The idea that America is in the grips of a great recovery is pure fiction.\"", "title": "Steve Wynn: 'America Is In A Very Bad Place'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1090, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Steve-Wynn02-1.jpg", "height": 612}, "updated_time": "2015-05-06T16:42:10-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/steve-wynn-america-is-in-a-very-bad-place/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The idea that America is in the grips of a great recovery is pure fiction.\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Steve-Wynn02-1.jpg", "title": "Steve Wynn: 'America Is In A Very Bad Place'", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-06T16:41:48-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Expose Obama", "tag": "United States Of America", "published_time": "2015-05-06T16:41:48-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-06T16:42:10-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "steve wynn, , obamacare, unemployment, united states of america, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f00\"", "article_summary": "Well, the idea that America is in the grips of a great recovery is pure fiction.\n\"The idea that America is in the grips of a great recovery is pure fiction.\"\nIt made things worse, not better.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowInternational gaming and casino magnate Steve Wynn said this week in a PBS interview that the great economic recovery is pure fiction.\nA very bad place."}
