The very literate libretto by conductor Clemens Krauss transforms the quandary of words vs. music into a human dilemma: The glamorous Parisian Countess Madeleine must choose between two rival suitors, a poet and a musician. As the second installment of a four-year Strauss cycle, Opera Theater\u2019s Summerfest brought this unique and very entertaining work to life Saturday in the 20th Century Club\u2019s Art Deco Theater in Oakland.\n\nIt\u2019s a formidable score, for which Opera Theater commissioned a reduced (21-piece) orchestration by Braden Toan. Barring some opening night mishaps, it worked very well for the mostly young players conducted by Brent McMunn. Strauss\u2019s effusive romantic writing alternates with declamatory vocalism that makes the words clear, while two hilarious Italian singers show off their voices without any interest at all in the words, and a frustrated impresario complains that today\u2019s theater business is squelching artistic integrity. In her final monologue, the Countess weighs the qualities of the poet vs. the musician. I won\u2019t give away the ending.\n\nWith a script that often goes into discussions about theater and musical technicalities, Carnegie Mellon University professor Gregory Lehane kept the action on stage lively and compelling. He made much of the interaction between poet and musician, natural enemies who eventually realize that cooperation is better than antagonism. He exploited the subplot in which the Countess\u2019 brother becomes an actor in an unsuccessful attempt to seduce the sexy actress Clairon. He gives each character a distinct persona, with Eunjin Lee\u2019s hip updated costumes adding to their 21st-century individuality. Inexplicably, the Countess reverted to an 18th-century hoopskirt gown in the closing scene. Christine Le Won\u2019s attractive set featured versatile revolving triangles that became various parts of the Countess\u2019 chateau.\n\nThe evening\u2019s best vocalism, and also the most subtle, came from Jeremy Galyon as the producer La Roche. This character is the catalyst for the opera\u2019s entire scenario, controlling the other figures like a puppeteer. Mr. Galyon\u2019s booming, richly-hued bass, and strong personality, made his presence felt whenever he was on stage, taking over in La Roche\u2019s lengthy central solo scene, where he encapsulates his philosophy of theater (and, one assumes, that of Strauss and Kraus).\n\nReferring back to earlier operatic heroines, the leading lady must embody the warmth of Mozart\u2019s Countess Almaviva (in \u2018The Marriage of Figaro\u201d) with the wisdom of Strauss\u2019s own Marschallin (in \u201cDer Rosenkavalier\u201d), and the nobility of his Ariadne. Diana McVey looked quite gorgeous and comported herself with elegance, but her shrill lyric sound was hard pressed to ride Strauss\u2019s soaring lines without strain, and lacking the coloristic variety to convey Madeleine\u2019s changing, complex emotions. A disparity with the orchestra when she reprised the sonnet \u2013 the opera\u2019s best melody \u2013 further broke the mood at a crucial moment.\n\nTenor Benjamin Robinson as the composer Flamand, and baritone Christopher Scott as the writer Olivier, were handsome and mellifluous as the rival lovers for Madeleine, though Mr. Robinson was overly timid in his early-on vocalism of the Sonnet. Andrew Cummings\u2019 Count was marked by exceptionally clear diction, while Victoria Fox\u2019s Clairon showed an impressive deep contralto, not always precisely in tune. Julia Fox and Rafael Helbig-Kostka sang the difficult Italian duet splendidly, Ms. Fox in particular showing a flair for the comic \u2013 gorging on food and drink, then showing the effects without becoming totally ludicrous.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opera Theater\u2019s Summerfest brought this unique and entertaining work to life Saturday in the 20th Century Club\u2019s Art Deco Theater.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "\u201cCapriccio,\u201d the last opera by Richard Strauss, is an opera about writing an opera, but it\u2019s no mere intellectual exercise.
