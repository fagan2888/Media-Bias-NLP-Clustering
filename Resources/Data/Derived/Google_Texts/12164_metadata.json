The average profit margin of 6.8 percent was one of the highest posted, he said, since 2000.\n\n\u201cIn the last couple years, you\u2019ve seen the average revenues to the health plans go up, but you\u2019ve seen the average medical expenses go down,\u201d Baumgarten said. \u201cThat\u2019s usually a pretty good predictor of profitability.\u201d\n\nOverall, Baumgarten\u2019s report found that health insurers collectively posted a small loss last year, including policies sold to businesses and individuals.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services (DHS), which administers the public programs, said it has made changes in HMO contracts that should deliver more than $450 million in savings this year.\n\n\u201cWe are not satisfied to see health care plan profits at these levels,\u201d the DHS said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cAlong with reducing profits, the 2016 contracts will result in significant saving for taxpayers in 2016 and the years beyond.\u201d\n\nWhile Baumgarten stressed that the amount of profit for HMOs was a record last year, health plans stressed that it came on record enrollment and record overall expenses in the programs, too.\n\n\u201cMajor changes in who gets care through Medicaid and MinnesotaCare have made it difficult for the state to predict the medical services these Minnesotans need,\u201d Jim Schowalter, president of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, a trade group for insurers, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons the state worked with health insurers to overhaul how it buys care in 2016. \u201d\n\nSigned last year, the new contracts factored the surprisingly low use of health care services by Medicaid enrollees who came into coverage as part of the federal health law.\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s report covers financial results from Medicaid, MinnesotaCare and two other public health insurance programs where the state last year hired five HMOs to manage care. Those companies were Blue Plus, HealthPartners, Medica, Metropolitan and UCare.\n\nMedicaid, which goes by the name \u201cMedical Assistance\u201d in Minnesota, generates most of the 2015 profit from state programs. It provides coverage for several groups including people near or below the poverty level.\n\nMinnesotaCare covers a slightly higher income group sometimes described as the \u201cworking poor.\u201d\n\nOverall, the insurers posted a small loss, driven by $318 million of red ink in the individual market. That slice of the market includes the state\u2019s MNsure health insurance exchange, and losses in the market during 2015 were twice as much as the previous year.\n\nThe individual market is undergoing significant changes with the federal health law, and insurers have raised concerns about financial losses in that market. What has received less attention are the profits from the Medicaid program, where the Affordable Care Act is expanding enrollment in states like Minnesota.\n\nThe federal government this year proposed new limits on income for HMOs hired by states for Medicaid beneficiaries. Had the rules been in place for 2015, three HMOs would have made slightly too much profit, Baumgarten said.\n\nThe government\u2019s rule would require a \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d of at least 85 percent for HMOs, meaning they must spend 85 percent of revenue on medical care and certain allowed costs.\n\nNo more than 15 percent could go to administrative costs and profits.\n\nThe rules would take effect beginning in July 2017, and states would have the option to impose higher ratios that would force even more money into patient care.\n\nBaumgarten said the five HMOs in Minnesota had a collective MLR ratio of 84.9 percent last year, even with record profits.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "HMOs saw record operating profits in 2015 from their business serving as managed care organizations in the state&rsquo;s public health insurance programs.", "title": "Record HMO profits from state programs", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/record-hmo-profits-from-state-programs/380742261/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "HMOs saw record operating profits in 2015 from their business serving as managed care organizations in the state&rsquo;s public health insurance programs.", "title": "Record HMO profits from state programs", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/record-hmo-profits-from-state-programs/380742261/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "HMOs saw record operating profits in 2015 from their business serving as managed care organizations in the state&rsquo;s public health insurance programs."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are not satisfied to see health care plan profits at these levels,\u201d the DHS said Tuesday in a statement.\nHMOs saw record operating profits in 2015 from their business serving as managed care organizations in the state\u2019s public health insurance programs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons the state worked with health insurers to overhaul how it buys care in 2016.\nBaumgarten said the five HMOs in Minnesota had a collective MLR ratio of 84.9 percent last year, even with record profits.\nMedicaid, which goes by the name \u201cMedical Assistance\u201d in Minnesota, generates most of the 2015 profit from state programs."}
