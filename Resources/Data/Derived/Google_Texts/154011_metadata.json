Yet, in hilarious and ironic fashion, despite this scrutiny, irony seems only to have become more deeply ensconced in our everyday mode of being \u2014 ensconced to such a point that Christy Wampole called irony \u201cthe ethos of our age\u201d and went on to instruct that prior attempts at sincerity had failed \u2014 that we have now entered a nearly hopeless phase of Deep Irony.\n\nWhether we have actually entered a state of Deep Irony or not is somewhat irrelevant. Importantly, though, there is something attached to the present stage of irony which seems to catalyze it: technology.\n\nIn a Salon article last year, Philip Burnett explicated this coupling as follows. We tend to cower behind cell phones and social media in the same way we hide behind ironic catchphrases, t-shirts, and Taylor Swift fandom: to escape the anxieties of social rejection. It is much easier to don a Bush 2004 campaign hat and insulate yourself behind a constantly scrolling smartphone than it is to present a sincere personal taste or opinion to the greater public. This is because \u2014 both with irony and technological presence \u2014 rejection is no longer a possibility. \u201cI am doing this ironically,\u201d as an insulating statement, is impenetrable; an iPhone in your hand will quickly cut the head off of a conversation you don\u2019t want to have and will protect you handsomely from the teeth of social awkwardness. When submerged like this, your actual self is miles away, perfectly cocooned and well clear of anything which might resemble judgement.\n\nBurnett claims that the problems of irony will be alleviated if attention is placed on consciously reducing ironic behaviors and technological dependencies. Such a method, to Burnett, entails \u201cputting away the technology, coming out of our ironic shells, and trying to have some genuine and unselfconscious fun.\u201d Without question, this change of attention would work: The problems of irony and technology will go away if we were to rid ourselves of irony and technology, if only temporarily. The mechanics of this change-of-attention, though, are not as smooth as the one-step process Burnett alludes to. In other words, the removal of these issues cannot be accomplished so directly, otherwise it would have occurred by now.\n\nPart of the issue is that irony and technology are seductive. It is intensely satisfying when something you post is \u201cliked,\u201d or when someone attractive laughs at your ironic jab. This constant allure (remember that this gratification, thanks to technology, is now available 24/7) makes any attempt at avoiding technology or irony incredibly, almost impossibly, difficult. Becoming sincere thus requires a strong enough catalyst: something external which can suck up our attention to the fullest and, if only for a few moments, allow us to forget what others are thinking of us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Irony is a seductive cultural force, but one that insulates us from real human connection", "title": "How to fight back against irony: a guide", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Irony is a seductive cultural force, but one that insulates us from real human connection", "title": "How to fight back against irony: a guide", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/02/how_to_fight_back_against_irony_a_guide/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/frank_rossitano_30_rock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Irony is a seductive cultural force, but one that insulates us from real human connection", "title": "How to fight back against irony: a guide", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/frank_rossitano_30_rock.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Frankie Lyon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cultural criticism, irony, literature, Music", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is because \u2014 both with irony and technological presence \u2014 rejection is no longer a possibility.\nBurnett claims that the problems of irony will be alleviated if attention is placed on consciously reducing ironic behaviors and technological dependencies.\nThis constant allure (remember that this gratification, thanks to technology, is now available 24/7) makes any attempt at avoiding technology or irony incredibly, almost impossibly, difficult.\nImportantly, though, there is something attached to the present stage of irony which seems to catalyze it: technology.\nWhether we have actually entered a state of Deep Irony or not is somewhat irrelevant."}
