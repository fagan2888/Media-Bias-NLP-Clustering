It is actually the schools\u2019 lifeblood.\n\nBut it\u2019s not every day that you hear an eminent Harvard professor accused of being a \u201cbandit\u201d and \u201cfinancial hit man.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered and increasingly thin-skinned president, reacted last week to an opinion piece co-authored by economist Ricardo Hausmann about whether the nation should default on its debts.\n\nThe article reportedly even contributed to a drop in Venezuela\u2019s bond prices.\n\nMaduro, political heir to Hugo Chavez, instructed Venezuela\u2019s attorney general to take unspecified \u201cactions\u201d against Hausmann, who heads Harvard\u2019s Center for International Development and is a former Venezuelan planning minister.\n\nHausmann, you might think, has good reason to worry about the Venezuelan economy. Inflation is around 60 percent. The official fixed bolivar-to-dollar exchange rate is less than a tenth of the black market rate. And the country is plagued by shortages of a lengthy laundry list of basic necessities, from bread to cancer drugs.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuela has one of the world\u2019s highest murder rates, with rich and poor fearing to leave their homes even in broad daylight.\n\nThe governments of Maduro and his late mentor Chavez have managed all that despite Venezuela having the world\u2019s largest oil reserves.\n\nThe Harvard prof has history with the Chavistas. Hausmann\u2019s brief time in office was in the elected but deeply unpopular government that Chavez sought to overthrow by force in 1992.\n\nThat coup failed and the brash young army colonel was jailed \u2014 but not before he gave a televised speech that rocketed him to fame and effectively launched his successful 1998 presidential run.\n\nSince taking office last year, Maduro has ramped up Chavez\u2019s intolerance for criticism, rights groups say, jailing several opposition leaders and overseeing the closure of critical TV and radio stations.\n\nBut what may really have hit a nerve with the president is Hausmann\u2019s suggestion that the government\u2019s insistence on honoring its debts to wealthy bondholders is hurting ordinary citizens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nicolas Maduro is fuming over a Kennedy School economist\u2019s criticism of his policies", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s president is bullying a Harvard professor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nicolas Maduro is fuming over a Kennedy School economist\u2019s criticism of his policies", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s president is bullying a Harvard professor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/venezuelas_president_is_bullying_a_harvard_professor_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/AP114650886927-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nicolas Maduro is fuming over a Kennedy School economist\u2019s criticism of his policies", "title": "Venezuela\u2019s president is bullying a Harvard professor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/AP114650886927-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simeon Tegel", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GlobalPost, Harvard, nicolas maduro, Venezuela", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c89\"", "article_summary": "Topics: GlobalPost, Harvard, nicolas maduro, Venezuela, NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostLIMA, Peru \u2014 Expressing intense differences of opinion at Ivy League universities is not exactly new.\nThe governments of Maduro and his late mentor Chavez have managed all that despite Venezuela having the world\u2019s largest oil reserves.\nBut it\u2019s not every day that you hear an eminent Harvard professor accused of being a \u201cbandit\u201d and \u201cfinancial hit man.\u201dThat\u2019s how Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered and increasingly thin-skinned president, reacted last week to an opinion piece co-authored by economist Ricardo Hausmann about whether the nation should default on its debts.\nThe article reportedly even contributed to a drop in Venezuela\u2019s bond prices.\nMaduro, political heir to Hugo Chavez, instructed Venezuela\u2019s attorney general to take unspecified \u201cactions\u201d against Hausmann, who heads Harvard\u2019s Center for International Development and is a former Venezuelan planning minister."}
