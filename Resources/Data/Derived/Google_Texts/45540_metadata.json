It\u2019s the level of epistemic closure crazy, also known as a delusional break with reality.\n\nTo wit: Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the \u201ceducated\u201d version of Sarah Palin and very new addition to the Senate, is in charge of the GOP and he doesn\u2019t have a clue what he\u2019s doing. He drinks the Kook-Aid and then force feeds it to the rest of his party, who take it from him since it\u2019s delivered through Koch straws. On Wednesday, Cruz was pulling a Romney, unskewing polls for fellow Republicans, claiming that the shutdown bolstered their position.\n\nI kid you not.\n\nSenior Congressional Correspondent David M. Druckner at the Washington Examiner reported that on Wednesday, Cruz \u201cWednesday argued to his Republican colleagues that the campaign he led to defund Obamacare has bolstered the GOP\u2019s political position in dealing with the government shutdown.\u201d\n\nTo accomplish this act of faith, Cruz relied upon a poll that he paid for.\n\nThe survey\u2019s findings mirrored other national polls: More voters blame the Republicans for the government shutdown than blame President Obama or the Democrats. But Cruz argued, based on the poll, that Republicans are in a much better position than they were during the 1995 shutdown because this impasse is defined by a disagreement over funding for the Affordable Care Act as opposed to a general disagreement over government spending.\n\nDrucker got his hands on the Cruz poll and revealed the numbers:\n\nBy a margin of 46 percent to 39 percent, voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown over \u201cObama and Democrats.\u201d Another 19 percent blamed both sides equally.\n\n\u2013 By a margin of 42 percent to 36 percent, independent voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown over Obama and the Democrats.\n\n\u2013 In November 1995, 51 percent of voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown; only 28 percent blamed then-President Clinton\n\nIf Republicans are using the Clinton numbers to ease their fears of being found out by Mommy USA, they are making a grave error. During the Clinton presidency, there was no Fox News. There were no conservative media outlets driving home an often inaccurate, partisan narrative that justifies anything Republicans are doing. There are more misinformed Republicans now, yes.\n\nBut Republicans are losing Independents. According to PPP, Democrats now lead Republicans with Independents, 42%-33%. Even in Ted\u2019s own poll, they are losing Independents 42-36. It\u2019s hard to say what Cruz tells himself that allows him to believe he can run for President, but whatever it is, is contagious and lethal to the national ambitions of the GOP.\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t believe regular polls, so they probably shouldn\u2019t be allowed to commission them \u2014 it only feeds their delusions. They certainly shouldn\u2019t be allowed to commission them from Republican pollsters, and that is what Wilson Perkins Allen is. I\u2019m not suggesting that they aren\u2019t a valid pollster, but rather if I were in charge of the GOP, the first order of business would be to take the hard medicine of reality with no chaser.\n\nThe only way they are going to become a viable national party again is if they can face things outside of the Fox bubble. I\u2019d go into enemy territory and see how my party was faring among Dems and Indies. The \u201cDemocratic pollster\u201d of PPP was the most accurate during 2012. Wouldn\u2019t you use the most accurate pollster you could if it were your party on the line? Hiding under the covers helps nothing but the GOP ego, which obviously doesn\u2019t need any bolstering.\n\nAlso, earth to Ted Cruz: Not everyone hates ObamaCare, so defunding the country over ObamaCare is not the winner you think it is. Publicly snickering at people without insurance isn\u2019t helpful either.\n\nCruz just admitted again that Republicans shut down the government over ObamaCare, a completely unrelated to the budget law. This means that Republicans are refusing to do their Constitutional duty. Or, \u201cgaining position\u201d according to Ted Cruz.\n\nRemember when Republicans used to be the party of \u201cideas\u2019?
