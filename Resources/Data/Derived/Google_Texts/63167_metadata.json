The local demonstration was co-opted by a militia, led by Nevada native Ammon Bundy, now calling itself Citizens for Constitutional Freedom. Following its participation in the planned protest, the militia seized and continues to illegally occupy the nearby Malheur National Wildlife Refuge\u2014vowing to remain there unless and until the Hammonds are granted clemency.\n\nMany have been eager to brand Bundy and his militia as terrorists, referring to them as \u201cYee-haw-dists\u201d or \u201cVanilla ISIS.\u201d And to be sure, there are similarities with Islamic militant groups. For instance, while Bundy\u2019s \u201cresistance movement\u201d is essentially driven by socio-political issues, chiefly land rights and perceived overreach by the federal government, their campaign is also religiously framed and motivated. This same dynamic holds true for ISIS, al-Qaida and related groups. Moreover, Bundy and his associates hold views that most would consider extreme. In fact, they share ISIS\u2019 admiration for slavery\u2014with Cliven Bundy (Ammon\u2019s father, and the head of the Bundy clan) having suggested that blacks may be better off today if they were still in chains; others from the militia are known members of designated hate groups and extremist organizations. Finally, as with al-Qaida, militants who drew inspiration from the Bundys have carried out atrocities that the family itself had to disavow.\n\nHowever, any similarities between the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom and Islamic terrorists are vastly outweighed by the differences between them.\n\nFor instance, the militia is not threatening violence, nor even to deface or destroy federal property, if their demands are not met; the only consequence is continued occupation. In the interim, they are being careful not to damage the refuge or its facilities, they have allowed the public to come and go largely unrestricted, and have even claimed that they will vacate the premises if it seems clear that the local population wants them to go. And so, while it is illegal for the militia to be occupying the Malheur Refuge, their actions would be better understood as an act of civil disobedience than an act of terror.\n\nGranted, Bundy and his supporters are heavily armed. However, there is no evidence that their weapons were illegally obtained, are unlicensed, or are otherwise unlawful\u2014and in the United States there is a constitutional right to bear arms. Clearly, the purpose of the guns is to deter the authorities from raiding them, and consistent with previous standoffs, Bundy has threatened violence if there is any attempt to forcibly dismantle or dislodge their demonstration. However, there is no evidence that they are seeking out this kind of escalation.\n\nAnd so the authorities have decided to wait them out. Although they are contemplating cutting off power to the site to render the occupation less comfortable, they are otherwise content with monitoring the situation and keeping the lines of communication as open as possible in order to bring the demonstration to a peaceful end. This is exactly what they should be doing.\n\nBlack Guns Matter?\n\nOf course, critics are quick to point out that the authorities would not have the same kind of respect for the protesters\u2019 rights, nor exercised the same level of restraint, were federal buildings being occupied by armed minorities\u2014for instance, blacks or Muslims. Recent history suggests they are absolutely correct.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the open-carry movement was not started by white conservatives, but by the Black Panthers. Much like the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, the Panthers legally purchased and licensed their guns, and carried them to public demonstrations in order to deter the authorities from impugning on their freedom of speech, their right to assemble, or denying them due process if accused of wrongdoing. These were very real concerns: At the time, civil rights activists were routinely harassed, intimidated, brutalized or killed by police officers or white mobs. Like Bundy, the Panthers emphasized that their weapons were strictly for defensive purposes\u2014they were not seeking out confrontation, but if the others initiated violence, they would respond in kind.\n\nDid conservative lawmakers celebrate black people affirming these constitutional rights? Far from it: Strict gun control laws were drafted, explicitly to disarm the Panthers, receiving wide bipartisan support\u2014to include from Ronald Reagan and the NRA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's treat minorities more like white people--not have Bundy treated more like Muslims or black people", "title": "Ammon Bundy is not a terrorist: The authorities are waiting out the militia \u2014 just as they should do with Black Lives Matter protesters", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Let's treat minorities more like white people--not have Bundy treated more like Muslims or black people", "title": "Ammon Bundy is not a terrorist: The authorities are waiting out the militia \u2014 just as they should do with Black Lives Matter protesters", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/ammon_bundy_is_not_a_terrorist_the_authorities_are_waiting_out_the_militia_just_as_they_should_do_with_black_lives_matter_protesters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ammon_bundy3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let's treat minorities more like white people--not have Bundy treated more like Muslims or black people", "title": "Ammon Bundy is not a terrorist: The authorities are waiting out the militia \u2014 just as they should do with Black Lives Matter protesters", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ammon_bundy3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Musa al-Gharbi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ammon Bundy, black lives matter, Editor's Picks, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Occupy Wall Street, Oregon standoff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The local demonstration was co-opted by a militia, led by Nevada native Ammon Bundy, now calling itself Citizens for Constitutional Freedom.\nHowever, any similarities between the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom and Islamic terrorists are vastly outweighed by the differences between them.\nDid conservative lawmakers celebrate black people affirming these constitutional rights?\nAs a matter of fact, the open-carry movement was not started by white conservatives, but by the Black Panthers.\nMany have been eager to brand Bundy and his militia as terrorists, referring to them as \u201cYee-haw-dists\u201d or \u201cVanilla ISIS.\u201d And to be sure, there are similarities with Islamic militant groups."}
