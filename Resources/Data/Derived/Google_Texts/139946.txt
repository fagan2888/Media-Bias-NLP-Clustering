LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) — Officials at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport say an investigation has found that a bag near gates at its “A” terminal is not a hazard.

The airport tweeted earlier Tuesday that fire and rescue crews were investigating a possibly suspicious bag near the A terminal, which is used by Southwest Airlines. As a precaution, the airport moved passengers in the vicinity away.

Airport spokesman Jonathan Dean says the investigation determined the bag was not a hazard.

The airport says gates are now clear for normal operations.
