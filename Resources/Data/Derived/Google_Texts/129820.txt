A Port Charlotte woman was stabbed several times inside her home, and neighbors say her son did it.

Alex Toth, 24, was arrested late Friday in connection with the attack.

It happened around 5:30 p.m. on Belinda Avenue. Neighbors said they didn't hear an argument, but did hear the woman screaming.

They said she was bleeding as she stumbled down her driveway, begging for someone to help her.

Kimberly Brazell heard the desperate pleas for help and noticed the woman had a butcher knife sticking out of her back. "By the time the other neighbors were here too, we were just trying to console her."

Brazell called it "something from a horror movie. I have never seen that much blood in my life."

"She was just, you know, kept screaming over and over again, 'he stabbed me,' and we asked her and she said her son," Brazell said.

Neighbors said the woman spelled her son's name for them as she lay on the ground.

Corydon Perkins Jr. said he saw Toth come out of the house.

"He made eye contact with me. He shut the door," Brazell said.

"And then he took off out to the back of the house," Corydon said.

Toth is behind bars while his mother recovers in the hospital. Neighbors said she had a knife in her back when they found her.

"We don't know how many wounds she had, but it was a lot of wounds," Brazell said.

Investigators haven't released a motive for the attack.
