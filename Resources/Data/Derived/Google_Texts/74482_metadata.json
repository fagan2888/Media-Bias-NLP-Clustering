So what are some of the issues surrounding birthright citizenship, and how are those opposed looking to end it? The Daily Signal explains.\n\nUPDATE: Several commenters have raised questions about the 1898 Supreme Court case, U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark. Professor Edward Erler addresses the case in \u201cThe Heritage Guide to the Constitution\u201d and Heritage senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky said this about it in a Fox News op-ed:\n\nEven in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the 1898 case most often cited by \u201cbirthright\u201d supporters due to its overbroad language, the Court only held that a child born of lawful, permanent residents was a U.S. citizen. That is a far cry from saying that a child born of individuals who are here illegally must be considered a U.S. citizen.\n\nVideo edited and produced by Tate Holcombe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the last week, a new debate has been brewing over birthright citizenship, an issue that has been discussed by the 2016 Republican presidential field.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Over the last week, a new debate has been brewing over birthright citizenship, an issue that has been discussed by the 2016 Republican presidential field.", "title": "The Debate Over Birthright Citizenship", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlsix539090.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-21T22:50:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PCeejb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Over the last week, a new debate has been brewing over birthright citizenship, an issue that has been discussed by the 2016 Republican presidential field.", "title": "The Debate Over Birthright Citizenship", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlsix539090.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-08-20T15:48:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-21T22:50:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "birthright citizenship, 2016 Republican presidential election, citizenship"}, "article_summary": "Birthright citizenship allows children born in the United States to be granted automatic citizenship, including those born to illegal immigrants.\nOver the last week, the debate over birthright citizenship has divided the 2016 Republican presidential field and put the spotlight back on immigration.\nSo what are some of the issues surrounding birthright citizenship, and how are those opposed looking to end it?\nUPDATE: Several commenters have raised questions about the 1898 Supreme Court case, U.S. v.
