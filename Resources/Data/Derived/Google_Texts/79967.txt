The U.S. Senate confirmed former Oklahoma Congressman Brad Carson as the 31st Under Secretary of the Army this week.

President Barack Obama nominated Carson last year.

Carson previously served as General Counsel to the Department of the Army and the Department of Defense, a post he had held since 2012.

He also served in Congress representing Oklahoma's Second District from 2001 to 2005.

Carson's predecessor, Dr. Joseph W. Westphal, was a faculty member of Oklahoma State University, where he worked as a professor of political science, later becoming head of the department.
