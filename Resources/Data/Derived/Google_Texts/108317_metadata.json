Swaab, Editor's Picks, Neuroscience, phil robertson, pope francis, Religion, Science, We Are Our Brains, Technology News, Life News\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the most interesting question about religion isn\u2019t whether God exists but why so many people are religious. There are around 10,000 different religions, each of which is convinced that there\u2019s only one Truth and that they alone possess it. Hating people with a different faith seems to be part of belief. Around the year 1500, the church reformer Martin Luther described Jews as a \u201cbrood of vipers.\u201d Over the centuries the Christian hatred of the Jews led to pogroms and ultimately made the Holocaust possible. In 1947, over a million people were slaughtered when British India was partitioned into India for the Hindus and Pakistan for the Muslims. Nor has interfaith hatred diminished since then. Since the year 2000, 43 percent of civil wars have been of a religious nature.\n\nAlmost 64 percent of the world\u2019s population is Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, or Hindu. And faith is extremely tenacious. For many years, Communism was the only permitted belief in China and religion was banned, being regarded, in the tradition of Karl Marx, as the opium of the masses. But in 2007, one-third of Chinese people over the age of 16 said that they were religious. Since that figure comes from a state-controlled newspaper, the China Daily, the true number of believers is likely at least that high. Around 95 percent of Americans say that they believe in God, 90 percent pray, 82 percent believe that God can perform miracles, and over 70 percent believe in life after death. It\u2019s striking that only 50 percent believe in hell, which shows a certain lack of consistency. In the Netherlands, a much more secular country, the percentages are lower. A study carried out in April 2007 showed that in the space of 40 years, secularization had increased from 33 to 61 percent. Over half of the Dutch people doubt the existence of a higher power and are either agnostic or believe in an unspecified \u201csomething.\u201d Only 14 percent are atheists, the same percentage as Protestants. There are slightly more Catholics (16 percent).\n\nIn 2006, during a symposium in Istanbul, Herman van Praag, a professor of biological psychiatry, taking his lead from the 95 percent of believers in the United States, tried to convince me that atheism was an \u201canomaly.\u201d \u201cThat depends on who you compare yourself to,\u201d I replied. In 1996 a poll of American scientists revealed that only 39 percent were believers, a much smaller percentage than the national average. Only 7 percent of the country\u2019s top scientists (defined for this poll as the members of the National Academy of Sciences) professed a belief in God, while almost no Nobel laureates are religious. A mere 3 percent of the eminent scientists who are members of Britain\u2019s Royal Society are religious. Moreover, meta-analysis has shown a correlation among atheism, education, and IQ. So there are striking differences within populations, and it\u2019s clear that degree of atheism is linked to intelligence, education, academic achievement, and a positive interest in natural science. Scientists also differ per discipline: Biologists are less prone to believe in God and the hereafter than physicists. So it isn\u2019t surprising that the vast majority (78 percent) of eminent evolutionary biologists polled called themselves materialists (meaning that they believe physical matter to be the only reality). Almost three quarters (72 percent) of them regarded religion as a social phenomenon that had evolved along with Homo sapiens. They saw it as part of evolution, rather than conflicting with it.\n\nIt does indeed seem that religion must have afforded an evolutionary advantage. Receptiveness to religion is determined by spirituality, which is 50 percent genetically determined, as twin studies have shown. Spirituality is a characteristic that everyone has to a degree, even if they don\u2019t belong to a church. Religion is the local shape given to our spiritual feelings. The decision to be religious or not certainly isn\u2019t \u201cfree.\u201d The surroundings in which we grow up cause the parental religion to be imprinted in our brain circuitries during early development, in a similar way to our native language. Chemical messengers like serotonin affect the extent to which we are spiritual: The number of serotonin receptors in the brain corresponds to scores for spirituality. And substances that affect serotonin, like LSD, mescaline (from the peyote cactus), and psilocybin (from magic mushrooms) can generate mystical and spiritual experiences. Spiritual experiences can also be induced with substances that affect the brain\u2019s opiate system.\n\nDean Hamer believes that he has identified the gene that predisposes our level of spirituality, as he describes in \u201cThe God Gene\u201d (2004). But since it will probably prove to be simply one of the many genes involved, he\u2019d have done better to call his book \u201cA God Gene.\u201d The gene in question codes for VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporter 2), a protein that wraps chemical messengers (monoamines) in vesicles for transport through the nerve fibers and is crucial to many brain functions.\n\nThe religious programming of a child\u2019s brain starts after birth. The British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins is rightly incensed when reference is made to \u201cChristian, Muslim, or Jewish children,\u201d because young children don\u2019t have any kind of faith of their own; faith is imprinted in them at a very impressionable stage by their Christian, Muslim, or Jewish parents. Dawkins rightly points out that society wouldn\u2019t tolerate the notion of atheist, humanist, or agnostic four-year-olds and that you shouldn\u2019t teach children what to think but how to think. Dawkins sees programmed belief as a byproduct of evolution. Children accept warnings and instructions issued by their parents and other authorities instantly and without argument, which protects them from danger. As a result, young children are credulous and therefore easy to indoctrinate. This might explain the universal tendency to retain the parental faith. Copying, the foundation of social learning, is an extremely efficient mechanism. We even have a separate system of mirror neurons for it. In this way, religious ideas like the belief that there\u2019s life after death, that if you die as a martyr you go to paradise and are given 72 virgins as a reward, that unbelievers should be persecuted, and that nothing is more important than belief in God are also passed on from generation to generation and imprinted in our brain circuitry. We all know from those around us how hard it is to shed ideas that have been instilled in early development.\n\nThe Evolutionary Advantage of Religion\n\n\u201cReligion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet.\u201d \u2014 Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nThe evolution of modern man has given rise to five behavioral characteristics common to all cultures: language, toolmaking, music, art, and religion. Precursors of all these characteristics, with the exception of religion, can be found in the animal kingdom. However, the evolutionary advantage of religion to humankind is clear.\n\n(1) First, religion binds groups. Jews have been kept together as a group by their faith, in spite of the Diaspora, the Inquisition, and the Holocaust. For leaders, belief is an excellent instrument. As Seneca said, \u201cReligion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful.\u201d Religions use various mechanisms to keep the group together:\n\nOne is the message that it\u2019s sinful to marry an unbeliever (that is, someone with a different belief). As an old Dutch proverb states, \u201cWhen two faiths share a pillow, the devil sleeps in the middle.\u201d This principle is common to all religions, with attendant punishments and warnings. Segregating education according to faith makes it easier to reject others, because ignorance breeds contempt.\n\nAnother is the imposition of numerous social rules on the individual in the name of God, sometimes accompanied by dire threats about the fate of those who don\u2019t keep them. One of the Ten Commandments, for instance, is lent force by the threat of a curse \u201cunto the fourth generation.\u201d Blasphemy is severely punished in the Old Testament and is still a capital offense in Pakistan. Threats have also helped to make churches rich and powerful. In the Middle Ages, enormous sums were paid in return for \u201cindulgences,\u201d shortening the time that someone would spend in purgatory. As Johann Tetzel, a preacher known for selling indulgences, is alleged to have put it, \u201cAs soon as a coin in the coffer rings, a soul from purgatory springs.\u201d In the beginning of the previous century, Catholic clerics were still automatically awarded indulgences based on the rank they held in the church. Threats and intimidation are effective even in this day and age. In Colorado, a pastor has introduced the idea of \u201cHell Houses,\u201d where fundamentalist Christian schools send children to frighten them about the punishments that await them in the afterlife if they stray from the straight and narrow.\n\nA further binding mechanism is being recognizable as a member of the group. This can take the form of distinguishing signs, like black clothing, a yarmulke, a cross, a headscarf, or a burka; or physical characteristics, like the circumcision of boys or girls; or knowledge of the holy scriptures, prayers, and rituals. You must be able to see who belongs to the group in order to obtain protection from fellow members. This mechanism is so strong that it seems senseless to try to ban people from wearing distinguishing accessories or items of clothing like headscarves. Social contacts within the group also bring with them considerable advantages and play an important role in American churches. The feeling of group kinship has been strengthened over the centuries by holy relics worshiped by the various faiths. It doesn\u2019t matter that there are wagonloads of Buddha\u2019s ashes in temples in China and Japan, nor that so many splinters of the True Cross have been preserved that, according to Erasmus, you could build a fleet of ships from them. The point is that such things keep the group together. The same applies to the 20 or so churches that claim to have Christ\u2019s original foreskin in their possession. (According to Jewish tradition, he was circumcised at the age of eight days.) Some theologians have argued that Christ\u2019s foreskin was restored on his ascension to heaven. However, according to the 17th-century theologian Leo Allatius, the Holy Prepuce ascended to heaven separately, forming the ring around Saturn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Pope Francis to Phil Robertson: Why are some people of faith generous \u2014\u00a0while others are nuts?", "title": "This is your brain on religion: Uncovering the science of belief", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Pope Francis to Phil Robertson: Why are some people of faith generous \u2014\u00a0while others are nuts?", "title": "This is your brain on religion: Uncovering the science of belief", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/04/this_is_your_brain_on_religion_uncovering_the_science_of_belief/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/pope_neuroscience.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Pope Francis to Phil Robertson: Why are some people of faith generous \u2014\u00a0while others are nuts?", "title": "This is your brain on religion: Uncovering the science of belief", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/pope_neuroscience.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "D.F.
