In fact, there\u2019s less than a ten-point gap between those who identify as a Democrat or Republicans in the 18-20-year-old bracket. For older Millennials, aged 25-29, the split is starker, with them breaking for Democrats over Republicans 50/27.\n\nAsma Khalid of NPR wrote that the younger millennials who aren\u2019t as left leaning grew up in a different time, post-9/11 and in the midst of a major recession. Yet, once Millennials get a job and start making between $40k-60k a year support for income redistribution, and other liberal policies related to fiscal policy, drops precipitously.\n\nThen again, Millennials are known for having political views that make no sense. Case in point, they generally support a large government, but when it comes to social security, they support\u2013by a wide margin\u2013the creation of private accounts. They support universal health care, but don\u2019t like Obamacare. On the flip side, they also do not support affirmative action policies, labeling them \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s end this on a positive note. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the majority of the 18-20-year-old vote. Fifty-seven percent of 18-year-olds, 59 percent of 19-year-olds, and 54 percent of 20-year-olds all cast their votes for Romney. As Jon Sides, Associate Professor of Political Science at George Washington University, noted, this means Democrats could potentially have a young people problem of their own in future elections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Silver lining?.05/26/2016 18:42:41PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Silver lining?", "title": "Poll: 18-20-Year-Olds Aren\u2019t As Liberal As Older Millennials", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/10/07/poll-1820yearolds-arent-as-liberal-as-older-millennials-n2062621", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/301/0a5d60c9-1db3-4039-9724-87243c76a532.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Silver lining?", "title": "Poll: 18-20-Year-Olds Aren\u2019t As Liberal As Older Millennials", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/10/07/poll-1820yearolds-arent-as-liberal-as-older-millennials-n2062621", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/301/0a5d60c9-1db3-4039-9724-87243c76a532.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: 18-20-Year-Olds Aren\u2019t As Liberal As Older Millennials, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "A Harvard Institute of Politics poll found something a bit interesting regarding Millennial voting patterns; younger ones aren\u2019t as liberal.\nAsma Khalid of NPR wrote that the younger millennials who aren\u2019t as left leaning grew up in a different time, post-9/11 and in the midst of a major recession.\nFor older Millennials, aged 25-29, the split is starker, with them breaking for Democrats over Republicans 50/27.\nYet, once Millennials get a job and start making between $40k-60k a year support for income redistribution, and other liberal policies related to fiscal policy, drops precipitously.\nIn fact, there\u2019s less than a ten-point gap between those who identify as a Democrat or Republicans in the 18-20-year-old bracket."}
