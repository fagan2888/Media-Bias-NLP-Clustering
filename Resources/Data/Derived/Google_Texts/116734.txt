It's Governor Corbett's plan for Medicaid money from the Affordable Care Act.



Corbett's plan is called Healthy PA. It's just weeks away from going into effect on January 1. Even in his waning days in office Corbett's administration is moving forward with Healthy PA.



Wolf wants to undo Corbett's plan for limited Medicaid expansion by accepting all the money from President Obama's ACA - without conditions. He comes into office on January 20, after Corbett's plan goes into effect January 1.

Katie McGinty, Wolf's chief of staff, says the Corbett Administration should start dismantling Healthy PA now, since Wolf is not backing off his campaign promise.
