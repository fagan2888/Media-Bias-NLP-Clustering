Now judges are taking away something more precious: their sons.\n\nRiccardo Cordi\u2019, a shy 18-year-old scion of one of Italy\u2019s most notorious mob families, is a pioneer in a new strategy to fight the mafia by exiling crime clan sons from their homes and families. Riccardo is the first of about 20 sons sent into a kind of rehab away from the mob by juvenile courts in the southern region of Calabria, home to the dangerous \u2018ndrangheta syndicate.\n\nBy age 16, Riccardo seemed destined to go the way of his father, a reputed boss gunned down in a turf war, and three elder brothers in prison on mafia-related convictions. Their photos line the wall of the fortress-like Cordi\u2019 home in Calabria, seen in an exclusive visit by The Associated Press, in a testimony to the rule of blood in the powerful \u2018ndrangheta.\n\nBut when Riccardo was charged with attempted theft and damage to a police car, judge Roberto Di Bella followed up his acquittal with a startling order: The \u2018ndrangheta family prince would be sent away to Sicily until he turned 18.\n\nDi Bella had sent Riccardo\u2019s three brothers to prison and wanted to spare the last son a similar fate. He cited legal provisions that allowed courts to remove minors from families incapable of properly raising them.\n\nRiccardo\u2019s mother seethed, but there was nothing she could do.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll take him away anyway,\u201d the judge told her.\n\nRiccardo was placed in a Sicilian facility for troubled youths where nobody cared that he was a Cordi\u2019. Rules were rigid, including no going out at night. Everyone made their own bed and sat down for meals at a communal table.\n\n\u201cIt was tough. I was counting the days,\u201d Riccardo said in interviews with The AP.\n\nThe judge put Riccardo under the wing of a fledgling psychologist, Enrico Interdonato. The psychologist had helped launch a courageous band of youths who encourage Sicilian business owners to stop paying \u201cprotection\u201d money to the Mafia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Italy fights mafia with new strategy: banish sons", "author": "Frances D'emilio", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Italy fights mafia with new strategy: banish sons", "title": "Italy fights mafia with new strategy: banish sons", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/28/italy_fights_mafia_with_new_strategy_banish_sons/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/italy-mafia-banished-sons.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Italy fights mafia with new strategy: banish sons", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/italy-mafia-banished-sons.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Italy fights mafia with new strategy: banish sons", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Italy fights mafia with new strategy: banish sons", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde81b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsLOCRI, Italy (AP) \u2014 First Italy fought its mafia mobsters by confiscating their wealth.\nRiccardo Cordi\u2019, a shy 18-year-old scion of one of Italy\u2019s most notorious mob families, is a pioneer in a new strategy to fight the mafia by exiling crime clan sons from their homes and families.\nThe psychologist had helped launch a courageous band of youths who encourage Sicilian business owners to stop paying \u201cprotection\u201d money to the Mafia.\nRiccardo was placed in a Sicilian facility for troubled youths where nobody cared that he was a Cordi\u2019.\nRiccardo is the first of about 20 sons sent into a kind of rehab away from the mob by juvenile courts in the southern region of Calabria, home to the dangerous \u2018ndrangheta syndicate."}
