Minneapolis, MN

Minneapolis authorities are cleaning up after a Metro Transit bus lost control and drove onto the sidewalk in downtown Minneapolis, damaging garbage cans and smashing into light posts.



A report says no passengers or pedestrians were seriously hurt. The driver was removed on a stretcher, and a report says he died at a hospital.



The accident happened Friday about 10 a.m. Witnesses say the No. 10 bus hit street lights and the awning of the WCCO-TV building.



WCCO meteorologist Mike Augustyniak says he was almost hit as he walked by. He says the bus was moving slowly enough for him to run around it, but it sideswiped a bicyclist who suffered scrapes.



One passenger twisted his ankle as he ran forward to try to hit the brakes.
