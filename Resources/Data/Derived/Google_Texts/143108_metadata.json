The Holiday Eve Document Dump. It\u2019s the Christmas gift that keeps on giving \u2026 to government officials that want a pretense at transparency while keeping too much notice falling on embarrassing revelations. The Obama administration used that option on Christmas Eve, but as reported by Politico\u2019s Hanna Trudo, so much is redacted that it may not have made much difference anyway:\n\nThursday\u2019s document dump, put out by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in compliance with a Freedom of Information request, includes correspondence sent from American intelligence officials in 2011 and 2012. The emails \u2014 edited to conceal what is considered to be sensitive information \u2014 provide few new details about the lethal September 2012 terrorist attack on the diplomatic mission in Libya or American-born Al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. In the first email, only two of 17 lines of text were not blacked out. Another email consists of the text \u201cAttached it the final draft; we need comment/coordination by 1000, Friday (tomorrow) 19 October 2012,\u201d followed completely by blacked-out text. Other emails consist of the text of news clippings from Reuters, the Washington Post and other organizations. \u2026 Other memos grouped with the Thursday morning release include specific instructions from 2013 on how to implement existing protocol on protecting intelligence, as well as a schedule of a counterintelligence executive from 2015.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle wasn\u2019t impressed, either:\n\n\u201cAcutely redacted\u201d isn\u2019t an overstatement. Practically the only items that aren\u2019t redacted out of this are several media reports passed around the intel communities for \u201csituational awareness\u201d of the political landscape. The redactions are to keep classified information under wraps, according to the codes linked to the blacked-out text. The original messages were classified at the highest levels: TOP SECRET, NOFORN (no foreign dissemination), and designations for compartmentalization appear throughout the 16 pages of e-mails. The Awlaki memo was released separately and is lightly redacted, apparently only to protect the identity of an intelligence operative who worked on the review.\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t appear is anything new of significance about either the Benghazi attack, although there is a tantalizing reference to \u201can IC-coordinated summary of our assessment of the threat in advance \u2026 and our assessment post-attack\u201d that is dated from October 22, 2012. That report went to \u201cour oversight committees on the Hill\u201d at the same time, and was classified TOP SECRET//HCS/SI-G/TK/ORCON/NOFORN. Interestingly, that message alone has a declassification code of \u201c50X1-HUM,\u201d which means that it bypasses the regular 25-year declassify date and is instead scheduled for default declassification in 2062. I\u2019ll be 99 years old by that time, so maybe one of my younger Townhall colleagues will have to follow up on this lead.\n\nOtherwise, we have a dump without much data. It seems like an odd opportunity to waste, but perhaps the FOIA release will turn out to be less responsive than required. It\u2019s worth watching, even if it\u2019s into our dotage.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cAcutely redacted.\u201d", "title": "The Obama administration\u2019s curiously meh Christmas Eve data dump on Benghazi", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/26/the-obama-administrations-curiously-meh-christmas-eve-data-dump-on-benghazi/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T16:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-26T15:53:45+00:00"}, "keywords": "Anwar al-Awlaki, Benghazi, classified, State Department,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration\u2019s curiously meh Christmas Eve data dump on Benghaziposted at 11:01 am on December 26, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyWhat\u2019s better than a Friday afternoon document dump?\nThe Holiday Eve Document Dump.\nThe redactions are to keep classified information under wraps, according to the codes linked to the blacked-out text.\nIt\u2019s the Christmas gift that keeps on giving \u2026 to government officials that want a pretense at transparency while keeping too much notice falling on embarrassing revelations.\nOther emails consist of the text of news clippings from Reuters, the Washington Post and other organizations."}
