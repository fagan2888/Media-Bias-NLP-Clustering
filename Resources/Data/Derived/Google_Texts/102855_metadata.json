He had been invited to deliver the definitive review of his theory of relativity to the Yearbook of Electronics and Radioactivity. It was a tall order, to summarize such an important piece of work at such short notice, especially since he could do so only in his spare time. From 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday, Einstein could be found working at the Bern Federal Office for Intellectual Property in the newly built Postal and Telegraph Building, where he would meticulously pore over plans for newfangled electrical contraptions and figure out if there was any merit in them. Einstein\u2019s boss had advised him, \u201cWhen you pick up an application, think that everything the inventor says is wrong,\u201d and he took his advice to heart. For much of the day, the notes and calculations for his own theories and discoveries had to be relegated to the second drawer of his desk, which he referred to as his \u201ctheoretical physics department.\u201d\n\nEinstein\u2019s review would recap his triumphant marriage of the old mechanics of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton with the new electricity and magnetism of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell. It would explain much of the weirdness that Einstein had uncovered a few years before, such as how clocks would run more slowly when moving, or how objects would shrink if they were speeding ahead. It would explain his strange and magical formula that showed how mass and energy were interchangeable, and that nothing could move faster than the speed of light. His review of his principle of relativity would describe how almost all of physics should be governed by a new common set of rules.\n\nIn 1905, over a period of just a few months, Einstein had written a string of papers that were already transforming physics. In that inspired burst he had pointed out that light behaves like bundles of energy, much like particles of matter. He had also shown that the jittery, chaotic paths of pollen and dust careening through a dish of water could arise from the turmoil of water molecules, vibrating and bouncing off one another. And he had tackled a problem that had been plaguing physicists for almost half a century: how the laws of physics seem to behave differently depending on how you look at them. He had brought them together with his principle of relativity.\n\nAll these discoveries were a staggering achievement, and Einstein had made them all while working as a lowly patent expert at the Swiss patent office in Bern, sifting through the scientific and technological developments of the day. In 1907, he was still there, having yet to move into the august academic world that seemed to elude him. In fact, for someone who had just rewritten some of the fundamental rules of physics, Einstein was thoroughly undistinguished. Throughout his unimpressive academic studies at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Einstein skipped classes that didn\u2019t interest him and antagonized the very people who could nurture his genius. One of his professors told him, \u201cYou are a very clever boy . . . But you have one great fault: you\u2019ll never let yourself be told anything.\u201d When Einstein\u2019s supervisor prevented him from working on a topic of his own choice, Einstein handed in a lackluster final essay, lowering his grade to a point where he was unable to secure a post as an assistant at any of the universities to which he had applied.\n\nFrom his graduation in 1900 until he finally landed his job in the patent office in 1902, Einstein\u2019s career was a sequence of failures. To compound his frustration, the doctoral thesis he submitted to the University of Zurich in 1901 was rejected a year later. In his submission, Einstein had set about to demolish some of the ideas put forward by Ludwig Boltzmann, one of the great theoretical physicists of the end of the nineteenth century. Einstein\u2019s iconoclasm had not gone over well. It wasn\u2019t until 1905, when he submitted one of his magical papers, \u201cA New Determination of Molecular Dimensions,\u201d that he finally obtained his doctorate. The degree, a newly diplomatic Einstein discovered, \u201cconsiderably facilitates relations with people.\u201d\n\nWhile Einstein struggled, his friend Marcel Grossmann was on the fast track to becoming an august professor. Well organized, studious, and beloved by his teachers, it was Grossmann who had saved Einstein from going off the rails by keeping detailed, immaculate notebooks of the lecture courses. Grossmann became close friends with Einstein and Einstein\u2019s future wife, Mileva Maric\u0301, while they studied together in Zurich, and all three graduated in the same year. Unlike Einstein\u2019s, Grossmann\u2019s career had progressed smoothly from then on. He had been appointed as an assistant in Zurich and in 1902 had obtained his doctorate. After a short stint teaching in high schools, Grossmann had become a professor of descriptive geometry at the Eidgeno\u0308ssische Technische Hochschule, known as the ETH, in Zurich. Einstein had failed to even get an appointment as a schoolteacher. It was only through the recommendation of Grossmann\u2019s father to an acquaintance, the head of the patent office in Bern, that Einstein had finally secured a job as a patent expert.\n\nEinstein\u2019s job in the patent office was a blessing. After years of financial instability and depending on his father for an income, he was finally able to marry Mileva and begin to raise a family in Bern. The relative monotony of the patent office, with its clearly defined tasks and lack of distractions, seemed to be an ideal setting for Einstein to think things through. His assigned work took only a few hours to complete each day, leaving him time to focus on his puzzles. Sitting at his small wooden desk with only a few books and the papers from his \u201ctheoretical physics department,\u201d he would perform experiments in his head. In these thought experiments (gedankenexperimenten as he called them in German) he would imagine situations and constructions in which he could explore physical laws to find out what they might do to the real world. In the absence of a real lab, he would play out carefully crafted games in his head, enacting events that he would scrutinize in detail. With the results of these experiments, Einstein knew just enough mathematics to be able to put his ideas to paper, creating exquisitely crafted jewels that would ultimately change the direction of physics.\n\nHis employers at the patent office were pleased with Einstein\u2019s work and promoted him to Expert II Class, yet they remained oblivious to his growing reputation. Einstein was still working on a daily quota of patents in 1907 when the German physicist Johannes Stark commissioned Einstein to write his review \u201cOn the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn From It.\u201d He was given two months to write it, and in those two months Einstein realized that his principle of relativity was incomplete. It would need a thorough overhaul if it was to be truly general.\n\nThe article in the Yearbook was to be a summary of Einstein\u2019s original principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should look the same in any inertial frame of reference. The basic idea behind the principle was not new and had been around for centuries.\n\nThe laws of physics and mechanics are rules for how things move, speed up, or slow down when subjected to forces. In the seventeenth century, the English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton laid out a set of laws for how objects respond to mechanical forces. His laws of motion consistently explain what happens when two billiard balls collide, or when a bullet is fired out of a gun, or when a ball is thrown up in the air.\n\nAn inertial frame of reference is one that moves at a constant velocity. If you\u2019re reading this in a stationary spot, like a cozy chair in your den or a table in a cafe\u0301, you\u2019re in an inertial frame. Another classic example is a smoothly moving fast train with the windows closed. If you\u2019re sitting inside it, once the train gets up to speed there\u2019s no way to know you\u2019re moving. In principle, it should be impossible to tell the difference between two inertial frames even if one is moving at a high speed and the other is at rest. If you do an experiment in one inertial frame measuring the forces acting on an object, you should get the same result as in any other inertial frame. The laws of physics are identical, regardless of the frame.\n\nThe nineteenth century brought a completely new set of laws that wove together two fundamental forces: electricity and magnetism. At first glance, electricity and magnetism appear to be two separate phenomena. We see electricity in the lights in our home or lightning in the sky, and magnetism in the magnets stuck to our fridge or the way the North Pole draws a compass. The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell showed that these two forces could be seen as different manifestations of one underlying force, electromagnetism, and that how they are perceived depends on how an observer is moving. A person sitting next to a bar magnet would experience magnetism but no electricity. But a person whizzing by would experience not only the magnetism but also a modicum of electricity. Maxwell unified the two forces into one that remains equivalent regardless of an observer\u2019s position or speed.\n\nIf you try to combine Newton\u2019s laws of motion with Maxwell\u2019s laws for electromagnetism, troubles arise. If the world indeed obeys both of these sets of laws, it is possible, in principle, to construct an instrument out of magnets, wires, and pulleys that will not sense any force in one inertial frame but can register a force in another inertial frame, violating the rule that inertial frames should be indistinguishable from one another. Newton\u2019s laws and Maxwell\u2019s laws thus appear inconsistent with each other. Einstein wanted to fix these \u201casymmetries\u201d in the laws of physics.\n\nIn the years leading up to his 1905 papers, Einstein devised his concise principle of relativity through a series of thought experiments aimed at solving this problem. His mental tinkering culminated in two postulates. The first was simply a restatement of the principle: The laws of physics must look the same in any inertial frame. The second postulate was more radical: In any inertial frame, the speed of light always has the same value and is 299,792 kilometers per second. These postulates could be used to adjust Newton\u2019s laws of motion and mechanics so that when they were combined with Maxwell\u2019s laws of electromagnetism, inertial frames remained completely indistinguishable. Einstein\u2019s new principle of relativity also led to some startling results.\n\nThe latter postulate required some adjustments to Newton\u2019s laws. In the classic Newtonian universe, speed is additive. Light emitted from the front of a speeding train moves faster than light coming from a stationary source. In Einstein\u2019s universe, this is no longer the case. Instead, there is a cosmic speed limit set at 299,792 kilometers per second. Even the most powerful rocket would be unable to break that speed barrier. But then odd things happen. So, for example, someone traveling on a train moving at close to the speed of light will age more slowly when observed by someone sitting at a station platform, watching the train go by. And the train itself will look shorter when it is moving than when it is sitting still. Time dilates and space contracts. These strange phenomena are signs that something much deeper is going on: in the world of relativity, time and space are intertwined and interchangeable.\n\nWith his principle of relativity, Einstein seemed to have simplified physics, albeit with strange consequences. But in the autumn of 1907, as Einstein set out to write the review, he had to admit that while his theory seemed to work well, it wasn\u2019t yet complete. Newton\u2019s theory of gravity didn\u2019t fit into his picture of relativity.\n\nBefore Albert Einstein came along, Isaac Newton was like a god in the world of physics. Newton\u2019s work was held up as the most stunning success of modern thought. In the late seventeenth century, he had unified the force of gravity acting on the very small and the very large alike in one simple equation. It could explain the cosmos as well as everyday life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before he changed the world forever, Albert Einstein staggered from one early defeat to another", "title": "Einstein the failure: How history\u2019s greatest physicist flirted with disaster", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Before he changed the world forever, Albert Einstein staggered from one early defeat to another", "title": "Einstein the failure: How history\u2019s greatest physicist flirted with disaster", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/16/einstein_the_failure_how_historys_greatest_physicist_flirted_with_disaster/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/alberteinstein.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before he changed the world forever, Albert Einstein staggered from one early defeat to another", "title": "Einstein the failure: How history\u2019s greatest physicist flirted with disaster", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/alberteinstein.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Pedro G.
