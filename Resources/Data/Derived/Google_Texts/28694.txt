TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) â€” Gov. Rick Scott is reversing course and says he no longer supports Medicaid expansion in a move that threatens to undo budget talks between the state House and Senate.

In a statement Monday, Scott expressed concern that the federal government might not make good on their promise to fund Medicaid for an additional 800,000 Floridians. The decision comes as Scott and the Legislature have been in intense negotiations with the federal government to extend more than $1 billion dollars in hospital grants. But the feds have said no and the disagreement has spilled over to Medicaid expansion.

Scott originally opposed expansion, but in an emotional speech two years ago he came out in support.

The disagreement has crippled Tallahassee lawmakers as they finalize a new state budget before the end of the session on May 1.
