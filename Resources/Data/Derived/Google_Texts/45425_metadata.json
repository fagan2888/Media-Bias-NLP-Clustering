The third group, it must be admitted, somewhat unsteadily combines neoconservatives proper (such as William Kristol) with old-fashioned defense hawks (such as Donald Rumsfeld), but perhaps this is the Republican \u201cbig tent\u201d we keep hearing about.\n\nIn any case, this neat three-part logic was roiled by two events in 2008: the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d and the election of Barack Obama as president. The latter\u2019s decision to respond to the crisis with a fairly traditional mix of demand-side remedies \u2014 some tax cuts, some increased spending \u2014 ignited a fire storm on the right. CNBC\u2019s Rick Santelli is often fingered as the principal arsonist. On Feb. 19, 2009, outraged by Obama\u2019s plan to assist homeowners caught up in the collapse of the housing market, Santelli went on air to unburden himself of the following \u201cideas\u201d:\n\n\u201cGovernment is promoting bad behavior\u2026 Do we really want to subsidize the losers\u2019 mortgages? This is is America! How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage? President Obama, are you listening? How about we all stop paying our mortgages?!\u201d\n\nThe spark had been struck; the Tea Party roared to life. Five years later it has remade American politics, largely through its impact on the GOP. Profoundly alienated from the modern American state, which it regards as a bureaucratic embodiment of foreign social-democratic ideals, intensely ideological, intransigent and scornful of compromise, the Tea Party has used its electoral success in the South and Midwest \u2014 and its power in primaries and caucuses \u2014 to impose sharp limits on the policy options available to GOP politicians. Rick Santelli\u2019s wildfire consumed immigration reform and an extension of unemployment benefits; it flared into a government shutdown and crept perilously close to two debt defaults.\n\nOne consequence of the Tea Party ascendancy has been a new prominence for the term \u201clibertarian.\u201d In many ways this is unfortunate. There is reason to believe that any connections between libertarianism and the Tea Party are tenuous at best. A recent study found that 60 percent of libertarians do not identify with the Tea Party, while only 26 percent of Tea Party supporters think of themselves as libertarians. (Fully twice as many affiliate with the religious right.) Still, an impression persists that the Republican Party is increasingly animated by the spirit of John Galt. I think there are mainly four reasons for this.\n\nThe first is that some conservative activists, quick to sense the electoral (and financial) potential of the Tea Party, moved quickly to associate its concerns with their own, often quite different, agendas. (The absurdist theater that swirled around Dick Armey\u2019s departure from FreedomWorks is apposite here.)\n\nA second \u2014 more important \u2014 source of confusion is that \u201clibertarian,\u201d as a rubric, offers Republicans certain rhetorical advantages. It suggests they\u2019re for something and not just against the Democrats, and that this something is related to \u201cliberty.\u201d (And it performs this latter function while avoiding the hated epithet \u201cliberal.\u201d) It also serves an irenic purpose insofar as it gestures at common ground for Tea Partyers, the religious right generally, and Wall Streeters. If these factions can agree on anything, it\u2019s that they want \u201cless government\u201d \u2014 meaning less liberal government \u2014 and this is easily elided into the claim that they want more liberty. As long as no one inspects the logic too closely, this \u201cWe\u2019re all libertarians now\u201d line can seem helpfully plausible. Which brings us to the fourth reason, a national media always ready to exploit the helpfully plausible in its constant search for the appealingly (or is it appallingly?) simple.\n\nSo one increasingly hears certain prominent Republicans referred to as libertarians or as members of the party\u2019s \u201clibertarian wing.\u201d Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan have been identified as such at one time or another, as have (with slightly more reason) both Pauls, Ron and Rand. This, again, is a mistake. As I\u2019ve argued elsewhere, no important Republican politician is a libertarian. Still, perceptions are important in politics, and there is certainly no doubt that real libertarians belong \u2014 noisily, busily belong \u2014 to the Republican coalition.\n\nGiven this, all of us have an interest in understanding the nature of libertarian thought, and in knowing whether it forms the basis of a workable politics. Michael Lind has written brilliantly about these issues (here, for example) in the context of practical politics. I want to take them up in a more theoretical light. I will focus on the central concept of libertarian thought \u2014 the idea of personal freedom \u2014 and argue that it cannot be coherently explained on libertarian grounds. I will also argue that a libertarian society, if fully realized, would be actively hostile to the development of free selves. Libertarianism, in other words, cannot give a persuasive account of its own core concept. It\u2019s as close to self-refuting as a political theory can be.\n\n* * *\n\nSome criticisms of libertarian thought are unwarranted. For example, it is sometimes alleged that libertarians lack concern for others, or are motivated only by greed, or embrace a crass, materialistic ethic. Libertarians think such charges are based on a simple confusion. Their intent is to advocate for liberty, they say; what free people choose to do with their liberty is an entirely separate matter. I think this reply is conclusive if it is meant to rebut the claim that libertarians, because they value freedom, must also value the content of every free choice. (In other contexts, as I will argue below, it is much less conclusive.) That claim really is a confusion. I do not have to approve of pornography simply because I endorse the First Amendment. Similarly, I do not have to approve of choices to be selfish or shallow because I favor economic and political liberty. Liberals, who are often on the receiving end of this kind of attack from conservative critics, should think twice before directing it at libertarians.\n\nLike any important political tradition, libertarianism is too complex to be caricatured in this way. But to consider it intelligently we need some sense of its theoretical core \u2014 a libertarian credo, as it were. The platform of the Libertarian Party, as adopted in 2012, is too declamatory for our purposes. (This isn\u2019t a criticism; any party platform would be.) The Cato Institute, which has roughly the same relationship to the libertarian movement as the Heritage Foundation once had to mainstream conservatism, features on its website a statement of the \u201cKey Concepts of Libertarianism.\u201d Written by David Boaz, an officer of Cato and an important libertarian theorist, it includes the following claims:\n\nLibertarians see the individual as the basic unit of social analysis. Only individuals make choices and are responsible for their actions. Libertarian thought emphasizes the dignity of each individual, which entails both rights and responsibility\u2026 Because individuals are moral agents, they have a right to be secure in their life, liberty, and property. These rights are\u2026 inherent in the nature of human beings\u2026. [I]ndividuals are free to pursue their own lives so long as they respect the equal rights of others\u2026 To protect rights, individuals form governments. But government is a dangerous institution\u2026 Limited government is the basic political implication of libertarianism\u2026 To survive and to flourish, individuals need to engage in economic activity. The right to property entails the right to exchange property by mutual agreement. Free markets are the economic system of free individuals, and they are necessary to create wealth. Libertarians believe that people will be both freer and more prosperous if government intervention in people\u2019s economic choices is minimized\u2026\n\nIf it is nothing else, the libertarian vision is (to say the least) sweeping. The above remarks move quickly from individual persons to government to market economics. A whole society unfolds in front of us in very short order. The engine of this movement \u2014 its impetus and rationale \u2014 appears to be the notion of freedom. That individual persons are \u201cthe basic unit of social analysis\u201d seems to follow \u2014 in the libertarian mind, at least \u2014 from the fact that \u201c[o]nly individuals make choices and are responsible for their actions.\u201d Our ability to choose is the wellspring of our dignity and the source of our rights. Nor does it seem unfair to say that rights, for libertarians, aren\u2019t just rooted in our capacity for choice but are meant to give it maximum expression: their ultimate function is to extend this capacity over as much of life as possible. (As the Libertarian Party platform puts it: \u201c[I]ndividuals have the right to exercise sole dominion (italics mine) over their own lives\u201d.) This exclusive \u2014 or nearly exclusive \u2014 emphasis on personal freedom as the cornerstone of moral personality is, to my mind, the most striking aspect of libertarian thought.\n\nIt also provides an obvious connection with liberalism. Liberals, after all, also value freedom and in general want us to have more of it rather than less. In fact, it\u2019s not uncommon for libertarians to refer to their position as \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d \u2014 the liberalism of John Locke and Adam Smith and of the two Thomases, Paine and Jefferson; a liberalism of pure principle, uncorrupted by the statist errors of modern (that is, post-Progressive Era) liberalism. This sense of themselves as defenders of an embattled faith, preserving its texts and truths against a heretical age, imparts an almost hermetic quality to the work of many libertarian writers. Reading them, I sometimes come away with the impression that the authors regard themselves as polemical versions of the grizzled knight who guards the Holy Grail in \u201cIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that liberals might often applaud the deep concern our libertarian friends have for personal freedom. We part company with them, however, over their insistence that government can only threaten freedom. (Government \u201cis a dangerous institution.\u201d) It seems to many of us that some activities of the state \u2014 from civil rights laws to public schools to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 actually enhance freedom. The libertarian refusal to admit this strikes us as dogmatic and extreme, a bad case of monomania topped off with some serious myopia.\n\nBecause both traditions make freedom a central value, anyone looking for arguments against libertarian ideas might seek them in certain attacks on liberalism. An obvious source of these is the \u201ccommunitarian\u201d tradition. This school of anti-liberal thought gained fresh impetus in the 1980s from Michael Sandel\u2019s \u201cLiberalism and the Limits of Justice\u201d and Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s \u201cAfter Virtue.\u201d These books argued that liberal individualism was blind to the significance of everything in human life that could not be represented as an object of choice \u2014 from our birth families and national origins (Sandel) to the moral traditions that shape and inform our ethical lives (MacIntyre). Sandel, after indicting the liberal self as \u201cthoroughly independent\u201d of its own values, goes on to argue that:\n\n[W]e cannot regard ourselves as independent in this way without great cost to those loyalties and convictions whose moral force\u2026 is inseparable\u2026 [from] the particular persons we are\u2014 members of this family or community or nation or people, bearers of this history, sons and daughters of that revolution, citizens of this republic.\n\nThe only remedy, he claims, is to reject the liberal self in favor of an older, earlier view that embeds each of us in the concrete realities of social and political life. Even liberals might be tempted to employ some of these arguments against libertarians, especially those on the social-democratic end of the liberal spectrum.\n\nThis temptation should be resisted. Not because the communitarians weren\u2019t on to something \u2014 they certainly were, as we will see \u2014 but because their arguments, as presented by Sandel and MacIntyre, suffer from a fatal flaw. Both men want to transform the moral judgments we make; they want us to stop thinking of our good in purely personal terms and start thinking of it as something we share with others. But their principal means of doing so is to attack the liberal view (as they see it) that persons can distance themselves from social norms and make independent choices about what is right and wrong, good and bad. In the jargon of ethical theory, they attack liberal ideas about agency in order to impugn the normative judgments liberal agents make.\n\nBut this strategy works only if the two things have been linked in the necessary way. We need an argument that when persons accept the moral vocabulary of their community, they will necessarily value social goods more than purely personal ones. Neither Sandel nor MacIntyre provides such an argument, however. If I find myself in a community of hedonists, for example, the Sandel-MacIntyre view implies only that I should share their interest in personal pleasure. This goal will be \u201csocial\u201d in the attenuated sense that it is shared with others, but non-social \u2014 that is, individualistic \u2014 in its content. We can sharpen this point a bit further. From the fact that I acquiesce in the ends of my community (or family, or tradition, or church, etc.) all that follows is that I have not chosen my ends. The substance of these ends, and in particular whether they are self-regarding or other-regarding, remains completely up for grabs. Sandel and MacIntyre write as though any change in our beliefs about agency would automatically produce changes in our beliefs about right and wrong. But they give us no reason to believe this. Ultimately, their version of communitarian thought seems unclear about exactly what it\u2019s opposed to. Is it the nature of what people are choosing, or the idea that they\u2019re choosing it?\n\nWe have stumbled across an essential point in evaluating the political tradition we call \u201cliberalism.\u201d The liberal theory of agency, which emphasizes the moral authority of individual persons \u2014 call it \u201cautonomy\u201d \u2014 is conceptually distinct from ideas about the ends such agents will (and should) pursue. (This point is related to, but importantly different from, the libertarian retort canvassed earlier.) Still, two concepts can be logically independent of each other but connected in other ways. Communitarians have tried and failed to link our agency and our judgments for anti-liberal purposes. But is there a way for liberals to link them in a critique of libertarian ideas \u2014 a critique that would endorse the value of autonomy but seek a pathway from it to substantively social ends?\n\nI believe there is, and that the distinguished Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor has shown us how to find it. As already noted, David Boaz\u2019s remarks above seem to connect the claims \u201cthe individual [is] the basic unit of social analysis\u201d and \u201c[o]nly individuals make choices and are responsible for their actions.\u201d Specifically, he appears to think the first follows from the second. But this will be the case only if individual persons do not require any external resources in order to \u201cmake choices.\u201d If they do, it would seem reasonable to include these resources in any inventory of the basic units of \u201csocial analysis.\u201d\n\nAnd of course persons do require such resources. In his essay \u201cAtomism,\u201d Taylor points out that we \u201conly develop [our] characteristically human capacities in society\u201d \u2014 including our capacity for choice. \u201cLiving in a society,\u201d Taylor goes on, \u201cis a necessary condition of the development of rationality \u2026 or of becoming a moral agent in the full sense of the term \u2026 or of becoming a fully responsible, autonomous being.\u201d Given this, those who value personal autonomy must also affirm the value of its social sources: \u201c[I]f we assert the right to one\u2019s own independent moral convictions, we cannot\u2026 claim that we are not under any obligation \u2018by nature\u2019 to belong to and sustain a society of the relevant type\u201d:\n\n\u201c[T]he free individual or autonomous moral agent can only achieve and maintain his identity in a certain type of culture\u2026 But these\u2026 do not come into existence spontaneously each successive instant. They are carried on in institutions and associations which require stability and continuity and frequently also support from the community as a whole\u2026 The crucial point here is this: since the free individual can only maintain his identity within a society/culture of a certain kind, he has to be concerned about the shape of this society/culture as a whole. He cannot\u2026 be concerned purely with his individual choices and the associations formed from such choices\u201d.\n\nTaylor shows us how to link the liberal concept of agency \u2014 the ideal of personal autonomy \u2014 with normative conclusions about what people should value. The connective tissue is the pattern of external resources on which our capacity for choice depends: the institutions, practices, and associations within which we develop and cultivate this capacity. For Taylor, it makes no sense to affirm the value of autonomy while denigrating (or simply ignoring) the social goods without which autonomy is impossible. Like communitarians, he thinks we should affirm these goods and not just our purely personal ends. Unlike them, he does not regard this as grounds for a wholesale rejection of liberal autonomy. Quite the contrary \u2014 he argues for a social element in ethical life precisely because he values autonomy and wants to sustain the cultural conditions upon which it rests.\n\nIn its practical effects, Taylor\u2019s position describes something very similar to the social democracies of Europe and the progressive liberalism of the United States \u2014 regimes that uphold individual rights but require citizens to support certain public goods through taxation, regulatory observance, etc. The obvious inference is that we should see progressive liberalism as a kind of middle ground between communitarianism on the one hand and libertarianism on the other. It acknowledges the social dimensions of ethical life but accepts personal autonomy as a genuine ideal.\n\nIts principal theoretical effect is to suggest that libertarianism cannot provide a coherent account of our capacity for choice. It presents freedom as its central concern, conceptually and normatively, but is indifferent to the conditions that nurture and sustain it. Actually, this is too weak. It is not just indifferent to these conditions: It is actively hostile to them. It cannot accept a constructive role for the social and the public; it conceives of them only as obstructions. For this very reason, a libertarian regime would be a very unreliable source of autonomous agents. Libertarianism, in other words, can neither account for nor sustain its own core value. That is reason enough for thoughtful persons to reject it.\n\n* * *\n\nThere is an answer to this line of thought. Some libertarians modify the individualism of earlier writers; they accept that autonomy, like most distinctively human capabilities, requires a social context if it is to develop fully (or at all). But, they will continue, this does not show that government has to be part of that context \u2014 particularly the bloated, distended government so beloved by liberals. Other forms of association can serve this purpose just as well, if not better \u2014 the family, neighborhoods, clubs and guilds, work-related affiliations, churches. And all of these, with the partial exception of the family, have the advantage of being purely voluntary. They can nurture and cultivate our capacity for choice without the coercion inherent in governmental action. This emphasis on voluntary associations (\u201ccivil society\u201d) as an essential middle ground between individual persons on the one hand and government on the other is one of the few genuine points of contact between libertarianism, which is often (mis)described in America as a \u201cconservative\u201d doctrine, and the authentic conservatism of Burke, Oakeshott, and Kirk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The libertarian tradition fundamentally misunderstands human life.
