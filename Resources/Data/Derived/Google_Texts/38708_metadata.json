Citizens United has filed a FOIA suit in hopes of having further emails released, which the group wants to acquire for use in an upcoming documentary.\n\nSpecifically, the suit seeks emails that Chelsea Clinton; Clinton Foundation foreign policy chief Amitabh Desai; longtime aide to Mr. Clinton Justin Cooper; and the manager of the Clinton\u2019s Chappaqua, New York, home, Oscar Flores, may had exchanged with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills; Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin; Director of Policy Planning Jake Sullivan; Special Representative for Global Partnerships Kris Balderston; and Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Michael Fuchs, Politico reported.\n\nMs. Clinton, 35, was scheduled to be participating in a global economy forum in Atlanta on Thursday morning. Representatives for her mother\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to Politico\u2019s requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citizens United filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on Thursday in hopes of having a federal court grant the conservative group access to emails exchanged between Chelsea Clinton and five top aides to her mother, White House contender Hillary Clinton, while the presidential hopeful served as secretary of state.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Citizens United filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on Thursday in hopes of having a federal court grant the conservative group access to emails exchanged between Chelsea Clinton and five top aides to her mother, White House contender Hillary Clinton, while the presidential hopeful served as secretary of state.", "title": "Citizens United sues over Chelsea Clinton emails", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/14/citizens-united-sues-over-chelsea-clinton-emails/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/13/DEM_2016_Clinton.JPEG-0ee1f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/13/DEM_2016_Clinton.JPEG-0ee1f.jpg", "description": "Citizens United filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on Thursday in hopes of having a federal court grant the conservative group access to emails exchanged between Chelsea Clinton and five top aides t", "card": "summary", "title": "Citizens United sues over Chelsea Clinton emails"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "On Twitter, Citizens United said the Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit formed in 1997 by then-President Bill Clinton, was the target of a \u201cpublic corruption investigation\u201d being launched by the conservative group.\nCitizens United has filed a FOIA suit in hopes of having further emails released, which the group wants to acquire for use in an upcoming documentary.\nPreviously released emails have already revealed that Mrs. Clinton exchanged emails with her daughter while secretary of state, including exchanges in which she attempted to explain the storming of a U.S. consulate in Benghazi in 2011.\nCitizens United filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on Thursday in hopes of having a federal court grant the conservative group access to emails exchanged between Chelsea Clinton and five top aides to her mother, White House contender Hillary Clinton, while the presidential hopeful served as secretary of state.\n\u2026 She is an officer, somebody with fiduciary responsibility at the Clinton Family Foundation,\u201d Mr. Bossie said."}
