The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 35.7 percent of the U.S. is obese \u2014 a total that, in 2008, put a $147 billion-strain on the health care system. Part of the problem is making healthier food more affordable than the starchy, sugar-heavy foods currently available to low-income budgets. Unfortunately, according to the recent study, initiatives to solve this problem have so far proven unsuccessful.\n\nOne of these initiatives is the $400 million Healthy Food Financing Initiative, promoted by the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity, which informs programs such as Michelle Obama\u2019s \"Lets Move!\" childhood obesity campaign. The goal of these government-run programs is to bring a wider range of food to impoverished areas, or regions where access to such food is unreasonably far away.\n\nTo conduct their study, researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Penn State University analyzed the impact of one Philadelphia supermarket that opened as part of the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative \u2014 a program responsible for 88 new or expanded food retail outlets in the area.\n\nThe team tracked approximately 650 residents for four years. They looked at what proportion of people used the market exclusively, at least one time, and to what extent people\u2019s health and weight management improved. Unfortunately, by the study\u2019s end only 27 percent of people had adopted the supermarket as their primary food source. And just 51 percent used it at all. The supermarket had no significant impact on improving residents\u2019 obesity or fruit and vegetable intake.\n\n\"Though these interventions are plausible and well-meaning,\u201d Dr. Steven Cummins, lead author, said in a statement, \u201cthis study suggests that they are only effective in taking us part of the way in changing dietary behavior \u2014 in order to realize their full potential we need to better understand how to translate changes in perception to changes in behaviors.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s The Problem?\n\nThe perceptual changes Cummins mentions may be core to the initiative\u2019s success. Despite its recent classification as a disease, obesity isn\u2019t a single-faceted problem. It\u2019s a combination of factors, which are at once social, biological, and, in Cummins\u2019 study\u2019s case, environmental. People may be predisposed to have lower basal metabolic rates \u2014 a determining factor of how quickly the body processes food \u2014 but they may also grow up in a household where nutrition was assigned little value, thus reinforcing bad habits.\n\nA large part of this environmental influence stems from the primary source: supermarkets. People that either can\u2019t access or can\u2019t afford fresh fruits and vegetables find alternative food sources to keep their hunger pangs at bay. Enter processed foods. Canned goods and non-perishable enriched grains may be nutritionally poor, but are long-lasting and filling \u2014 something Cummins sees as a crippling problem.\n\n\"U.S. policymakers have implemented policies and interventions that encourage the location of supermarkets and grocery stores to improve diet and reduce diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever we don't know whether these kinds of policies are effective in improving diet.\u201d\n\nIn this, Cummins and his colleagues hope the current study can help motivate further research to learn how to motivate healthier choices within a food desert, whether it\u2019s more supermarkets tailored to residents of the area or complementary initiatives that focus on price promotions, marketing, and branding to encourage people to put down the pastries and pick up a pomegranate instead.\n\nSource: Cummins S, Flint E, Matthews S.
