In an otherwise toothless and boring episode of SNL, at least “Father Daughter Ad” was kind of surprising? The punchline is more shocking than anything in Fifty Shades of Grey, though nearly as funny as the book’s prose. I imagine this is how the average Fox News viewer/at least one of your crazy relatives on Facebook imagines the world. “Damn ISIS is picking up our young girls!”

THANKS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMACARE. Meanwhile, the people have spoken:

'Just when you think its safe to go into water, #SNL spoofs #ISIS. Producers channeling #JeSuisCharlie? Vile. #nbc #DakotaJohnson — Kathy Murphy (@katmur23) March 1, 2015

Just saw maybe the most unfunny #SNL piece of all time. Is ISIS really a good subject for humor? #nbc And I've loved SNL for decades. — Ed Tate (@edwardtate) March 1, 2015

I'm going to go ahead and voice my opinion on the #SNL ISIS skit. Absolutely hell no, under any circumstance. Poor poor taste! — Matthew Lyle (@mlyle2) March 1, 2015

Dear #SNL, jokes about Isis are not funny. See how much you laugh when you have to see your loved one(s) being slaughtered. No respect. — Chas. (@RugratChas) March 1, 2015
