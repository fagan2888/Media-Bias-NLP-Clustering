A company would be liable for tax only if its activity rendered it a \"permanent establishment\".\n\nBut the Israeli authorities have widened the definition of permanent to include online businesses, where the economic activity of the foreign company is mainly through the Internet.\n\n\"Facebook pays taxes according to the law in every country it operates, including Israel,\" the company said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nA spokesman for Google in Israel declined to comment. Ebay, and Amazon were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe issue has been raised in parliament that foreign firms do not pay the same tax rates as Israeli ones. Last week, a blimp with \"Google must pay tax\" written across it floated over the Tel Aviv skyline and near Google's offices.\n\nThe tax authority is also seeking to implement a law in which digital services - such as downloading music or books - from a foreign online store would also be subject to VAT.\n\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer.
