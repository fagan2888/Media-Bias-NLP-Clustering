NEW YORK (MainStreet) — When the levee broke, a river of muddy water flooded the little town of Valmeyer, Ill., for nearly two months. The small community of some 2,500 residents was "erased" by the overflowing water from the Mississippi River during the Great Flood of 1993. With help from the U.S. government, the village was rebuilt on nearby bluffs "where it thrives today," says Nicholas Pinter, professor of geology at Southern Illinois University.

If other solutions aren’t implemented, many floodplain residents in America may face similarly forced migrations.

The National Flood Insurance Program is some $24 billion in the hole. Many homeowners in flood zones are beginning to feel that fiscal pain as flood insurance premiums skyrocket. Rate increases of 18% to 25% for some policyholders have gone into effect as of April 1, with additional surcharges up to $250.

Climate change and subsidies, or FEMA mismanagement?

Blame it on climate change and decades of premiums lagging risk, professor Pinter says, but the "government handout" of flood insurance subsidies will have to end — with homeowners absorbing a "doubling or tripling, or in some cases much more," increase in premiums — or else floodplain residents should consider moving to higher ground.

George Kasimos, a real estate agent in Toms River, N.J., knows a thing or two about flood insurance . His home was damaged by Superstorm Sandy, but his claim was paid, and he rebuilt. Kasimos says the $24 billion flood insurance shortfall is due to the bureaucracy and "mismanagement" of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
