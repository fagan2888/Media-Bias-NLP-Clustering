The sub-acute segment will significantly outgrow the larger market for home-care COPD ventilators, which will expand by only 25 percent during the same period, as presented in the attached figure.\n\nSub-acute refers to hospital patients who no longer need acute care, but haven\u2019t recovered enough to return home. The sub-acute ventilator market consists of systems that are used in locations outside of the intensive care unit (ICU). These places include step-down wards, general wards, long-term care facilities and skilled nursing facilities.\n\nThe US is the largest global sub-acute COPD ventilator market.\n\n\u201cU.S. hospitals increasingly are struggling to cope with the costs associated with the treatment of chronic diseases and long-term care,\u201d said Nicola Goatman, medical devices and healthcare IT analyst at IHS. \u201cConsequently, the sub-acute segment is expanding rapidly. In previous years, there was a drive to provide long-term care away from the central hospital environment in order to save costs. This move has been further heightened by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Readmission Reduction Program, a section of the ACA that penalizes hospitals for the readmission of COPD patients. The need to cut down on readmission has spurred the expansion of sub-acute ventilator market.\u201d\n\nCOPD crisis\n\nGrowing demand for sub-acute ventilators represents just the latest episode in America\u2019s COPD crisis.\n\nApproximately 12 million people are diagnosed with COPD in the US every year. This costs U.S. healthcare systems an estimated $50 billion annually.\n\nExpenses related to COPD readmission rank third highest among U.S. Medicare expenditures, according to the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Foundation.\n\nThe home care market in the United States has been the focus in previous years in an effort to reduce the cost associated with treating COPD.\n\nHome Care provides the most cost effective solution for treating COPD patients. However, the United States has a high percentage of readmissions. Therefore, in efforts to reduce costs associate with COPD hospitals are more cautious in sending patients directly to the home environment.\n\nFurthermore, reductions in reimbursements for non-life-support home-care ventilators is impacting the market. Home care ventilation has moved to a fixed fee, which impacts growth in this market as DMEs look for the most cost-effective solution. This results in price pressure to the manufacturer and restricted revenues from the sale of home care ventilators.\n\nAbout IHS (www.ihs.com)\n\nIHS (NYSE: IHS) is the leading source of information, insight and analytics in critical areas that shape today's business landscape.
