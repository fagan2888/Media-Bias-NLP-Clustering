Now Harvard scientists, backed by the Obama administration\u2019s ARPA-E program, have written up an advance that they say addresses the key matter of flow battery expense, thanks in part to rhubarb.\n\nYes, rhubarb.\n\nIt all comes down to something called \u201cquinones,\u201d described as \u201cnaturally abundant, inexpensive, small organic (carbon-based) molecules.\u201d The Harvard team says it designed, built and tested a laboratory flow battery using quinones as an alternative to flow-battery favorite vanadium, the active metal component dissolved in the rechargeable soup of electrolytes that are stored in external tanks, then pumped into a cell to react electrochemically across a membrane to produce current.\n\nSo where might these quinones come from? According to the Harvard release:\n\nQuinones are abundant in crude oil as well as in green plants. The molecule the Harvard team used in its first quinone-based flow battery is almost identical to one found in rhubarb. The quinones are dissolved in water, which prevents them from catching fire.\n\nA metal-free battery, the Harvard team says, could make flow batteries a whole lot less expensive than they are today, allowing the world to take advantage of their great attribute: the ease with which they energy storage can be scaled simply by varying the size of the tanks holding the fluids. Not possible with solid-electrode batteries, explains Harvard:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harvard scientists have developed a battery that could change the way we refuel \u2014\u00a0with a little help from rhubarb", "title": "Renewable energy gets help from an unexpected place", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Harvard scientists have developed a battery that could change the way we refuel \u2014\u00a0with a little help from rhubarb", "title": "Renewable energy gets help from an unexpected place", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/15/rhubarb_the_newest_form_of_alternative_energy_newscred/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/BrazosWindFarm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harvard scientists have developed a battery that could change the way we refuel \u2014\u00a0with a little help from rhubarb", "title": "Renewable energy gets help from an unexpected place", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/BrazosWindFarm.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Pete Danko", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alternative Energy, earth techling, Electricity, Harvard, Research, rhubarb, Science, Solar Power, Wind power", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The molecule the Harvard team used in its first quinone-based flow battery is almost identical to one found in rhubarb.\nNow Harvard scientists, backed by the Obama administration\u2019s ARPA-E program, have written up an advance that they say addresses the key matter of flow battery expense, thanks in part to rhubarb.\nNot possible with solid-electrode batteries, explains Harvard:\nAccording to the Harvard release:Quinones are abundant in crude oil as well as in green plants.\nThe quinones are dissolved in water, which prevents them from catching fire."}
