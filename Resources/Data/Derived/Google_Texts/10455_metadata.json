Remember threats that Obamanomics would strangle the recovery? That hasn\u2019t played out either. The unemployment rate is down to 5.6 percent. Growth is strong. Obama can't take all the credit for the recovery. The Federal Reserve\u2019s willingness to ignore inflation hawks and keep interest rates at zero is a key reason why the U.S.\u2019s recovery is the envy of the developed world, for instance. But the fact is that the economy really has strengthened considerably over the past year. Republican arguments that Obama\u2019s policies would stifle growth and prevent the economy from bouncing back no longer are credible.\n\nAs Senator Elizabeth Warren points out, the recovery has not been felt equally\u2014wages are still stagnant. Obama made that point in his address. Yet, lower gas prices, even though they aren\u2019t due to Obama\u2019s actions, are effectively acting as a tax cut for middle class Americans across the country. In turn, optimism in the economy has ticked up considerably over the past two months\u2014and so have Obama\u2019s approval ratings. Americans are starting to believe in the recovery\u2014and to give Obama credit for it.\n\nRepublican talking points largely haven't adjusted to this new reality. \"We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs,\" said Senator Joni Ernst in the official Republican response to Obama's State of the Union. \"We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they'll be able to leave to their children.\" Clawson even said Obama's speech was \"pretty much the same rhetoric we've heard for the past six years,\" which is simply not true.\n\nBut some Republicans are starting to realize that this message doesn't jibe with an improved economy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, opened the 114th Congress by trying to take credit for the recovery. But even if more Republicans adopt new talking points, the president and his party are generally the ones who benefit, politically, from an improving economy. Given Republicans' doomsday predictions through the first six years of Obama\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s hard to imagine voters crediting the GOP for the recovery over Obama.\n\nMcConnell has largely been treated as a political mastermind during Obama\u2019s presidency. He was one of the leaders of \u201cno compromise\u201d strategy that the party adopted to stifle Obama\u2019s agenda and prevent him from claiming credit for any bipartisan accomplishments. In many ways, it was a success. Republicans won landslide victories in 2010 and 2014. They soured the country on the president and have, until now, sunk his approval ratings on many issues.\n\nBut it came at a major cost, and the cost seems to be getting greater by the day: Republicans lost all ability to shape policy, especially in the first two years of Obama's presidency. Instead of compromising on issues like health care reform, financial regulation, and fiscal stimulus, Republicans sidelined themselves in lockstep opposition, determined not to leave fingerprints on the legislation. In turn, they adopted a message that each of Obama\u2019s major legislative achievements\u2014Obamacare, the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, and the stimulus\u2014were going to crush the economy and destroy different industries. It was an appealing message when the economy was still struggling. Now it's rapidly becoming a political liability.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean McConnell\u2019s strategy was wrong. If the GOP had compromised with Obama and pulled his policy rightward, voters almost certainly would have rewarded Democrats. The country might even be in better shape, but the Republican Party probably wouldn\u2019t be. Ultimately, Republicans were in an impossible position. The economy was eventually going to recover, and Obama was going to get credit for it.\n\nThe president has spent the first six years of his presidency waiting for the moment he could take that credit, knowing it was coming. On Tuesday night, it came. Even with five separate responses to the president\u2019s address, there was nothing Republicans could say to fight the growing sense that Obama\u2019s policies are working and that the GOP has been wrong for the past six years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In his seventh State of the Union on Tuesday night,&nbsp;President Barack Obama&nbsp;touted&nbsp;the low unemployment rate, low gas prices, increase in clean energy production, lower teen pregnancy rates and host of other statistics that supported his optimistic vision. \u201cThe shadow of crisis has passed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the state of the union is strong.\u201dGiving the official Tea Party response to Obam...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "And there's nothing Republicans can do about it.", "title": "Mitch McConnell's \"No Compromise\" Strategy Is Finally Failing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/989cf4e7a19504b264027a9209c87fb173110f42.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/120814/2015-tea-party-state-union-response-shows-failed-strategy", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/989cf4e7a19504b264027a9209c87fb173110f42.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "description": "And there's nothing Republicans can do about it.", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mitch McConnell's \"No Compromise\" Strategy Is Finally Failing"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/989cf4e7a19504b264027a9209c87fb173110f42.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Mitch McConnell's \\\"No Compromise\\\" Strategy Is Finally Failing\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120814/2015-tea-party-state-union-response-shows-failed-strategy\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-21T04:11:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":120814,\"author\":\"Danny Vinik\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Barack Obama\",\"State of the Union\",\"QED\",\"Mitch McConnell\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-01-21"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Americans are starting to believe in the recovery\u2014and to give Obama credit for it.\nMcConnell has largely been treated as a political mastermind during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\"We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs,\" said Senator Joni Ernst in the official Republican response to Obama's State of the Union.\nRepublican arguments that Obama\u2019s policies would stifle growth and prevent the economy from bouncing back no longer are credible.\nGiven Republicans' doomsday predictions through the first six years of Obama\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s hard to imagine voters crediting the GOP for the recovery over Obama."}
