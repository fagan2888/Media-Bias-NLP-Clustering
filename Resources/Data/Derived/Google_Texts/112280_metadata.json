Competing job offers? In this economy? To dream!\n\nBut it does happen. Just ask Jessica Walton, 27, a health-care consultant based in Atlanta. After graduating from Emory University with a master\u2019s in public health in 2010, she received offers for consulting positions with three different companies.\n\nThe offers ranged from $65,000 to $80,000, but when the time came to make a decision, her potential salary was only one of several considerations. Walton asked herself numerous questions to help her make the best choice: Where could she see herself growing a career? Did she like the people she\u2019d be working with? Did she feel that their personalities and work ethic were similar to hers? What was the reputation of each firm in the marketplace?\n\nUltimately, she accepted a position from a company that wasn\u2019t offering the bestsalary but whose reputation she respected. \u201cI knew other people from my graduate program who had joined that particular firm and they were satisfied with their choice,\u201d says Walton. \u201cI wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t just go where the money was.\u201d Once she made her decision, however, she negotiated with the company, which matched the higher offer she\u2019d received.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the job hunt, you may think you\u2019d be lucky if your search turned up oneoffer. But who knows, in the course of your career, you might find yourself in the even more fortunate position of choosing between two (or more!) opportunities.\n\nRELATED: THE 7 WORST JOB INTERVIEW MISTAKES PEOPLE MAKE\n\nIn which case, ask yourself a few key questions before you make your next move.\n\n1. Is the company interested in helping its employees grow?\n\nJoseph Terach, founder and CEO of Resume Deli, a professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing company, advises all of his clients to consider how the company culture affects employees over the long haul. Do your research to find out if the company is invested in its employees as assets (think perks like tuition reimbursement and a hire-from-within commitment to developing talent) or if the company just does the bare minimum when it comes to employee satisfaction and career growth.\n\n\u201cThere are some people that only want to clock in and clock out each day, and if you\u2019re one of those people, then this area certainly might not be important to you,\u201d says Terach. \u201cBut for people looking to grow, such as young professionals, this is a question that needs to be asked.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re interviewing with the company, inquire about career development programs, or get even more specific and ask the interviewer to share one or two specific examples of employees who have climbed the ladder in the company. But, Terach says, make sure to tread lightly as you dig for more information.\n\n\u201cThe best way to bring up this matter is to ask a question that is open-ended and nonthreatening, such as, \u2018Could you give me a sense of what a new employee\u2019s trajectory is like over a one-, two- or three-year period?\u2019 or \u2018Where might a new employee today find him or herself three years from now?\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to directly ask if or when you\u2019ll get promoted. That might be what\u2019s going through your head, but you have to ask about it in a positive way.\u201d\n\nRELATED: HOW TO MAKE YOUR TEMP JOB A FULL-TIME GIG\n\n2. What is the matching and vesting schedule of each company\u2019s 401(k) plan?\n\nDepending on where you are in your career (and how soon you plan to retire), this question could have a huge impact on your long-term financial health. And getting a company \u201cmatch\u201d on your 401(k) is like getting a raise\u2014albeit one you can\u2019t cash in on until you retire.\n\n\u201cA 401(k) plan is a very cost-effective way to build a nest egg for the future,\u201d says Terach. \u201cCertain companies will give you different matched contributions toward your plan. The more generous those contributions are, the less you as an individual need to set aside from your own net income to build up the same amount of long-term savings.\u201d\n\nSo, ask if each company will match a percentage of your own contribution, and then if you find that one company offers a more robust company-matched 401(k) plan, take note. To set your expectations, not all companies offer a match at all: According to the 401(k) Performance Survey, conducted by American Investment Planners LLC, 42% of American companies don\u2019t offer any match\u2014but that means the majority do.\n\nAnother question you should weigh: How soon can you invest in the plan (six months? one year?), and what\u2019s the company\u2019s vesting schedule? In other words, do you have to work a certain number of years in order to keep the company\u2019s retirement contribution? According to CNN Money, the most common vesting schedules are 33% or 25% per year, thus requiring employees to stay for at least three or four years, respectively, before they can claim the full company match at departure. Employees typically receive only a portion of the company match if they choose to leave the company before that deadline.\n\nTerach suggests spending some time thinking about how long you realistically expect to stay at each company. \u201cIf you stay at one company for a short time, what will you walk away with at the end? At some companies, you only receive your own investment if you leave within a year,\u201d he says.\n\nRELATED: THE GREAT JOB HUNT: 3 GENERATIONS DO IT DIFFERENTLY\n\n3. What\u2019s the work-life balance like?\n\nOf course, a job offer doesn\u2019t just come down to compensation. You also have to weigh what stage of your career you\u2019re at, and how the company culture will impact your lifestyle. A lucrative offer may come with an expectation to work weekends or evenings as needed, or to forgo using your vacation days in the interest of taking on more responsibility at the office.\n\nOn the other hand, a more relaxed work environment \u2014 one in which employees regularly take time off, rarely respond to emails outside of the office and generally leave right at closing time \u2014 may be worth a lower salary if a clear boundary between your work and personal lives is a top priority.\n\n\u201cWhile the typical workday at each company may have been outlined for you, having a sense of what is expected outside of those hours can help you better determine the true work-life balance available at each company,\u201d says Lindsey Pollak, author of \u201cGetting From College to Career.\u201d\n\nSome information you might want to suss out in the course of the interview process: What does a typical day look like? How many vacation days will you receive? Do people leave their desks for lunch? Is it the kind of workplace that requires firing off or responding to emails at all hours of the day or night? And so on.\n\nJust as with career-growth questions, it\u2019s important to remember that, first and foremost, it\u2019s your job as a candidate to convince an employer to hire you. Couch these questions gently, and consider asking a recruiter or HR person, as opposed to firing them off during an interview with a hiring manager, or ask around if you know other employees at the company to see what kind of feel for the culture you can get.\n\nRELATED: JOB HUNITING: THERE'S AN APP FOR THAT\n\n4. Do I like and respect the person I would be reporting to?\n\n\"Your boss has a huge impact on both your day-to-day life and your longer-term prospects at a company,\u201d says Pollak. \u201cA major reason people quit their jobs is because of a bad relationship with their boss.\u201d Good bosses are rare and invaluable to any career, so think about what benefits you\u2019d gain from working with this person, as well as what lessons he or she might teach you.\n\nAnd be sure you\u2019re clear about what\u2019s expected of you: How does your manager, and the company, define success in the job you\u2019d be taking? Let those criteria help determine which role would be the most fulfilling for you\u2014after all, it feels good to win, and being confident about doing a good job at your job is a tip-off that it might be a great fit.\n\nHow to Turn Down an Offer\n\nOnce you decide which job to take, your next order of business is to turn down the other offer(s). Telling another employer that you\u2019re declining their offer might seem awkward, but keep in mind that it\u2019s not personal; you\u2019ve simply made a decision about which company is the best fit for you.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, say that you\u2019re flattered \u2014 and, if you can, do it over the phone instead of email,\u201d says Debra Shigley, author of \u201cThe Go-Getter Girl\u2019s Guide: Get What You Want in Work and Life.\u201d \u201cExplain that it was a tough decision, and pick one reason why you chose the other job. Just keep whatever reasons you give focused on the job itself as opposed to personal reasons.\u201d\n\nShigley also notes that turning down a job offer can also be a networking opportunity. \u201cBy the time you get to the offer stage, you\u2019ve met with different people at a company and really gotten to know them,\u201d she says. \u201cThings may or may not work out with your current job. The best way to keep opportunities open is to remain top of mind with other people who know you well.\u201d Be sure to represent yourself well all the way to the end, and send thank-you notes to all your interviewers for having considered you.\n\nMore from LearnVest\n\nWhy Nearly Everyone in America Wants to Change Careers\n\nThe Trick to Gaining More Influence of Work\n\n9 Signs You've Got a Bad Boss", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you're on the job hunt, you may think yourself lucky if your search turned up one offer.
