Republicans are eager to avoid another Capitol Hill mess as they struggle to hang onto control of Congress and try to take back the White House next year.\n\nAlready they are deep into the blame game with Democrats over who would be responsible if a shutdown does happen. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has denounced Democrats\u2019 \u201cdangerously misguided strategy\u201d while House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California accuses Boehner and his Republicans of pursuing \u201cmanufactured crises.\u201d\n\nThe funding deadline does not even arrive until Sept. 30, but lawmakers face more immediate tests. Near the top of the list is renewing highway funding before the government loses authority July 31 to send much-needed transportation money to the states right in the middle of summer driving season.\n\nThe highway bill probably also will be the way lawmakers try to renew the disputed federal Export-Import Bank, which makes and underwrites loans to help foreign companies buy U.S. products. The bank\u2019s charter expired June 30 due to congressional inaction, a defeat for business and a victory for conservative activists who turned killing the obscure agency into an anti-government cause celebre.\n\nDepending on the progress of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran, lawmakers could also face debate on that issue. Leading Republicans have made clear that they are prepared to reject any deal the administration comes up with.\n\n\u201cCongress stands ready to stand up for core U.S. national security interests \u2014 and against a bad deal with Iran,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in an opinion piece in The Washington Post.\n\nNot all will be partisan rancor. The Senate opens its legislative session with consideration of a major bipartisan education overhaul bill that rewrites the much-maligned No Child Left Behind law by shifting responsibility from the federal government to the states for public school standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seven years overdue\u201d for a rewrite, said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn, the bill\u2019s chief sponsor.\n\nThe House also is moving forward with its own, Republican-written education overhaul bill, revived after leadership had to pull it earlier this year when conservatives revolted.\n\nEven if both bills pass, though, it\u2019s uncertain whether Congress will be able to agree on a combined version to send to President Barack Obama. Indeed the prospects for any major legislative accomplishments arriving on Obama\u2019s desk in the remainder of the year look slim, though there\u2019s talk of the Senate following the House and moving forward on cybersecurity legislation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Back at work: Congress facing busy agenda, funding deadline", "title": "Back at work: Congress facing busy agenda, funding deadline", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Back at work: Congress facing busy agenda, funding deadline", "title": "Back at work: Congress facing busy agenda, funding deadline", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/back_at_work_congress_facing_busy_agenda_funding_deadline/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/congress-returns.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Back at work: Congress facing busy agenda, funding deadline", "title": "Back at work: Congress facing busy agenda, funding deadline", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/congress-returns.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erica Werner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b84\"", "article_summary": "The funding fight is shaping up as a major partisan brawl against the backdrop of an intensifying campaign season.\nRepublicans are eager to avoid another Capitol Hill mess as they struggle to hang onto control of Congress and try to take back the White House next year.\nThe highway bill probably also will be the way lawmakers try to renew the disputed federal Export-Import Bank, which makes and underwrites loans to help foreign companies buy U.S. products.\nEven if both bills pass, though, it\u2019s uncertain whether Congress will be able to agree on a combined version to send to President Barack Obama.\nAlready they are deep into the blame game with Democrats over who would be responsible if a shutdown does happen."}
