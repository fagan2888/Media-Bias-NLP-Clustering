The Mississippi State Department of Health will have new hours at county clinics, effective Feb. 1. Most services will still be offered, but not necessarily on a daily basis.

MSDH will no longer be enrolling new maternity patients, as patients now have other options under the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid Managed Care.

“Over the past few years patient flow has seriously declined throughout the state, and with that, so has our incoming revenue," said State Health Officer Dr. Mary Currier. "For many months now we have been reviewing clinic hours, patient flow, and current services.”

Reductions in staff include approximately 35 full-time employees and 29 contract workers. With these changes, nine county health departments will be permanently closed due to a very limited number of people using their services or as a more efficient way to utilize staff. Among those closures are Newton, Heidelberg and Taylorsville.

Services such as immunizations, family planning, WIC, the Perinatal High Risk Management Program, and the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Program may have different days or hours for their services.
