A judge dismissed the charges earlier this year.\n\nBlumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote to U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati on Thursday regarding Solo, calling domestic violence \u201cunacceptable, particularly for an athlete representing the United States of America on the global stage.\u201d\n\nSolo is currently starting for the U.S. women\u2019s national team at the World Cup in Canada. The U.S. played to a 0-0 draw with Sweden in a group-stage match on Friday night. She did not speak to reporters following the match.\n\nGulati\u2019s response said U.S. Soccer investigated the matter as thoroughly as it could at the time, but its approach was guided by limited access to information and contradictory accounts of the incident, as well as legal concerns.\n\n\u201cThe federation has been a long-standing leader in the pursuit of gender equity in sport \u2014 a role of which we are quite proud,\u201d Gulati wrote. \u201cAccordingly, rest assured that the federation considered domestic and family violence a very serious matter. The federation understands its role and obligation as the national governing body for the sport of soccer and will continue to investigate and address such issues as they arise.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal\u2019s letter came in the wake of an ESPN report that brought new information about Solo\u2019s arrest to light, including allegations that the goalkeeper was combative with police officers. Solo pleaded innocent to the charges.\n\nESPN said the report was based on police records, two sworn depositions obtained by the network program \u201cOutside the Lines,\u201d other documents and interviews with one of Solo\u2019s alleged victims. It said Solo had been drinking when she arrived at the home of her half-sister, Teresa Obert, and was the aggressor in the altercation, including slamming the teenager\u2019s head into the floor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US soccer defends Hope Solo decisions in letter to senator", "title": "US soccer defends Hope Solo decisions in letter to senator", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US soccer defends Hope Solo decisions in letter to senator", "title": "US soccer defends Hope Solo decisions in letter to senator", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/us_soccer_defends_hope_solo_decisions_in_letter_to_senator/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/wwcup-us-sweden-soccer.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US soccer defends Hope Solo decisions in letter to senator", "title": "US soccer defends Hope Solo decisions in letter to senator", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/wwcup-us-sweden-soccer.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anne M.
