Good athletes with rocket arms who play with a linebacker\u2019s mentality. Gritty. Hard-nosed. Competitors.\n\nBut the stories of these two men go much deeper. And much farther than the game of football.\n\nPeople who are close to Jim and Chad Kelly already know, but the nearly 800 in attendance at the 2016 Ole Miss Fellowship of Christian Athletes breakfast found out Saturday morning. There is much more to the Kellys than what first meets the eye.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have a son,\u201d Jim Kelly told the crowd. \u201cMy wife\u2019s water broke and it was Valentine\u2019s Day, my birthday. We went to the hospital and my wife delivered a boy on Daddy\u2019s birthday. The game plan was already done. The script was written. Hunter would wear No. 12. Play against Chad. But my son was diagnosed with a fatal genetic disease at four months, and he lived to be eight years old. When our son died, that day was the lowest point in my life.\u201d\n\nUncle Jim went on to talk about how the death of his son Hunter on August 5, 2005 changed his spiritual life forever.\n\n\u201cNumber one, I wanted to see my son again, and I knew where he was. Number two, I wanted to be able to walk through the door and for my two daughters to respect who I was. Number three, I wanted to love my wife the way she deserved to be loved. I\u2019ll never forget it was April 22, 2007.\u201d\n\nFast forward to February 2016.\n\n\u201cI have a beautiful wife, two beautiful daughters, a great nephew here. For many years now I\u2019ve been a Christian, and boy am I happy.\u201d\n\nUncle Jim, who originally grew up in Pittsburgh and was a big fan of Terry Bradshaw and the Steelers, was the starting quarterback for the University of Miami before a long career as the signal caller for the Buffalo Bills. He took Buffalo to four Super Bowls and was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002. He also started the non-profit organization Hunter\u2019s Hope as an advocacy group for the awareness of Krabbe disease, the genetic disease that cost his son his life at such an early age.\n\nChad, the son of Jim\u2019s brother Kevin, grew up following his uncle\u2019s every move.\n\n\u201cTo be able to consider myself close to Uncle Jim and being close to him and all he\u2019s accomplished is surreal,\u201d Chad told the FCA breakfast crowd. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m sitting here. This is literally insane. I can\u2019t believe how God is changing my life. I look up to (Jim) every day and hope to come close to what he\u2019s accomplished.\u201d\n\nAll Chad did in his first year at Ole Miss was lead the team to its first Sugar Bowl appearance and win since 1970 and guide the Rebels to 10 wins that included victories over Southeastern Conference Western Division rivals Alabama, Auburn, LSU and Mississippi State. He broke or tied 14 single-season Ole Miss records and led the SEC in passing (310.9 yards per game), total offense (349.4 yards per game), touchdown passes (31) and points responsible for (246).\n\nBut it might be his off-the-field progress that\u2019s even more impressive than his accolades on the gridiron. Chad has a well-documented past of difficulties that forced him to leave his first school, Clemson, and take the junior college route to East Mississippi Community College before being given another chance by Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze.\n\nThe chance Freeze took on Chad has paid dividends for everyone.\n\n\u201cEvery day I thank the Lord because I\u2019m so blessed with this opportunity,\u201d said Chad, who went on a mission trip to Haiti with some of his teammates and Ole Miss staff last spring break. \u201cIt\u2019s just unreal that I\u2019m up here speaking in front of people. A couple of years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have thought this was possible. It\u2019s just wild how God has really changed my life and surrounded me with such great people. I\u2019m so blessed to be in this situation \u2013 to have coaches, players and fans that I truly love. It\u2019s such a family. For everybody to be so happy and down to earth and willing to help \u2013 what more can you ask for?\u201d\n\nLess known to the public than Chad\u2019s overcoming obstacles on the field is how he has changed as a person since his arrival in Oxford. He is considered a leader in the locker room. He embraces his position as a role model for young children. He credits another difficult family matter for his spiritual awakening.\n\n\u201cReally when God touched me spiritually is when my grandma died around a year ago today,\u201d Chad said. \u201cWhen she died it really took a lot of my heart out of me. She raised me for a year or two. To see her struggle in the same capacity as Uncle Jim and my cousin Hunter, when I saw her smile and be happy even though she was so hurt, that was the greatest moment. I asked myself what did I have to do to be a great person on and off the field. Ever since then, something just clicked. I\u2019ve had great coaches that have helped me get there. It\u2019s been a team effort.\u201d\n\nThe 2015 Ole Miss-Arkansas game conjured a variety of emotions for Ole Miss players and fans \u2013 most of them not good. But it was a meeting with a former SEC and NFL quarterback during pregame that offered Chad an indelible memory.\n\n\u201cWhen I had the opportunity to meet Tim Tebow before the Arkansas game, he said to me, \u2018fear or faith.\u2019 Ever since then when I go out on the field I think about that. When you truly understand fear, you shouldn\u2019t have any because the man above has a plan for you. You may not know it, but he has it. As long as God is for you, there\u2019s no one else who can be against you. You have to have faith in everything you do. Never give up because God never gave up on you.\u201d\n\nJim Kelly, who has survived a pair of bouts with cancer, can attest to not giving up. He also sees how Chad\u2019s faith has grown and his nephew has become someone that a younger generation can admire and emulate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around here and seen how these kids look up to him and how he acts around him,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me to see how much he\u2019s grown up in the last couple of years. This is my nephew. This is my godson. This is a man who\u2019s making a difference in young kids\u2019 lives. I am so proud of him.\u201d\n\nFollow Ole Miss Football on Twitter at @OleMissFB, as well as Facebook and Instagram.
