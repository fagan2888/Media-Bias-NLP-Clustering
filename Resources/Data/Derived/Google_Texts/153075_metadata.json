The speaker is pursuing the suit on behalf of the House of Representatives, which will have to vote on legislation to authorize it. President Obama indicated earlier this year that he would be more aggressive in his use of executive orders and administrative actions because of his frustrations with Congress.\n\nClearly, the president\u2019s tactics do not sit well with the speaker, who has cited among his concerns a shift in power from the legislative branch to the executive branch. In a memo to House Republicans, the speaker wrote, \u201cIf the current president can selectively enforce, change or create laws as he chooses with impunity, without the involvement of the Legislative Branch, his successors will be able to do the same. This shifts the balance of power decisively and dangerously in favor of the presidency, giving the president king-like authority at the expense of the American people and their elected legislators.\u201d\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nThe White House says the president has acted within his authority on the executive orders. Additionally, a Brookings Institute fellow told The Hill that the speaker's claims that the president has overstepped will be hard to prove. However, if the speaker feels the legislative branch is losing power to the executive branch, perhaps he should look inward and examine the actions of the Congress in which he serves.\n\nSince they regained the majority, the House Republican agenda has been primarily focused on preventing the president from doing anything. While this effort has resulted in dozens of pointless votes on issues like repeal of the Affordable Care Act, it has not enabled Congress to pass much legislation of substance or enact new laws. A general unwillingness to compromise throughout the legislative body has caused short-term renewals of major policies rather than long-term reauthorizations that would allow legislators to leave their mark. With few exceptions, the legislative process has all but ground to a halt. So, yes, one might say Congress has less power than it used to.\n\nUltimately, the courts will decide whether the speaker's suit has merit. But a Congress that legislates would surely help reverse the power shift he is concerned about.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "John Boehner's Obama Lawsuit and Congress' Power Loss", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Rather than suing the president, the speaker could lead Congress to actually legislate.", "title": "How Boehner Can Take Back the Power", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/06/26/john-boehners-obama-lawsuit-and-congress-power-loss", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d9/540ff1c435bfa9bf1a397aa79bc5ee/media:30f3a771b28248c99ccf78fd5f8ce33bBoehner.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "John Boehner's Obama Lawsuit and Congress' Power Loss", "description": "Rather than suing the president, the speaker could lead Congress to actually legislate.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 26, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Cary Gibson,Obama, Barack,Boehner, John,Republican Party,executive orders,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Rather than suing the president, the speaker could lead Congress to actually legislate."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe472a\"", "article_summary": "President Obama indicated earlier this year that he would be more aggressive in his use of executive orders and administrative actions because of his frustrations with Congress.\nYesterday, House Speaker John Boehner announced he is pursuing a lawsuit against President Obama because of what the speaker deems to be the president\u2019s excessive use of executive orders and other administrative actions.\nClearly, the president\u2019s tactics do not sit well with the speaker, who has cited among his concerns a shift in power from the legislative branch to the executive branch.\nHowever, if the speaker feels the legislative branch is losing power to the executive branch, perhaps he should look inward and examine the actions of the Congress in which he serves.\nBut a Congress that legislates would surely help reverse the power shift he is concerned about."}
