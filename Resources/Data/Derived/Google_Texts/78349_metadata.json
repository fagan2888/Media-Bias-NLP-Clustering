He has called it the worst thing since slavery, worse than the terrorist attacks of September 11, and said the U.S. Supreme Court overstepped its authority when it upheld the landmark health care law.\n\nThe medical coalition Carson announced in Iowa Friday will, according to his statement, help spread his \u201cmessage of liberty, simplicity and personal responsibility for health care reform.\u201d The announcement comes at a time when the number of people who are uninsured in the United States has declined by almost 16 million thanks to the health care law\u2019s coverage expansion.\n\nHere are a few of the doctors and experts who make up Carson\u2019s coalition:\n\nDr. Kris Held: Texas ophthalmologist Kris Held is a founder and co-director of AmericanDoctors4Truth, a group working to repeal the ACA (fellow co-director and founder of the group, Jane Hughes, will also serve on Carson\u2019s coalition). The group claims the health care law is a \u201cpolitically driven government takeover of our healthcare, passed by overt bribery and coercion.\u201d Held has also publicly spoken out against the law, saying on Fox News in 2014 that she will no longer comply with the ACA because she \u201ccan no longer be an enabler to the dysfunction that is harming patients.\u201d\n\nDr. Kris Held speaks about her opposition to the ACA on Fox News.

The Arizona-based doctor has appeared on television and radio programs to speak about her views on health care reform. She has said the law will increase individual\u2019s insurance costs and that companies will have to go out of business. She is also the president of Doctors for Disease Preparedness, which has been called a \u201ctruly bizarre lobby group\u201d that focuses on promoting the belief that climate change is not real. She has also writen articles on controversial topics like her belief that same-sex marriage has led to the \u201cdestruction of the American family.\u201d\n\nMembers of the John Birch Society protested Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping on Feb. 1, 1979.

The Southern Poverty Law Center calls it a \u201cconspiracist group\u201d and said in 2013 that it was gaining influence again even after it was exiled by the right half a century ago because of its racist and anti-Semitic roots.\n\nJohn Rosemond: North Carolina psychologist John Rosemond is known for being an outspoken political conservative who holds a number of controversial views on parenting. The mental health community has pushed back on Rosemond\u2019s disciplinary approach to parenting including his belief that for certain children, spanking can be effective and is not harmful. Rosemond has received disciplinary sanctions from the North Carolina Licensing Board and has been entangled in a legal battle with Kentucky officials for misrepresenting his professional credentials.\n\nDr. Rosemary Fernandez-Stein: North Carolina-based pediatrician Rosemary Fernandez-Stein and her husband helped to co-write and were featured in a commercial that warned of the consequences of the ACA. The commercial was aired on Fox News and was called a \u201chome run\u201d by conservative strategist Frank Luntz.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The group includes Obamacare opponents and anti-vaxxers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The group includes Obamacare opponents and anti-vaxxers.", "title": "Ben Carson Rounded Up A Bunch Of Obamacare Opponents And Now Calls Them His \u2018Medical Coalition\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/10/02/3708572/ben-carson-medical-coalition/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/02115352/AP_580748412103.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The group includes Obamacare opponents and anti-vaxxers.", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/02115352/AP_580748412103-321x214.jpg", "title": "Ben Carson Rounded Up A Bunch Of Obamacare Opponents And Now Calls Them His \u2018Medical Coalition\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/02115352/AP_580748412103.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/02115352/AP_580748412103.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-02T13:09:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The Arizona-based doctor has appeared on television and radio programs to speak about her views on health care reform.\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson announced on Friday that he has assembled a team of 32 doctors, authors, and policy experts \u2014 mostly vocal Obamacare opponents and anti-vaccine proponents \u2014 to advise him on health care policy.\nPolitics Ben Carson Rounded Up A Bunch Of Obamacare Opponents And Now Calls Them His \u2018Medical Coalition\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/John Minchillo Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson to the media during a new conference before a campaign event at the Cedarville University, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015, in Cedarville, Ohio.\nCarson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, has repeatedly spoken out about his opposition to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nHe has called it the worst thing since slavery, worse than the terrorist attacks of September 11, and said the U.S. Supreme Court overstepped its authority when it upheld the landmark health care law."}
