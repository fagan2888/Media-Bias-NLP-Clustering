Photo: Luis Ascui\n\nThe chief executive of corporate medical provider Healthscope Robert Cooke says asking patients to make a small co-payment alongside their Medicare-funded doctor visits will not affect health outcomes and is an \u201cinevitable\u201d consequence for a government battling rising healthcare costs.\n\nMr Cooke said the proposed $6 payment for bulk billed visits to a general practitioner could act as \u201can important price signal.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the government as medical costs continue to balloon with the ageing population, the capacity to pay is going to be severely stretched,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think price signals in health care are important. It\u2019s not a free service, someone is paying for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Cooke said it was unlikely that the co-payment, which was proposed in a submission to the National Commission of Audit by consultant and former Tony Abbott health advisor Terry Barnes, was unlikely to influence a person\u2019s decision to visit a doctor. The co-payment proposal would save the government $750 million over four years, according to its author.\n\nCap required\n\nMr Cooke warned that if the Coalition was to take on board the proposal it should come with a frequency cap on the payments to protect \u201cvulnerable people in the community\u201d such as those on low incomes or patients with chronic illnesses.\n\nHealthscope operates 55 medical and skin cancer clinics across the country. Mr Cooke said over 80 per cent of visits to Healthscope GPs were funded by Medicare.\n\nThe private equity-owned company also operates pathology services and private hospitals and has been mooted for an initial public offering or trade sale in 2014.\n\nMr Barnes was a senior advisor to Mr Abbott when he was Health Minister in the Howard Government and was also a former advisor to former Liberal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge.\n\nThe lobby advocating for doctors, the Australian Medical Association, has come out against the controversial proposal, saying it will discourage people to visit their GP and that this will lead to increased hospitals visits and longer emergency room waiting times.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Asking patients to make a co-payment for doctor visits will not affect health outcomes, says Healthscope's Robert Cooke.", "title": "Healthscope CEO Robert Cooke backs Medicare co-payments", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/business/healthscope-ceo-robert-cooke-backs-medicare-copayments-20140102-3077s.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/7/9/z/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.3077s.png/1388634435150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/7/9/z/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.3077s.png/1388634435150.jpg"}, "description": "Asking patients to make a co-payment for doctor visits will not affect health outcomes, says Healthscope's Robert Cooke.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthscope CEO Robert Cooke backs Medicare co-payments"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Asking patients to make a co-payment for doctor visits will not affect health outcomes, says Healthscope's Robert Cooke."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb136\"", "article_summary": "Healthscope CEO Robert Cooke.\nThe co-payment proposal would save the government $750 million over four years, according to its author.\nMr Cooke said over 80 per cent of visits to Healthscope GPs were funded by Medicare.\nHealthscope operates 55 medical and skin cancer clinics across the country.\nPhoto: Luis AscuiThe chief executive of corporate medical provider Healthscope Robert Cooke says asking patients to make a small co-payment alongside their Medicare-funded doctor visits will not affect health outcomes and is an \u201cinevitable\u201d consequence for a government battling rising healthcare costs."}
