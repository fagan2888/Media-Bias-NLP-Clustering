Not a single shot was fired when government troops entered today (Saturday),\" he added.\n\nInitially triggered by a political row, battle lines have increasingly followed ethnic lines with Kiir's Dinka battling Machar's Nuer. Bor was the scene of a massacre of Dinka by Nuer troops loyal to Machar, during an earlier conflict in 1991.\n\nUganda, which for years backed the SPLA in its conflict against Sudan's government before the south declared independence in 2011, has sent its troops to support Kiir. A spokesman said the Ugandan People's Defence Force was behind the success at Bor, the capital of restive Jonglei state.\n\n\"It's UPDF that captured Bor,\" Ugandan army spokesman Paddy Ankunda told Reuters after first announcing the UPDF's role on Twitter. \"There was a lot of resistance but our force was overwhelming.\"\n\nUganda deployed its troops to South Sudan shortly after the fighting began. At first, Uganda said it troops were there to help stranded Ugandans and protect key facilities. But it has since declared its role in combat.\n\nUganda's involvement has raised worries of a broader conflict that draws other regional players into South Sudan, an oil-producing nation but one of the poorest in Africa.\n\nEthiopia, one of South Sudan's neighbours, has voiced its concerns about Uganda's role.\n\nMachar and rebel officials have demanded Ugandan forces withdraw before they agree a ceasefire at the talks in Addis Ababa that are sponsored by the regional African body IGAD.\n\n\"The mediators have tabled their offer,\" said Dina Mufti, spokesman for Ethiopia's Foreign Ministry. \"There is a good chance they will agree to its elements and sign an agreement on a cessation of hostilities within a week's time.\"\n\nU.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic said on Friday the fighting had \"now reached the threshold of an internal armed conflict\", a status that could lead to prosecutions for war crimes where deemed appropriate.\n\nSimonovic, speaking after a four-day trip to South Sudan, said \"mass atrocities\" had been committed by both sides. New York-based Human Rights Watch has also reported crimes against civilians, such as targeted attacks based on ethnicity.\n\n(Additional reporting by Elias Biryabarema in Kampala and Aaron Maasho in
