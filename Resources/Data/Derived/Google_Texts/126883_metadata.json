It\u2019s a pretty important question, and one the candidates will spend millions trying to figure out.\n\nEven Donald Trump, who left his competitors in the dust by zeroing right in on the issues and stylistic approach that would win him the Republican nomination, has got to be wondering how to grab the remaining votes he needs from a population that hasn\u2019t warmed up to his primary-season tactics.\n\nI have no magic 8 ball to consult for the answers; all I can tell you is what this voter is looking for from each of the likely major-party nominees.\n\nFrom Hillary Clinton, I want to see some candor. For instance, Clinton has branded herself during the Democratic primaries as a continuation of the Obama doctrine, with the occasional acknowledgement of the Obamacare flaws that need fixing and the foreign-policy failures that need addressing. Once she\u2019s the formal nominee, I want to hear what the Clinton doctrine is, and be reassured that she understands what went wrong and has a plan to fix it.\n\nAs for Trump, I want to see some humility. He should prove that he knows what he doesn\u2019t know by bringing in serious advisers and showing us what he\u2019s learning from them. Demonstrating genuine growth in his grasp of issues would go a long way toward dispelling the whiff of fraud that hangs over the Trump campaign.\n\nLuckily for our country, Clinton\u2019s partisans and trump\u2019s groupies won\u2019t decide this race. The rest of us will. And some of us want more than a bunch of smoke and spin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jon lays out what he's looking for from each of the likely major-party nominees.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/05/17/jon-keller-at-large-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-humility-candor/", "image": {"width": 628, "secure_url": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/clinton-trump.jpg?w=628", "identifier": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/clinton-trump.jpg?w=628", "height": 353}, "type": "article", "description": "Jon lays out what he's looking for from each of the likely major-party nominees.", "title": "Keller @ Large: Clinton Needs Candor, Trump Needs Humility"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/clinton-trump.jpg?w=628", "description": "Jon lays out what he's looking for from each of the likely major-party nominees.", "site": "CBSboston", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Keller @ Large: Clinton Needs Candor, Trump Needs Humility"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Boston News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Boston's Best", "msvalidate.01": "FDD12CE797EAB78953FDE9ACF7F312A5", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Boston", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston"}, "keywords": "jon keller, keller at large, keller @ large, hillary clinton, donald trump, republican, democrat, politics,", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://boston.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/72ff1baf55fe94c284ce5747d8d4a96e?s=16", "news_keywords": "donald trump, hillary clinton, jon keller, keller at large"}, "article_summary": "Once she\u2019s the formal nominee, I want to hear what the Clinton doctrine is, and be reassured that she understands what went wrong and has a plan to fix it.\nBOSTON (CBS) \u2014 What really matters to voters as they try to choose a president?\nDemonstrating genuine growth in his grasp of issues would go a long way toward dispelling the whiff of fraud that hangs over the Trump campaign.\nIt\u2019s a pretty important question, and one the candidates will spend millions trying to figure out.\nFrom Hillary Clinton, I want to see some candor."}
