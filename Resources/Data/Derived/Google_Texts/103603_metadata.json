The whole idea seemed too bizarre to be taken seriously, and the effort barely caused a ripple in national coverage on health care policy.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame, because as Sarah Kliff noted yesterday, the ridiculous proposal actually passed this week.\n\nArizona has passed a bizarre new law in which the state effectively promises that if the Supreme Court destroys its health exchange, it won\u2019t build a new one, no matter how badly Arizonans are hurting.\n\nEven for Republicans, this is an odd one. I\u2019ve heard plenty about states claiming to hate \u201cObamacare,\u201d but it\u2019s unusual to see a state declare its intention to punish itself, on purpose, for no reason.\n\nIf the GOP justices on the Supreme Court side with the far-right in the King v. Burwell case, insurance subsidies will only be available to consumers in states with their own exchange marketplaces. And what if your state doesn\u2019t have an exchange? Then according to the Supreme Court, you and your neighbors wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the benefits anymore.\n\nOf course, states could respond to the ruling by creating these marketplaces, protecting consumers from massive premium increases, and some states have already suggested they\u2019re prepared to do exactly that to prevent families from suffering.\n\nBut Arizona this week did the opposite, announcing that, no matter what, they will not create a marketplace for private insurers to compete for Arizonans\u2019 business. State Republicans want to make sure those tax dollars go to other states, not their own, while forcing over 200,000 people in Arizona to lose their subsidies \u2013 again, on purpose \u2013 so that they\u2019ll struggle to pay for their coverage.\n\nThe apparent goal of a policy like this is genuinely hard to understand: lawmakers in Arizona want to deny benefits to their constituents in order to spite an effective federal law, which Republicans don\u2019t like for reasons they can\u2019t explain.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this new state law can be reversed later. If the court ruling goes the wrong way, and 200,000 Arizonans demand state action, lawmakers could simply pass a new law overriding this one and protecting families from health care insecurity.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "How much do Republican policymakers in Arizona hate \"Obamacare\"?
