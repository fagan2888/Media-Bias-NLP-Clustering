Indiana University Southeast students on Thursday were told to stay inside and lock their doors over what turned out to be a man carrying an umbrella.

“IU Southeast Emergency! An armed person is on campus. Go into nearest room and lock door. Follow instructions from authorities,” the university’s official Twitter account tweeted Thursday afternoon.

The school said police were searching for a white male, approximately 5’ 10”, wearing light colored shorts and a camouflage backpack.

Students were cleared to leave roughly one hour after the lockdown was issued after authorities located the man. IU Southeast tweeted the reported weapon was an umbrella.

“Update: All Clear. The suspect has been located and the reported weapon has been identified as an umbrella. At this time it is safe to leave,” the school said.

Twitter users immediately started ridiculing the school and authorities for what they perceived as an overreaction.

“Headline… ‘IU campus held hostage by… Mary Poppins,’” one commenter said.

“Nice. Good way to get innocent people hurt,” another said.

“Whoever called 911 to report this should be stoned to death in public,” wrote another.
