Obama Thursday at the White House.\n\nThe interview will air on V-103 at 7:30 a.m. Monday.\n\nCameron Friday morning said Mayor Kasim Reed\u2018s office reached out to him Tuesday, saying Obama wanted to meet with him and four other radio hosts Thursday to talk about health care. Cameron paid for a flight up to D.C. on Wednesday. He was told about 400,000 people eligible for the Affordable Care Act have not signed up in metro Atlanta and Obama wanted a big platform to convey that message. He also wanted to talk about justice reform.\n\nEach host was given five minutes of one-on-one time with the president at the White House on Thursday. Cameron chose to finish last in hopes of getting a little more time and he succeeded, pulling in eight minutes.\n\nCameron said Obama recognized him from two previous brief encounters in Atlanta, telling him, \u201cYou always dress so sharp.\u201d\n\nThe hometown morning host said compared to the meet-and-greet set ups before, he said seeing Obama at his home was different. \u201cHe was so relaxed,\u201d he said.\n\nOne thing did freak him out: he had all these questions to ask and Obama seemed to anticipate some of them before he even asked them. Referencing \u201cScandal,\u201d he said, it was like \u201csome B613 stuff going on.\u201d\n\nCameron wore his good-luck pin given to him by his favorite basketball player of all time, Dr. Julius Erving. After he and Erving became friends, the basketball legend gave Cameron a sweep pin he had received from his 1983 sweep of the Lakers while he played for the 76ers. Cameron treasures it.\n\nAfter Obama noted his sharp-dressed ways, Cameron mentioned the pin and told him the story. Obama mentioned to him how much he loved that team. \u201cIt was just wow,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHe was trying to explain to his staff but he was like, \u2018You guys don\u2019t remember. You\u2019re way too young!\u2019 \u201d\n\nObama has reached out over the years to black radio talk show hosts when he needs to get specific messages out to that audience, including Steve Harvey, Rickey Smiley and Cameron\u2019s predecessor Frank Ski.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Radio and TV Talk", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/11/06/ryan-cameron-interviews-barack-obama-airing-on-v-103-nov-9/", "image": "https://cmgajcradiotvtalk.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/obama-ryan.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By RODNEY HO/ rho@ajc.com, originally Friday, November 6, 2015\r\n\r\nV-103 morning host Ryan Cameron interviewed Pres.
