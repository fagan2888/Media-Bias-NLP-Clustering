It\u2019s also very easy to do. Simply fill out form 4868 by April 15 either electronically or via snail mail and you\u2019ll automatically be granted an extension for six months. You don\u2019t need to give a reason why you\u2019re requesting an extension.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What to Do with That Tax Refund (at Every Age)\n\nFiling a tax extension is actually a lot more common than people might think. Nearly 13 million taxpayers requested an automatic extension last year for their 2013 tax returns.\n\nBut there are some major misunderstandings and questions about filing an extension. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nYou Still Have to Pay Taxes by April 15\n\nFiling a tax extension with the IRS allows you to push the deadline back to Oct. 15 and avoid IRS late-filing penalties as long as you file for the extension by April 15. But here\u2019s the catch: You must pay your estimated tax bill by April 15.\n\nRelated: 26 Most Overlooked Tax Deductions\n\n\u201cThe extension only pushes back the due date for the paperwork,\u201d TurboTax explains. \u201cIf you owe money, you need to estimate the amount, then file your extension and make your payment by April 15.\u201d\n\nWhat Happens If You Don\u2019t Pay by April 15?\n\nThe same as if you file a return by April 15 but fail to pay the taxes you owe: You could be liable for penalties and interest. If you have underestimated the amount you owe, you will also be liable for paying interest on the amount you failed to pay.\n\nThe IRS says you should pay at least 90 percent of your tax liability. If you pay less, you\u2019ll end up owing a 0.5 percent penalty of the underpayment every month until you pay the balance.\n\nWhat Are Some of the Best Reasons for an Extension?\n\nIf you have to pay taxes by April 15 anyway, you may wonder what the benefit is of applying for an extension. There are several cases in which it makes sense. The main advantage is it gives you more time to get your paperwork in order. This is especially useful for people who are receiving some key forms late.\n\nRelated: Last-Minute Tax Moves That Can Still Save You Money\n\n\u201cAs one example, quite often taxpayers who have invested in partnerships or S corporations do not receive their K-1s from these entities until after the original April 15 due date,\u201d Ron Michelson, a CPA with Florida\u2013based Fiske, told the IRS\u2019s U.S. Tax Center.\n\nFiling a tax extension also makes sense if you\u2019ve been lazy or too busy to get all your paperwork in order. But if the IRS owes you a refund, skip the extension and file as soon as possible. You won\u2019t face a late-filing penalty if you are owed money back and you don\u2019t want to extend your interest-free loan to the government any longer than necessary.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With less than a month left to file your tax return, you may be debating whether an extension makes senses.
