Recently, GHN reported that the Texas-based chain Tenet Health is seeking a partner or buyer for its Georgia hospitals.\n\nAnd Piedmont Healthcare, based in Atlanta, has begun talking about a partnership with St. Francis Hospital in Columbus, which is reeling from a $30 million accounting inaccuracy.\n\nA merger, if completed, would combine Emory\u2019s academic health system with WellStar\u2019s expertise in running community hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe want to end up with the best of community health care and the best of academic health care,\u2019\u2019 Emory University President James Wagner said Monday. \u201cWe hope to be a model for the Southeast and the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nIt would also create a system with geographic reach across Atlanta and into the city\u2019s northwest suburbs, where WellStar dominates the market.\n\nThe initial talks between the two systems will continue for 45 days, under a resolution passed by each organization\u2019s board. Completing a merger would take a year or more, leaders of each organization told GHN.\n\nThe vision is to create a new nonprofit company containing the assets of both Emory Healthcare and WellStar. \u201cIt is a true 50/50 partnership of equals,\u2019\u2019 Reynold Jennings, CEO of WellStar, told GHN.\n\nEmory Healthcare and WellStar staffers would become employees of the new entity, he added.\n\nA merger would represent the first such combination of a leading academic health organization and a large community health system in the Southeast, he said.\n\nThe changes in hospital and physician payments helped drive the push to consolidate, Jennings said.\n\nHealth insurers and Medicare are moving more toward paying for a bundling of medical services, rather than paying for individual procedures separately.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not in an offensive strategy, the emerging health care [changes] will put you on a defensive strategy,\u2019\u2019 Jennings said.\n\nA combination would foster savings in economies of scale, he added.\n\nJennings said that if initial talks lead to a green light on merger plans, he will hold off on his pending retirement to work on planning for the new company.\n\nWagner said departing Emory Healthcare CEO John Fox has been actively involved in the discussions with WellStar. Fox is stepping down as Emory Healthcare CEO to take a similar post at a Michigan system in March.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nHealth systems are looking to gain more leverage in their dealings with insurers, who are ratcheting down payments, said Craig Savage, of Durham, N.C.-based CMBC Advisors, a consulting firm.\n\n\u201cA lot of provider systems are trying to do the same thing, to stay one step ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nAn Emory/WellStar combination \u201cmakes a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 Savage said. It could provide Emory \u201cwith more support for its teaching and research activities.\u201d\n\nSome Georgia hospitals have banded together in partnerships or alliances to protect their common interests. But an outright merger \u2013 such as the one Emory and WellStar are considering \u2014 is a much more solid and permanent deal. \u201cThere\u2019s always an opportunity to walk away\u2019\u2019 from a partnership, Savage noted.\n\nEmory Healthcare, with about $2.7 billion in annual revenue, has six hospitals, 200 provider locations and 1,800 physicians.\n\nIts flagship Atlanta hospital, Emory University Hospital, has gained national attention in recent months for its role in the fight against Ebola. It was the first U.S. facility ever to treat an Ebola patient, and Emory has successfully treated all four Ebola patients admitted there.\n\nWellStar includes WellStar Kennestone Regional Medical Center (anchored by WellStar Kennestone Hospital in Marietta) and WellStar Cobb, Douglas, Paulding and Windy Hill hospitals, along with its physicians, urgent care centers and health parks.\n\nA merger would overshadow the remaining systems in the Atlanta area, including Piedmont and Northside Hospital.\n\nJennings said he intends to continue WellStar\u2019s role in the health plan that it currently operates with Piedmont. And he said he does not think a merger with Emory would lead to any obstacles on antitrust grounds.\n\nA 2011 hospital merger in Albany led to an antitrust lawsuit by the federal government, and the dispute has gone on for years, but metro Atlanta is a much more competitive environment.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "In the turbulent business of health care, bigger is often better.", "title": "Emory, Wellstar discuss a blockbuster merger", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/business/emory-wellstar-discuss-a-blockbuster-merger/article_9f4e8848-b087-11e4-a68e-ab2f1f5ead52.html", "image": {"width": 510, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/23/e23a0100-f524-50cb-8735-dc5b298ad4e5/526b5616256ab.image.jpg?resize=510%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In the turbulent business of health care, bigger is often better.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "business,business,business,business,business,business", "news_keywords": "business,business,business,business,business,business"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe want to end up with the best of community health care and the best of academic health care,\u2019\u2019 Emory University President James Wagner said Monday.\nIts flagship Atlanta hospital, Emory University Hospital, has gained national attention in recent months for its role in the fight against Ebola.\nThe vision is to create a new nonprofit company containing the assets of both Emory Healthcare and WellStar.\nEmory Healthcare and WellStar staffers would become employees of the new entity, he added.\nEmory Healthcare, with about $2.7 billion in annual revenue, has six hospitals, 200 provider locations and 1,800 physicians."}
