Bruce Poliquin is comfortably ahead in the money race for his 2016 re-election bid for Maine\u2019s 2nd District with the Republican outraising Democrat Emily Cain by more than five times from January through the end of March.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge haul for Poliquin, who raised $700,000 to Cain\u2019s $136,000 in 2015\u2019s first quarter. It\u2019s a sign that their likely rematch will be a larger priority for their parties than it was in 2014. That was still the most expensive U.S. House race in Maine\u2019s history with outside groups spending $3 million supporting and opposing candidates.\n\nBruce Poliquin speaks to his supporters gathered in Bangor in 2014.

Patrick Murphy, D-Fla, who raised $558,000, according to Roll Call. Both Murphy and Poliquin serve on the House Financial Services Committee, whose members often raise more than their colleagues with financial industry backing.\n\nThe campaigns haven\u2019t released their filings, which contain details about donors and aren\u2019t due to the Federal Election Commission until Wednesday.\n\nPoliquin had more time to raise money than Cain, who entered the 2016 race in March, but his campaign said on Monday that more than $400,000 of his money came from individuals and most of the money was raised in March with most of the rest coming from political action committees and other candidate committees.\n\n\u201cWhile working on issues important to Maine\u2019s 2nd District families, I\u2019m grateful that my campaign committee is receiving strong support to build a winning re-election effort so this work can continue,\u201d Poliquin said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Cain\u2019s campaign said her total demonstrates \u201centhusiasm and strong, local grassroots support\u201d with more than 95 percent of donors contributing $250 or less and 80 percent of donors coming from Maine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored and humbled by the strong support and enthusiastic response we\u2019ve already received from people all across Maine,\u201d Cain said in a statement.\n\nThis campaign has heated up much earlier than it did in 2014 after Democratic incumbent Mike Michaud announced an ultimately unsuccessful run for governor. Then, Cain announced for the race in June and Poliquin committed in August, and they combined to raise $3.7 million during the campaign.\n\nPoliquin, of Oakland, won with 45 percent of votes in November \u2014 a large share, given that independent conservative Blaine Richardson won 11 percent \u2014 and got to Washington in January.\n\nSo far, he has received national attention by breaking with his party in not voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He opposes the law, but he has said he wants to see a conservative alternative before repeal.\n\nCain, who had been pushed to run again by national Democrats virtually since Election Day, surprised some pundits with the early declaration, but the former state senator has laid low for the most part since then.\n\nThe parties are gearing up for a competitive race in 2016, a presidential year. In February, the campaign arm for House Republicans put Poliquin and 11 other party lawmakers in a program to aid incumbents who could be vulnerable. Earlier in the month, he made a list of the Democrats\u2019 top targets.\n\nWhile the rural 2nd District is more conservative than the rest of Maine, it has nonetheless voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1992. However, no sitting congressperson from the district has lost re-election in the modern era.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's an impressive total for the Republican from Maine's 2nd District, and it signifies that his likely rematch against Democrat Emily Cain will be pricier than before.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "It's an impressive total for the Republican from Maine's 2nd District, and it signifies that his likely rematch against Democrat Emily Cain will be pricier than before.", "title": "Poliquin raises $700K in three months for 2016 re-election bid - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/384737_610932_2014_1104_poliquinpa.jpg", "height": 664}, "updated_time": "2015-04-13T16:36:30-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/04/13/poliquin-raises-700k-in-three-months-for-2016-re-election-bid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/384737_610932_2014_1104_poliquinpa.jpg", "description": "It's an impressive total for the Republican from Maine's 2nd District, and it signifies that his likely rematch against Democrat Emily Cain will be pricier than before.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Poliquin raises $700K in three months for 2016 re-election bid - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2015-04-13T11:16:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T16:36:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0162\"", "article_summary": "That was still the most expensive U.S. House race in Maine\u2019s history with outside groups spending $3 million supporting and opposing candidates.\nU.S. Rep.
