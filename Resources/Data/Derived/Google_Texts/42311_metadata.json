But if you encountered any difficulty enrolling through HealthCare.gov, you may be eligible for an extension through Feb. 22. Visit HealthCare.gov or call the federal health insurance marketplace, 1-800-318-2596, for more information.\n\nThe health insurance company, which insures 417,000 people across the state, plans to cut all Carolinas Healthcare System providers, including Roper St. Francis doctors and hospitals, from its network Feb. 28.\n\nOnline For more health news, go to postandcourier.com/yourhealth.\n\n\u201cWe offered to pay Roper St. Francis rates that are similar to what other health plans pay them for the same services, but the hospital system is demanding an increase above the market average without any commitment to the quality or value it provides our customers,\u201d said Daryl Richard, a spokesman for the insurance company. Richard said about 10,000 customers will be affected by this decision.\n\nRoper St. Francis spokesman Andy Lyons said the hospital is committed to quality. \u201cNegotiations continue, but there are significant gaps in what United Healthcare is proposing and what Roper St. Francis considers to be fair rates and contract terms.\u201d\n\nIf United Healthcare beneficiaries wish to continue seeing Roper St. Francis providers after Feb. 28, they will be expected to pay higher, out-of-network prices. Emergency care at Roper St. Francis facilities will continue to be covered at in-network rates.\n\nThe negotiations do not affect the contracts between United Healthcare and other Charleston-area hospitals. Patients insured by United Healthcare will continue to pay in-network prices at Medical University Hospital, East Cooper Medical Center and Trident Health facilities.\n\nUnited Healthcare customers who are already receiving care at Roper St. Francis because of an ongoing illness or pregnancy may be eligible for in-network benefits during a transition period, the hospital system\u2019s CEO told patients in a letter earlier this month.\n\nNone of this is unprecedented. Health insurance networks are becoming increasingly \u201cnarrow\u201d \u2014 or \u201chigh-value,\u201d as insurance companies like to say \u2014 as companies try to control costs by limiting patient choice to hospitals and doctors that provide the best results for the best prices.\n\nThis trend is already apparent in the Lowcountry. For example, Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan, which offers policies to South Carolinians through the federal health insurance marketplace, does not include Roper St. Francis in its network either. BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina does not include the Medical University Hospital in its plans offered through the marketplace.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a national trade organization, commissioned a report last year concluding, \u201cThe use of high-value provider networks is one of the tools used by health plans to reduce costs and provide high quality and cost effective care for consumers.\u201d The report found that premiums were 5 percent to 20 percent lower for narrow network plans, compared with \u201cbroad network plans.\u201d\n\nAll this, of course, is harder to swallow for patients whose choices have been recently restricted.\n\nColin Smoak, a benefits consultant in Mount Pleasant, called these negotiations between providers and insurance companies \u201csadly routine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a saber-rattling contest,\u201d Smoak said. \u201cIt would surprise me if United Healthcare will stay out at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "United Healthcare dropping Roper St. Francis from insurance network, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, health insurance,Roper St. Francis Healthcare", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "United Healthcare customers in South Carolina will soon have fewer options when they need to make medical decisions.", "title": "United Healthcare dropping Roper St. Francis from insurance network", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150216/150219464/united-healthcare-dropping-roper-st-francis-from-insurance-network", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150216/PC16/150219464/AR/0/AR-150219464.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150216/PC16/150219464/AR/0/AR-150219464.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "United Healthcare customers in South Carolina will soon have fewer options when they need to make medical decisions.", "title": "United Healthcare dropping Roper St. Francis from insurance network", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150216/PC16/150219464/AR/0/AR-150219464.jpg?201502161641", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150219464}}, "keywords": "United Healthcare dropping Roper St. Francis from insurance network , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, health insurance,Roper St. Francis Healthcare", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-16T15:43:49Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-16T16:41:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "United Healthcare customers in South Carolina will soon have fewer options when they need to make medical decisions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2e5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNegotiations continue, but there are significant gaps in what United Healthcare is proposing and what Roper St. Francis considers to be fair rates and contract terms.\u201dIf United Healthcare beneficiaries wish to continue seeing Roper St. Francis providers after Feb. 28, they will be expected to pay higher, out-of-network prices.\nUnited Healthcare is planning to drop Roper St. Francis hospitals from its network Feb. 28.\nEmergency care at Roper St. Francis facilities will continue to be covered at in-network rates.\n\u201cIt would surprise me if United Healthcare will stay out at the end of the day.\u201dReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.\nUnited Healthcare customers in South Carolina will soon have fewer options when they need to make medical decisions."}
