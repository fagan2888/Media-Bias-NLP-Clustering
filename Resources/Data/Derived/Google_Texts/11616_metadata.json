Mark Udall in the closing weeks of a race that may shift the balance of power in Washington, DC.\n\nKicking off two rallies over the next 18 hours in Colorado\u2019s two biggest swing counties, Clinton echoed the message delivered last week by First Lady Michelle Obama and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, urging voters not to vote their fears about ISIS or Ebloa, as he alleged Republicans are encouraging them to do \u2014 and he framed the choice for middle class voters as a matter of economic fairness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought of Colorado as a state of the future,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe have to decide whether we\u2019re going into the future together, with shared opportunities for everyone willing to work for it, or whether we\u2019re going to go back to trickle-down economics where one or two percent of the population are getting all the benefits.\u201d\n\nClinton also rattled off a list of Udall\u2019s work with Republican lawmakers on earmark reform, the Farm Bill, and comprehensive immigration reform, making a more convincing argument about the lawmaker\u2019s bipartisan background than the incumbent\u2019s campaign has to date.\n\nAfter defending the Affordable Care Act and noting that insurance premiums are rising at a lower rate since the law\u2019s implementation, Clinton looked to unpack Gardner\u2019s campaign strategy of nationalizing the race against Udall.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take Mark Udall off the ballot and put the president on the ballot,\u201d Clinton said, noting the president only has two years left in office but that Gardner is seeking a six year-term.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll vote against you for six years but it\u2019ll feel so good on Election Day,\u201d he continued. \u201cIsn\u2019t that basically whats going on? He\u2019s saying give me a six-year job for a two-year protest.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take the deal.\u201d\n\nClinton also implored voters here to support Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and congressional candidate Andrew Romanoff, running in perhaps the country\u2019s most competitive race to unseat Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Aurora.\n\n\u201cI have an admission: I really like Andrew Romanoff, personally,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nTouting Hickenlooper\u2019s work after last year\u2019s devastating floods and his effort to bring together the state\u2019s oil and gas industry and environmentalists, Clinton urged Coloradans to give the governor four more years.\n\n\u201cYou say you want leaders who bring people together,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s what John Hickenlooper has done. You\u2019d better reelect him.\u201d\n\nClinton will rally supporters again Tuesday morning in Lakewood, smack in the heart of Jefferson County, the state\u2019s biggest bellwether.\n\nUdall, who 10 days ago told a group of canvassers that the pundits were counting him out, shrugged off the cloak of the underdog as he introduced Clinton, telling supporters that his campaign is on the road to victory.\n\n\u201cWe have momentum. We are surging,\u201d Udall said. \u201cWe are going to win this election.\u201d\n\nRepublican Congressman Cory Gardner, who has mostly held smaller campaign events in the closing weeks, is set to rally alongside former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday in Douglas County, a solidly Republican county.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AURORA -- Former President Bill Clinton continued the parade of prominent Democratic surrogates in Colorado to stump\u00a0for Democratic U.S. Sen.
