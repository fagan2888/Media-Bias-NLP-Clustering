The trend statewide will be to eliminate teacher assistants in all areas except K-1 classrooms. Like so many other educators across the state, Jackson County recognizes the need for teacher assistants and hopes that the state level will make changes soon. \u201cOur teacher assistants are valuable members of our educational family,\u201d said Dr. Murray. \u201cThey are used appropriately and help reduce our class size by working with students in small groups and assisting the teacher in providing differentiated instruction in the classroom.\u201d\n\nRowan-Salisbury Schools made a decision on how they will handle the state\u2019s budget cuts to public schools \u2014 they laid off 46 employees last week.\n\nForty-six Rowan-Salisbury employees found out Friday they will be without a job this school year. \u201cSchools operate like families, so when you lose someone on your staff \u2014 for a school, it\u2019s like losing a family member,\u201d said Superintendent Dr. Lynn Moody. Due to state budget cuts and a dwindling fund balance, the district cut 79 positions \u2014 18 district-wide personnel, 15 school-based personnel and 46 teacher assistants.\n\nOf those 46 layoffs, 32 were teacher assistants. Many of those TAs doubled as school bus drivers (see my story about this issue here).\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Rowan-Salisbury has had to reduce its workforce.\n\nSince the financial downturn in 2008, roughly 300 positions have been cut. This time the cuts are because of reductions in state teacher assistant funding and the district\u2019s fund balance. The state budget called for a 22 percent, or $1.3 million, reduction in funding for teacher assistants.\n\nGot more public school cuts resulting from the new state budget to report?
