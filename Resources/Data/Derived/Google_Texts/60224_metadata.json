The Commerce Department this week is also leading a trade mission of 20 U.S. cyber firms to the country in an effort to strengthen private sector ties.\n\nRomania oversees the Ukraine Cyber Defense Trust Fund, a program funded by NATO member countries to help strengthen embattled Ukrainian defenses.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to be a regional leader,\u201d Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta recently told foreign media outlets. \u201cThat is why Romania \u2026 has been appointed by NATO to be in charge of [Ukraine's] cybersecurity and preventing cyber warfare.\u201d\n\nEastern Europe has long been home to some of the most advanced hackers in the world.\n\nFormer Soviet bloc states have well-established elite math and science education programs that were churning out computer programmers before it was trendy.\n\nAn underground online market known as the \u201ccyber arms bazaar\u201d operates out of the region, trafficking hacking tools, viruses and any form of infiltration and cyber sabotage imaginable. Nearly all cyber crime worldwide \u2014 a $400-plus billion business annually \u2014 can be traced back to the bazaar in some fashion.\n\nRomanian digital thieves were part of this business, pilfering $1 billion from U.S. victims in 2011, U.S. officials said at the time. A Romanian hacker known as \u201cGuccifer\u201d also became infamous after exposing former president George W. Bush\u2019s paintings of himself in the shower and bath.\n\nThe U.S. has struggled to use the Eastern Europe cyber expertise to its advantage. American investigators have had trouble cooperating with local law enforcement when trying to collect evidence or arrest cyber crooks peppering U.S. businesses with attacks.\n\nRomania has emerged as an exception. Europe\u2019s police agency told the AP that 20 percent of Europol\u2019s cyber defense force are Romanian police officers.\n\nWith its trade mission, the U.S. Commerce Department is trying to encourage private sector collaboration as well between the two countries.\n\nBruce Andrews, deputy secretary of Commerce, told a Romanian audience on Tuesday that the trade mission \"is a testament to your tech savvy, this region\u2019s strategic location, and our shared dedication to combatting both criminal and state-sponsored cyber attacks.\"\n\nCompanies traveling this week with Commerce are also touting the benefits of joining forces with Romanian cyber firms.\n\n\u201cCyber readiness exercises don't happen \u2014 and real actions aren't taken \u2014 until we can all come to the table and start to collaborate,\u201d wrote Ryan Gillis, vice president of government affairs and policy at Palo Alto Networks, one of the companies on the trip.\n\nBut Romania faces a tall task defending Ukraine against Russia\u2019s dominant cyber program.\n\nIn response to international sanctions over its intervention in Ukraine, Russia has become more brazen with its cyberattacks worldwide.\n\n\u201cA dramatic increase,\u201d Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at security research firm Trend Micro, told The Hill in March.\n\nMoscow has also increasingly targeted Ukraine, using its digital deftness to stir unrest in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ukraine conflict is kept in place artificially by Russia,\u201d Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of cybersecurity training firm KnowBe4, told The Hill when discussing Russian cyber crime rings.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Romania has emerged as an unlikely cybersecurity ally for the international community.", "description": "Romania has emerged as an unlikely cybersecurity ally for the international community.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Romania has emerged as an unlikely cybersecurity ally for the international community.", "title": "Romania defending Ukraine's cyberspace", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/241889-romania-defending-ukraines-cyberspace", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/bucharestromania05132015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/241889-romania-defending-ukraines-cyberspace", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-13T10:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-13T10:06:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/241889-romania-defending-ukraines-cyberspace", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Romania has emerged as an unlikely cybersecurity ally for the international community.", "card": "summary", "title": "Romania defending Ukraine's cyberspace"}, "dcterms.title": "Romania defending Ukraine's cyberspace"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce471\"", "article_summary": "Romania oversees the Ukraine Cyber Defense Trust Fund, a program funded by NATO member countries to help strengthen embattled Ukrainian defenses.\nIn response to international sanctions over its intervention in Ukraine, Russia has become more brazen with its cyberattacks worldwide.\nBut Romania faces a tall task defending Ukraine against Russia\u2019s dominant cyber program.\nCompanies traveling this week with Commerce are also touting the benefits of joining forces with Romanian cyber firms.\nAmid the turmoil in Ukraine, Romania has emerged as an unlikely cybersecurity ally for the international community."}
