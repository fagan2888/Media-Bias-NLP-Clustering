That\u2019s partly a factor of TV production schedules, partly the hesitance about shoehorning a serious issue in between laugh tracks. But on Friday night, ABC\u2019s \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d managed to jump into current events \u2014 specifically, the Obamacare debate.\n\nLead character Mike Baxter (Tim Allen) is a conservative dad who deeply dislikes President Obama \u2014 and the show used the start of second Healthcare.gov rollout to set up some one-liners. On Friday night\u2019s episode, we learned that health insurance costs at Mike\u2019s Outdoor World store are going through the roof, thanks to stupid employees (in this case, a dude named Kyle) who get in motorcycle accidents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already paying more to meet the new Obamacare requirements,\u201d complains Mike\u2019s boss, Ed.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought if you liked your present health care plan, you could keep it,\u201d Mike says dryly.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re making us add stuff like vision care and birth control,\u201d Ed continues.\n\n\u201cIf women get vision care, our men won\u2019t need birth control,\u201d Mike zings back.\n\nThis goes on for awhile until Ed decides that he\u2019s going to cut the employees to part-time so they can get rid of health insurance. Mike argues that\u2019s not fair, and they should take care of their employees.\n\n\u201cIf I cut them loose, they can get their own plan on the private exchange,\u201d Ed says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mike counters. \u201cAnybody who can figure out that exchange is too smart to be working here.\u201d Cue the laughter.\n\nIt all culminates with a dinner table discussion in which Mike tells his daughters and wife Vanessa about Ed\u2019s plan. \u201cYou know what? I blame this on your president,\u201d Mike says to his daughter, Kristin, who battles him on liberal versus conservative issues.\n\n\u201cYou said that last month when it hailed,\u201d Kristen says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI cannot believe you are still railing against Obamacare. Wasn\u2019t that, like, ten fake scandals ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we all agree he screws up a lot, but I prefer his earlier, classic screw-ups,\u201d Mike says. He adds that it\u2019s not Obama\u2019s job to give Americans more insurance: \u201cWho does he think he is, that cooler black dude on the Allstate commercials?\u201d Hahahaha!\n\nWhen Mike\u2019s other daughter says she\u2019s grateful Kyle (her boyfriend) was covered for his motorcycle accident, Mike insists \u201cthe feds had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take care of our employees because we choose to. It\u2019s like when I choose to empty the dishwasher. It\u2019s great because I choose it. It\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Mike explains. \u201cIt\u2019s better than when your mom nags me to do it.\u201d\n\nVanessa: \u201cWhen have you ever emptied the dishwasher?\u201d Ba-da-bump!\n\nIn the end, Ed tries to save on health care costs by promoting healthy lifestyles among his staff: He throws out the break-room doughnuts, starts yoga classes in the office. But in a classic sitcom ending, Ed decides that ultimately, he can\u2019t tell people how to live their lives.\n\nStill, Mike recommends that Kyle not ride his motorcycle anymore. Because of Obamacare? No, says Mike, though he wouldn\u2019t mind laying the blame on Obama \u201cbecause literally everything is his fault.\u201d Hahahahaha!\n\n\u201cLast Man Standing\u201d hit a season high in the ratings with this episode, as about 7 million tuned in on Friday night. Maybe a good reason for more sitcoms to try topical humor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's tough for sitcoms to do a timely political story, but Tim Allen's show found a way.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emily.yahr", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It's tough for sitcoms to do a timely political story, but Tim Allen's show found a way.", "title": "\u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 still has a lot to say about Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/11/17/last-man-standing-still-has-a-lot-to-say-about-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2014/11/137538_5702_pre.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@emilyyahr"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/11/17/last-man-standing-still-has-a-lot-to-say-about-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "tim allen; last man standing; tim allen republican; obamacare on last man standing; last man standing abc; last man standing sitcom; tim allen mike baxter; mike last man standing ABC; tim allen obamacare; obamacare rollout; healthcare.gov rollout;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emily.yahr"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "tim allen; last man standing; tim allen republican; obamacare on last man standing; last man standing abc; last man standing sitcom; tim allen mike baxter; mike last man standing ABC; tim allen obamacare; obamacare rollout; healthcare.gov rollout;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7d5\"", "article_summary": "But on Friday night, ABC\u2019s \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d managed to jump into current events \u2014 specifically, the Obamacare debate.\n\u201cLast Man Standing\u201d hit a season high in the ratings with this episode, as about 7 million tuned in on Friday night.\nTim Allen on \u201cLast Man Standing.\u201d (Nicole Wilder/ABC)It can be tough for a sitcom to take on a timely topic, particularly in the political arena.\n\u201cAnd I thought if you liked your present health care plan, you could keep it,\u201d Mike says dryly.\n\u201cI\u2019m already paying more to meet the new Obamacare requirements,\u201d complains Mike\u2019s boss, Ed."}
