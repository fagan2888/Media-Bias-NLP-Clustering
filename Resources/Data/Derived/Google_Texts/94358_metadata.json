By avoiding the constrictions of shareholders and the need for aggressive pricing, industries are providing a different value proposition to the market.\n\nThere are seven principles of co-ops:\n\n\u25a0 Voluntary and open membership;\n\n\u25a0 Democratic member control;\n\n\u25a0 Member economic participation;\n\n\u25a0 Autonomy and independence;\n\n\u25a0 Education, training, and information;\n\n\u25a0 Cooperation; and\n\n\u25a0 Concern for the community.\n\n\u201cI would like to see more industries adopt the cooperative business model,\u201d says Chris Brooks, executive vice president of energy services for Valley Electric Association. \u201cIf other industries viewed their consumers as owners and didn\u2019t appeal to them solely as shareholders or investors, you would see different strategies and a higher level of commitment.\u201d\n\nFor Valley Electric Association, Southern Nevada is home to a long-running successful co-op that transcends state boundaries. From its headquarters in Pahrump, the VEA serves substantial irrigation power loads to the Amargosa and Fish Lake valley portions of its service area, and is the only out-of-state utility company in the California independent system operator, which controls energy transmission throughout the state.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t raised rates a penny in four years,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe are held accountable through monthly meetings with our board of directors, and on a daily basis we remind ourselves we are here to serve the owner-members of this company.\u201d\n\nNext year, the VEA will celebrate its 50th year. Although many variables have changed, its dedication to the co-op business model\u2019s seven principles has not.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at four other distinct industries experiencing the success of a co-op collaboration:\n\nA creative co-op\n\nOne of valley\u2019s newest co-ops is the Vegas Video Co-op, established in 2013. In a city that depends on communications for business, this co-op lets members access top-quality professional video services for as little as $209 per month.\n\n\u201cBecause of the high numbers of entrepreneurs in the area, it leads to more opportunity for us as they recognize the importance video plays in their online sales and marketing efforts,\u201d Vegas Video Co-op founder Scott Whitney says.\n\nAlong with entrepreneurs, the co-op has landed major clients, including: KSHP-AM (1400), local television personality Dave Courvoisier, LASIK of Nevada and Las Vegas Heals.\n\nThe co-op provides clients with important strategic coaching on content that can be worth more than the cost of membership. The strategy often involves directing clients to create content so the viewer takes an action, or implementing a video communication strategy that boosts clients\u2019 bottom lines.\n\n\u201cWhether you are trying to sell something or establish yourself as an expert, if you use the same Web-based techniques as everyone else, you will look like everybody else,\u201d Whitney says. \u201cIt is a tough place to start a sales process, so we spend a great deal of time teaching our clients how to differentiate themselves from the competitive herd.\u201d\n\nCo-op for the table\n\nFar from the bright lights of the Strip\u2019s world-famous restaurants, the Vegas Food Co-op is quietly reinventing how locals buy their food.\n\nThe co-op lets people buy free-range chickens, a small portion of grass-fed beef and pasteurized pork raised with no antibiotics or growth hormones. The co-op sells 170 dozen eggs every two weeks and works closely with farmers in Southern Nevada and Utah.\n\n\u201cPeople ask us to track down certain natural animal products, and we try to find it,\u201d Vegas Food Co-op co-director Carolyn Rockwell says.\n\nThe Vegas food co-op\u2019s most intriguing selling point is that anyone can purchase the meat without being a member.\n\nHowever, those who do sign up as members enjoy direct email communication on what food is available for no additional charge. The food is delivered directly to the consumer from the farmer in a public meeting area. The co-op is the top customer for its pork farmer.\n\nThe co-op has expand to 1,200 members because of taste, not word-of-mouth.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t advertise, and the process and the food speak for itself,\u201d Rockwell says. \u201cIt is a resource that is hard to keep quiet because after someone tastes the difference, they want to tell their family and friends.\u201d\n\nA co-op for care\n\nAfter all the fuss and fury surrounding the Affordable Care Act, Nevadans came out of it with the first member-operated health care insurance plan in the state\u2019s history, Nevada Health CO-OP.\n\nThe group received a $65 million loan to establish the co-op, which it calls \u201cuncomplicated care.\u201d\n\nThe co-op includes 552 doctors and has 40,000 members. To increase memberships, the co-op is attending public events, connecting with diverse audience through groups like the Latino Chamber of Commerce and leveraging social gatherings such as local farmers markets.\n\n\u201cWe want to educate our members about our plan before they have to use it,\u201d Nevada Health CO-OP CEO Tom Zumtobel says. \u201cThat is a large departure from our current health care system.\u201d\n\nAnother departure from the standard health care system is the level of customer service provided to members; the health plan acts as client advocate.\n\n\u201cWe are really happy that our members tell us that they can tell we truly care about them,\u201d Zumtobel says. \u201cWe have made mistakes, but we have learned from them and are looking forward to new offerings like telehealth and wellness.\u201d\n\nA co-op for kids\n\nKids cooperative preschool and kindergarten has been established for 30 years, but its curriculum requirements, parent involvement and interaction strategies are as innovative as ever.\n\n\u201cOur foundation is having an appropriate curriculum for child development,\u201d co-op director Bonnie Toft says. \u201cThe parents have to commit to being in the classroom twice a month because we believe they are an integral part of the child\u2019s education because they know them best.\u201d\n\nThe board of directors operating the school is elected annually, eliminating long-term monopolies or hidden agendas. The board also directs community service projects such as litter pickups to build bonds among directors, teachers, students and parents.\n\n\u201cOur teachers keep our vision on track so that our students can learn both emotionally and mentally in this environment,\u201d Toft says. \u201cThey are taught communications, life skills and negotiation tactics to a power themselves to have useful conversations.\u201d\n\nTo continue to improve the co-op, Toft and her colleagues visit three different educational co-ops annually. Toft says that because of the nontraditional work schedule many parents have in Las Vegas, the co-op benefits parent participation.\n\n\u201cWith the school choice movement being more popular than ever, we often wonder why there are not more co-ops across the country,\u201d Toft says. \u201cPeople feel they belong here, and in a transient city like Las Vegas, that stands out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/retail/involving-customers-co-ops-create-collaborative-business-opportunities", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rodric J.
