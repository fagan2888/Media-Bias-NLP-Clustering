You should protect your ears on at-risk work sites because once hearing is damaged, it often cannot be restored.\n\n\u201cOne exposure to a single sound could permanently damage hearing,\u201d Dr. Stefanie Wolf, a clinical audiologist at Audiology of Nassau County, told Medical Daily. \u201cPeople who use drills should definitely be protected and tested by their employer or a contracted company. They should supply them with proper protective gear that can safely and perfectly seal in the acoustics while allowing them to still hear commands.\u201d\n\nWolf, who grew up with her mother working as a clinical audiologist, has seen decades of progression in technology and reports she\u2019s happy to see where it\u2019s moving. However, she said it\u2019s a mistake to think hearing aids are an easy fix for hearing loss and should be treated as a process, not a product.\n\nThere are two different types of hearing loss: One is considered congenital when you are born with hearing loss due to a genetic or developmental problem during pregnancy. The second is gradual hearing loss, which occurs from short-term or prolonged damage, and is avoidable.\n\nApproximately 48 percent of adults in the United States report experiencing some degree of hearing loss, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Noise is measured using decibels (Db) and can evaluate how loud, soft, or damaging something can be to your ears. A noise between 70 to 90 Db can cause slow but increased damage, or one single loud noise, such as a 150-Db gunshot, can cause permanent hearing damage.\n\n\u201cLook at singers. Beyonce, for example. She always has special ear protection on that blocks out the background noise,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThey\u2019re expensive, but they\u2019re worth it because they work.\u201d\n\nThe following jobs cause damage that worsen over time and can send you complaining to your friends, family, and eventually your doctor until you\u2019ve been properly fitted with a hearing aid. Manual labor jobs fare the worst, which should be another reason to make sure if you fall under any of these titles that you receive ear protection from your employer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "8, jobs, cause, hearing, loss, and, how, protect, yourself, damage, starts", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hearing loss can change your social and professional life, emphasizing the importance of protection.", "title": "8 Jobs Likely To Cause Hearing Loss, And How To Protect Yourself", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/8-jobs-cause-hearing-loss-and-how-protect-yourself-damage-starts-300278", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/hearing-loss-can-be-life-changing-protect-yourself-work.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hearing loss can change your social and professional life, emphasizing the importance of protection.", "title": "8 Jobs Likely To Cause Hearing Loss, And How To Protect Yourself", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/8-jobs-cause-hearing-loss-and-how-protect-yourself-damage-starts-300278", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/hearing-loss-can-be-life-changing-protect-yourself-work.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/hearing-loss-can-be-life-changing-protect-yourself-work.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-28T12:12:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T12:12:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hearing loss can change your social and professional life, emphasizing the importance of protection."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf837\"", "article_summary": "There are two different types of hearing loss: One is considered congenital when you are born with hearing loss due to a genetic or developmental problem during pregnancy.\nHearing loss can cause isolation and depression, and certain jobs can put your ears in harm's way more than others.\nA noise between 70 to 90 Db can cause slow but increased damage, or one single loud noise, such as a 150-Db gunshot, can cause permanent hearing damage.\nHowever, she said it\u2019s a mistake to think hearing aids are an easy fix for hearing loss and should be treated as a process, not a product.\nApproximately 48 percent of adults in the United States report experiencing some degree of hearing loss, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association."}
