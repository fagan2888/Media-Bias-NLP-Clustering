Another recent report found increasing reports of ADHD among Hispanics, especially girls.\n\nYet while ADHD is a popular subject for the research community, many teachers and parents still do not understand the condition and all the ways it affects young people at home and in school.\n\nWhat exactly is ADHD? It is a brain-based medical disorder that affects the behavior of people across age, gender, intelligence and socio-economic lines. Kids with ADHD may daydream a lot, talk too much, fidget, frequently forget and lose things, display impulsivity and risk-taking behavior and have trouble making transitions.\n\nI talked with Ned Hallowell, one of the country\u2019s foremost experts, about what parents and teachers need to know \u2014 but too often don\u2019t understand \u2014 about how ADHD affects young people.\n\nHallowell is a child and adult psychiatrist, and was a member of the faculty of the Harvard Medical School from 1983 to 2004 until he began working full-time on his clinical practice, lectures and writing. Here are his insights:\n\n\u201cIn fact, what we call ADD (a terrible term, as it is not a deficit of attention but rather a wandering of attention, and it is not a disorder in my opinion but rather a trait; if you manage it properly it can turn you into a phenomenal success, but if you don\u2019t it can ruin your life, which makes it unique and fascinating) is really a type of mind, genetically transmitted, and composed of a wide array of complex and often contradictory tendencies.\n\n\u201cFor example, the signature symptom, attention, may either occur in abundance or wander off. People with ADD can super-focus when they are really interested, as in playing video games, an instrument, a sport, or studying a subject they love; or they can wander off, when they lose interest, when the book is boring, the teacher is boring, Grandma is boring, or the car ride is too long. This inconsistency of attention can lead to inconsistent performance and underachievement in school (or, for adults, at work).\n\n\u201cToo often, teachers and parents (and bosses) jump to what I call \u201cthe moral diagnosis,\u201d and ascribe the underachievement to lack of effort or laziness, which leads to lectures, punishments, and a gradual infection of the spirit with the viruses of shame and diminished sense of self. In fact, the correct diagnosis is of a brain difference, not a brain deficit, and certainly not a moral failing.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, which people rarely discuss, people with ADD are the people who founded this country. They tend to be visionaries, dreamers, explorers, inventors (Edison was a classic), path-finders, discoverers, entrepreneurs (almost all entrepreneurs have ADD), creative types, original thinkers, paradigm breakers, trend-setters, free thinkers, as well as being big-hearted, trusting, generous, and fun.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "I talked with Ned Hallowell, one of the country\u2019s foremost experts, about what parents and teachers need to know \u2014 but too often don\u2019t understand \u2014 about how ADHD affects young people.\nYet while ADHD is a popular subject for the research community, many teachers and parents still do not understand the condition and all the ways it affects young people at home and in school.\nKids with ADHD may daydream a lot, talk too much, fidget, frequently forget and lose things, display impulsivity and risk-taking behavior and have trouble making transitions.\nIt is a brain-based medical disorder that affects the behavior of people across age, gender, intelligence and socio-economic lines.\nBy Valerie Strauss, The Washington PostThere seems to be a never-ending stream of research reports about attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD \u2014 the most commonly diagnosed neuro-behavioral disorder in U.S. children \u2014 and how it affects young people."}
