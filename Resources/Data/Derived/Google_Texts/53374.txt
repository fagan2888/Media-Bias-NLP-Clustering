Pro tip: Before you do anything else, buy a better coffee grinder, Claire said.

“A lot of people make the mistake of getting one of those spice mills to grind their coffee. With those, you get so many fine particulate pieces of coffee and so many coarse bits that the resulting brew is both under- and over-extracted at the same time,” she said. “The real key is finding an amazing grinder that is consistent, that is even. When you set it, it won’t shift around.”

“If it’s not ground appropriately for your brew method or if it’s not grinding consistently, you can buy the best beans in the world and they would not taste good,” she said. “If you got the water temperature right, if you got your coffee-to-water ratio right on, it still wouldn’t be good, because there would be parts of coffee in there that were under-extracted and parts that were over-extracted. You’d get this strange both cardboardy and tart thing going on at the same time, and that’s not good.”
