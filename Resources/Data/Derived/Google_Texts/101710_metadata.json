The announcement was one in a series of previews of domestic policy proposals he is planning to include in his State of the Union speech later this month.\n\nThe important question to ask is, will the president\u2019s proposal help achieve his goal of returning the nation to global prominence in post-secondary education?\n\nThe Difference Between Obama and Clinton Proposals\n\nGuaranteeing two years of free community college is not a new idea. Former President Bill Clinton proposed the same thing approximately two decades ago. What is different is how the guarantee works. Under Clinton, students\u2019 tuition and fees would have been paid for by a series of tax credits and deductions.\n\nRelated: Why Democrats Are Pushing a $1.2 Trillion Redistribution of Wealth\n\nRather than utilizing the tax code, President Obama\u2019s plan, which he calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s College Promise,\u201d would provide a grant to cover the tuition of an in-state community college, which currently averages $3,800 per year across the nation.\n\nThe president should be congratulated for attempting to tackle the problems of college affordability and access. Both of these have grabbed the attention of the media, parents and students in recent years. The president has talked about the issues before \u2013 this is one of the few bold, concrete ideas of how to address them.\n\nAmerica\u2019s College Promise at face value looks like an important initiative. At the same, there are major problems with what the president has proposed.\n\nBig Ambitions, Few Details\n\nIt is difficult to understand exactly how the program will work, because the White House has yet to release many details.\n\nOne of the things we do know is that the program is potentially very expensive. While the White House estimates the cost at $60 billion over ten years, an estimate by David Leonhardt of The New York Times puts the annual cost at $15 billion.\n\nRelated: Why Elizabeth Warren Trumps Obama's Economic Message\n\nWhatever the amount, the president will have a hard time selling a fiscally conservative Congress on the need for new spending on the government\u2019s student aid programs. And if this is not going to be a new stream of funding, it leads one to question where the money will come from.\n\nWill it come from existing funding for Pell Grants, the primary federal grant program for low- and moderate-income students? Or from the Department of Education\u2019s Federal Direct Loan Program? These are important questions to ask to determine whether America\u2019s College Promise is a wiser use of the money than other options.\n\nThe president\u2019s proposal also requires states to kick in 25 percent of the cost for each student. It is unclear whether the states \u2013 most of which cut spending on higher education during the recession \u2013 will take on this commitment. Another problem with the proposal is that it is open to anyone, no matter what the financial circumstances are of the student or her family.\n\nIs a Universal Benefit the Way to Go?\n\nI understand the appeal of offering a universal benefit like this \u2013 it helps build political support for the program. There are also benefits to publicizing the idea of offering the first two years of community college for free to all students. This can help lessen the \u201csticker shock\u201d that affects many low-income students who want to go to college, but who think that it is too expensive and do not have good information about financial aid.\n\nHowever, offering this benefit to all students may be a largely inefficient use of the money if the president\u2019s ultimate goal is to increase college access and degree attainment.\n\nProviding public subsidy to some students who would enroll in a community college even without the government assistance is unlikely to have much impact on their college-going behavior. The money would be more effectively spent targeting students who truly have financial need, and whose behavior can be influenced through the subsidy.\n\nThe country may, in fact, be better off if the $3,800 grant could be used for students attending 4-year universities, as well as community colleges.\n\nThere is definitive research showing that students who earn bachelor\u2019s degrees receive much larger economic returns, on average, than do those earning associates degrees. And while some community colleges do a good job of preparing students for transfer to 4-year institutions, the research also shows that most students who start their post-secondary career at a community college will never earn a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nIn other words, the country may benefit more if students could use these subsidies at four-year universities, as well as community colleges.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s intentions are good, there are still many unknown pieces of his proposal that still need to be fleshed out. Until they are determined and the concerns raised here are addressed, President Obama\u2019s good intentions may be foiled by a poorly-designed program.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last week, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to guarantee that students coul", "title": "The Trouble with Free Access to Community College", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/13/Trouble-Free-Access-Community-College", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11202013_Graduation_Cap_Money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/13/Trouble-Free-Access-Community-College", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11202013_Graduation_Cap_Money.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Last week, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to guarantee that students coul", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0364\"", "article_summary": "The Difference Between Obama and Clinton ProposalsGuaranteeing two years of free community college is not a new idea.\nThere are also benefits to publicizing the idea of offering the first two years of community college for free to all students.\nLast week, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to guarantee that students could attend a community college for free for their first two years.\nThe important question to ask is, will the president\u2019s proposal help achieve his goal of returning the nation to global prominence in post-secondary education?\nProviding public subsidy to some students who would enroll in a community college even without the government assistance is unlikely to have much impact on their college-going behavior."}
