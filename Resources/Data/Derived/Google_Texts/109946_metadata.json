EPA\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan (CPP) is illegitimate, an affront to both federalism and the separation of powers,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe letter \u2014 signed by Heritage Action, and the -backed Americans for Prosperity and American Commitment \u2014 doesn\u2019t mince words, arguing the EPA can\u2019t control \u201cits appetite for power\u201d and that the proposal can\u2019t be implemented in any \u201cfeasible or responsible\u201d way.\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to bargain with EPA, leaders like you should send a clear message to the federal government that if it insists on pursuing the regulatory equivalent of punitive energy taxes, it must promulgate and implement that policy itself \u2014 and be held solely accountable for the disastrous consequences that will follow,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe groups go on to claim that the EPA proposal is \u201calmost certain to be overturned\u201d by a federal court.\n\nThey also predict that the new GOP majority next year will \u201cundoubtedly\u201d vote to block the rule, and the 2016 presidential election could end \u201cEPA\u2019s war on coal\u201d \u2014 the phrase critics coined to allege the carbon rule and other White House policies create costly burdens that will kill jobs and raise power costs.\n\n\u201cYou will never regret saying no and forcing the federal government to implement its own destructive agenda,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe conservative organizations assert that EPA\u2019s carbon pollution rule is not very different from the administration\u2019s healthcare law, claiming states that chose to implement the law \u201clearned the hard way\u201d as federal officials \u201cmicromanaged\u201d everything.\n\n\u201cResistance to these regulations is not futile!\u201d the groups add.\n\nThe EPA has said it has yet to craft a plan for states that decide to not implement the rules, instead focusing on aiding states that have questions and are cooperating with the agency.\n\nDespite severe pushback from the GOP, and the coal industry, the EPA says it in on solid legal footing when it comes to the rule.\n\nThe public comment period for the rule, which mandates the nation\u2019s fleet of existing power plants cut carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, closed on Monday.\n\nThe EPA says it still expects to finalize the regulation by summer of next year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"EPA\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan (CPP) is illegitimate,\" the groups charge.", "description": "\"EPA\u2019s so-called Clean
