Exposure to ultraviolet tanning devices before age 30 increases the risk of skin cancer by 75 percent, and nationally, the tanning industry aggressively targets minors in advertising.\n\nThe researchers said that despite what they called clear evidence of cancer risk, \u201cindoor tanning remains popular in the United States.\u201d\n\nNationwide, more than 3.5 million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed each year, according to the study.\n\nThe survey was conducted in May, 2013. A female medical student who identified herself as a 17-year-old called a random sample of salons in California that advertised on Yellowpages.com, the majority of which were clustered in metropolitan areas. She told respondents that she wanted a base tan before summer, asked how frequently she could tan, whether there were any dangers, and if tanning was good for her.\n\nOf the tanning salons she called, 77 percent \u2014 260 out of 338 \u2014 told the female caller that she could not use their tanning beds.\n\nBut some said she could use their tanning beds with a doctor\u2019s note, and some told her she could use their facilities with parental consent. In addition, researchers said out of the 338 salons, 61 percent \u201cmade unlawful claims of specific health benefits,\u201d including vitamin D production, skin disease treatment, prevention of future sunburns, and remedies for depression.\n\n\u201cThat was extremely troubling, because we have overwhelming evidence that tanning, especially at an early age, causes cancer, and it\u2019s killing people,\u201d Resneck said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young and invincible and there\u2019s people telling you tanning is safe, that information is going to be much more believable, even if it\u2019s not backed up by facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common misconception that tanning helps your health, and is better or the same as the sun,\u201d Resneck added. \u201cSo we thought this was critical to look at, knowing that the tanning industry is marketing to teenagers, and knowing that early tanning exposure causes cancer.\u201d\n\nResearchers attributed the misinformation to salons workers not being familiar with the law \u2014 or with lack of law enforcement.\n\nResneck said despite lack of education and enforcement, that the study\u2019s results were a big leap forward in an industry that doesn\u2019t have a lot of good data and that hasn\u2019t accurately tracked enforcement of laws that prevent or restrict tanning among minors.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers were the first to pass an outright ban on minors using indoor ultraviolet tanning salons in 2011. Since, California passed its ban on minors using indoor tanning beds, eight other states have passed similar laws. Statewide, salons that violate the law are required to pay a civil violation fine of $2,500 a day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California was the first state to ban people under 18-years-old from using tanning salons, and now new research takes a look at how well the law is working.
