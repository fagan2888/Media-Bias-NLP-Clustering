A man trying to break in to an acquaintance's home actually was trying to kick in the wrong door, police said.

Police arrested and charged 20-year-old Bryan Banks with attempted burglary in Manassas, Virginia, Sunday night.

Banks attempted to kick down an apartment door at the11900 block of Coverstone Hill Circle to confront someone about an ongoing dispute, police said.

The person Banks sought did not live at that apartment, and the residents did not know the suspect.

One resident called police, and Banks fled the scene. Police later found and arrested him at his home in the 7600 block of Northington Circle in Gainesville.

He is currently being held without bond. His court date is July 10.
