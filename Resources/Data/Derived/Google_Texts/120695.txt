Regarding the Aug. 7 front-page article “Parents feel need to scale back jobs”:

Child care, especially infant care, should be expensive — very expensive. Nothing about it should be affordable. You are paying someone to do your most important job as a parent — raise your child. Whether you choose to go back to work or stay at home, sacrifices are significant.

How about some financial help with retirement savings? As a stay-at-home mom, I can no longer contribute to a 401(k). Sure, I can set money aside, but how about a nice pre-tax savings program so I am not penalized for staying at home and forgoing my ability to save for retirement as do my working counterparts?
