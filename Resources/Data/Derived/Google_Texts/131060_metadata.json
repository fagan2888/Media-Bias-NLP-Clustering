In the bottom of the inning, Tulo made a leaping catch on a line drive by Kyle Seager, robbing him of a hit.\n\n\u201cIt is encouraging, to see him go up and get that ball on defense, especially,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cIt was good to see. We knew he could hit, but to see him move around like that on defense was encouraging.\u201d\n\nThree of the Rockies\u2019 top prospects combined to score three runs in the top of the ninth to beat the Mariners 4-1. Ryan Casteel hit a run-scoring double to chase home Mike Tauchman; Will Swanner hit a single to score Casteel; and Kyle Parker blasted a double to score Swanner.\n\nIt was just a half day\u2019s work for Tulowitzki, who walked in his second at-bat, but it was a satisfying afternoon. (See video below).\n\nOutfielder Charlie Blackmon, slowed by an abdominal strain, made his Cactus League debut. He went 0-for-2 with a strikeout.\n\n\u201cIt was good to be back out there with my teammates,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cI was also happy that I wasn\u2019t too tentative out there.\u201d\n\nBlackmon\u2019s diagnosis of his ailment was short and sweet.\n\n\u201cThere is something in my ab that kind of hurts a little bit when I swing, but now it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cSo you might want to stick with just ab strain.\u201d\n\n\n\nHits\n\nRotation candidate David Hale was excellent again, pitching two scoreless innings, allowing one hit and striking out three.\n\nReliever Adam Ottavino ran into trouble in the eighth when Stefan Romero scored a leadoff triple, but Ottavino used his fastball and slider to escape trouble. He has not been scored upon this spring.\n\nMisses\n\nStarter Christian Bergman gave up a run on four hits and a walk in his 2 2/3 innings. The right-hander, likely slated to begin the season at Triple-A, was able to minimize the damage.\n\nColorado\u2019s offense was very quiet early, with Tulo\u2019s homer and a single by catcher Wilin Rosario their only hits through eight innings.\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Rockies travel to Maryville to play the Brewers. Right-hander Gus Schlosser, acquired in a trade with Atlanta, starts for the Rockies. Right-hander Wily Peralta starts for Milwaukee.\n\nOther Rockies scheduled to pitch are: RHP Brett Marshall, RHP Jose Ortega, LHP Rex Brothers, RHP Justin Miller and RHP Brooks Brown.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charlie Blackmon,Christian Bergman,David Hale,Troy Tulowitzki,Wilin Rosario", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "In just his second Cactus League game, Rockies all-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki ripped a solo homer off right-center off right-hander Erasmo Ramierz.", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki homers for Rockies; Blackmon make first start", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/11/troy-tulowitzki-homers-rockies-blackmon-make-first-start/19516/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/03/464669276-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In just his second Cactus League game, Rockies all-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki ripped a solo homer off right-center off right-hander Erasmo Ramierz.", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki homers for Rockies; Charlie Blackmon makes first start", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/11/troy-tulowitzki-homers-rockies-blackmon-make-first-start/19516/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/03/464669276-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In just his second Cactus League game, Rockies all-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki ripped a solo homer off right-center off right-hander Erasmo Ramierz."}, "article_summary": "Other Rockies scheduled to pitch are: RHP Brett Marshall, RHP Jose Ortega, LHP Rex Brothers, RHP Justin Miller and RHP Brooks Brown.\nIt was just a half day\u2019s work for Tulowitzki, who walked in his second at-bat, but it was a satisfying afternoon.\nIn just his second Cactus League game, the Rockies all-star shortstop ripped a solo homer to right-center off right-hander Erasmo Ramierz in the first inning.\nRight-hander Gus Schlosser, acquired in a trade with Atlanta, starts for the Rockies.\n\u201cIt is encouraging, to see him go up and get that ball on defense, especially,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said."}
