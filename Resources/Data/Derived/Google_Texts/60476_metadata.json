Age didn\u2019t slow her down.\n\n\u201cI think you mustn\u2019t tell your body, you mustn\u2019t tell your soul, \u2018I\u2019m going to retire,'\u201d Dee told The Associated Press in 2001. \u201cYou may be changing your life emphasis, but there\u2019s still things that you have in mind to do that now seems the right time to do. I really don\u2019t believe in retiring as long as you can breathe.\u201d\n\nSince meeting on Broadway in 1946, she and her late husband were frequent collaborators. Their partnership rivaled the achievements of other celebrated performing couples, such as Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy.\n\nBut they were more than a performing couple. They were also activists who fought for civil rights, particularly for blacks.\n\n\u201cWe used the arts as part of our struggle,\u201d she said at an appearance in Jackson, Miss., in 2006. \u201cOssie said he knew he had to conduct himself differently with skill and thought.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, the pair celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary and an even longer association in show business with the publication of a dual autobiography, \u201cWith Ossie and Ruby: In This Life Together.\u201d\n\nDavis died in February 2005. At his funeral, his widow sat near his coffin as former President Clinton led an array of famous mourners, including Harry Belafonte and Spike Lee.\n\nDavis and Dee met in 1945 when she auditioned for the Broadway play \u201cJeb,\u201d starring Davis (both were cast in it). In December 1948, on a day off from rehearsals from another play, \u201cThe Smile of the World,\u201d Davis and Dee took a bus to New Jersey to get married. They already were so close that \u201cit felt almost like an appointment we finally got around to keeping,\u201d Dee wrote in \u201cIn This Life Together.\u201d\n\nThey shared billing in 11 stage productions and five movies during long parallel careers. Dee\u2019s fifth film, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d with Sidney Poitier in 1950, was her husband\u2019s first. Along with film, stage and television, their richly honored careers extended to a radio show, \u201cThe Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee Story Hour,\u201d that featutred a mix of black themes. Davis directed one of their joint film appearances, \u201cCountdown at Kusini\u201d (1976).\n\nLike her husband, Dee was active in civil rights issues and efforts to promote the cause of blacks in the entertainment industry. As young performers, they found themselves caught up the growing debate over social and racial justice in the United States. The couple\u2019s push for social justice was lifelong: In 1999, the couple was arrested while protesting the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, by New York City police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daughter: Actress Ruby Dee dead at 91", "title": "Daughter: Actress Ruby Dee dead at 91", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Daughter: Actress Ruby Dee dead at 91", "title": "Daughter: Actress Ruby Dee dead at 91", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/daughter_actress_ruby_dee_dead_at_91/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/obit-ruby-dee.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Daughter: Actress Ruby Dee dead at 91", "title": "Daughter: Actress Ruby Dee dead at 91", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/obit-ruby-dee.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karen Matthews and Mark Kennedy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4c8\"", "article_summary": "Along with film, stage and television, their richly honored careers extended to a radio show, \u201cThe Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee Story Hour,\u201d that featutred a mix of black themes.\nDavis and Dee met in 1945 when she auditioned for the Broadway play \u201cJeb,\u201d starring Davis (both were cast in it).\n\u201cI think you mustn\u2019t tell your body, you mustn\u2019t tell your soul, \u2018I\u2019m going to retire,'\u201d Dee told The Associated Press in 2001.\nLike her husband, Dee was active in civil rights issues and efforts to promote the cause of blacks in the entertainment industry.\nAs young performers, they found themselves caught up the growing debate over social and racial justice in the United States."}
