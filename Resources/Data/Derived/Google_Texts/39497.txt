The same number said they do not admire the president.According to the poll, 53 percent of the country does not think that Obama is "a strong and decisive leader," while 56 percent declared that he does not "inspire confidence."These are the worst numbers for the president in CNN polls since he took office."It's clear that views of Obama as a person, once his strong suit, have taken a hit in October and throughout 2013," said Holland.But there was some good news for the president. Seven out of 10 respondents described him as a likable person, while six out of 10 believe he has a vision of where the country is headed.Still, his job approval rating continues to take a hit survey after survey.
