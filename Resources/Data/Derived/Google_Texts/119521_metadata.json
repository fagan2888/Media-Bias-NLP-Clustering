The second occurred at the end of the turbulent 1970\u2019s, when a bureaucratic glitch prevented the federal government from paying $122 million in Treasury bills, costing taxpayers billions.\n\nBond markets panicked at the \u201cdelay\u201d in payments, which investors unambiguously labeled a \u201cdefault.\u201d There were two additional debatable defaults involving late 18th century war debts and the transition from the gold standard in 1933.\n\nThe financial disaster predicted by economic analysts for the coming weeks could dwarf the prior default episodes \u2014 and the near-default shock of 2011, after which the U.S. credit rating was downgraded and the market tanked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even if America puts a band-aid on the budget this week, bigger battles loom large for policymakers", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/15/deal-or-no-deal-usdebtproblemslinger.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/15/deal-or-no-deal-usdebtproblemslinger/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.congress_100113.1381889158769.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Even if America puts a band-aid on the budget this week, bigger battles loom large for policymakers", "title": "Deal or no deal, US debt problems linger"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/15/deal-or-no-deal-usdebtproblemslinger/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.congress_100113.1381889158769.jpg", "description": "Even if America puts a band-aid on the budget this week, bigger battles loom large for policymakers", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Deal or no deal, US debt problems linger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Debt Ceiling, Shutdown, John Boehner, Republican Party, Barack Obama, Congress, Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d5b\"", "article_summary": "Contrary to statements by politicians and financial leaders, the Treasury has indeed failed to meet its obligations before.\nThe agreed-upon bipartisan deal could extend the Treasury's borrowing authority until February, thereby setting a new cap above $17 trillion.\nAl Jazeera looks at some of the questions at the heart of ongoing fiscal uncertainty:Has the U.S. ever defaulted on its debt?\nIn 1814 and 1979, there were two relatively contained examples of U.S. default on sovereign debt.\nThe first was during the War of 1812, when the capital was on fire and U.S. troops were fighting unpaid."}
