His spree ended when he was shot dead by police.\n\n\u201cI remember him as a very gentle soul\u201d whose life was ruined by drugs, Christensen said, adding that his brother did awful things.\n\nMore needs to be done to address mental health, substance abuse and other behavioral issues to deal with crime, he said.\n\nJack Truman, who is running against Christensen in the Democratic primary Aug. 2, was invited but did not attend the Democratic club\u2019s weekly luncheon. Hartzler has her own primary opponent, John Webb.\n\nThe primary winners face off in the general election Nov. 8.\n\nA physician and scientist, Christensen also was a whistleblower in the 1990s at Truman Memorial Veterans\u2019 Hospital, helping to expose a series of suspicious patient deaths linked to a single nurse.\n\nDuring his hourlong appearance, Christensen attacked Hartzler\u2019s voting record, including her support of repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and her vote to reduce food stamp benefits.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really just a terrible thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of poverty in the Fourth District.\u201d\n\nChristensen also talked about reforming the use of \u201cdark money\u201d whose donors could not be traced and limitless contributions in campaigns.\n\nTrump, he said, has changed views on several issues over the years, including universal health care and abortion, two things the Republican establishment, including Hartzler, are staunchly against. Trump\u2019s idea to build a wall at the Mexican border and force Mexico to pay for it, as well his idea to deport millions of immigrant here illegally, are mistakes, Christensen said.\n\n\u201cThe forced, armed deportation of 11 million residents of the United States is a horrific proposal,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Stevenson declined to comment on Christensen\u2019s views on Trump and Hartzler, he said he liked the candidate\u2019s comments about crime.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5;
