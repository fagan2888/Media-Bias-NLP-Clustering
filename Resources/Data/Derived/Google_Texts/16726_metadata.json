Ted Strickland told fellow Democrats in Athens County Saturday night that they are living through an unprecedented and challenging time in American politics.\n\nStrickland was full of fire for these Democrats in the foothills of Appalachia during their annual spring party dinner at the the local American Legion Hall. He called on party members to stand up for what they believe in and to stand against an extremist Republican Party.\n\n\u201cWe have a Republican Party that in my judgment has been taken over by such extreme thinkers they don\u2019t believe in compromise,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cThey are slash and burn in their attitudes. If they can\u2019t have their way, they want this government to go down.\u201d\n\nStrickland\u2019s been taking a strong populist, progressive tone in the early days of his 2016 campaign for U.S. Senate. He faces a Democratic Primary challenge from Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld. The winner of the primary will go on to face U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, who was first elected in the Republican wave of 2010.\n\n\u201cWe are facing challenges, I think, in America today that are very, very unusual,\u201d Strickland said Saturday.\n\nHe pointed to the 16-day government shutdown of October 2013 and various threats of the same both before and since, and what Strickland called \u201cincredible intransigence\u201d toward President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cFrom the time he was elected until the present moment, many of the leaders of the Republican Party have been determined above all else to see that he cannot succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the good news is, in spite of their efforts, he and we as a party have seen success.\u201d\n\nHe cited the Affordable Care Act bringing health insurance to millions of people who previously did not have it or could not obtain it because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nStrickland has roots in Athens, having represented the area in the U.S. Congress for years before going on to be elected governor in 2006. For the past several years, he\u2019s been at the Center for American Progress.\n\nDressed in a blue blazer, grey slacks and a white button-down, Strickland arrived Saturday with his longtime friend and former chief of staff John Haseley, who now lives again in Athens County. Strickland was relaxed, confident, and charming, waiting around after the event to greet friends old and new, and pose for photographs.\n\nDuring his keynote address, Strickland talked about the importance of protecting what he called \u201cour most precious right,\u201d the right to vote.\n\nHe said he\u2019s proud of his vote against the war in Iraq, which, he maintained, led directly to the tumultuous current situation in that region of the world with the extremist group widely known as ISIS (whom I prefer to call \u201cDaesh,\u201d because it\u2019s as insulting to them as they are to human decency).\n\n\u201cIt was a tragic decision that still has this country bogged down,\u201d Strickland said, slamming the George W. Bush administration and others who called for the war. He said he is not a pacifist but that \u201cwe cannot maintain a constant state of war against the rest of world.\u201d\n\nStrickland also criticized the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling and the doorway it opened to massive campaign donations by corporate interests, pointing specifically to major Republican Party donors David and Charles Koch.\n\n\u201cWe are in danger of having our country bought and sold,\u201d Strickland said.\n\nHe said that Democrats need to stand up for what they believe in, including equal pay for equal work, equal marriage rights, a fair minimum wage that provides a livable income, and a strong and diplomatic foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a progressive Democrat,\u201d Strickland declared, \u201cand I\u2019m getting more progressive by the day.\u201d\n\nAlso that night, state Sen. Lou Gentile, D-Steubenville, of Ohio\u2019s 30th Senate District, recalled his grandfather\u2019s emigration from Italy in search of the American dream. He called Strickland his political mentor.\n\n\u201cGov. Strickland is running for U.S. Senate to give the people of this state the same opportunities that my grandfather sought for his family: The American dream \u2013 the ability to work hard, to play by the rules, to get ahead and provide for your family,\u201d Gentile said. \u201cHis candidacy is so important to our state and our region. Ted Strickland is the embodiment of a child of Appalachia.\u201d\n\nAnd state Rep. Debbie Phillips, D-Albany, of Ohio\u2019s 94th House district, talked about the challenges she\u2019s seen at the Ohio Statehouse as they\u2019ve struggled to shape Ohio\u2019s next budget.\n\n\u201cI believe budgets are moral documents. They show what our priorities are. They show what our values are,\u201d she said. The budget proposed by Gov. Kasich, she said, will hurt people. \u201cWhat we were given by Gov. Kasich to work with is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nRetired Athens County Common Pleas Judge L. Alan Goldsberry, a longtime party member, also spoke about his concerns over the changes he\u2019s seen in the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cI believe our opponents are more vicious and less responsible than I have seen them,\u201d he said. He called on Democrats to circle the wagons and \u201cchallenge idiocy.\u201d He said they need to learn to be fearless but fair, and to focus on recruitment efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have to do our part. We have to start here. We have to be a tight-knit group that cares about each other and cares about our country,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the end of the evening, I waited around for Gov. Strickland as he politely greeted dozens of Athenians. When I got the opportunity, I reintroduced myself, as it has been several years since I last had the opportunity to speak with him in person.\n\n\u201cPlunderbund!\u201d he exclaimed as I mentioned my affiliation with this great and noble website, and he told me all about his work with the CAP\u2019s ThinkProgress blog, an essential daily stop on the information superhighway for yrs. truly.\n\nThe former governor seemed to me as strong as ever, and as ready as ever for the good fight that lies ahead. I\u2019m happy to see him back on the trail throwing some punches.\n\nDavid DeWitt is a writer and man of sport and leisure based out of Athens, Ohio.
