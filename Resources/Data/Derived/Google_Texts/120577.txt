If you are a last-minute shopper, you're not alone. According to a survey by SOASTA, about half of Americans are late shoppers. About one in four Americans haven't finished getting their gifts by December 23 or 24.

The general manager for the Chapel Hills Mall, Victoria Harley, said her advice to people shopping Christmas Eve is to get there early and to check out their website before heading out the door.

“One thing they can do is go to our website, chapelhillsmall.com, click on deals and maybe they’ll find see a special that’s going on at the stores that interest them,” said Harley.

Harley says December has been busy at Chapel Hills. They expect large crowds for Christmas Eve.

11 News talked with some last-minute shoppers Tuesday.

Cheryl Walton said, “Last-minute shopping…this is the first year I haven’t had it done in October!”

Another shopper, Jody Torres, said, “We did have some success, we took a picture with Santa so we are having fun...This is early for me. I usually start Christmas Eve.”
