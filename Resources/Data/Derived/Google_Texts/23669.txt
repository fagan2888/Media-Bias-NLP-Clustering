For the ninth straight year, October is Dining Month on OnMilwaukee, presented by the restaurants of Potawatomi Hotel & Casino. All month, we're stuffed with restaurant reviews, dining guides, delectable features, chef profiles and unique articles on everything food, as well as voting for your "Best of Dining 2015."

Three-time defending champion Blue's Egg got knocked off its perch last year in the best breakfast/brunch combined category as Benji's managed to snatch first place. That was last year, however, and Blue's Egg fans came back with a vengeance, handing the title of best breakfast back over to the bustling breakfast place â€“ and with over 100 votes to spare between it and second place.

Perhaps last year Blue's Egg became a victim of its own success, with long waits for seating pushing some away. But it seems the love for Blue's Egg's scrumptious breakfast meats, platters, omelettes and more came back to life in 2015, resulting in an overwhelming win over its other competitors.

And speaking of those other competitors, Dave Begel favorite Cafe at the Plaza finished comfortably in second place, Mad Rooster another 100 votes behind, and Engine Company No. 3 and Original Pancake House rounding out the voters' top picks.

Runners up:

2. Cafe at the Plaza

3. Mad Rooster

4. Engine Company No. 3

5. Original Pancake House
