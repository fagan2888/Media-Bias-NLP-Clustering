Some call it a provider tax, and it\u2019s one of the ideas being considered by state GOP lawmakers.\n\nIf Utah lawmakers can agree on a plan to expand Medicaid, the federal government would pay for 90 percent of the costs. But it\u2019s the remaining 10 percent that the Republican leaders drafting that plan are concerned about. Among the proposals is to increase the licensing fees for physicians. Sean Mulvihill is CEO of the University of Utah Medical Group.\n\n\u201cI personally feel that it\u2019s bad public policy to create a provider tax on individuals to support something that is a societal good or a state good,\u201d Mulvihill says.\n\nThe Utah Medical Association is opposed to the idea, says CEO Michelle McOmber.\n\n\u201cIf this is a community benefit, which we do believe it is a community benefit - it increases the health of the citizens of Utah - then we ought to find a solution that involves the whole community when it comes to paying for it,\u201d McOmber says.\n\nSpeaking to KUER on a legislative bus tour in Southern Utah, House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan says he\u2019s heard from many doctors in the last few days.\n\n\u201cSome of the comment I\u2019ve heard from doctors is, why are you picking on just us? Well, we\u2019re not. There\u2019s plenty of shared pain to go around,\u201d Dunnigan says.\n\nHe says there are 16 different classes of healthcare providers who would be asked to pay, including hospitals, surgical centers, ambulances, therapists, and pharmacies. Altogether, Dunnigan says he and his colleagues in the Gang of 6 would like to see healthcare providers cover about two-thirds of the expansion costs. They\u2019re still working on the proposal, but he expects the issue will be decided in a possible special legislative session this year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Utah doctors are objecting to the idea that they should help pay for the cost of expanding Medicaid to low-income citizens.
