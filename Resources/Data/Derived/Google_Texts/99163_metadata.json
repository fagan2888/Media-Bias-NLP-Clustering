Gregg announced his resignation effective immediately from the Governor\u2019s office, and will seek the nomination at the Republican State Convention on June 14th. Gregg will then challenge Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who was first elected to the office in 1978.\n\nGregg is a native of Hawarden, Iowa, where his family still resides. He attended Central College in Pella, Iowa, where he played football and graduated at the top of his class. Gregg then attended Drake Law School in Des Moines on an academic scholarship, and graduated with high honors. Upon graduation, he joined Brown Winick, a prestigious Iowa law firm.\n\nWhile at the law firm, Gregg maintained a general practice of law, including business matters such as litigation, contracts, and forming new companies. In 2012, Gregg joined the senior staff of the Governor\u2019s office, where he handled legislative liaison duties, and helped secure passage of the largest tax cut in Iowa\u2019s history, historic education reform, and a state based, Iowa alternative to Obamacare.\n\nGregg said, \u201cI am running for Attorney General for a very simple reason. I\u2019ve got the passion and the energy to fight everyday for Iowa families, Iowa farmers, and our constitutional freedoms. As Iowa\u2019s Attorney General, I\u2019ll be an advocate for open government and I\u2019ll hold Washington, DC accountable when the federal government oversteps its bounds. It\u2019s time Iowa has an Attorney General that represents the people of Iowa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the interests of Iowa farmers, businesses and individuals are challenged, it is the duty of the Attorney General to stand up for them,\u201d Gregg added. \u201cAs Iowa\u2019s Attorney General, I won\u2019t be interested in chasing headlines. I\u2019ll be interested in enforcing the laws and protecting Iowans in every court in which our interests are threatened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd158d\"", "article_summary": "DES MOINES\u2014Johnston attorney Adam Gregg today announced his candidacy for Attorney General for the State of Iowa.\nGregg will then challenge Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who was first elected to the office in 1978.\nIt\u2019s time Iowa has an Attorney General that represents the people of Iowa.\u201d\u201cWhen the interests of Iowa farmers, businesses and individuals are challenged, it is the duty of the Attorney General to stand up for them,\u201d Gregg added.\nAs Iowa\u2019s Attorney General, I\u2019ll be an advocate for open government and I\u2019ll hold Washington, DC accountable when the federal government oversteps its bounds.\n\u201cAs Iowa\u2019s Attorney General, I won\u2019t be interested in chasing headlines."}
