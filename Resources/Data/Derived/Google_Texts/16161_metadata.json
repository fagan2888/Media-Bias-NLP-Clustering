She said the cost of stocking restrooms at a school or business with sanitary supplies works out to $4.67 per girl per year. \"Menstruation is a normal bodily function, and it should be treated like that.\"\n\nIn other words, if your local restaurant or store operates a public restroom for free, with free toilet paper, it somehow is obligated to also provide other free stuff.\n\nThe \"logic\" is that men don't use tampons; therefore, it is sexist for businesses and taxpayers not to give them to women for \"free.\"\n\nSeriously?\n\nIf someone gives you free toilet paper, that does not mean he or she owes you free tampons.\n\nLikewise, if someone buys you a soda, he or she does not therefore owe you a bag of chips.\n\nThis is true without regard to whether men eat chips.\n\nWhether we are ladies or we are gentlemen, let's be adults. We buy our own stuff and we buy the stuff our children need. If someone gives us something for free, we say, \"thank you\" -- not \"gimme more or you're sexist.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/resource/Tampax_Tampon_Box.jpeg?fileId=26910839", "description": "This is truly the age of grievances.\n\n Case in point is the new political cause arguing that tampo...", "title": "Activists Demand Free Tampons Because Men Don't Menstruate\u00a0(Seriously!) - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "If someone gives you free toilet paper, that does not mean he or she owes you free tampons.\nIn other words, if your local restaurant or store operates a public restroom for free, with free toilet paper, it somehow is obligated to also provide other free stuff.\nCase in point is the new political cause arguing that tampons should be distributed for free in public restrooms, simply because public restrooms almost never charge for toilet paper .\nThe \"logic\" is that men don't use tampons; therefore, it is sexist for businesses and taxpayers not to give them to women for \"free.\"\nIf someone gives us something for free, we say, \"thank you\" -- not \"gimme more or you're sexist.\""}
