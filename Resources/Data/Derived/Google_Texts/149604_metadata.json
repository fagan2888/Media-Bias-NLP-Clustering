The latest crack is a nice try, but it\u2019s not going to end the lawsuits over the contraception mandate. Some of the religious employers don\u2019t like the new fix any more than they liked the old one.\n\nEmily Bazelon Emily Bazelon is a staff writer at the New York Times Magazine and the author of Sticks and Stones.\n\nIn the initial fight over the contraception mandate, the religious groups that are currently suing\u2014nonprofits that include universities and charities\u2014got what they call a \u201cpartial\u201d accommodation. Instead of providing birth control to their employees directly via their insurance plans, these groups could file a two-page form (Form 700, it\u2019s called) in which they certified that they were religious nonprofit organizations that oppose providing some or all of the birth control services required by the Affordable Care Act , as part of comprehensive health care for women. The groups quickly argued that this partial accommodation was no accommodation at all, from their point of view. They argued that the act of signing Form 700 and sending it in implicated them in providing the contraception, by setting in motion the process through which the \u201cthird-party administrators\u201d (TPAs, for short\u2014sorry, but you are going to need that jargon below) of their health insurance plans would then offer women the birth control.\n\nMaybe you think that taking a few minutes to sign a form is hardly a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion\u2014the legal showing the groups have to make to win in court. But they looked around and noticed that houses of worship (churches, mosques, synagogues) got a simpler, and in their view better, accommodation: They got out of paying for birth control without having to do anything\u2014no form to fill out, nothing. Also, no contraception for their employees. Full stop. It\u2019s becoming more and more clear that the schools and charities want nothing less than the same deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs lawsuits challenging Form 700 sprung up around the country, some judges said that making a group turn in the form violated its religious freedom, and other judges said that it did not. Last January, in a preliminary order, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the Little Sisters of the Poor, which provides housing to elderly people in need, didn\u2019t have to fill out Form 700 or notify its TPA that it wasn\u2019t paying for the birth control. Instead, Sotomayor said, Little Sisters could \u201cinform the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that they are non-profit organizations that hold themselves out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d In other words, Little Sisters could substitute a letter for the form, and they only had to send it to the government rather than contact the TPAs.\n\nThe religious employers don\u2019t like the new fix anymore than they liked the old one.\n\nThis letter-writing idea led the Obama administration, last Friday, to its latest try at stopping the contraception lawsuits, while still providing birth control via employer insurance plans: Any group that doesn\u2019t want to send in Form 700 can tell HHS that it has a religious objection to offering contraceptive coverage. It also has to send in the name of its TPA. But it doesn\u2019t have to contact the TPA itself. That will be the government\u2019s job. The government will also pay back the TPAs. Oh, and the government is also offering this arrangement to \u201cprivately held\u201d corporations like Hobby Lobby, though it hasn\u2019t figured out exactly how to define that magical phrase from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, so it\u2019s asking for feedback on that point.\n\nHere\u2019s why this new rule isn\u2019t going to end the lawsuits anytime soon: Little Sisters and the others don\u2019t want a new mechanism for alerting the government so a TPA can provide birth control. \u201cThe government has never offered a reason why it needed to coerce the Little Sisters and others to be a part of its contraceptive delivery system, nor any reason why it chose to treat the Little Sisters as less deserving of religious liberty than houses of worship,\u201d Daniel Blomberg, a lawyer for the Becket Fund, which represents Little Sisters, emailed me. \u201cIt is disappointing that the government continues to treat religious ministries as not religious enough to deserve the same exemption it gives houses of worship.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the groups say that being asked to play any role at all in this handoff substantially burdens their religious rights by making them complicit. Georgetown law professor Marty Lederman, who has written many words about these suits, put it this way when I called him: \u201cThe new rule takes care of all the arguments the religious groups are making except one: \u2018We\u2019re still complicit because we\u2019re like Yenta\u2014we matched up Aetna with these particular employees.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis brings us to the real crux of the issue, which Hobby Lobby and all the other litigation has so far obscured: The government wants the employees at the heart of these cases to get the contraception coverage everyone else\u2019s employees get, through their employment. The religious employers do not.\n\nIn its Hobby Lobby ruling in June, the Supreme Court seemed to suggest that the government\u2019s goal was a perfectly acceptable one\u2014easily reached, with a little rewriting of the rules. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito appeared to see Form 700 as a good compromise. TPAs could arrange for contraceptive coverage, Alito said, \u201cwithout imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible organization.\u201d This was all very soothing. Alito went so far as to make the government\u2019s stance, in insisting that Hobby Lobby cover birth control for its employees directly, seem a little silly. If the officials at HHS who came up with Form 700 had figured out an accommodation for the religious nonprofit groups, why not offer to extend it to private companies like Hobby Lobby?\n\nBut there was a catch. \u201cWe do not decide today whether an approach of this type complies with RFRA\u201d\u2014the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the 1990s law that\u2019s the basis for all of these religion-based challenges to paying for birth control\u2014\u201cfor purposes of all religious claims,\u201d Alito wrote. A week later, the court walked through this conveniently open door. Wheaton College, which is Christian, didn\u2019t want to sign Form 700, and in another interim but telling order, the court said it didn\u2019t have to. No wonder all the other religious groups and \u201cprivately held\u201d companies want the same deal.\n\nIn the Wheaton College case, Sotomayor (plus Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) raised hell. In an unusual act of all-female solidarity, the three justices said the court\u2019s order siding with Wheaton \u201cundermines confidence in this institution\u201d because it contradicts the promise the majority made in Hobby Lobby. To me, it looks like some justices thought they\u2019d reached a nice compromise for the religious objectors in Hobby Lobby, only to find that others weren\u2019t along for the ride.\n\nHere\u2019s the question behind the divide on the court: If the government doesn\u2019t know which groups aren\u2019t paying for birth control, because they don\u2019t fill out a form or send in a letter, how can it make sure the employees get their contraception coverage? It can\u2019t. What it could do instead, as the Becket Fund\u2019s Blomberg pointed out to me, is provide contraceptives itself. If you\u2019re inclined, you can insert an ode here to the beauties of a single-payer, government-run health care system. If Obamacare wasn\u2019t built atop employer-based health insurance, we wouldn\u2019t be having this fight. (Though I somehow doubt the groups suing over the mandate and accommodations would have supported single-payer.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The president\u2019s latest accommodation to the contraception mandate has one problem: Religious employers won\u2019t go for it.", "fb-share": "Nice Try, but Obama\u2019s Latest Attempt at a Contraception Mandate Accommodation Won\u2019t Work", "sailthru.author": "Emily Bazelon", "description": "I would like to be snoozing my way though the legal news in this last week of August, but the Obama administration has woken me up with a new effort to ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "I would like to be snoozing my way though the legal news in this last week of August, but the Obama administration has woken me up with a new effort to ...", "title": "Nice Try, but Obama\u2019s Latest Attempt at a Contraception Mandate Accommodation Won\u2019t Work", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/obama_s_new_contraception_mandate_accommodation_religious_employers_are.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/140825_JURIS_EmployerPaidBirthControl.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I would like to be snoozing my way though the legal news in this last week of August, but the Obama administration has woken me up with a new effort to ...", "title": "Nice Try, but Obama\u2019s Latest Attempt at a Contraception Mandate Accommodation Won\u2019t Work", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/obama_s_new_contraception_mandate_accommodation_religious_employers_are.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/140825_JURIS_EmployerPaidBirthControl.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@emilybazelon", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-26T12:24:46Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Nice Try, but Obama\u2019s Latest Attempt at a Contraception Mandate Accommodation Won\u2019t Work", "sailthru.headline": "Nice Try, Obama", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Nice Try, but Obama\\u2019s Latest Attempt at a Contraception Mandate Accommodation Won\\u2019t Work\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/obama_s_new_contraception_mandate_accommodation_religious_employers_are.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/140825_JURIS_EmployerPaidBirthControl.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100140826003\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-26T12:24:46Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Emily Bazelon\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"supreme court\",\n    \"hobby lobby\",\n    \"contraception\",\n    \"obamacare\",\n    \"politics\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Nice try, but Obama\u2019s latest attempt at a contraception mandate accommodation won\u2019t work:", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "contraception mandate, contraception mandate accommodation, obama\u2019s new contraception accommodation, hobby lobby, little sisters, obamacare contraception, religious liberty contraception, religious freedom contraception", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emily.bazelon"}, "sailthru.tags": "contraception mandate, contraception mandate accommodation, obama\u2019s new contraception accommodation, hobby lobby, little sisters, obamacare contraception, religious liberty contraception, religious freedom contraception", "sailthru.description": "I would like to be snoozing my way though the legal news in this last week of August, but the Obama administration has woken me up with a new effort to ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/08/140825_JURIS_EmployerPaidBirthControl.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In the initial fight over the contraception mandate, the religious groups that are currently suing\u2014nonprofits that include universities and charities\u2014got what they call a \u201cpartial\u201d accommodation.\nThe groups quickly argued that this partial accommodation was no accommodation at all, from their point of view.\nThe latest crack is a nice try, but it\u2019s not going to end the lawsuits over the contraception mandate.\nIn his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito appeared to see Form 700 as a good compromise.\nNo wonder all the other religious groups and \u201cprivately held\u201d companies want the same deal."}
