Canada, in particular, is making a bid to attract them, he said.\n\nOne way of competing is to promise students that they can stay and work after they graduate, he said, vowing that will \u201censure that we do not continue to lose ground\u201d to Canada.\n\nDavid North, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, said the program should be scrapped, not expanded, if the government is interested in helping workers already looking for jobs here in the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not only talking about replacement workers, you\u2019re talking about cheap replacement workers,\u201d Mr. North said.\n\nBecause those in the OPT program are still deemed students \u2014 even though they have graduated \u2014 businesses don\u2019t have to pay payroll taxes on their wages, creating an incentive worth thousands of dollars a year to employ them over American citizens, green card holders or those with legal work visas.\n\nMr. North also said the way the program is structured makes it tough for participating companies and foreign students to be policed.\n\nThe fight over foreign workers has heated up in recent years as some companies have looked to them as a cheap source of labor. Technology workers testified to Congress earlier this year about being forced to train the foreign workers who replaced them at their jobs.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators wrote a letter asking for an investigation into the practice, but the Obama administration declined.\n\nThe OPT program changes are part of the executive actions President Obama announced in November, when he said he was no longer going to wait for Congress to rewrite the immigration law, and would instead change it himself.\n\nThe biggest part of that change was his proposal to grant a deportation amnesty to millions of illegal immigrant parents, but that has been put on hold by the federal courts, who ruled he was overstepping his powers. However, many of the other parts of his plan are being carried out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Foreign students in science and technology fields would be able to stay and work in the U.S. for up to three years after they get their degrees under a program the Obama administration proposed expanding on Friday, saying the country needs to find a way to keep those students-turned-workers here.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Foreign students in science and technology fields would be able to stay and work in the U.S. for up to three years after they get their degrees under a program the Obama administration proposed expanding on Friday, saying the country needs to find a way to keep those students-turned-workers here.", "title": "DHS opens door to more foreign tech workers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/16/dhs-opens-door-more-foreign-tech-workers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/28/9_282015_homeland-security-syrian--28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/28/9_282015_homeland-security-syrian--28201.jpg", "description": "Foreign students in science and technology fields would be able to stay and work in the U.S. for up to three years after they get their degrees under a program the Obama administration proposed expand", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "DHS opens door to more foreign tech workers"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Labor, Social Issues, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca726\"", "article_summary": "Technology workers testified to Congress earlier this year about being forced to train the foreign workers who replaced them at their jobs.\nThe fight over foreign workers has heated up in recent years as some companies have looked to them as a cheap source of labor.\nMr. Johnson said the U.S. is competing for foreign students, who pump billions of dollars into the U.S. economy every year.\nMr. North also said the way the program is structured makes it tough for participating companies and foreign students to be policed.\nBut critics say it would provide companies with a significant source of cheap labor, making it easier to stiff American workers."}
