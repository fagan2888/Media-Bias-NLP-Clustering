They are unsupported by social science research or evidence and have left far too many families and children behind.\n\nToday, we see increasing levels of severe poverty \u2014 for example, the doubling of the number of people living on less than $2 per day \u2014 and thousands of single parents working in low-wage jobs with little hope for the future. They\u2019re working, but they still can\u2019t support their families and often must leave their children with inadequate care.\n\nFor a while, Maine was able to buck this trend and be a national leader. Twenty years ago, with unanimous agreement on both sides of the aisle, policymakers increased opportunity for poor families through innovative programs such as Parents as Scholars, which sent thousands of low-income parents to college.\n\nThey increased stability for low-income working parents with important transitional services such as health care and child care.\n\nToday, we are crashing toward the bottom of states, as more children and their parents go without health insurance, a place to live or enough to eat.\n\nFive years ago, Maine changed direction. Our state took a highly politicized turn in its policy making around poverty and welfare. This change has had dire consequences for some of Maine\u2019s most vulnerable children and families and, ultimately, for the whole state.\n\nWhile other parts of the country have shown improvement in fighting poverty and hunger, Maine has seen an increase in deep child poverty, growing numbers of uninsured children and parents, and more and more households facing food insecurity.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, Maine had the sharpest increase (50 percent) of any state in the country in the number of children living in extreme poverty \u2014 or less than half the federal poverty line, about $10,000 for a family of three. Growing up in extreme poverty has life\u00adlong consequences for individuals and their communities, including poor school attendance, increased contact with the criminal justice system and a weaker connection to the labor market.\n\nAmong families with children eligible for TANF, only half as many (31 percent) received the help they needed from that program as did those in 2010 (60 percent). A study we conducted on the consequences of families losing assistance because of the state\u2019s strict five-year time limit revealed harsh consequences for families, including increased hunger and homelessness, often leading to family separation. Maine ranks in the worst third of all states in the country in terms of children living apart from their families.\n\nSince the 2010 Affordable Care Act, every state in the country except Maine has seen an increase in the percentage of people with health insurance. This is a direct result of Maine refusing federal dollars to expand Medicaid, something that was prescribed in the historic health reform law as a method for increasing health insurance coverage. Maine is the only state that has had a statistically significant increase in the number of children without health insurance between 2010 and 2014.\n\nMaine families also are experiencing increased hunger. While food insecurity has declined in the rest of the nation as a whole, the percentage of people in Maine who face food insecurity increased from 2009 to 2014. Maine has the third highest ranking in the United States for very low food security and the highest rate of child food insecurity in New England.\n\nThese trends are dire and very troubling. They are a direct consequence of policy decisions based on ideologies that withhold opportunity instead of promoting it. They are creating untold hardships for the poorest children in our state; hardships that will result in lifelong consequences, and as such do not bode well for their or our futures.\n\nIt is imperative that we turn these frightening trends around so we do not ruin the lives of a large segment of the next generation of Mainers.\n\nIf we don\u2019t change course, the damage will seep into every part of our state, undermining our workforce, our schools and our communities.\n\nSandy Butler is professor of social work and is the graduate program coordinator in the School of Social Work at the University of Maine.
