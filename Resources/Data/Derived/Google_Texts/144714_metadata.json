Mark Begich, the incumbent Democrat, as a loyalist to President Obama.\n\nThe state has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.\n\nBut Begich, boasting endorsements by the United Fishermen of Alaska and the Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers, is campaigning as the true Alaskan, traveling to far-flung villages to connect with people who have unique needs and normally wouldn\u2019t vote.\n\nOnly about 250,000 of Alaska\u2019s 500,000 registered voters are expected to vote this year.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Geoffrey Skelley, associate editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Alaska\u2019s \u201cunique political culture\u201d makes it ripe for seemingly random local issues to sway the race.\n\n\u201cAlaska is a place where the default political allegiance is not quite as hardened, though it is pretty Republican,\u201d Skelley said. \u201cYou also tend to see a little higher libertarian ethos. Alaskans think it\u2019s important that they get investment from the federal government [for local issues] because they are so far away from the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nFish Matter\n\nIn their only debate last week, focused specifically on fishing issues, Begich showed his command of oceans and fishing ports.\n\nHe trumpets his support for subsistence rights on federal and state lands (there are 198 native villages in Alaska, and residents hunt, fish and gather much of their own food).\n\nBegich has portrayed Sullivan as against subsistence rights because, as the state\u2019s attorney general, he reopened a case against Katie John, a Alaska native elder and subsistence rights activist.\n\nSullivan insists he supports subsistence rights.\n\nIn another Alaskan matter, Begich promises to fairly distribute fishing quotas\u2014required to keep the state\u2019s fishing stock full because half of the nation\u2019s seafood comes from Alaska.\n\nBegich, who chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, is the former mayor of Anchorage and son of a popular Alaskan congressman who died in a plane crash in 1972.\n\n\u201cBegich has been around a long time,\u201d said Michael Carey, a columnist for the Alaska Dispatch News, in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cPeople know him. He\u2019s done stuff for them.\u201d\n\nSullivan, an Alaska transplant from Ohio, trumpets his own Alaskan credentials.\n\nIn the debate, Sullivan said he is against genetically modified fish, known as \u201cFrankenfish,\u201d a position Begich shares.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very one-sided issue,\u201d Carey said. \u201cVery few people would be in favor of it. It is universally abhorred here. The argument is who is against it more.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s wife, Julie, is the daughter of indigenous Athabaskan leaders. He said he helps out at her family\u2019s fish camp.\n\nBig Picture\n\nThough the local issues bring a distinct feel to the race, another prominent political analyst, Stuart Rothenberg, told The Daily Signal that \u201cthis election will be about the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditionally, federal elections are about bigger picture issues,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cWhat complicates it in Alaska is that some local issues are federal issues, with so many being about federal land.\u201d\n\nStill, Skelley and Rothenberg project Alaska to be close enough that the winner won\u2019t get 50 percent of the vote, as what happened in the state\u2019s last Senate election in 2010.\n\nSo fish might matter after all.\n\n\u201cBegich is looking to make voters take a straight choice between him and Sullivan,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re talking about fishing right\u2019s issues. If it comes down to a few thousand votes, could it be the difference?
