Russ Feingold\u2019s departure from the State Department has political experts predicting a highly contested rematch of the 2010 race in which the Madison-area senator was defeated.\n\nFeingold, a Democrat, recently resigned his post an envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa, posting on Facebook that he would soon return to his Middleton home and \u201ctravel the state extensively.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will listen carefully to my fellow Wisconsinites talk about their concerns, especially those involving their economic well-being,\u201d Feingold wrote. \u201cI will also seek their counsel on how I can best further serve my country and the state I love.\u201d\n\nFeingold, who had been senator since 1993, lost to current U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican, in 2010 with a five-point margin, part of the national Republican wave that also led to Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s election and the GOP gaining wide majorities in the state Legislature.\n\nBut the electorate will likely be much different in 2010 than in 2016, with more Democrats expected to turn out in a presidential election year, political experts say, making a potential race between the two a much closer matchup.\n\n\u201cIt would definitely be a hotly contested race,\u201d University of Wisconsin political science professor David Canon said.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge that Johnson acknowledges, although he told The Hill that he remains confident he could defeat Feingold again.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it that it\u2019s going to be a challenge, and I think I will be a target of Democrats and the left, it\u2019s kind of obvious,\u201d Johnson told The Hill last year.\n\nIn his interview with the Hill, Johnson contrasted their visions, with Feingold \u201cdedicated to growing big government\u201d and saying that Feingold would \u201chave to answer\u201d for his vote supporting the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe race will likely have significant national attention, as it could decide whether the Democrats take back the Senate in 2016. POLITICO, for example, named Wisconsin as one of the \u201c10 states that could decide the next Senate.\u201d\n\nOne of Feingold\u2019s largest advantages in the race would be that a 2016 race would match up with a presidential election, when more Democrats typically turn out than in midterm elections, UW-Green Bay political scientist David Helpap said.\n\nYounger voters, Helpap said, are among these voters that tend to turn out more often in presidential election years and also lean Democratic.\n\n\u201cPeople who tend be marginal voters and only vote in presidential elections tend to be more Democratic,\u201d Helpap said.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll of registered voters in October found Johnson had a 33 percent favorable rating, compared to 30 percent who viewed him unfavorably and 36 percent who had not heard of him. Feingold\u2019s numbers, meanwhile, were 42-30-27.\n\nCanon and Helpap both said it was too early to say for sure what Wisconsin\u2019s political climate would be come fall 2016 but that it would be interesting to see how the Senate race unfolds.\n\n\u201cFeingold would be a good candidate,\u201d Canon said. \u201cI think it would definitely be a good election for Wisconsin voters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Badger Herald", "description": "Former U.S. Sen.
