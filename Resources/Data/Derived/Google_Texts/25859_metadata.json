American intellectuals, led by H.L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis and heavily influenced by H.G. Wells, came to see \"the American middle class as their enemy.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cthe beginning of the Europeanization of American politics. And what these writers want, they want to be more like Europe. They want a more stratified, more hierarchical society. They dislike American small-d-democracy. And they talk about this at great length. This is not a conjecture.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s been largely forgotten, since in both academia and the media, the left has largely written the story of American history of the 20th century. Fortunately, Fred has done yeoman archeological work, bringing the early history of the American left to light once again, in a book that anyone who was enlightened by Jonah Goldberg\u2019s Liberal Fascism will also find absolutely intriguing.\n\nDuring our interview, we\u2019ll discuss:\n\n\u25cf The largely forgotten racism of H.G. Wells and Woodrow Wilson.\n\n\u25cf Sinclair Lewis\u2019s absurd yet highly influential It Can\u2019t Happen Here, and its paranoid vision of American fascism rising up from the benign members of the all-American Rotary Clubs and Elks and Moose Lodges.\n\n\u25cf When did \u201cProgressivism\u201d become \u201cLiberalism,\u201d and why?\n\n\u25cf What really happened during the Scopes Trial?\n\n\u25cf Why H.L. Mencken rooted for the Germans to win World War I.\n\n\u25cf What were the three legal trials that shaped the American left of the 1920s?\n\n\u25cf How did the Kennedy assassination unhinge American liberals?\n\n\u25cf What shaped the radical environmentalism of Al Gore and other American leftists?\n\n\u25cf How much of the tradition and the excesses of the early progressives was inherited by Barack Obama?\n\nAnd much more.
