They\u2019ve packed the law with lots of conditions to raise the bar: Although there\u2019s no age limit, the child needs to be capable of \u201cdiscernment\u201d of his condition; he needs to be not only in a state of unbearable suffering (the standard for adults) but terminally ill and close to death; he needs his parents\u2019 approval; and even if all of those are met, he still needs to be approved by a team of doctors and psychologists. Given all the prerequisites, you might think they\u2019d be better off sticking to ye olde \u201cdon\u2019t euthanize kids\u201d rule. The fact that they\u2019re pushing ahead anyway makes me think this is essentially gestural. For whatever reason, the right to die is important enough to them that they want to be sure it\u2019s on the books even for children. Even for eight-year-olds.\n\nProblem one: How do you know the eight-year-old is telling you what he wants and not what his parents want?\n\nPalliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, told CNN she is concerned that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that it would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers.\n\n\u201cIn my experience as a nurse, I never had a child asking to end their life,\u201d said Develter to Reuters. Problem two: Why grant children a right like this when, increasingly, medical technology is making it easier for the terminally ill to hang on?\n\nWhile supporters in the medical profession say such euthanasia is likely to be applied only in a few cases a year, the paediatricians claimed it was not necessary. They said they had never faced such demands; palliative care was now so sophisticated they could \u201cfully control the physical pain, choking, or anxiety as they approach death\u201d. They added that allowing euthanasia for children would create unbearable stress for carers and relatives.\n\nProblem three: Why extend this right to children when the law typically deems people legally incapable of giving informed consent to anything until their late teens?\n\nBrussels Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard, head of the Catholic Church in Belgium, asked at a prayer vigil last week why the state wanted to give minors such responsibility when they had to wait until 18 for many other legal rights. \u201cThe law says adolescents cannot make important decisions on economic or emotional issues, but suddenly they\u2019ve become able to decide that someone should make them die,\u201d he said.\n\nEuthanasia is typically justified as \u201cdeath with dignity.\u201d How many 10-year-olds could explain what that means?\n\nHere\u2019s CNN\u2019s report on the bill. Fair warning: It\u2019s difficult to watch in parts.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cProgress.\u201d", "title": "Belgium passes right-to-die law \u2014 for children, with no age limit", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/13/belgium-passes-right-to-die-law-for-children-with-no-age-limit/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T21:41:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-13T20:42:26+00:00"}, "keywords": "age, assisted suicide, belgium, children, euthanasia, right to die,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd5f\"", "article_summary": "Belgium passes right-to-die law \u2014 for children, with no age limitposted at 4:41 pm on February 13, 2014 by AllahpunditA little more grease on the slippery slope.\nProblem three: Why extend this right to children when the law typically deems people legally incapable of giving informed consent to anything until their late teens?\nProblem two: Why grant children a right like this when, increasingly, medical technology is making it easier for the terminally ill to hang on?\nGiven all the prerequisites, you might think they\u2019d be better off sticking to ye olde \u201cdon\u2019t euthanize kids\u201d rule.\nThey added that allowing euthanasia for children would create unbearable stress for carers and relatives."}
