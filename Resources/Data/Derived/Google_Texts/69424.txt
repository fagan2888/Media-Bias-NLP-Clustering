If you haven't gotten your pumpkin for your front porch, here's a way to do it and give back.

WINGS, a special needs community, is located at 13700 N. Eastern in Edmond. It's having its Fall Festival and Pumpkin Patch, where unique and traditional pumpkins are for sale.

There will be free pumpkin train rides, hayrides and other activities. The festival is happening now through Halloween.

Pumpkins are available for $1 to $75 and all proceeds will go back to WINGS. Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.
