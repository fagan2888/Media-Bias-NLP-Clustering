He said they don't necessarily signify policy differences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U S Rep Charlie Dent is spreading his message of dismay about polarization in the nation s capital Today Washington is broken he said in a speech Monday before the Pennsylvania Press Club As", "title": "Moderate GOP congressman offers dim assessment of D.C. \u2014 and a sliver of hope", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "U.S. Rep.
