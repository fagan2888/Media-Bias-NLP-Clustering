At first, it was an April Fools\u2019 joke, and then once Candace Cameron Bure went on Dancing with the Stars and voiced her excitement it seemed like the real deal. Now we can confirm via TV Line that a reunion series called Fuller House might be heading to Netflix.\n\nAccording to TV Line, Netflix is very close to ordering a 13-episode series that would star Candace Cameron Bure and Andrea Barber as BFFs D.J. and Kimmy.\n\nFor the Full House reunion guest appearances are being mulled over, and it\u2019s said that Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, and John Stamos are all being looked at to reprise their roles as Danny Tanner, Jesse Katsopolis, and Joey Gladstone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard a Tanner-girls centered Full House show. Months ago, TV Guide reported that Warner Bros and the original producers of Full House were talking about a resurrection of sorts.\n\nThis talk about a revival seemed kismet considering another 90s favorite Boy Meets World had successfully launched a Disney spin-off Girl Meets World. Since discussion of a Full House spin-off, Girl Meets World has scored a second season, and has seen many of its original characters return and pop up in the series.\n\nAlthough representatives of Netflix and Warner Bros. refused to comment on TV Line\u2019s report, fans are already very excited about the potential of seeing some of their favorite characters back again.\n\nMY HEART CANNOT HANDLE ANY MORE FALSE HOPE. \u201c@EW: #FullHouse revival eyed by @Netflix: http://t.co/z9WdVGDujQ pic.twitter.com/QmyPTjeWxB\u201d \u2014 Jess Tholmer (@tholmz) April 2, 2015\n\n@EW @netflix OH MY GOD YAAAASSSSSSSSSSS PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN \u2014 Alfredo Sauce (@freddy25) April 2, 2015\n\n\u201c@EW: #FullHouse revival eyed by @Netflix: http://t.co/veIOmwGpQV pic.twitter.com/gDiXr660kG\u201d This is the happiest day of my life. \u2014 Patti Murin (@PattiMurin) April 2, 2015\n\nCut. it. out.

Odds are looking better for Sweetin than they are the Olsen twins. Sweetin has met up with the Full House cast mates during their many reunions, where the Olsen Twins have been absent.\n\n[Image via Warner Bros Television]", "article_metadata": {"description": "For years, we've been hearing about a Full House reunion in the works.
