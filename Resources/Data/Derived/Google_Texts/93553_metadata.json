He just lied about it. https://t.co/lNpWVvzF0y \u2014 Hunter Walker (@hunterw) March 30, 2016\n\n\u201cWell, look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject, but you still \u2014 I just believe in choice,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAgain, it may be a little bit of a New York background because there is some different attitude in different parts of the country. And, you know, I was raised in New York, and grew up, and work, and everything else in New York City. But I am strongly for choice and yet I hate the concept of abortion.\u201d\n\nTrump says he was never asked about whether he was pro-life or pro-choice before he was a politician. He's lying: https://t.co/0LjEYRE5E1 \u2014 Yair Rosenberg (@Yair_Rosenberg) March 30, 2016\n\nTrump literally wrote an entire book on policy in 2000 when he flirted w/running for president and said he was pro-choice. \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) March 30, 2016\n\nThis being said, Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski pointed out that Trump has evolved towards a pro-life position in the past.\n\nHe thought about enough to change his mind on partial birth abortion in 2000 book. https://t.co/io29WZNYBR pic.twitter.com/RAKQbQpFJT \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) March 30, 2016\n\nI'd also offer this hilarious audio of Trump telling Howard Stern in 2013 he's pro-life. Stern replies in disbelief https://t.co/aQwHhj8t9o \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) March 30, 2016\n\nPersonally, I'm willing to believe Trump on this one. Improved sonogram technology, as well as medical advances that have saved the lives of many premature babies, has changed many hearts and minds on abortion. There's no reason why Trump's mind couldn't have been changed as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Progress..05/27/2016 8:55:48AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Progress.", "title": "Donald Trump: I've Evolved, I'm Pro-Life Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/29/donald-trump-ive-evolved-im-prolife-now-n2140838", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/89/2016-03-30T004433Z_1_LYNXNPEC2T01E_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Progress.", "title": "Donald Trump: I've Evolved, I'm Pro-Life Now", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/29/donald-trump-ive-evolved-im-prolife-now-n2140838", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/89/2016-03-30T004433Z_1_LYNXNPEC2T01E_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Donald Trump: I've Evolved, I'm Pro-Life Now, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) March 30, 2016This being said, Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski pointed out that Trump has evolved towards a pro-life position in the past.\nStern replies in disbelief https://t.co/aQwHhj8t9o \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) March 30, 2016Personally, I'm willing to believe Trump on this one.\nOn Tuesday's CNN town hall, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said that he's evolved on the issue of abortion and now considers himself to be pro-life.\nhttps://t.co/io29WZNYBR pic.twitter.com/RAKQbQpFJT \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) March 30, 2016I'd also offer this hilarious audio of Trump telling Howard Stern in 2013 he's pro-life.\nTrump said that as a businessman, he wasn't asked about abortion, and thus didn't have strong views on the issue."}
