Yankton, SD

Saturday night the Yankton community came together to remember the 6-year-old boy whose body was pulled from the Missouri River Friday.

Windy conditions prohibited candles at the vigil, but participants say it didn't extinguish the warmth felt for the family of Lincoln Hilt.

A Yankton pastor acknowledged the suffering and pain over Hilt's death and asked participants to remember the good things the boy brought into their lives. Hilt's cousin was one of the family members at the gathering.

"He was smiles and giggles and just vibrant, and always, always moving. Always happy, and always saying things you never expected him to say. He was smart and adorable. He was great," Lincoln's cousin, Jessie Hancock said.

Participants released balloons, symbolizing their own release of Hilt from their lives. Many people wore green shirts featuring Bumblebee, Hilt's favorite transformers character.
