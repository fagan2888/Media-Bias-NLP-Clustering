Now, the competition moves here.\n\nBillet parents Rob and Debi Hoffman of Colorado Springs have four children, but they helped raise four others out of their previous Monument home, plus others on a part-time basis.\n\nTheir billets are temporarily adopted hockey players \u2014 the ones looking to play juniors, in college or professionally. Cam Strong came from Billings, Mont., Garrett Metcalf from Salt Lake City and Charlie Donlin and Matt LaPrade from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. They played triple-A hockey for the Colorado Rampage, one of the state\u2019s four Tier I programs.\n\nStrong will play for Dartmouth this fall and Metcalf \u2014 a sixth-round draft pick of the Anaheim Ducks last June \u2014 is bound for UMass Lowell. Donlin plays for Division III St. Thomas in Minnesota and LaPrade was a one-time University of Minnesota recruit who was forced to hang up the skates because of an injury.\n\n\u201cThese kids became like family for us,\u201d said Rob Hoffman, a retired money manger and stock broker who grew up in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe do it out of sense of community,\u201d Debi Hoffman said.\n\nUniversity of Denver freshman Dylan Gambrell is from Bonney Lake, Wash., but he played for the Colorado Thunderbirds\u2019 U-16 team in 2011-12, billeting with teammate Brandon Carlo and his family in Colorado Springs. Gambrell centers DU\u2019s top line and is among its leading scorers. He is expected to be drafted by an NHL team in June.\n\n\u201cYou mature as a hockey player and person,\u201d said Gambrell, who attended high school in Colorado Springs. \u201cYou mature a lot, moving away from your parents. It\u2019s a whole other world, but a good experience all around. The coaches and the players take you under their wings and become like family.\u201d\n\nGambrell\u2019s Thunderbirds were upset by the Dallas Stars Elite at the district playoffs but finished 56-6-6.\n\n\u201cFor me, I thought it was the best opportunity I could have,\u201d Gambrell said.\n\nCarlo could be the next NHL player born and raised in Colorado, following Seth Jones of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Nick Shore of the Los Angeles Kings. Carlo, who is playing major junior for the Tri-City Americans, was drafted in the second round by the Boston Bruins last summer and represented his country at the past two World Junior Championships. He and Gambrell were drawn to the Thunderbirds since the U-16 team won the national title in 2010, Colorado\u2019s first and only to date.\n\nJones, the fourth selection in the 2013 draft, also played for the Thunderbirds along with Shore, the second of three brothers to play at DU.\n\nThe Hoffmans, meanwhile, are sadly without a billet this season for the first time since 2009. They are saving money, but miss having another highly motivated hockey player serving as a role model for their fourth child, Andrew, who is a freshman hockey player at Lewis-Palmer.\n\n\u201cThey crushed us in food,\u201d Rob Hoffman, 56, said of his billets, who are required to pay a $300 monthly fee.\n\n\u201cThe $300 is a nice bonus, but we certainly didn\u2019t do it for the money,\u201d said Debi Hoffman, 53.\n\n\u201cIt covers Gatorade,\u201d Rob said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the money.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Springs billet parents find new family in hockey \u201csons\u201d", "title": "Colorado Springs billet parents find new family in hockey \u201csons\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/colorado-springs-billet-parents-find-new-family-in-hockey-sons/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T22:06:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-27T22:06:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They are saving money, but miss having another highly motivated hockey player serving as a role model for their fourth child, Andrew, who is a freshman hockey player at Lewis-Palmer.\nWhen the Avalanche arrived in 1995, young hockey players with big dreams had to move elsewhere to find adequate competition.\nTheir billets are temporarily adopted hockey players \u2014 the ones looking to play juniors, in college or professionally.\n\u201cYou mature as a hockey player and person,\u201d said Gambrell, who attended high school in Colorado Springs.\n\u201cThese kids became like family for us,\u201d said Rob Hoffman, a retired money manger and stock broker who grew up in New Jersey."}
