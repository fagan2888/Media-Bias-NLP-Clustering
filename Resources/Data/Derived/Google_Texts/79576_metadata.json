McMath suffered cardiac arrest in December 2013 after a routine operation to remove her tonsils to cure her sleep apnea. Doctors say she suffered irreversible brain damage from lack of oxygen and declared her brain dead.\n\nThe Alameda County coroner in Oakland signed Jahi McMath\u2019s death certificate a few weeks later, but McMath\u2019s family sought a state court ruling declaring the teen is still alive. A state court judge earlier this year refused the family\u2019s request and upheld the death certificate after a respected Stanford University neurologist and two other medical experts concluded the girl was dead.\n\nJahi\u2019s family is now asking a federal judge to declare Jahi alive and invalidate the death certificate. If that happens, insurance companies will be required to pay for her medical treatment, says lawyer Chris Dolan, who represents Jahi\u2019s family.\n\nDolan says insurance companies are paying for Jahi\u2019s nursing care and around-the-clock treatment with a ventilator in New Jersey, the only state in the country that requires medical treatment of patients like McMath who are declared dead but show minimal brain function.\n\nMcMath\u2019s family, led by her mother Nailah Winkfield, want a federal court to invalidate the death certificate so they can care for the in their home in Oakland.\n\n\u201cI want her to have the same rights as any other disabled kid,\u201d Winkfield said.\n\nMcMath\u2019s mother says her daughter show some signs of life, including the twitching of fingers and toes.\n\nMedical experts said those movements could be spasms and reflexes commonly seen in corpses. They say McMath shows hardly any brain activity and is clinically dead.\n\nBut her mother isn\u2019t ready to give up. Winfield said she recently sold her Oakland home and is living off those rapidly dwindling proceeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t give up on Jahi, because I\u2019m her mother,\u201d Winkfield said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jahi McMath suffered cardiac arrest two years ago at age 13 following an operation to have her tonsils removed.
