Bunning Thursday that marriage is between one man and one woman.\n\n\u201cToday, judicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in a statement. \u201cToday, for the first time ever, the government arrested a Christian woman for living according to her faith. This is wrong. This is not America.\u201d\n\nMs. Davis, a Christian, has maintained that she could not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs.\n\nJudge Bunning, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, said in court Thursday that Ms. Davis\u2019s \u201cgood-faith belief is simply not a viable defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not physically impossible for her to issue the licenses,\u201d he said, The New York Times reported. \u201cShe\u2019s choosing not to.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in June, sparking outrage from social and religious conservatives, as well as calls for a Constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nOn Thursday. Mr. Cruz said the nation was founded on \u201cJudeo-Christian values\u201d and said it is hypocritical for elected officials to on the one hand argue that Ms. Davis should resign from her job, but on the other hand refuse to call for the mayor of San Francisco to step down for creating a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cWhere is the call for President Obama to resign for ignoring and defying our immigration laws, our welfare reform laws, and even his own Obamacare?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign, then we can talk about Kim Davis.\u201d\n\nOther GOP presidential candidates also panned the decision.\n\n\u201cI think it is absurd to put someone in jail for exercising their religious liberty,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, in a statement, said that putting Ms. Davis in federal custody \u201cremoves all doubt of the criminalization of Christianity in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a reckless, appalling, out-of-control decision that undermines the Constitution of the United States and our fundamental right to religious liberty,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz criticized a federal judge for ordering a Kentucky county clerk to be jailed after she defied the Supreme Court by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz criticized a federal judge for ordering a Kentucky county clerk to be jailed after she defied the Supreme Court by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.", "title": "Ted Cruz rips jailing of Kim Davis: \u2018This is not America\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/3/cruz-rips-jailing-kim-davis-this-is-not-america/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/23/8851d56eaceadc257f0f6a7067001031.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/23/8851d56eaceadc257f0f6a7067001031.jpg", "description": "GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz criticized a federal judge for ordering a Kentucky county clerk to be jailed after she defied the Supreme Court by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ted Cruz rips jailing of Kim Davis: \u2018This is not America\u2019"}, "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Law Crime, Religion Belief, Politics, Kim  Davis"}, "article_summary": "This is not America.\u201dMs. Davis, a Christian, has maintained that she could not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs.\nGOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz criticized a federal judge for ordering a Kentucky county clerk to be jailed after she defied the Supreme Court by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.\n\u201cShe\u2019s choosing not to.\u201dThe Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in June, sparking outrage from social and religious conservatives, as well as calls for a Constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.\n\u201cWhen the mayor of San Francisco and President Obama resign, then we can talk about Kim Davis.\u201dOther GOP presidential candidates also panned the decision.\n\u201cToday, judicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in a statement."}
