The three announced that the organizations are teaming up to offer a new coverage plan with a limited provider network but one that they say will promote high-quality health care at a lower premium cost. AP Photo/Jim Cole\n\nValley Regional Hospital is in Claremont, a city with a 15 percent poverty rate and the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state over the adequacy of education funding in New Hampshire.\n\nSo it should be no surprise that Valley Regional CEO Peter Wright was riled up after he learned that Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New Hampshire didn\u2019t approach the hospital to be on the network of providers it put together for its offering on the new health exchange.\n\nThe network was deemed by state officials as providing adequate statewide medical coverage. But, asked Wright, if the exchange is supposed to attract the uninsured, \u201cand we have some of the highest level of private pay in the state because they don\u2019t have insurance, why not reach out to the major provider in this community?\u201d\n\nWright answered his own question: \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt by a for-profit to seek the most lucrative market and avoid what doesn\u2019t accrue to its earnings.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Wright\u2019s assertion is being echoed at Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital in Colebrook and hinted at by Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester, two other hospitals left out of the network Anthem put together for its exchange offering in 2014 \u2013 which, if it is approved at the federal level, it will begin marketing on October 1.\n\nBut Paula Rogers, a lobbyist for Anthem, rejected that accusation. \u201cThat\u2019s a highly disturbing suggestion,\u201d she said, pointing out that Concord Hospital, Portsmouth Regional Hospital and Parkland Medical Center in Derry are also off the list. \u201cClearly there has been no discussion of such a thing. We developed a narrow network.\u201d And that network, she said, \u201ccould have been more narrow,\u201d but Anthem \u201cexceeded the rules.\u201d\n\nShe said a narrow network will bring down costs by giving Anthem a stronger hand in negotiations with the participating hospitals. That, she said, will help attract uninsured residents to the network.\n\nNarrow networks are not new \u2013 they were part of the original health maintenance organization game plan. Some HMOs involved only a few hospitals and a limited number of doctors, but they were billed as a cost-cutting alternative in providing health coverage.\n\nAs HMOs got bigger, and competition fierce, accessible networks became the selling point, and soon nearly everybody was in a network.\n\n\u2018Sustainable health system\u2019\n\n\u201cEverybody understands that the ground is shifting in a fundamental way,\u201d said Alex Walker, senior vice president for operations and strategic development at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester.\n\nIndeed, four days after Anthem unveiled its network, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the Elliot Health System put forward their own limited network, called ElevateHealth.\n\nThat partnership will serve the group market at first, differentiating it from Anthem\u2019s health exchange plan for individuals, but both Harvard Pilgrim and Anthem hope to move into the other market, albeit with a different group of hospitals.\n\nElevateHealth\u2019s three founding institutions would divvy up the pool of premiums and split them three ways. The savings claims are more modest than Anthem\u2019s \u2013 about 10 percent off the premiums of similar plans \u2013 and the deductibles will be high, ranging from $1,500 to $5,000 a year.\n\nThe \u201csustainable health system\u201d will consist of \u201ctaking care of people,\u201d \u201cvalue, not volume\u201d of patients, and a new shared-risk \u201cpayment model,\u201d said Dr. James Weinstein, president and CEO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock.\n\n\u201cThis has never been done between a payer and two provider systems,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cIt will change the landscape in the way we live that needs to be changed.\u201d\n\nElevateHealth\u2019s 3,000-provider network, which is ready to go into effect on Dec. 1, is currently even more limited than Anthem\u2019s, concentrating on the southern tier of the state, the Upper Valley and other areas, such as Keene, Derry and New London. There will be no provider network in half the state\u2019s 10 counties.\n\nConcord Hospital has declined to participate, but the Dartmouth-Hitchcock clinic in Concord will.\n\nCMC in Manchester and St. Joseph Hospital in Nashua say were not approached to participate, though they have worked closely with Dartmouth-Hitchcock and Harvard Pilgrim in the past. Southern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua, which was left off the Anthem network, signed on.\n\nBut because ElevateHealth is being marketed alongside other plans and may yet enter their territories, hospital officials aren\u2019t as concerned about it as they are by the Anthem health exchange plan.\n\nAnthem\u2019s health exchange plan is the only one offered at this point under the Affordable Care Act, meaning that those with individual policies, as well as those in the assigned risk pool, will simply be moved to the Anthem network.\n\nThe population that will get insurance on the exchange is an uncertain mix. They could be uninsured sick individuals or healthy people who choose to buy health insurance rather than pay the federal penalty for not having it, or there could be those refugees from the group market -- if employers, as some threaten to do \u2013 cancel their health benefits in response to the ACA.\n\nThere are about 160,000 uninsured individuals in New Hampshire, but one study estimated that only 70,000 people will end up on the exchange, including those already with individual coverage. Small groups (those under 50 employees) might do so as well, though nobody expects many to join this year.\n\n\u2018A travesty\u2019\n\nNo matter what the numbers, hospitals are upset at being left out of Anthem\u2019s health exchange network.\n\n\u201cWe need every patient,\u201d said Alvin Felgar, CEO of Frisbie Memorial in Rochester. \u201cWe have the worst payer mix on the Seacoast.\u201d\n\nFelgar\u2019s disappointment is not restricted to lost revenue. He remembers hearing President Obama claim that no one will have to switch their doctor because of the ACA, but many of Rochester\u2019s primary care physicians work for the hospital. That means those with individual plans will have to switch their doctor or dig deep into their pockets.\n\n\u201cSo once we get the details, it\u2019s not true,\u201d Felgar said. \u201cThat\u2019s a travesty. It is no mean feat to change doctors.\u201d\n\nIn addition, there are all those uninsured patients who have been showing up at his door in the past. If they go on the exchange, they will be insured. \u201cWe would finally be able to collect something from these people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they will be going somewhere else.\u201d\n\nFelgar said he approached Anthem about participating. \u201cWe have the lowest rates on the Seacoast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite baffling that a major player won\u2019t talk to us.\u201d\n\nFelgar, unlike Wright at Valley Regional, won\u2019t offer an opinion why. He saved his major criticism for the state.\n\n\u201cWhere is the fairness here? Where is the insurance commissioner? How could they let this happen? We don\u2019t have to be in the network, but to not even ask us?\u201d\n\nThe previous Republican-controlled Legislature rejected the idea of New Hampshire forming its own state-controlled health exchange, so the federal government essentially has oversight, although it is clear that it is deferring to the states.\n\n\u201cCMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) will rely on state analyses and recommendations when the state has the authority and means to assess issuer network adequacy,\u201d the agency said, though the agency could overrule them if it doesn\u2019t come up to the state standards.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the exchange is to provide consumer choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere New Hampshire went terribly wrong is that there is no consumer choice \u2013 you take it or leave it.\u201d\n\nCMS would not comment on Anthem\u2019s plan until it is officially approved. The state, however, has had no problem with the coverage offered.\n\n\u201cAnthem has met our adequacy standards. Our regulations set a floor for minimum access. We have never required carriers to sign on every hospital in the state,\u201d said Deputy Insurance Commissioner Alexander Feldvebel.\n\nTravel time\n\nThe state\u2019s standards call for 90 percent of the population to be within 15 miles or a 40-minute average driving time of primary care providers and 45 miles or 60 minutes\u2019 travel time for most specialists.\n\nAccording to Google Maps, Frisbie is 16 minutes from Wentworth Douglass, in Dover, which is part of the Anthem network, and Valley Regional is 23 minutes to New London and a half-hour away from Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, both of which are on the network.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a public transportation system,\u201d Wright said. The result, he said would be that many people on the exchange will wind up after hours in the hospital emergency room \u2013 which defeats the whole purpose of the ACA, he added.\n\nTraveling distance is even more of a problem in the North Country. Indeed, Anthem added two North Country hospitals \u2013 Androscoggin Valley Hospital in Berlin and Littleton Regional Hospital \u2013 because of criticism that the only area hospital it had previously signed up, Weeks Medical Center in Lancaster, did not have a maternity center.\n\nAnthem didn\u2019t approach Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital in Colebrook to participate. Upper Connecticut Valley\u2019s chief administrative officer, Charlie White, said his hospital is \u201cthe smallest in the state with the largest coverage area.\u201d\n\nUpper Connecticut Valley is about an hour from Weeks and an hour and a quarter from Berlin, and the population to its north, in towns like Pittsburg, are another 45 minutes away. That means travel time for some residents to the closest hospital in the Anthem network would easily exceed state standards. But only 90 percent of a hospital area\u2019s population have to meet those parameters, and the Colebrook area is a very sparsely populated area. The town of Colebrook has fewer than 1,400 residents.\n\nSelective networks make sense for urban areas where there are two hospitals in a city, \u201cbut not in a rural areas where there is limited access,\u201d he said. And they certainly don\u2019t make sense when there is no competition, he added.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the exchange is to provide consumer choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere New Hampshire went terribly wrong is that there is no consumer choice \u2013 you take it or leave it.\u201d\n\nWhite suggested that the North Country wasn\u2019t going to take it. Hospitals in the area are thinking of teaming up with Dartmouth-Hitchcock to either form their own network or work with ElevateHealth.\n\nIf so, it seems, the war of the networks would then begin in earnest.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "Two new lower-cost health offerings offer proof that \u2018the ground is shifting\u2019 in N.H.\u2019s health insurance market", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85bf\"", "article_summary": "\u2018A travesty\u2019No matter what the numbers, hospitals are upset at being left out of Anthem\u2019s health exchange network.\nIndeed, four days after Anthem unveiled its network, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the Elliot Health System put forward their own limited network, called ElevateHealth.\nSouthern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua, which was left off the Anthem network, signed on.\nSome HMOs involved only a few hospitals and a limited number of doctors, but they were billed as a cost-cutting alternative in providing health coverage.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a highly disturbing suggestion,\u201d she said, pointing out that Concord Hospital, Portsmouth Regional Hospital and Parkland Medical Center in Derry are also off the list."}
