Cujo was not injured.\n\nThe Weld County DA already has filed charges against Duran for felony child abuse, burglary, felony menacing, felony robbery, first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft, felony trespassing and theft. Those charges reflect the Weld County portion of the alleged crime spree.\n\nWeld County authorities said Duran ditched a stolen car in Longview estates and tried to break into two houses before threatening to kill a man's young child before taking the man's car at knifepoint.\n\nPolice found the car outside of the Niwot home about an hour later and began a search for Duran, who was taken into custody when he returned to the car, apparently to work on the engine.\n\nAt roughly the same time Boulder County sheriff's deputies took Duran into custody, a fire was reported at the Niwot home he is accused of breaking into.\n\nDuran remained in custody on Friday at the Weld County Jail on a $150,000 cash or surety bond. He is due back in Weld County District Court for an advisement hearing on Feb. 23.\n\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/crime/ci_27526368/weld-county-da-files-more-charges-against-lafayette", "sailthru.section": "Crime", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n  Staff Writer", "description": "The Weld County District Attorney's Office on Friday  filed additional charges against a Lafayette man accused of embarking on a crime spree in Weld and Boulder counties earlier this month.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27526368:view"}, "startDate": "2015-02-14T11:17:49-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/crime/ci_27526368/weld-county-da-files-more-charges-against-lafayette", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0213/20150213__14TCAMTH~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Weld County District Attorney's Office on Friday  filed additional charges against a Lafayette man accused of embarking on a crime spree in Weld and Boulder counties earlier this month.", "title": "Weld County DA files more charges against Lafayette man arrested in alleged crime spree"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Weld County District Attorney's Office on Friday  filed additional charges against a Lafayette man accused of embarking on a crime spree in Weld and Boulder counties earlier this month.", "title": "Weld County DA files more charges against Lafayette man arrested in alleged crime spree", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/crime/ci_27526368/weld-county-da-files-more-charges-against-lafayette", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0213/20150213__14TCAMTH~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-14T11:17:49-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Weld County DA files more charges against Lafayette man arrested in alleged crime spree", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0213/20150213__14TCAMTH~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John BearStaff", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2015-02-14T11:19:02-0700", "endDate": "2025-02-13T21:38:23-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-02-14T11:20:16-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado, Mead, Weld, County, Boulder, Lafayette, Firestone, Fredrick, Dacono, Loveland, crime, map, police, courts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0efc\"", "article_summary": "Frank Duran (Weld County Sheriff' / Courtesy photo)The Weld County District Attorney's Office on Friday filed additional charges against a Lafayette man accused of embarking on a crime spree in Weld and Boulder counties earlier this month.\nHe is due back in Weld County District Court for an advisement hearing on Feb. 23.\nThose charges reflect the Weld County portion of the alleged crime spree.\nThe Weld County DA already has filed charges against Duran for felony child abuse, burglary, felony menacing, felony robbery, first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft, felony trespassing and theft.\nDuran remained in custody on Friday at the Weld County Jail on a $150,000 cash or surety bond."}
