The Estes Family is a military family who loves to escape onto the water. One local organization worked to give them anther escape, one leaders say they truly deserved.

"Well we got the one big picture gonna go over there," Sherry Melton said to the group of volunteers. "And once we move this in the corner we'll put the other one over here."

If Melton were a conductor, the group of more than 30 volunteers would be her orchestra,

Here at the Estes family house, it's home makeover, special edition. The volunteers spent the day making a special space for a special boy.

"He's going to love the room that bed is so perfect for him," Alexi Evans, a family member said of the room's recipient.

Special Spaces makes it their mission to makeover bedrooms for children with life threatening illnesses. Lloyd Jr, or Bub as his family calls him, has a seizure disorder, tuberous sclerosis and a heart condition. But he's also got a family with a heart big enough to handle it all.

The Estes family loves to fish and Melton designed a nautical makeover for boy's room, with a bed boat and pallet covered wardrobes to look like fishing shacks.

Special Spaces has done several of these projects before, but this room is a little different.

"I really wanted to give back to our military for everything that they do for us is an amazing blessing for us," Melton said. Lloyd Estes is in the Air Force.

You can tell from the Estes family home that mom Natalie has a D-I-Y approach to life.

"Natalie does everything herself all the time," Evans said, "and so for her to let people in her home and do something for her for a change was just a great."

The family spent the day fishing, horseback riding and enjoying the weather at Dreamcatcher Ranch in Southport.

After some last minute adjustments and a quick fix came the reveal.

"I'm just so overwhelmed," Natalie Estes said after taking in her son's room. "I'm so grateful."
