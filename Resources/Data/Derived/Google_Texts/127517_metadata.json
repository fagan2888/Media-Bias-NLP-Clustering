A flash flood watch expired at noon, though a flash flood advisory for urban and small streams is in effect through 3:30 p.m. for several counties.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include Broken Arrow, Muskogee, Claremore, Wagoner, Vinita, Nowata, Pryor, Coweta, Chouteau, Haskell, Chelsea, Locust Grove, Oologah and Salina, the National Weather Service states.\n\nSee All Weather Alerts\n\nRainfall totals for 24 hours include 3.7 inches in Muskogee, 2.8 at Poteau, 2.7 at Grove, 2.3 in Okmulgee and 1.4 for Tulsa. That's as of noon Sunday.\n\nThe Illinois River near Tahlequah is expected to crest at moderate flood stage Monday night. If you live in low-lying areas prone to flooding, be aware of rising water.\n\nThis afternoon, most of us should see a break from the rain for a few hours. This is a very strong and slow moving system that could redevelop some showers tonight. Anything that does redevelop should be gone by the time we head to work on Monday.\n\nWe are looking at 1 to 3\u201d of rain possible across much of Green Country, some locally higher amounts will be possible. Once this system moves out, we still warmer than normal day time highs. Tuesday will be our warmest day of the week, topping out in the mid-60s.\n\nA stronger cold front arrives by Wednesday morning and then day time highs drop back to near normal for the middle of December.\n\nTrack The Storm With WARN Interactive Radar", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The large system bringing rain to Green Country is moving slowly out of the state, leaving colder temps and some road flooding.", "author": "Stacia Knight", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30734444/flash-flood-watch-in-effect-for-eastern-oklahoma", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9450092_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The large system bringing rain to Green Country is moving slowly out of the state, leaving colder temps and some road flooding.", "title": "Large System Leaves Some Flooding, Colder Temps In Green Country"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9450092_G.jpg", "description": "The large system bringing rain to Green Country is moving slowly out of the state, leaving colder temps and some road flooding.", "card": "summary", "title": "Large System Leaves Some Flooding, Colder Temps In Green Country"}, "wnreadableurl": "flash-flood-watch-in-effect-for-eastern-oklahoma", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/12/13", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "article_summary": "The large system bringing rain to Green Country is moving slowly out of the state, leaving colder temps and some road flooding.\nWe are looking at 1 to 3\u201d of rain possible across much of Green Country, some locally higher amounts will be possible.\nOnce this system moves out, we still warmer than normal day time highs.\nThis is a very strong and slow moving system that could redevelop some showers tonight.\nA stronger cold front arrives by Wednesday morning and then day time highs drop back to near normal for the middle of December."}
