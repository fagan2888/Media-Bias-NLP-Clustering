Ward\u2019s snap count to the 30s as he came back from a high ankle sprain.\n\nWard played 39 of the Broncos\u2019 72 defensive snaps.\n\nThe good news, according to Kubiak, is neither Ward nor safety Darian Stewart, who had a hamstring injury, suffered a setback Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beat up, but our frame of mind is really good,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 timely win over Cincinnati helped clinch a playoff spot, but Sunday\u2019s game against San Diego decides the division.\n\nThe defense isn\u2019t the only side banged up either. Receivers Demaryius Thomas (hamstring) and Emmanuel Sanders (ankle) were limited by in-game injuries, but able to finish the game. Kubiak believed they would be OK moving forward.\n\nThat first-round bye looks even tastier as the injuries pile up.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe\n\nShooting for the bye\n\nThe Broncos clinched a playoff spot Monday with a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are popping champagne bottles.\n\nThere still are achievable regular-season goals \u2014 a fifth consecutive AFC West crown, a first-round bye and an outside shot at the No. 1 seed. First, Denver would need to beat the San Diego Chargers at Sports Authority Field on Sunday. Here\u2019s a look at how the Broncos could rise to the top spot or fall as low as the No. 6 and final AFC seed:\n\n\u2022 No. 1 seed \u2014 The Broncos victory over San Diego coupled with a Patriots loss to the Dolphins would give Denver the No. 1 seed.\n\n\u2022 No. 2 seed \u2014 A Denver victory clinches at least No. 2 and a first-round bye no matter what else happens. The Broncos would also get this spot if the Chiefs, Broncos and Bengals all lose.\n\n\u2022 No. 3 seed \u2014 Broncos and Chiefs losses along with a Bengals victory would give Denver the division, but no bye.\n\n\u2022 No. 4 seed \u2014 This is the only seed the Broncos can\u2019t get. It\u2019s reserved for the AFC South champion, Houston or Indianapolis.\n\n\u2022 No. 5 seed \u2014 The Broncos would face this with a loss, a Chiefs victory and a Jets loss.\n\n\u2022 No. 6 seed \u2014 This would be quite a drop, but Denver could find itself headed to Kansas City with a loss and the Chiefs and Jets win.\n\nCameron Wolfe, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos faced with rough injury recovery due to quick turnaround", "title": "Broncos faced with rough injury recovery due to quick turnaround", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/29/broncos-faced-with-rough-injury-recovery-due-to-quick-turnaround/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151229__SP29FBNBRONCOS6808xp1-1.jpg", "height": 483}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151229__SP29FBNBRONCOS6808xp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-29T13:41:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:45:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "1 seed \u2014 The Broncos victory over San Diego coupled with a Patriots loss to the Dolphins would give Denver the No.\nThere still are achievable regular-season goals \u2014 a fifth consecutive AFC West crown, a first-round bye and an outside shot at the No.\n3 seed \u2014 Broncos and Chiefs losses along with a Bengals victory would give Denver the division, but no bye.\n2 seed \u2014 A Denver victory clinches at least No.\nThat first-round bye looks even tastier as the injuries pile up."}
