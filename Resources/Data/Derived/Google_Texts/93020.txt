Oxley was first elected to Congress in 1981. He served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee before leaving Capitol Hill in 2006 and becoming a lobbyist.

He is best known for co-authoring the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which ratcheted up reporting requirements for publicly traded companies.

While in the House, Oxley also worked on energy policy and federal telecommunications. Prior to entering Congress, he was an FBI agent and member of the Ohio General Assembly.

Oxley is survived by his wife, Patricia, and their son, Chadd, also a lobbyist.

Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) called Oxley, a friend of more than 30 years, "a model statesman and an Ohio original."

"He served his constituents and country with honor and courage, always with twinkle in his eye and a heart full of love," Boehner said in a statement Friday.

"He was as skilled as a legislator as he was quick with a smile. He loved to serve, and he loved those he served, and it was reflected in his work," Boehner added.
