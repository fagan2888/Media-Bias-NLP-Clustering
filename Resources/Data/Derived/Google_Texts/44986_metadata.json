She added that patients currently undergoing care shouldn't worry about a disruption. \"We would never stop a patient's treatment because of a change in insurance or financial situation.\"\n\nEmpire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, one of the health plans that failed to reach an agreement with Sloan-Kettering, didn't directly address why things hadn't worked out, but hinted that cost was a factor.\n\n\"Our choices relating to network composition have been motivated by our goal of supporting access to a broad range of care on an affordable sustainable basis,\" spokeswoman Deb Wiethop said in an email. \"Affordability is key to a more focused network.\"\n\nFounded in 1884, Sloan-Kettering was the first hospital in the world dedicated solely to treating cancer. The faculty includes winners of prestigious science prizes. Its clinical research program is one of the country's largest.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC New York", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Yorkers buying a health plan on the state's new insurance exchange should read the fine print if they're interested in getting care at some of the city's top hospitals.", "title": "Some NYC Hospitals Aren't Taking New Health Exchange Plans", "og": {"site_name": "NBC New York", "description": "New Yorkers buying a health plan on the state's new insurance exchange should read the fine print if they're interested in getting care at some of the city's top hospitals.", "title": "Some NYC Hospitals Aren't Taking New Health Plans", "url": "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Affordable-Care-Act-Sloan-Kettering-New-York-Presbyterian-Hospital-Langone-232772741.html", "image": "http://media.nbcnewyork.com/images/1200*675/doctor-health-generic-1200-02.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Yorkers buying a health plan on the state's new insurance exchange should read the fine print if they're interested in getting care at some of the city's top hospitals.", "title": "Some NYC Hospitals Aren't Taking New Health Plans", "url": "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Affordable-Care-Act-Sloan-Kettering-New-York-Presbyterian-Hospital-Langone-232772741.html", "image": "http://media.nbcnewyork.com/images/1200*675/doctor-health-generic-1200-02.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcnewyork", "site": "@nbcnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 57055548682}, "keywords": "hospitals not accepting health exchanges, affordable care act, sloan kettering, langone, new york presbyterian", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCNewYork"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "hospitals not accepting health exchanges, affordable care act, sloan kettering, langone, new york presbyterian"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb701\"", "article_summary": "Other premier city hospitals are in the networks of just a few of the new plans.\nAs of this week, not one of the plans for sale on New York's health benefit exchange would cover treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, one of the world's largest and most respected cancer hospitals.\nThe hospital also chose not to work with insurers that wanted to include the hospital, but not its doctors, in its treatment networks.\nNew Yorkers buying a health plan on the state's new insurance exchange should read the fine print if they're interested in getting care at some of the city's top hospitals.\nSloan-Kettering spokeswoman Caitlin Suzanne Hoo said Wednesday that the hospital was still talking with insurers."}
