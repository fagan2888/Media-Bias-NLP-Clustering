Businesses violating the mandate are penalized $2,000 for each uninsured employee.\n\n\u201cCompany\u2019s that were right on the edge of hiring more employees have held back because they don\u2019t want to go over that magic fifty employee number\u2026.We\u2019re still coming out of the recession, we\u2019re doing very well. But you wonder how much better we could be doing now if people could hire large numbers without worrying about the implications,\u201d Hannon said.\n\nIn addition, Obamacare cuts the hours of part-time workers and creates a larger base of full-time employees who require health care coverage. Previously, up to 34 hours a week was considered part-time. Now, anyone racking \u201con average at least 30 hours of service per week\u201d will be characterized as a full-time worker.\n\nThe full economic impact of the Affordable Care Act on small businesses has yet to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Goodbye Bonnie\u2019s Tracks, Peppermint Flake and Blue Moon ice cream \u2014 after 75 years Bonnie Doon ice cream factory in Indiana is closing shop due primarily to Obamacare. .05/24/2016 4:57:20AM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Goodbye Bonnie\u2019s Tracks, Peppermint Flake and Blue Moon ice cream \u2014 after 75 years Bonnie Doon ice cream factory in Indiana is closing shop due primarily to Obamacare.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Decades-Old Ice Cream Plant Closes Because of Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2013/10/17/ice-cream-plant-closes-obamacare-to-blame-n1726435", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/10/17/12.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Goodbye Bonnie\u2019s Tracks, Peppermint Flake and Blue Moon ice cream \u2014 after 75 years Bonnie Doon ice cream factory in Indiana is closing shop due primarily to Obamacare.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Decades-Old Ice Cream Plant Closes Because of Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2013/10/17/ice-cream-plant-closes-obamacare-to-blame-n1726435", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2013/10/17/12.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Decades-Old Ice Cream Plant Closes Because of Obamacare, Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a91\"", "article_summary": "Goodbye Bonnie\u2019s Tracks, Peppermint Flake and Blue Moon ice cream \u2014 after 75 years the Bonnie Doon ice cream factory in Indiana is closing shop due primarily to Obamacare.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires \u201clarge employers\u201d with more than 50 full-time workers to provide health care coverage.\nThe company announced the declining economy and rising production costs as contributing to the decision; however, the encroaching implementation of the Affordable Care Act was the tipping point.\nThe full economic impact of the Affordable Care Act on small businesses has yet to be seen.\n\u201cWith the Obamacare it will just effect the business too much, so that was their main reason for shutting down the ice cream plant at this time.\u201dMany Indiana businesses fear the impending fiscal impact of Obamacare, Kyle Hannon, the Elkhart Chamber of Commerce president confirmed."}
