This year the event is a fundraiser for Roxie Johnson's group called Angels With A Dream. The charity got started three years ago after Johnson lost her husband to cancer.\n\n\"Bill just passed away about five years ago from cancer. He saw how the kids struggled with their treatments and stuff. It's a wish of his to make dreams come true for the kids,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson, the kitchen manager at the ski valley, initially hoped to raise just $500 for Make-A-Wish of South Dakota but has since helped bring in more than $29,000.\n\nAngels With A Dream has already granted wishes for three families and they've just received some good news. They'll be able to grant a wish for a fourth.\n\n\"Very emotional. It's really nice to meet these families to see what these people go through. The kids are amazing. They struggle really hard but they keep really good spirits,\" Johnson said.\n\nMoney raised has sent kids to Hawaii and Disney World. Angels With A Dream also helped build a sun porch for another family.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity to help some kids out and these kids would really appreciate it,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe race is scheduled for January 11 at Great Bear. Registration costs $10 with the proceeds going to Make-A-Wish.\n\nNews\n\nOutdoors {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
