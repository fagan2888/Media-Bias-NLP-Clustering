I\u2019ve written a bunch of them: about Madeira, artisan sake, restrained California Zinfandel, etc.\n\nBut do you ever read the other side \u2014 this wine is disappearing, and that\u2019s a good thing?\n\nWelcome to Rivesaltes.\n\nSweet, but no dessert\n\nBefore you say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about Rivesaltes\u201d and click away to see 5 Weird Tricks Make Your Hair Sexier, let me add that there\u2019s a larger story as well about sweetness in wine, and at what point in the day we want it.\n\nHere are a few numbers that don\u2019t seem to add up. A lot of frequent wine drinkers in the US say they \u201cstrongly prefer sweet wine,\u201d according to the Wine Market Council, including 40% of millenials, and 20% of baby boomers.\n\nYet dessert wine sales dropped 8% in 2012 and are about where they were five years ago, according to the Wine Institute. Table wine sales have grown 15% over the same period.\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t drinking as much dessert wine. What they are doing is drinking sweeter wines with dinner \u2014 hence the phenomenal growth for Muscat and blends like Apothic Red. Maybe you don\u2019t need dessert wine after that.\n\nBut Rivesaltes could get by without American sales; it was never a big deal here anyway. In France, though, it was a huge success, selling 70 million bottles every year in the mid-1900s, according to Jancis Robinson. Now, fewer than 3 million bottles are sold each year.\n\nGoing dry\n\nFrench society has changed, and here comes the zither. People don\u2019t drink wine with lunch anymore. Young French people drink more beer and spirits. Tough drunk-driving laws have devastated rural restaurants and eliminated that glass of dessert wine at the end. All true. Man, I just love that zither, makes me want to weep.\n\nThing is, and let me put this delicately so I don\u2019t offend anyone: Rivesaltes sucked.\n\nNo, let me rephrase that. Here\u2019s Jancis from the Oxford Companion to Wine: \u201cIf the overall quality (of Rivesaltes) is more varied that that of Banyuls or Maury, it is improving, largely thanks to the efforts of Domaine Cazes.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s so polite. I went with a group of journalists to Domaine Cazes, and Emmanuel Cazes was so uninterested in Rivesaltes that he didn\u2019t pour us any. He\u2019s using grapes that used to go into Rivesaltes to make dry wines, and that\u2019s going so well he\u2019s expanding.\n\nAnother Rivesaltes area winemaker, Olivier Pithon, says, \u201cThe problem with Rivesaltes is it\u2019s not very good. I want to make wine with personality.\u201d\n\nHis Domaine Olivier Pithon La D18, a biodynamic wine made from old Grenache Gris and Grenache Blanc vines that used to go into Rivesaltes, is outstanding: intense, fresh and stony, with a citrus pith character. We tried a taut 2011 and a delicious 2007 that shows how well it ages. Should we mourn the vineyard pulled from Rivesaltes production for this wine?\n\nLet\u2019s not just pick on Rivesaltes here. Jancis calls Banyuls its superior, writing, \u201cBanyuls and Banyuls Grand Cru are the appellations for France\u2019s finest and certainly most complex vins doux naturels\u201d in the Oxford Companion.\n\nGuess what? People aren\u2019t drinking Banyuls either.\n\n\u201cI travel all over the world and I pour people the Banyuls,\u201d says Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Deu of Domaine du Traginer. \u201cThey like the wine, but they don\u2019t buy it.\u201d\n\nEndings and new beginnings\n\nRobinson visited Collioure, the main town for producing Banyuls, last year and reported that there\u2019s only one working cellar left. Picturesque, seaside Collioure, with its old vineyards of Mourv\u00e8dre and Grenache and nobody local left to tend them. Cue the zither \u2026 but wait, there\u2019s tuba and alto sax!\n\nTurns out that the depressed prices for vineyards in Collioure has made them available for some of the young, ambitious winemakers in the nearby Rivesaltes region, except they don\u2019t call it Rivesaltes for dry wines, they call it Roussillon. Because Rivesaltes is disappearing, and we\u2019re not sorry.\n\nAnyway. In Collioure, instead of deliberately overripe, shriveled grapes going into barrels to meet up with grain alcohol, now we\u2019re seeing more of what the grapes can do when they\u2019re picked for dry wine. Cazes is expanding there, and taking the vineyards he buys biodynamic. Deu is making much more dry wine.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, this market shakeout for dessert wines, but it might get even more extreme in the future. While the Wine Institute reports 7.6% of all US wine sales are dessert wines, Wine.com says just 1.3% of its orders in 2013 were for dessert wines. The dessert wine market has farther to fall.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a winnowing, and Rivesaltes and Banyuls might not make the cut. But it\u2019s worth noting that wine technology has changed since the time when vintners in those regions decided sweet wines were the highest and best uses of their grapes. Viticulture is more precise. Refrigeration is widely available. Dry wines can be made there now that weren\u2019t possible even 30 years ago.\n\nYou want a parallel? It\u2019s like the rise of C\u00f4tes de Gascogne wines in the region where all the grapes used to go into Armagnac. Armagnac is still great, but it\u2019s possible to make delicious dry table wines there now in a way that wasn\u2019t before.\n\nMy favorite wines from my visit to C\u00f4tes du Roussillon were from Domaine Gardi\u00e9s. Jean Gardi\u00e9s is in love with Mourv\u00e8dre-based blends, and his La Torre C\u00f4tes du Roussillon Villages 2011 is terrific: potent, ripe red fruit with plenty of minerality, a meaty texture and a long finish. It\u2019s elegant and yet fruity, the kind of delicious organic wine we could use more of in the US, and I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it. I hope he gets ahold of one of these suddenly affordable old vineyards in Collioure, because I\u2019d like to taste what he can do with it.
