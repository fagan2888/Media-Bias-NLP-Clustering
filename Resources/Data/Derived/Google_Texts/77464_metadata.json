This puts Connecticut far ahead of where it projected it would be at this time.\n\nThe New Haven Health Department mission is to \u201cadvocate for and ensure the health and well-being of all New Haven residents,\u201d the release said. \u201cProviding residents with access to health insurance through the Access Health CT Navigator program helps them to meet that mission.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee a list of enrollment events here.\n\n\u201cHealthcare coverage is something I encourage all New Haven residents to consider \u2013 made so much easier now by the Affordable Care Act \u2013 because it not only helps residents stay prepared for medical emergencies, it promotes better overall health through preventative care and early diagnoses of problems,\u201d Mayor Toni N. Harp said, also in the release. \u201cHealthier residents, by definition, also place a reduced burden on our local healthcare delivery system, reducing the overall cost of healthcare in our city.\u201d\n\nThe city Health Department is one of six Navigator organizations in Connecticut, and more than 160 health, community and faith-based organizations across Connecticut that partnered with Access Health CT through the Navigator and Assister Outreach Program, the release said.\n\nPaul Kowalski, acting director of the New Haven Health Department, said, \u201cWith the support of our community partners and Assisters, we are hosting enrollment fairs in New Haven County nearly every day through the end of Open Enrollment on March 31st. There are many opportunities for individuals who need insurance to enroll right in their community, where they live, work, go to school and where they pray. \u201d\n\nA list of in-person assisters is available online at http://www.accesshealthct.com/ and clicking on the \u201cGet Help\u201d tab.\n\nFor a list of events and Assisters in this region, contact Elizabeth Hilton at (203) 533-2610 or visit http://ahctcommunity.org/news-and-events/events/\n\nOpen enrollment continues until March 31.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "New Haven partners with Access Health CT to help residents sign up for health insurance", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140307/new-haven-partners-with-access-health-ct-to-help-residents-sign-up-for-health-insurance", "image": {"width": "488px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20140307/NEWS/140309400/AR/0/AR-140309400.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "323px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New Haven partners with Access Health CT to help residents sign up for health insurance"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> The city Health Department, and Hill Health Center have kicked off a partnership  with Access Health CT to promot", "title": "New Haven partners with Access Health CT to help residents sign up for health insurance", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140307/new-haven-partners-with-access-health-ct-to-help-residents-sign-up-for-health-insurance", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20140307/NEWS/140309400/AR/0/AR-140309400.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> The city Health Department, and Hill Health Center have kicked off a partnership  with Access Health CT to promot"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8c6\"", "article_summary": "The New Haven Health Department mission is to \u201cadvocate for and ensure the health and well-being of all New Haven residents,\u201d the release said.\n\u201cProviding residents with access to health insurance through the Access Health CT Navigator program helps them to meet that mission.\u201dAdvertisementSee a list of enrollment events here.\nNEW HAVEN >> The city Health Department, and Hill Health Center have kicked off a partnership with Access Health CT to promote the \u201cBecause I Got Covered\u2026\u201d campaign to help residents enroll in health care coverage, officials said in a release.\nBy mid-February, 121,983 people had signed up for health insurance through Access with 50,665, or some 41.5 percent, enrolled in private insurance plans and the rest in Medicaid.\nPaul Kowalski, acting director of the New Haven Health Department, said, \u201cWith the support of our community partners and Assisters, we are hosting enrollment fairs in New Haven County nearly every day through the end of Open Enrollment on March 31st."}
