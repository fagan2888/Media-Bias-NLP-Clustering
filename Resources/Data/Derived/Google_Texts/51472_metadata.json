And women\u2019s issues here in Iowa are that we have a strong economy. We have jobs that our sons and daughters can go off to someday. We have a great educational system. And women want strong national defense. We want to know that our families are going to be safe.\u201d But those aren\u2019t \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d\u2014in Iowa or in the rest of the country.\n\nIt may sound like Ernst is referencing polling results, but it appears there hasn\u2019t been any recent formal polling on which issues are most important to Iowan women. Nor does Ernst perform particularly well with them: In her winning 2014 Senate campaign, she only managed to split female voters with Democratic candidate Bruce Braley; that's likely because the economy and health care eclipsed what are normally wedge issues, like abortion or gay marriage.\n\nBut if female voters in Iowa are anything like those in the rest of the country\u2014and Iowa is a swing state, after all\u2014then Ernst is off the mark on what's most important to them.\n\n\n\nLeading up to the 2012 election, Gallup asked female registered voters in 12 swing states, \"What do you think is the most important issue for women in this election?\u201d Thirty-nine percent said abortion (without specifying support or opposition). Jobs and health care ranked second and third, with 19 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The economy and \u201cequal rights/pay/opportunity\u201d ranked fourth (16 percent) and fifth (15 percent). Male registered voters, on the other hand, ranked jobs and the economy as men\u2019s top two issues.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "On Sunday, Senator Joni Ernst appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union and, predictably, took a moment to scrutinize Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be a woman,\u201d said Ernst. \u201cYou have to care about women\u2019s issues.
