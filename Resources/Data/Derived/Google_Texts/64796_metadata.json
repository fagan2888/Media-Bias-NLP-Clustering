After years as a cult-figure road warrior (and, for a brief stint, the co-songwriter foil to Jack White in the much-more-popular-than-cult-figure band The Raconteurs), Benson\u2019s settled into something resembling mid-career maturity.\n\nInstead of using South By to promote his most recent record (2013\u2019s typically excellent \u201cYou Were Right\u201d), he\u2019s here instead as a label president; his imprint, Readymade Records, which he co-runs with his manager, Emily White showcased over the weekend, and \u2013 other than a brief sit-in with Readymade artist Leah Mason, he\u2019s here overseeing, rather than rocking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of strange,\u201d he says, in between smokes and sips of water. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, though. It\u2019s nice not to have that stress of having to play.\u201d\n\nBenson\u2019s a road-warrior, so it\u2019s hard to imagine him sitting still for too long \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what he says his plans are. After years of picking up and putting down in Detroit, San Francisco, and elsewhere, he\u2019s positioned himself permanently in Nashville, where in addition to the label president stuff, he\u2019s producing bands out of a studio and getting used to family life. \u201cI have kids now, and I don\u2019t want to miss out on their upbringing. I\u2019m kind of older now,\u201d he says. \u201c[Touring] is not comfortable.\u201d\n\nThankfully, the label-head role seems to suit him: he\u2019s visibly glowing while talking about what he sees the imprint achieving \u2013 and what it\u2019s already achieved. His model is the early days of Ian MacKaye\u2019s Dischord Records \u2013 playing the part of tastemaker as well as artist, and signing bands (like the bluegrassy Howlin\u2019 Brothers, whose sophomore Readymade release drops this April) that he personally connects to, rather than following the sales. That said, he acknowledges that the business end of it wasn\u2019t something he saw coming \u2013 and has become a large part of his responsibilities.\n\n\u201cI thought of [starting a label] as more of the fun of it \u2013 but, you know, these people [on the label] are trying to make a go at it. It\u2019s their living. You kind of have to know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo [White] is the business side of things. And I do the creative stuff.\u201d\n\nFor him, though, that\u2019s not going to include a major promotional push for his own record at any point in the near future. \u201cSince I started the label, I have been going through this transition, and it\u2019s almost like an identity crisis \u2013 like leaving my solo career a bit. I\u2019m still going to make records,\u201d he says, \u201cbut not at the intensity at which I was doing it. I have been asking myself, \u201cWhat\u2019s my role in the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a dad,\u201d he answers. \u201cThat\u2019s the best one. And I\u2019m a producer. I\u2019m really enjoying that. I\u2019m good at it, and it\u2019s a lot more fulfilling. I fed my ego enough with my solo career that now it\u2019s cooler to be more behind the scenes and helping other bands. And I like to be around these younger artists. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, that means the Raconteurs are indefinitely on hold, as well. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of off the table,\u201d he says, of the supergroup reuniting. \u201cIt always felt spontaneous. I liked that about it, too. And I think it remains that way. We never planned anything. We never planned a breakup. All of us but one live in the same town, so [in the future] it could very well happen\u2026 or not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Instead of using South By to promote his most recent record (2013\u2019s typically excellent \u201cYou Were Right\u201d), Benson\u2019s here instead as a label president; his imprint, Readymade Records, which he co-runs with his manager, Emily White showcased over the weekend, and \u2013 other than a brief sit-in with Readymade artist Leah Mason, he\u2019s here overseeing, rather than rocking.", "title": "SXSW: Brendan Benson Comfy as Label Head, Says Raconteurs Comeback's 'Off the Table'", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5937566/sxsw-brendan-benson-comfy-as-label-head-says-raconteurs-comebacks-off", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/brendan-benson-2014-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Instead of using South By to promote his most recent record (2013\u2019s typically excellent \u201cYou Were Right\u201d), Benson\u2019s here instead as a label president; his imprint, Readymade Records, which he co-runs with his manager, Emily White showcased over the weekend, and \u2013 other than a brief sit-in with Readymade artist Leah Mason, he\u2019s here overseeing, rather than rocking.", "title": "SXSW: Brendan Benson Comfy as Label Head, Says Raconteurs Comeback's 'Off the Table'", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5937566/sxsw-brendan-benson-comfy-as-label-head-says-raconteurs-comebacks-off", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/brendan-benson-2014-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Instead of using South By to promote his most recent record (2013\u2019s typically excellent \u201cYou Were Right\u201d), Benson\u2019s here instead as a label president; his imprint, Readymade Records, which he co-runs with his manager, Emily White showcased over the weekend, and \u2013 other than a brief sit-in with Readymade artist Leah Mason, he\u2019s here overseeing, rather than rocking.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "SXSW: Brendan Benson Comfy as Label Head, Says Raconteurs Comeback's 'Off the Table' | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfec7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of off the table,\u201d he says, of the supergroup reuniting.\nI\u2019m kind of older now,\u201d he says.\n43-year-old singer/songwriter Brendan Benson looks relaxed as he sits on the patio outside his hotel restaurant during SXSW, and who can blame him?\nI\u2019m still going to make records,\u201d he says, \u201cbut not at the intensity at which I was doing it.\nAll of us but one live in the same town, so [in the future] it could very well happen\u2026 or not.\u201d"}
