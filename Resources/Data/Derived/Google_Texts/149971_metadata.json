This is futile even by the standards of futile campaigns launched by columnists, given the obvious fact that Republicans do not want my help and have good reason to mistrust my motives, and that if anyone in the GOP leadership actually read my advice, they would immediately do the opposite.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that I feel some fervent nostalgia for the good old days of moderate Republicanism, although it\u2019s true that the Nixon-era GOP was only microscopically to the right of today\u2019s Democratic Party on most major policy questions \u2013 and decidedly to its left on healthcare and social spending. (Which United States president actually proposed a nationwide, single-payer healthcare system? Well, I\u2019ve already given you the answer.) Go back to Dwight Eisenhower, who presided over a more progressive and redistributive tax code than anything seen before or since, and sent federal troops to desegregate the schools in Little Rock, and in relative terms it looks like Lenin and Trotsky trying to out-radical each other. (The top marginal tax rate on the wealthiest Americans in 1960 was 91 percent. Just try to convince your Fox News uncle of that one.)\n\nAll of that is amazing and incomprehensible today, as is the fact that the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate was a Republican (Edward Brooke, in 1966), and so was the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress (Margaret Chase Smith, elected to the House in 1940 and the Senate in 1948). But the real point lies a little deeper. It isn\u2019t so much that the old Republicans were awesome, but at least they existed in the real world and practiced real politics. They had vigorous internal debates about numerous issues and represented a broad coalition of interests, holding to a reasonably coherent ideology of limited government, social order and support for business.\n\nThose words are still used, of course; they are closely identified with the Republican brand. But thanks to the Matrix-like magic of our altered political reality, they do not mean what they used to mean. \u201cBusiness\u201d refers only to the infinitesimal ruling caste of multinational capital. \u201cLimited government\u201d means a limitless, borderless police state with low internal taxes and little or no social safety net. \u201cSocial order\u201d means the stealth revocation of citizenship rights, first for blacks and women, to be sure, but ultimately for everyone else too.\n\nThere is no silver lining to the fact that one of our nation\u2019s two political parties has disappeared into a self-concocted ideological fog of delusion and denial that has cut it off from political reality, American history, basic economic facts, international law and even its own past. The evil zombie sock-puppet condition of the GOP is the most gruesome single symptom of our failing democracy, and one that has inflicted immense harm not just on our country but the entire world. It didn\u2019t happen by accident.\n\nI would contend that the Republican Party has been the subject, willing or otherwise, of a version of the Stanford prison experiment, conducted on a grand scale. I wrote about that famous 1971 simulation, now the subject of a new feature film, earlier this week: A group of normal, middle-class California college students eagerly embraced roles as sadistic guards and abused prisoners, submitting almost immediately to the social order of an entirely fictional institution they knew had no real power. Properly understood, the Stanford experiment is not about prisons or schools or other overtly coercive social institutions, although it certainly applies to them. It is about the power of ideology and the power of power, about the fact that if you change people\u2019s perception of reality, you have gone most of the way to changing reality itself.\n\nThe Republican Party did not organically evolve into a xenophobic, all-white party of hate that seeks to roll back not just the Civil Rights movement and feminism, but the entire Enlightenment. It did not accidentally become untethered from reality and float off to the moons of Pluto. Those possibilities were already present, but they had to be activated. Partly as a result of its own ideological weakness and internal divisions, the GOP was taken over from within and from above: In the first instance, by a dedicated core of right-wing activists, and in the second by the ultra-rich, super-PAC oligarchy epitomized by the Koch brothers. The two forces sometimes worked separately, but ultimately the first was funded and sponsored by the second.\n\nOne key element of this ideological conquest was that the party\u2019s understanding of itself and its place in American politics and American history was reshaped to conform to a fictional narrative that is now widely believed to be true. Ultimately the Republican prison experiment has replicated itself on an even larger scale, remaking not just the GOP but American political reality.\n\nAmong other things, the GOP\u2019s flight to Crazytown has permitted leaders of the Democratic Party to crawl ever more cozily into the pockets of Wall Street bankers and to become ever more intertwined with the national security state \u2014 while still proclaiming themselves, in all innocence and with considerable plausibility, to be less noxious than the alternative. So we see millions of well-meaning people getting ginned up to vote for Hillary Clinton, despite the nagging sensation that the political universe in which she represents the best available option is a cruel hoax. Pay attention to that feeling! It\u2019s the reality we have discarded, banging on the door.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the re-engineered Republican Party, with its counterfactual and frequently contradictory worldview, appeals most strongly to a shrinking minority of Americans, most of them white and male and rural or Southern. But despite that, or in some sense because of that, it has been an enormous success. Not only has the zombie GOP driven the Democrats much further to the right that at any point in their history, it has paralyzed the legislative process, driven electoral participation to historic lows and turned the deep American current of political apathy and mistrust into a majority sentiment. Whether or not the Republican prison experiment was consciously intended to produce a period of oligarchic rule in which political parties and elections become increasingly irrelevant and increasingly ignored, that has definitely been the outcome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How a stodgy, mainstream party was reinvented as a den of lunatics and monsters -- and why it was no accident", "title": "The Republican prison experiment: How the right-wing conquest of the GOP altered political reality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How a stodgy, mainstream party was reinvented as a den of lunatics and monsters -- and why it was no accident", "title": "The Republican prison experiment: How the right-wing conquest of the GOP altered political reality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/18/the_republican_prison_experiment_how_the_right_wing_remaking_of_the_gop_altered_political_reality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/cruz_reagan_prison.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How a stodgy, mainstream party was reinvented as a den of lunatics and monsters -- and why it was no accident", "title": "The Republican prison experiment: How the right-wing conquest of the GOP altered political reality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/cruz_reagan_prison.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Charles Koch, David Koch, Democratic Party, Democrats, Editor's Picks, Future of GOP, GOP, Koch Brothers, Politics, Republican Party, Republicans, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Ted Cruz, The Stanford Prison Experiment, U.S. Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Ultimately the Republican prison experiment has replicated itself on an even larger scale, remaking not just the GOP but American political reality.\nBut thanks to the Matrix-like magic of our altered political reality, they do not mean what they used to mean.\nPolitics, Politics NewsEvery so often I conceive the bizarre desire to help save the Republican Party from itself.\nTopics: Charles Koch, David Koch, Democratic Party, Democrats, Editor's Picks, Future of GOP, GOP, Koch Brothers, Politics, Republican Party, Republicans, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Ted Cruz, The Stanford Prison Experiment, U.S.\nIt isn\u2019t so much that the old Republicans were awesome, but at least they existed in the real world and practiced real politics."}
