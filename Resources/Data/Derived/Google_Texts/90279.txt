The House rejected an amendment Thursday that would have allowed religious employers to be exempt from a mandate that long-acting contraceptives be covered under health insurance.

Rep. Janssen Willhoit, R-St. Johnsbury, proposed the amendment ahead of the final reading of H.620, a bill that codifies provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act.

Willhoit’s amendment would have required insurers in Vermont to offer a plan that does not cover contraceptives. The House voted it down, 107 to 33.

Some supporters of the amendment argued on the floor that it would respect religious freedom.

“We should not be forcing religious organizations to buy something for their employees that violates their conscience and their religious tenets,” said Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield.

Opponents expressed concerns that the amendment would interfere with coverage of the use of contraceptives for medical procedures, as well as concerns about constitutional implications and women’s rights.

“I think what may be occurring here is some confusion between personal rights and religious rights, and I don’t believe that there is anything in the bill that would require a religious person to violate his or her own personal beliefs,” said Rep. James Masland, D-Thetford Center.

After the amendment was voted down, the House passed the bill on a voice vote. It now moves to the Senate.
