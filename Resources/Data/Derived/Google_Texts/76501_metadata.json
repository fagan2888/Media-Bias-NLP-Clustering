I think they do a great job.\"\n\nAt 1,000 square feet, the Basemar Whole Pets doesn't have the room yet for a dog wash, but carries a similar assortment of food, toys and supplies, said Kuzdek, who partnered on the Basemar store with Lleane Grimditch .\n\n\"Honestly, it's just a smaller version of our Pearl Street store,\" she said, noting the 3,600-square-foot store at 2835 Pearl St. \"We really haven't done anything different. If there's a chance for us to expand, then we'll expand and put in a dog wash.\"\n\nThe new store's arrival came on the heels of Whole Pets shedding its Broomfield location. Kuzdek sold the location to a local resident who converted the shop at 8855 W. 116th Circle to an Urban Dogg holistic pet supply store.\n\n\"I really wanted to concentrate on Boulder,\" Kuzdek said. \"It made sense because we really wanted to concentrate on south Boulder, and Broomfield was a little far away to be convenient.\"\n\nThe Broomfield location opened in 2011.\n\n\"I feel like south Boulder, it's almost a city unto its own,\" she said. \"I think people down there are looking for more retail to become available to them. I think there's a whole new crop of animal guardians down there that this would be a lot more convenient for them to come to.\"\n\nWhole Pets' expansion is occurring at a time when the natural pet food industry is booming. In recent years, sales in the roughly $2 billion industry saw double-digit percentage gains.\n\nMarket research firm Packaged Facts has estimated that the natural pet products industry could record $9.4 billion in sales in 2017.\n\nAfter seeing flat sales during the recession, Whole Pets has seen a return in spending in recent years, Kuzdek said.\n\n\"We're a utilitarian store,\" she said. \"It's like grocery, you still have to feed your pets,\" she said.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26528024/whole-pets-opens-second-boulder-location", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace ,  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26528024:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-14T14:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "When the first Whole Pets opened in central Boulder in 2001, the natural pet food and supplies store found a fitting neighbor in Whole Foods.", "title": "Whole Pets opens second Boulder location", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26528024/whole-pets-opens-second-boulder-location", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-09-17T14:27:19-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-13T13:18:05-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Alicia Wallace,", "pubDate": "2014-09-13T13:22:19-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-14T14:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Whole Pets opens second Boulder location", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "description": "When the first Whole Pets opened in central Boulder in 2001, the natural pet food and supplies store found a fitting neighbor in Whole Foods.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26528024/whole-pets-opens-second-boulder-location", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "When the first Whole Pets opened in central Boulder in 2001, the natural pet food and supplies store found a fitting neighbor in Whole Foods.", "title": "Whole Pets opens second Boulder location"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "\"I always said that Whole Pets is Whole Foods for pets,\" said Carol Kuzdek, Whole Pets founder.\nSo when Whole Pets recently moved forward on a second location, the Boulder-based retailer stuck with what worked.\nWhole Pets' expansion is occurring at a time when the natural pet food industry is booming.\nMarket research firm Packaged Facts has estimated that the natural pet products industry could record $9.4 billion in sales in 2017.\nFood, toys, supplies, and perhaps someday a dog washWhen the first Whole Pets opened in central Boulder in 2001, the natural pet food and supplies store found a fitting neighbor in Whole Foods."}
