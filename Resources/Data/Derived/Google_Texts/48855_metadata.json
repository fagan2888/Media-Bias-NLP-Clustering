It is the largest land seizure since August 2014.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon denounced the move and Palestinian officials said they would push for a resolution at the United Nations against Israel's settlement policies.\n\n\"Settlement activities are a violation of international law and run counter to the public pronouncements of the government of Israel supporting a two-state solution to the conflict,\" Ban said in a statement.\n\nThe land, in an area fully under Israeli civilian and military control and already used by Jewish settlers to farm dates, is situated near the northern tip of the Dead Sea.\n\nPalestinian officials denounced the seizure.\n\n\"Israel is stealing land specially in the Jordan Valley under the pretext it wants to annex it,\" Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Reuters. \"This should be a reason for a real and effective intervention by the international community to end such a flagrant and grave aggression which kills all chances of peace.\"\n\nThe United States, whose ambassador angered Israel this week with criticism of its West Bank policy, said it was strongly opposed to any moves that accelerate settlement expansion.\n\n\"We believe they're fundamentally incompatible with a two-state solution and call into question, frankly, the Israeli government's commitment to a two-state solution,\" Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner said on Wednesday.\n\nIn a development likely to further upset Europe, Israeli forces demolished six structures in the West Bank funded by the EU's humanitarian arm. The structures were dwellings and latrines for Bedouins living in an area known as E1 - a particularly sensitive zone between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea.\n\nIsrael has not built settlements in E1, with construction considered a \"red line\" by the United States and the EU. It could potentially split the West Bank, cutting Palestinians off from East Jerusalem, which they seek for their capital.\n\n\"This is the third time they demolished my house and every time I rebuilt it, this time also I will rebuild it and I am not leaving here. If we leave they will turn the place into a closed military zone,\" said Saleem Jahaleen, whose home was razed.\n\nRISING TENSION\n\nIsraeli officals did not respond to requests for comment on the demolitions. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week the EU was building illegally in the area.\n\n\"They're building without authorization, against the accepted rules, and there\u2019s a clear attempt to create political realities,\" he told the foreign media.\n\nNetanyahu was scheduled to address the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. He met U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry there but it was not clear if the issue was raised.\n\nThe Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.\n\nThere are now about 550,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem combined, according to Israeli government and think-tank statistics. About 350,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem and 2.7 million in West Bank.\n\nIsrael is hoping that in any final agreement with the Palestinians it will be able to keep large settlement blocs including in the Jordan Valley, both for security and agricultural purposes. The Palestinians are adamantly opposed.\n\nThe last round of peace talks broke down in April 2014 and Israeli-Palestinian violence has surged in recent months.\n\nSince the start of October, Palestinian stabbings, car-rammings and shootings have killed 25 Israelis and a U.S. citizen. In the same period, at least 148 Palestinians have been killed, 94 of whom Israel has described as assailants.\n\nIsraeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said on Thursday he had revoked the residency rights of four Jerusalem Palestinians involved in two fatal attacks on Israelis, one in September and one in October, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe measure, described as rare, was meant to deter others from carrying out attacks, Deri said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Maayan Lubell, Luke Baker, Ali Sawafta; Nidal al-Mughrabi; editing by Luke Baker and Angus MacSwan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel confirmed on Thursday it was planning to appropriate a la", "title": "Israel says will seize West Bank land; demolishes EU structures", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/21/Israel-confirms-it-plans-seize-West-Bank-land", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/israel-palestinians_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/21/Israel-confirms-it-plans-seize-West-Bank-land", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/israel-palestinians_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel confirmed on Thursday it was planning to appropriate a la", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In a development likely to further upset Europe, Israeli forces demolished six structures in the West Bank funded by the EU's humanitarian arm.\nIt could potentially split the West Bank, cutting Palestinians off from East Jerusalem, which they seek for their capital.\nThere are now about 550,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem combined, according to Israeli government and think-tank statistics.\nThe Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.\nAbout 350,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem and 2.7 million in West Bank."}
