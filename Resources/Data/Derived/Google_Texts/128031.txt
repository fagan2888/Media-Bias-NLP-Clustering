It was only a matter of time.

Comedian Kate McKinnon mocked Justin Bieber on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend for the singer’s appearance in a new Calvin Klein Jeans advertisement.

McKinnon played Bieber in a parody commercial while his co-star in the original Calvin Klein ad — model Lara Stone — was mocked by comedian Cecily Strong.

The new ad features “Bieber” playing basketball, eating popsicles and frolicking around in his XXS underwear.
