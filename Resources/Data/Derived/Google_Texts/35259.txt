Representatives from California American Water, the agency that represents Newbury Park, will visit 8,000 homes starting Saturday to offer water-saving tips to its customers.

During the three-week Walk and Talks campaign, representatives will offer free water nozzles and provide information on turf and appliance rebates. Under state mandate, the water district is required to reduce usage by 32 percent.

“We believe talking with customers at their homes — about water use, rebates and related topics — will help us achieve our conservation goals,” said Garry Hofer, Southern California director of operations, in a statement.
