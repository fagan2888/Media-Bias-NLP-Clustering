As shoppers fill stores on Black Friday, the executive director for Wesley House Community Center hopes that shoppers remember children who are less fortunate for Christmas. Ginger Grissom says this year hundreds of local children are depending on others from the community for Christmas.

"'We've got 600 children that need to be adopted out that are in foster care presently," says Grissom, "and they're the children that are the special needs children a lot of them, and they are not in their family."

With donations down for most charities nationwide this year, Grissom is hopeful that the holiday spirit will motivate locals to give.

"As you think about the money in our area, how there is so little it seems, but if everybody gives just a little bit and buys a baseball; buys a basketball; buys a bike if you can."

Along with providing toys for children who are in foster care, Wesley House will also help a number of other families for Christmas.

"You've got the families that are working, but they don't have enough left over for the Christmas holidays to help their children, and then you've got the families that don't expect to get anything, but the children do."

Wesley House is accepting: monetary, food, clothing and toy donations. The agency is located at 1520 on 8th Avenue in Meridian.
