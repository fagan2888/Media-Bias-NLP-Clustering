And like other jails, it is awash in a tide of booking and releases that make it particularly unsuited for the task.\n\nU.S. jails, most of whose 731,000 inmates are trying to make bail or awaiting trial, hold roughly half the number in prisons. But last year, jails booked in 11.7 million people \u2014 19 times the number of new prison inmates. The revolving door complicates the task of screening for mental illness, managing medications, providing care and ensuring inmate safety.\n\n\u201cJails are churning people,\u201d says Henry J. Steadman, a consultant to government agencies on how courts and correctional facilities deal with people with mental illnesses.\n\nExperts have pointed to rising numbers of inmates with mental illnesses since the 1970s, after states began closing psychiatric hospitals without following through on promises to create and sustain comprehensive community treatment programs.\n\nBut as the number of those with serious mental illnesses surpasses 20 percent in some jails, many have struggled to keep up, sometimes putting inmates in jeopardy.\n\nThe Associated Press has reported that at least nine of the 11 suicides in New York City jails over the past five years came after operators failed to follow safeguards designed to prevent self-harm by inmates. The AP\u2019s investigation into the deaths of two mentally ill inmates at the city\u2019s Rikers Island complex \u2014 one who essentially baked to death in a 101-degree cell in February and the other who sexually mutilated himself last fall \u2014 have prompted promises of reform.\n\nFederal law protects the rights of people in jails and other institutions. But in temporary holding facilities, dealing with serious, long-term mental illnesses requires operators to rethink what they do, Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re given a court order by a judge to hold this person in the jail until you\u2019re told not to,\u201d Dart says. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to do anything other than feed him, give them a bed, make sure they don\u2019t harm anyone else or themselves. \u2026 You\u2019re not in there trying to cure people.\u201d\n\nMany jails are dealing with similar dynamics, with sometimes disturbing results.\n\n\u2014In June, federal officials cited \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions for mentally ill inmates in the Los Angeles County jails as partly to blame for 15 suicides in 30 months. The L.A. system, the country\u2019s largest with 19,000 inmates, has been under federal supervision since 2002, but still fails to adequately supervise inmates \u201cwith clearly demonstrated needs,\u201d the Justice Department concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US jails struggle with role as makeshift asylums", "author": "Adam Geller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US jails struggle with role as makeshift asylums", "title": "US jails struggle with role as makeshift asylums", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/14/us_jails_struggle_with_role_as_makeshift_asylums/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/jailed-and-mentally-ill.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US jails struggle with role as makeshift asylums", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/jailed-and-mentally-ill.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "US jails struggle with role as makeshift asylums", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "US jails struggle with role as makeshift asylums", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1b6\"", "article_summary": "\u2014In June, federal officials cited \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions for mentally ill inmates in the Los Angeles County jails as partly to blame for 15 suicides in 30 months.\n\u201cJails are churning people,\u201d says Henry J.
