Jones (5-7, 185), redshirt freshman Phillip Lindsay (5-8, 175) and sophomore Michael Adkins II (5-10, 195) rely more on their speed.\n\nA successful running game by the Buffs would open up more options for CU quarterback Sefo Liufau against Oregon State (3-1, 0-1). The absence of Powell makes that goal more challenging.\n\nThe weather appears almost perfect for football \u2014 sunny skies with the high temperature expected to be in the low 70s.\n\nOregon State is making its first visit to Folsom Field since 1988, when Colorado was a member of the Big Eight Conference. This is CU\u2019s fourth season in the Pac-12.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffaloes hope to get running game in gear vs. Oregon State", "title": "CU Buffaloes hope to get running game in gear vs. Oregon State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/04/cu-buffaloes-hope-to-get-running-game-in-gear-vs-oregon-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141004_122645_phillip-lindsay.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141004_122645_phillip-lindsay.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-04T12:28:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:20:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde709\"", "article_summary": "A successful running game by the Buffs would open up more options for CU quarterback Sefo Liufau against Oregon State (3-1, 0-1).\nOregon State is making its first visit to Folsom Field since 1988, when Colorado was a member of the Big Eight Conference.\nBOULDER \u2014 In an effort to supply balance to the offense, Colorado would like to get its running game in gear Saturday afternoon against Oregon State (2 p.m., Pac-12 Network).\nLIVE GAMETRACKER: Colorado vs. Oregon State, 2 p.m.CU junior running back Christian Powell is designated by the school as \u201cout indefinitely\u201d with concussion symptoms, according to pregame media materials.\nPowell has netted 274 yards through five games, almost 100 yards more than CU\u2019s second-leading rusher, senior Tony Jones (175)."}
