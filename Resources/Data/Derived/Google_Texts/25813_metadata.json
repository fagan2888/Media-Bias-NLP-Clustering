Amos Cancer Center.\n\n[Also: Running list of notable 2015 healthcare frauds]\n\nPippas will pay Georgia and the United States $425,000 to settle allegations that he received improper salary and medical directorship payments from Columbia Regional Hospital System resulting in the illegal submission of claims by the hospital to Medicare and Medicaid, according to the Attorney General's Office.\n\nThe case began with a lawsuit filed in May 2012 by whistleblower Richard Barker, who joined the cancer center in 2011 as administrative director.\n\nThe civil settlement resolves the lawsuit, and makes no determination of liability.\n\nThe agreement involves Columbus Regional Hospital System, The Medical Center, including the John B. Amos Cancer Center, Columbus Regional Oncology Treatment Center, and Regional Oncology, LLC. The defendants have agreed to pay Georgia and the United States $25 million and may pay another $10 million contingent upon certain financial conditions, according to the AG's Office.\n\nIn addition, on Sept. 5, another large nonprofit provider in Columbus, Georgia, St. Francis Hospital, was told it had to repay the federal government $21.4 million, according to a published source. This was after St. Francis said it could not account for about $30 million on its financial books, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution referring to a story published in the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nA federal audit said St. Francis Hospital management did not comply with regulations and a regulatory agreement connected to the financing of its $252 million expansion and campus renovation, completed in 2013, the Ledger-Enquirer reported.\n\nOriginally terming the $30 million financial hole an \"accounting inaccuracy,\" St. Francis disclosed that its finance chief had been \"permanently relieved of his duties'' in November, according to the AJC. CEO Robert Granger resigned in early March, the source stated.\n\nThe financial issue is not expected to derail a potential acquisition by Tennessee-based LifePoint Health, according to AJC. The organizations have entered into a non-binding letter of intent, according to information published Aug. 4 on LifePoint's website.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/georgias-columbus-regional-hospital-system-pay-25-million-settle-kickback-charges", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/columbus-regional-hospital-crh.org-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Columbus Regional Hospital System in Georgia has agreed to pay the state and federal governments $25 million, and potentially another $10 million, to resolve allegations that it overbilled Medicare and paid kickbacks to a medical director for referrals, according to Georgia Attorney General Sam", "title": "Georgia's Columbus Regional Hospital System to pay $25 million to settle kickback charges"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/columbus-regional-hospital-crh.org-feature.jpg"}, "description": "The Columbus Regional Hospital System in Georgia has agreed to pay the state and federal governments $25 million, and potentially another $10 million, to resolve allegations that it overbilled Medicare and paid kickbacks to a medical director for referrals, according to Georgia Attorney General Sam", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Georgia's Columbus Regional Hospital System to pay $25 million to settle kickback charges"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Columbus Regional Hospital System in Georgia has agreed to pay the state and federal governments $25 million, and potentially another $10 million, to resolve allegations that it overbilled Medicare and paid kickbacks to a medical director for referrals, according to Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens in a Sept. 4 announcement.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The agreement involves Columbus Regional Hospital System, The Medical Center, including the John B.
