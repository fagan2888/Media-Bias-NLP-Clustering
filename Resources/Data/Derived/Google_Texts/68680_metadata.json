Subban and others for 18th among NHL defensemen. The comparison should end there, because Subban and others can\u2019t compete with Holden\u2019s relatively paltry, by NHL standards, $600,000 salary, or that he played in only 54 games.\n\nSubban, who this season will make $9 million, played in all 82 games. The only defenseman in the league to score as many goals in fewer games as Holden a season ago was Pittsburgh\u2019s Kris Letang, who will make $7.25 million this season.\n\nHolden is one of the NHL\u2019s premier bargains. But he and Avalanche coach Patrick Roy prefer that you don\u2019t call him that.\n\n\u201cThese are great stories. Honestly, these are great stories,\u201d Roy said of Holden, undrafted and generally unwanted until cracking the Avs\u2019 lineup last season. \u201cI never look at the pay. I look at what the player brings to the team, and I\u2019m very, very impressed with Nick. Last year he came into camp and he was supposed to be a (regular-season) call-up, and not only is he not a call-up, he\u2019s probably going to be a top-four D for us.\u201d\n\nHolden, 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds, is again playing with dynamic playmaker Tyson Barrie on the second line, behind Erik Johnson and Brad Stuart. In regular-season and playoff goal scoring last season, Holden tied Barrie with a team-high 13 goals among defensemen, with three coming in the postseason.\n\nHolden signed a three-year, $4.95 million extension midway through the season, at a $1.65 million annual salary cap hit.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly a bargain at what he\u2019s at now, but even the extension he signed is going to be a bargain too,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s part of our core D and he scored 10 goals last year, which is like scoring 20 for a forward.\u201d\n\nHolden, 27, doesn\u2019t want to jinx his unofficial rookie NHL year with the Avs; he entered the season with just seven games under his belt, all with Columbus.\n\nHe was a healthy scratch the first 11 games of last season and played Game 12 as an emergency forward. He became a fixture among the D-corps, playing in all situations including the left point on the power play.\n\n\u201cLast year I had a good opportunity in the last three quarters of the year and I did well with it, but until I can prove myself consistently on a year-by-year basis, I don\u2019t see how you can say I\u2019m a bargain guy yet,\u201d he said. \u201d I think the best players, the biggest thing they bring is consistency. I don\u2019t think you can judge a player off one season, or in my case, three quarters of a season.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI want to be the same player I was last year, but I want to push myself. I don\u2019t want to be stagnant, or the same. I want to make a bigger difference. \u2026 I\u2019m stronger this year, and I feel like I can make a bigger impact.\u201d\n\nBarrie, 23, said he enjoys playing with Holden because he\u2019s good in all areas of the ice, all situations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the size and all the tools. He can play power play, penalty kill,\u201d Barrie said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bizarre that he didn\u2019t get drafted or play elsewhere much. He looks like a proven NHL defenseman, and he\u2019s a big part of the team.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nPrice is right\n\nNick Holden of the Avs is one of the NHL\u2019s best bargains at $600,000. Denver Post hockey reporter Mike Chambers lists five other top bargains in the league:\n\nPatrick Maroon, F, Ducks, $575,000\n\nHe\u2019s a first-line left wing on a Western Conference power. Begins a three-year, $6 million extension next season.\n\nAndre Benoit, D, Sabres, $800,000\n\nUndersized defenseman with good offensive ability takes $100,000 pay cut from what the Avs gave him last season.\n\nDevin Setoguchi, F, Flames, $750,000\n\nOnly 27 years old, the No. 8 pick in the 2005 draft has three 20-goal seasons, and he reached 30 goals once.\n\nJordie Benn, D, Stars, $700,000\n\nPlayed 78 games in first full NHL season in 2013-14, and was a plus-16. Younger brother and teammate Jamie Benn makes $5.75 million.\n\nGustav Nyquist, F, Red Wings, $950,000\n\nScored 28 goals in only 57 NHL games last season.
