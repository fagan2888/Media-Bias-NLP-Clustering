According to a report from The Wrap, director Quentin Tarantino is expected to apologize for his controversial comments about the police during a #BlackLivesMatter rally.

“When I see murders, I do not stand by…” Tarantino said during an October 24 anti-police brutality rally. “I have to call a murder a murder and I have to call the murderers the murderers.”

In response to those comments, a number of police unions announced a boycott of Tarantino’s films. Tarantino was supported by some of the actors he had directed in the past, such as Django Unchained‘s Jamie Foxx.

But The Wrap‘s Anita Bennett reports that “an individual with knowledge of the situation said the director is planning to explain his comments in an opinion piece and apologize to those who were offended. The exact time and media outlet will be decided by the director…”
