HARTFORD >> It wasn’t until state auditors were about to finalize their report that Connecticut’s health insurance exchange presented them with the corrective action plan for a potential security breach that happened in June 2014.

“They never produced it until the very end,” Robert Ward, one of the state auditors, said Tuesday.

Connecticut’s health insurance exchange, known as Access Health CT, is the quasi-public agency created to oversee the state’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act and to help facilitate the purchase of health insurance.

Last year, a call center representative lost a backpack that contained the names and Social Security numbers of clients or potential clients. The backpack, lost on a Hartford street, ended up at the office of a state lawmaker and Hartford police investigated the matter, but no criminal charges were filed against the employee. Maximus, the vendor that employed the call center representative who lost the backpack, and Access Health CT promised changes as a result of the incident.

Following the incident last June, the exchange hired a third-party security consultant to perform a security assessment. The exchange provided copies of that assessment to auditors.
