The changes come after The New York Times published a lengthy story on the hardships faced by a single mother who is trying to manage an erratic work schedule and get an education at the same time.\n\nThe company will quickly update its scheduling software to provide \u201cstability and consistency\u201d for its more than 130,000 \u201cstore partners,\u201d according to an internal e-mail Thursday from Cliff Burrows, the head of Starbucks\u2019 U.S. operations.\n\nStarbucks managers will now post schedules at least one week in advance, and store workers should never have to work an opening and closing shift back-to-back, according to Burrows. In addition, if an employee\u2019s commute is more than one hour long, Starbucks will transfer them to a closer store as soon as possible.\n\nBurrows said Starbucks is committed to \u201ctaking care\u201d of its employees and that he was \u201ctroubled\u201d when he read about the 22-year-old employee, Jannette Navarro.\n\n\u201cOur success is a direct result of the relationship our partners \u2014 like Janette \u2014 have with our customers,\u201d said Burrows. \u201cWe have a responsibility to support them in balancing their home and work lives.\u201d\n\nThe company was already working on new human resources policies aimed at improving the employee experience, but decided to expedite the process in response to the Times article, said spokesman Zach Hutson.\n\nHutson acknowledged that the company had received complaints from workers about scheduling in the past. But he added that managers will now have more leeway when it comes to setting hours for individual employees.\n\nHe said Navarro is still with the company and now has a more predictable schedule, working 40 hours a week. That\u2019s good news because Navarro often worked fewer hours and was struggling to cover her childcare and housing costs, according to the article.\n\nWhile he said the company has other improvements in store, Hutson declined to go into details.\n\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz has been outspoken on a number of social and economic issues, such as same-sex marriage and the push to raise the national minimum wage.\n\nThe company recently announced plans to offer both full- and part-time employees a generous tuition reimbursement benefit that covers two full years of classes. The benefit is through a partnership with Arizona State University\u2019s online studies program.\n\nStarbucks also pledged last year to maintain health benefits for employees despite increased costs under the Affordable Care Act. Many other big employers have reduced health coverage in response to the rollout of so-called Obamacare.\n\n\u2014 CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The story of one employee's daily struggle to plan her life around an unpredictable work schedule prompted a swift response from Starbucks.
