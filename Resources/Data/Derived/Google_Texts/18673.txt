Nationwide Insurance is a sponsor for a number of very worthwhile causes. I applaud their program to encourage civic action highlighted in the Nov. 3 paper [Kasich calls for rebuilding families, neighborhoods]. I was surprised, however, by the lack of female and minority persons in the picture of 30 or so employees at a talk given by Ohio Gov. John Kasich. I don’t think only white males are interested in civic action. The picture made me wonder about the diversity of Nationwide’s employees.
