Such seamless back-and-forth sharing still isn\u2019t a reality, but a huge announcement by the feds\u2019 top health care official Monday could finally bring substantive results from this years-long conversation.\n\nHealth IT developers that provide 90 percent of all records services to U.S. hospitals are banding together with the country\u2019s five biggest health systems, alongside a dozen professional associations, to help ease the free flow of information in health care. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made that big revelation during her opening keynote yesterday at the HIMSS16 conference here in Las Vegas. Major players involved are making promises in three specific areas tied to interoperability, including bolstering consumers\u2019 access to their own records, refusing to block information from other systems and implementing national interoperability standards.\n\nSuch information sharing is crucial for hospitals trying to move away from the old siloed way of providing care with wide variation in quality and outcomes. How can a primary care doctor know that his patient visited an independent physician to obtain more pain meds, or a faraway emergency department for a mental health issue, without such sharing of data? Burwell recently paid a visit to Flint, Mich., and saw just how critical data has been to tracking health trends during the water contamination crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to create a system that delivers better care, spends our dollars more wisely and supports health care people because, at the heart of our efforts, are doctors and their teams who want to deliver the best possible care, and the patients who get put through the same tests over and over and over again, and the people like the children of Flint who need a doctor who can see the big picture and make changes at the community level,\u201d Burwell told HIMSS attendees Monday evening.\n\nThe announcement comprises a who\u2019s who of health care, cutting across all facets of the business \u2014 Epic, McKesson, GE on the technology side, to name a few; Kaiser, Catholic Health Initiatives and Ascension, among others, altogether representing providers in 46 states; and professional groups like the American Hospital Association and American Medical Association. You can see the whole list of those involved in this HHS fact sheet.\n\nIn HHS\u2019s own words from its announcement, the health care organizations are committing to three promises:\n\nTo help consumers easily and securely access their electronic health information, direct it to any desired location, learn how their information can be shared and used, and be assured that this information will be effectively and safely used to benefit their health and that of their community. To help providers share individuals\u2019 health information for care with other providers and their patients whenever permitted by law, and not block electronic health information (defined as knowingly and unreasonably interfering with information sharing). [To] implement federally recognized, national interoperability standards, policies, guidance, and practices for electronic health information, and adopt best practices including those related to privacy and security.\n\nSignees of the pact, such as the AHA, expressed optimism going forward, along with frustration with the current state of affairs, following Burwell\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cAchieving a seamless flow of health information to support care and engage patients will require action from all stakeholders, including vendors, providers and policymakers,\u201d AHA President and CEO Rick Pollack said in a statement. \u201cHospitals need the technology of their IT systems to communicate effectively, without having to deploy expensive and cumbersome patches and partial solutions.\u201d\n\nOne of the big themes at HIMSS this year is cybersecurity (also the topic of our February cover story), and Burwell believes keeping patients\u2019 data private and secure is the \u201cbedrock of an interoperable health information technology system.\u201d Cyber threats, like the one recently perpetrated in California, endanger the financial security and privacy of millions, Burwell said. That\u2019s why Congress recently enacted legislation creating a task force focused on protecting the health sector from such attacks.\n\nHitting these ambitious goals in the coming months is going to require an all-hands-on-deck approach from the entire field, and Burwell wants to hear from anyone who needs help along the path toward interoperability.\n\n\u201cAs always, we\u2019re committed to listening to all of you,\u201d she told attendees. \u201cYour voices are crucial to this conversation and we want to know what you need from us and how we can support your efforts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 For years, interoperability \u2014 or the ability of disparate health information systems to communicate with one another \u2014 has been the talk here at the country\u2019s biggest health IT conference.
