Update: \u201cMisleading\u201d; Update: Rubio swipes\n\nposted at 1:22 pm on December 10, 2015 by Allahpundit\n\nBefore you start jumping up and down and saying \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d note that Cruz supposedly said this at a private fundraiser, not publicly. And when asked to confirm it by the press, he declined.\n\nCan\u2019t blame him. The idea that Donald Trump, who\u2019s reversed himself on a galaxy of partisan hot-button issues over the past 15 years, might not be the steady hand we need on the tiller of the ship of state is very controversial indeed.\n\nMr. Cruz described both campaigns [Trump and Ben Carson] as having a \u201cnatural arch\u201d with gravity \u201cpulling them down\u201d now. Mr. Carson\u2019s descent, he added, has been faster. But he added, according to a second attendee, \u201cYou look at Paris, you look at San Bernardino, it\u2019s given a seriousness to this race, that people are looking for: Who is prepared to be a commander in chief? Who understands the threats we face?\u201d He went on: \u201cWho am I comfortable having their finger on the button? Now that\u2019s a question of strength, but it\u2019s also a question of judgment. And I think that is a question that is a challenging question for both of them.\u201d\n\nCruz was asked about this earlier today after a speech and said, without naming names, \u201cultimately the decision is, who has the right judgment \u2014 experience and judgment \u2014 to serve as commander in chief?\u201d Experience and judgment? He\u2019s spent a total of two and three-quarters years as a legislator. He\u2019s alienated nearly everyone in the Senate, making it difficult for him to even ask for floor votes anymore, and his main claim to fame among the wider public is probably as the face of the doomed 2013 shutdown over ObamaCare. I say this as someone who\u2019s leaning towards Cruz in the primary: Trump has plenty of ammo to attack him on experience and judgment if he wants to engage over this. But then ask yourself, if Cruz doesn\u2019t hit Trump for his \u201cjudgment,\u201d what\u2019s he going to hit him on? He can\u2019t call him a RINO; plenty of Trump fans are RINO-y themselves and those who aren\u2019t seem willing to tolerate Trump\u2019s RINO-ier tendencies because of his less RINO-y ones, like mass deportation. Cruz could go after him for some of the outre things he\u2019s said about women, etc, but that would just piss off Trump fans. Being non-PC is part of Trump\u2019s appeal, and occasional boorishness comes with the territory. Plus, scolding the base and its heroes for being \u201cvulgar\u201d or whatever is a hallmark of establishmentarians, not would-be populists like Ted Cruz. If he tries to slap Trump\u2019s wrist for not having the character needed for the office, it\u2019ll end up turning off the Trump voters Cruz keeps pandering to.\n\nHere\u2019s a radical idea, via Jay Cost: What if Cruz never attacks Trump publicly? Does he really need to? Right now, Trump being in the race may be helping him more than it\u2019s hurting him.\n\nIn much the same way that Trump has set the terms of the presidential debate in ways that discomfited the party\u2019s leadership and fired up the base, Cruz did the same in Washington. The intense loathing Cruz inspired among every professional Republican politician not named Ted Cruz made his nomination difficult to fathom. But the rise of Trump has changed many things, and one of them may be to grant Republican insiders a new perspective on just what unacceptable means. Rubio is the candidate who laid his credibility on the line in order to resolve the party\u2019s immigration problem in 2013. (While he failed, and abandoned his own proposal, pro-reform Republicans have every reason to believe his heart lies with them.) Trump is the candidate whose inflammatory racism would brand the GOP as irrevocably hostile to immigrant communities. Cruz lies in between, not having sponsored major pro-reform legislation, but also having steered clear of crude Trumpist demagoguery (and, like Rubio, having a Cuban-American background to fall back upon). Cruz may find himself best positioned to bridge the gap, and well positioned to win a three-way race divided along these lines. Should Trump falter, pro-Trump border hawks would probably prefer Cruz to Rubio, who tried to shepherd immigration reform through the Senate. And should Rubio falter, Rubio\u2019s supporters would find Cruz a more predictable and disciplined Republican partisan than the erratic Trump.\n\nFor most of the fall, the conventional wisdom (adopted by Cruz himself, apparently) has been that most Trump fans will become Cruz fans once Trump is out of the race, in which case Cruz obviously should want Trump out of the race ASAP. They\u2019re both \u201coutsiders,\u201d they both crap on \u201cthe Washington cartel\u201d at every opportunity \u2014 it\u2019s a natural match. Lately, though, with more attention being paid to the class divide between Trump\u2019s base and the rest of the GOP plus the fact that Trump\u2019s supporters are more a distinct coalition than some traditional subset of the Republican base, that conventional wisdom has loosened. Remember that USA Today poll from a few days ago? More than two-thirds of Trump fans say they\u2019d vote for Trump even if he dumped the GOP and ran as an independent. Their allegiance to any politician or party beyond Trump himself is hard to pin down; Cruz would be taking a calculated gamble in expecting they\u2019d choose him over Rubio (he\u2019s closer to Trump on immigration), but it\u2019s still a gamble. Rubio\u2019s pushed harder in the Senate on blue-collar economic reforms than Trump has. Rubio\u2019s also more personally likable than Cruz. So maybe Cruz is now thinking that keeping Trump around for awhile isn\u2019t an altogether bad thing. If Cruz wins Iowa, which seems increasingly likely, then he\u2019ll be pulling for Trump to win New Hampshire (assuming Cruz himself isn\u2019t in contention) in the name of denying Rubio a big win. Cruz would look much better in a head-to-head race against Trump for the nomination, even to center-righties who otherwise don\u2019t like, than he would against Rubio. That\u2019s the Jeb Bush strategy \u2014 turn the race into \u201cTrump vs. not Trump.\u201d That won\u2019t work for Jeb. It probably would for Cruz.\n\nExit question: Per the Times, one of the people at Cruz\u2019s fundraiser reportedly asked whether he trusts Trump\u2019s judgment to appoint quality Supreme Court justices. (Cruz\u2019s answer is unknown.) What do Trump fans think about that? You trust a rock-ribbed lifelong dogmatic conservative like Trump to be a stickler on conservative justices, no?\n\nUpdate: Lame.\n\nCruz goes after NYT for suggesting he criticized Trump pic.twitter.com/XDCx0Ue9ge \u2014 Betsy Woodruff (@woodruffbets) December 10, 2015\n\nHow is the Times story misleading if Cruz is now reiterating the point they claimed he made at the fundraiser? A Twitter pal who says he\u2019s a Trump fan told me last night that he has more respect for Jeb than for Cruz because at least Bush is showing some leadership in disagreeing with Trump on things. As a would-be Cruz voter, I sympathize with that. There is a middle ground between viciously berating Trump and his fans and coming off like you might take a dump in your pants in terror if people perceive you as criticizing him.\n\nUpdate: I assume this is a dig at Cruz.\n\n.@marcorubio \u2013 \"I wouldn't say anything at a private fundraiser that I wouldn't say at a public event.\" #iacaucus pic.twitter.com/V0MApc5yje \u2014 Samantha-Jo Roth (@SamanthaJoRoth) December 10, 2015\n\nIs it really true that Rubio wouldn\u2019t say something at a fundraiser that he wouldn\u2019t also say publicly? I can think of something.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Questions.", "title": "Ted Cruz: Does Donald Trump have the judgment to be president?
