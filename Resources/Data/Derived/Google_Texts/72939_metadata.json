Reading it on a beach somewhere, I felt a light went on in my head; she was describing the culture of our times in a way that was both persuasive and accessible, and yet that I had come across nowhere else, not even in academia. For her 2001 book, the massive best-seller Nickel and Dimed, she took a series of service jobs incognito and told the world what the experience was like. Bright-Sided, which she published in 2009, saw her turn her painstaking scrutiny on the quasi-religious industry of positive thinking.\n\nSomewhere along the line, I became Barbara\u2019s friend, and it occurred to me that the factor that makes each of her books so completely unique in American intellectual life is her persistent sensitivity to matters of social class. She can always see through the smokescreen, the cloud of fibs we generate to make ourselves feel better about a world where the work of the many subsidizes the opulent lifestyles of the few. That, plus the fact that she writes damned well. Better than almost anyone out there, in fact.\n\nBut now, in Living With a Wild God, she takes us in a radically new direction. Instead of telling us about some fatuity in the world around us, she recalls her own youth in the \u201950s and \u201960s and her search for the grand philosophical truths about life itself. That childhood quest, as she tells it, culminates in a shattering, mystical experience which she has only lately decided to embrace and explore. Which she does, of course, with the profound rhetorical clarity we have come to expect from Barbara Ehrenreich.\n\nI got her on the phone a few days ago to talk it over. Here is our conversation, lightly edited.\n\nThis book is a pretty big switch for you. It\u2019s a memoir, but a memoir without nostalgia.\n\nThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s a memoir about one particular theme, one particular long-running concern.\n\nIt\u2019s an intellectual memoir too.\n\nIntellectual, philosophical.\n\nIt\u2019s also a memoir with a point, which you don\u2019t often encounter.\n\nI first of all think there is a great deal of vanity in the very notion of a memoir. The subtitle in the U.S. edition was \u201cA Memoir\u201d before, and we changed that to \u201cAn Unbeliever\u2019s Search For the Truth About Everything.\u201d\n\nI was able to figure that out because I got the galleys\u2026It\u2019s kind of an intimidating memoir, intellectually speaking. The teenaged you, and I guess the adult you too, are pretty relentless in following this quest wherever it takes you. It\u2019s scary.\n\nReally?\n\nThat was my opinion. In some ways. Because there\u2019s no soft landing here.\n\nNo.\n\nYou don\u2019t give us a way out.\n\nNo. And I don\u2019t grow out of it either. What I was very conscious in the back of my mind was the standard coming-of-age narrative and putting away childish things and the idea that you can, in your youth, be a little bit crazy and think big thoughts, but you then grow up. I hate that.\n\nThat\u2019s in Corinthians in the Bible, putting away childish things.\n\nWell, you know your Bible better than I do.\n\nI know because I quoted the passage in my column a few weeks ago and there is another part in that same passage, \u201cFor now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.\u201d And that\u2019s sort of what happened to you.\n\nYeah. I haven\u2019t read enough of the Bible. You know, I\u2019m saving the Bible for if I ever get imprisoned and the only reading material was the Bible.\n\nYeah, when you\u2019re imprisoned in a motel. It happens to me all the time. Gideon\u2019s Bible\u2026\n\nWinnie Mandela was imprisoned and all there was to read was the Bible and that made a big impression on me. I thought, okay, I better save the best part.\n\nSpeaking of that, in South Africa, religion had a big role in the apartheid state. The Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou have been very hostile to religion over the years.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nYou can\u2019t just say, uh-huh!\n\nOh yeah. No, I haven\u2019t seen much socially redeeming about religion. I\u2019m an atheist. I don\u2019t here want to get into the Hitchens or Dawkins style attack on religion. I was raised on that. It\u2019s boring.\n\nThe Tom Paine style?\n\nRobert Ingersoll.\n\nRobert Ingersoll. He was not a marginal figure in American life. He was a great orator. He gave the nominating speech for James G. Blaine in 1876. One of my all time favorite speeches for silly bluster. He\u2019s the one who called Blaine the \u201cplum\u00e8d knight.\u201d Blaine \u201cthrew his shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every defamer of his country.\u201d This sort of outrageous rhetoric. That was Ingersoll.\n\nYou see, he was very, very popular with middle class audiences. There was also this strain in American working class culture, native born. Well, no. There were plenty of atheist immigrants too\u2014Swedes and Germans, and so on. There was something called \u201cfree thought\u201d in the 19th century and I think that\u2019s what may have had an influence on my ancestors who were blue collar working class and were in some cases small farmers. But they were more concerned with reading and learning.\n\nFrom my own reading of Populist newspapers in the 1890s, I know there was a lot more going on in working-class culture back then than we give them credit for today, or rather than we would expect today. People read all kinds of stuff.\n\nYeah. It amazes me when you would see an occasional letter written by, say, my paternal grandfather, how extremely articulate and grammatically correct and everything. This was a man who didn\u2019t go to school.\n\nBut he probably read a lot.\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nHere (in Living With a Wild God) we see a very different Barbara. This is you spending your life contemplating metaphysics. And chemistry. That\u2019s also new. I didn\u2019t know you had a PhD\u2014is it in chemistry or biology?\n\nThe final PhD was in cell biology.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of your writing and I didn\u2019t know you had studied science until you told me that one day.\n\nYeah, no, I\u2019m a secret scientist.\n\nThere it is.\n\nYou\u2019re like me. You have many different channels going on in your mind at once. Mine just happen to be very different from each other. Minimum wage, the universe, etc.\n\nThe method\u2019s the same in this book as in your others: to look relentlessly beneath the surface. You\u2019ve done this with social class, with gender relations, with war, and now you\u2019ve taken on the biggest subject of them all.\n\nYeah. I\u2019m an obsessive. When I get a problem, a question in my mind it can take me over. And this metaphysical stuff was the longest running of that.\n\nTo continue with the religion stuff, in Nickel and Dimed, you said you could always tell if somebody was going to be a lousy tipper if they wore one of those WWJD bracelets.\n\nPeople would come in on Sunday after services. You\u2019d serve the whole table and get a dollar tip. And I was criticized for saying that in Nickel and Dimed, that that was straight-up prejudice. But I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve come across recently, articles asking what\u2019s wrong with Christians? Why don\u2019t they tip better?\n\nReally? That would have never occurred to me.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me either. But that\u2019s what Nickel and Dimed got a lot of heat for, being anti-Christian, when in fact it was the other way around.\n\nThe Christians were anti-you.\n\n(laughs) Well no. The book was sort of pro-Jesus.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to that in a second. And the same with your book Bright-Sided. Bright-Sided I thought [was a] fantastic book and it had a very sharp attack on the prosperity gospel.\n\nRight, but I stopped short in Bright-Sided. And I knew I was stopping short, saying that the ultimate in bright-siding would be to believe in a benevolent God.\n\nHow so?\n\nWhat could be nicer? Everything is going to be okay. That\u2019s the worst. And I stopped short of taking that on in Bright-Sided. I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s another book.\u201d\n\nAnd this is that?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo Jesus. You do have kind words for Jesus.\n\nI think I have very kind words for Jesus. And that all comes out in the section about going to a tent revival.\n\nBut not his followers.\n\nNo. I\u2019m not interviewing the followers in the tent revival or anything.\n\nI mean, the later books of the New Testament.\n\nNo. What happens is, here you have this amazing, charismatic, madly generous Jesus, who says that when someone asks for your coat, give him not just your coat but your cloak also. Someone sues you in the court of law, give him everything. Then he turns into God, or the Son of God, and becomes the risen Christ. Now everything changes. Because now there is a personal selfish goal to be achieved in following this faith. To get into heaven. To get into heaven.\n\nIs it like getting into Harvard?\n\nWhat bothers me about that is it seems to me that what Jesus would say is you must give up your space in heaven to some poor sinner. Give it all away. So it\u2019s kind of an inverse Jesus. Everybody\u2019s out in their own little careerist scheme to get into heaven.\n\nIt sounds like they should have cosmic SATs.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo get back to the book. The kind of stuff you were reading in high school. I think it\u2019s fair to say that not many high schoolers read those kind of books anymore. Was that common back then? Tell the readers what you were reading first.\n\nTo me, looking back, it looks like a pretty standard reading list for an alienated nerdy kid. Dostoyevsky, Conrad, Camus, a touch of Sartre.\n\nYou also said Kant, Hegel.\n\nI didn\u2019t read Kant. There was no sort of order to these things except for the way they were arranged in the library shelves.\n\nI loved that scene in the Lowell library, Lowell, Mass., where you say Jack Kerouac spent all that time.\n\nYes. Which I only found out recently of course. So I had no system. I probably got to Hegel before Kant because he\u2019s ahead of him in the alphabet.\n\nAnd Descartes. You were very struck by Descartes. You think Descartes was a cop out.\n\nI thought he was silly.\n\nHis nerve failed.\n\nWell, now I have slightly more respect for his radical skepticism. But at the time I thought, \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d? Well, how could you think if you weren\u2019t? How could you even put those words together? I thought it was sort of a tautology.\n\nA lot of Nietzsche too.\n\nA lot of Nietzsche? Yes. yes. (laughs)\n\nSo we come to the central experience in the book\u2026the epiphany in Lone Pine, Calif. For something that has fascinated you your entire life, it takes up very little space in the book, about a page and a half.\n\nYup.\n\nYou have to say what happened for our readers because I\u2019m not even going to try.\n\nWell, the circumstances were a bit unusual. I had gone on a skiing trip with my brother and a high school friend. My brother was 13. I was 17. And I don\u2019t know whose car it was or what the deal was. And my uncle lived not too far from the Mammoth Mountain Ski area in Northern California. So we were all going to stay with my uncle and then spend a day skiing. After that day of skiing, for reasons which are investigated in the book but I didn\u2019t understand at the time, we did not go straight back to LA, but slept in the car in Lone Pine. Meaning, [we] pretty much didn\u2019t sleep. The conditions, the physiological conditions for a Plains Indians vision quest, I realized, were all in place. Sleep deprivation, probably hypoglycemia, exhaustion, physical exhaustion. And after that night in the car, I got up before the others and just started walking down the street, probably looking for a restroom. And that\u2019s what happened, where it happened. The only kind of words I could find, the only kind of imagery after all these years is to say the world flamed into life. Everything was coming at me. I was flowing out into it. It was exhilarating and kind of terrifying.\n\nYou described it as kind of an encounter with something living.\n\nWell, that\u2019s how it felt. Then, after reflection for a couple of months, I decided no, it can\u2019t be an encounter because, what am I talking about? What\u2019s to encounter? The world is dead. That\u2019s what I know from science. So it must be mental illness. It must have been some kind of breakdown. And that\u2019s how I filed it away as much as I could for years.\n\nYou call it dissociation.\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s a series of little strange things that happened there. First when I was 13 I started having these, what I now found out now are called, dissociative episodes which \u2014 suddenly the layer of language and associations and significance peels off the world, and you just see what\u2019s underneath.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating, especially since I\u2019ve never had an experience like that. I think most people probably haven\u2019t.\n\nWell, I am now impressed by how many have. I couldn\u2019t have written this book, I wouldn\u2019t have had the confidence, if I didn\u2019t begin to figure out, in the last couple decades, that some people seem to have had similar experiences, but they generally framed them in religious language or in some other way that completely turned me off.\n\nDrugs, that\u2019s a common one.\n\nWell, drugs is different. I have never taken LSD or anything like that, because I\u2019m afraid to. But from what I can tell, that is different sort of experience \u2014 that things get kind of lurid and wriggly and multicolored and there is a real change in the nature of the world. And I never saw anything happen that seemed to break the laws of physics.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s something about, that you were so philosophical as a child that it set you up for something like this? Could something like that just happen to someone who hadn\u2019t done all the reading and studying and thinking that you had done?\n\nI think so. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve read on the dissociation front. There is a website, a support group, for people who suffer from such things and they don\u2019t seem to be like major philosophical thinkers. In fact, they seem to hate the experience. They\u2019re terrified. They want to get \u201cbetter.\u201d And I didn\u2019t see it like that. I thought, \u201cWow, isn\u2019t this interesting.\u201d You know, because the dissociative episodes are the first thing that challenged, for me, the nature of this consensual reality we are all supposed to sign on to. Know what I mean?\n\nYes.\n\nIt\u2019s just so strange to me to read these people saying, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t get better. I\u2019ve tried drugs. I\u2019ve tried therapy.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s very unpleasant. Does this still happen to you?\n\nYeah, but I\u2019m more likely to shut it off. I can\u2019t control whether it\u2019s going to happen or not but I can generally say, \u201cAll right, enough. Come on! You\u2019re driving a car.\u201d (laughs)\n\nReally? Do you know how to turn it on?\n\nNo. That\u2019s the trouble. I\u2019d probably spend a lot more time there.\n\nYeah, I was going to say, if you can turn it on whenever you want, I\u2019d like to have a shot at it. If you could just tell me what the steps are, what the procedure is.\n\nPeople often think that the route to such uncanny experiences must be through some kind of discipline, meditation, et cetera. Not in my experience.\n\nWell you said, hypoglycemia and sleeplessness. One of the things that really intrigued me about the book was how you intertwine biology and metaphysics all the time. I like that \u2026 I want to get you to talk about that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Belief, Richard Dawkins, Jesus and the minimum wage, \"The Fountainhead\" and more, in our exclusive conversation", "title": "Tom Frank interviews Barbara Ehrenreich: \u201cYou\u2019re the anti-Ayn Rand\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Belief, Richard Dawkins, Jesus and the minimum wage, \"The Fountainhead\" and more, in our exclusive conversation", "title": "Tom Frank interviews Barbara Ehrenreich: \u201cYou\u2019re the anti-Ayn Rand\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/06/tom_frank_interviews_barbara_ehrenreich_youre_the_anti_ayn_rand/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/barbara_ehrenreich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Belief, Richard Dawkins, Jesus and the minimum wage, \"The Fountainhead\" and more, in our exclusive conversation", "title": "Tom Frank interviews Barbara Ehrenreich: \u201cYou\u2019re the anti-Ayn Rand\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/barbara_ehrenreich.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Frank", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Ayn Rand, Barbara Ehrenreich, Books, Christopher Hitchens, Editor's Picks, Living with a wild god, Religion, Richard Dawkins, Thomas Frank, Tom Frank", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf313\"", "article_summary": "Which she does, of course, with the profound rhetorical clarity we have come to expect from Barbara Ehrenreich.\nYou know, I\u2019m saving the Bible for if I ever get imprisoned and the only reading material was the Bible.\nYeah, I was going to say, if you can turn it on whenever you want, I\u2019d like to have a shot at it.\nPeople often think that the route to such uncanny experiences must be through some kind of discipline, meditation, et cetera.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that not many high schoolers read those kind of books anymore."}
