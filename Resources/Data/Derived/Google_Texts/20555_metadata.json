After press inquiries, the police revealed a list of dates and places a reporter's car had been, and even the routes followed by the city's mayor.\n\nI'm guessing it was that second point that spurred Minnesota legislation to limit access to license plate data, as well as how long it can be held.\n\nBoston police stopped using license plate scanners entirely after they inadvertently data-dumped tracking information on 68,000 vehicles to the Boston Globe. The incident revealed that the cops weren't actually putting the data to good use (they kept recording the same stolen vehicles without following up) and were perhaps less than ideal stewards of sensitive material.\n\nWho knows?
