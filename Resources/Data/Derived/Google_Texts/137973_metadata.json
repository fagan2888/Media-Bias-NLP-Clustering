In spring 1998 I stopped in Krakow, Poland, for a few days, and one morning took a train to the small town of Oswiecim.\n\nFrom there a short taxi ride dropped me at the entrance to Auschwitz, perhaps the most infamous of the German network of forced labor and extermination camps. After touring this place where indescribable horrors occurred, a small bus took me to Birkenau, the larger and more notorious companion facility. Here I examined plans for a major expansion curtailed by the fortunes of war.\n\nIn these facilities a million Jews, and others, were murdered or worked to death during World War II. Standing outside Birkenau, I noticed chimneys as far as I could see. Each of these signified a barracks in 1944. I walked past the \"selection\" platform, shown in the movie \"Schindler's List,\" the crematoria, and the gas chambers partially destroyed by the retreating Germans.\n\nTo get to Netanyahu and Israel: All the books I've read, the documentaries I've watched, and my pilgrimage to Auschwitz and later to Israel do not and cannot personalize the Holocaust to me like it is to hundreds of thousands (millions?) of Israelis. No wonder Israel fears today's Iranian regime's pledge to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and complete the Germans' unfinished work.\n\nOur narcissistic impeachment-proof president wants to make a nuclear deal with the Iranians, any deal. In his vaguely arrogant, vaguely patronizing way, President Obama even asserts that he knows what is best for Israel's security.\n\nLike his namesake Obamacare, the Iranian nuclear deal has been shrouded in secrecy. In fact, information about the emerging deal suggests provisions that both contain and legitimize the Iranian nuclear program. It may delay \u2014 but does not strip \u2014 Iran of the ability to develop nuclear weapons, despite Obama's often-stated goal to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, period. Many more details are to be finalized by the end of June.\n\nBut unlike Obamacare, when the nuclear deal's warts come out or later when the Iranians thwart those \"highly intrusive\" inspections of its nuclear facilities, the deal's loss function will be much greater. Obama wanted the Israelis and others sympathetic to Israel to twist in the wind while the United Nations, not Congress, reviewed and approved the deal. Now, however, he has a whole new attitude as the reality of congressional oversight cannot likely be avoided.\n\nPresumably Netanyahu knew what was cooking and did his best to publicize to the Congress and the American people the threat posed by the deal with the Iranians. Unfortunately, while achieving its objectives the speech ruffled a few feathers and some people claiming to be grown-ups behaved like spoiled adolescents.\n\nIran's ability to wreak havoc with nuclear weapons dwarfs the Germans' Zyklon B/gas vans/mass shootings of the 1940s. The Israelis understand this. Does the White House?\n\nJames Largay, Ph.D., who lives in Upper Saucon Township, is professor of accounting emeritus at Lehigh University.
