Most notable was Cheney\u2019s brazen defense of the Bush administration\u2019s post-9/11 national security policies, for which he asserted \u201cI don\u2019t think we have any apologies to make.\u201d\n\nEmploying the Bush White House\u2019s Orwellian phrase of choice to describe torture, the former vice president hailed \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d as key to the administration\u2019s anti-terrorism efforts.\n\n\u201c[W]hat are you gonna do?\u201d Cheney asked. \u201cJust say \u2018please, please, pretty please, tell us what you know\u2019? That\u2019s not gonna work.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we developed a series of techniques. \u2026 Waterboarding was part of that process,\u201d Cheney recalled.\n\nKristol, you\u2019ll be shocked to learn, didn\u2019t ask Cheney about the role U.S. torture and detention policies played as recruitment tools for terrorists.\n\nAsked to reflect on the current national security landscape, Cheney hardly minced words. In a not-so-thinly veiled jab at longtime antagonist Rand Paul, Cheney said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a fool to believe an isolationist strategy is the way to go.\u201d\n\nThen came a good measure of quintessential Cheney fear-mongering.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no choice but to be involved in [the Middle East],\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re not actively involved there, some very bad things are gonna happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former VP predicts a \"mass casualty attack\" worse than 9/11 -- and shamelessly defends torture VIDEO", "title": "Dick Cheney wants you to be very afraid", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former VP predicts a \"mass casualty attack\" worse than 9/11 -- and shamelessly defends torture VIDEO", "title": "Dick Cheney wants you to be very afraid", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/13/dick_cheney_wants_you_to_be_very_afraid/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/dick_cheney3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former VP predicts a \"mass casualty attack\" worse than 9/11 -- and shamelessly defends torture VIDEO", "title": "Dick Cheney wants you to be very afraid", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/dick_cheney3.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, Bill Kristol, bush administration, Dick Cheney, Iraq war, neoconservatives, Rand Paul, Terrorism, The Weekly Standard, Torture, Video, Waterboarding", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf53a\"", "article_summary": "Kristol, you\u2019ll be shocked to learn, didn\u2019t ask Cheney about the role U.S. torture and detention policies played as recruitment tools for terrorists.\nAsked to reflect on the current national security landscape, Cheney hardly minced words.\nSitting down with neoconservative pundit William Kristol for a nearly two-hour interview, Cheney discussed at length what the sycophantic Kristol called his \u201cdistinguished,\u201d \u201cexemplary,\u201d and \u201cmodel\u201d career.\n\u201c[W]hat are you gonna do?\u201d Cheney asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no choice but to be involved in [the Middle East],\u201d Cheney said."}
