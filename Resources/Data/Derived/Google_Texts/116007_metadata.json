But only 36 percent of Americans can actually name the three branches of government the Constitution created. That\u2019s according to a new survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center, and it shows a huge percentage of Americans might need to take a civics refresher course. Only 38 percent of Americans knew the Republican Party controls the U.S. House of Representatives, while 17 percent think Democrats are still in charge. The number of people who knew Republicans were in charge has dropped 17 percent since the last time Annenberg asked, back in 2011, right after Republicans reclaimed control. An identical number, 38 percent, knows Democrats run the Senate, while 20 percent believe Republicans control the upper chamber. Only 27 percent knew it takes a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate to override a presidential veto.\n\nAmericans are thus more familiar with which political parties are in power than with which branches of government comprise our political system. Interesting. I wonder, then, how many of us also know that the \"U.S. House of Representatives\" and the \"U.S. Senate,\" when taken together, make up the \"U.S. Congress\"?\n\nIn all seriousness, these are the kinds of results one might expect to find when polling, say, eight-year-olds. The fact that this was a national sample of adults is pretty scary.\n\nFor a nation with so many smart people in it, it\u2019s amazing how little some of us know.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idiocracy. .05/26/2016 2:48:03AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Idiocracy.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Confirmed: Most Americans Need Remedial Civics Lessons", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/09/21/poll-most-americans-need-a-serious-civics-lesson-n1894213", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/256/83235562-c40d-417e-a39c-b824c4c2f40f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Idiocracy.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Confirmed: Most Americans Need Remedial Civics Lessons", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/09/21/poll-most-americans-need-a-serious-civics-lesson-n1894213", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/256/83235562-c40d-417e-a39c-b824c4c2f40f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Confirmed: Most Americans Need Remedial Civics Lessons, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32aa\"", "article_summary": "Only 38 percent of Americans knew the Republican Party controls the U.S. House of Representatives, while 17 percent think Democrats are still in charge.\nThe number of people who knew Republicans were in charge has dropped 17 percent since the last time Annenberg asked, back in 2011, right after Republicans reclaimed control.\nThat\u2019s according to a new survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center, and it shows a huge percentage of Americans might need to take a civics refresher course.\nAmericans are thus more familiar with which political parties are in power than with which branches of government comprise our political system.\nBut only 36 percent of Americans can actually name the three branches of government the Constitution created."}
