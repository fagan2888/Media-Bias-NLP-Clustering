Forensic investigators were conducting tests on the knife, which was recently turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department by a retired officer, Lieutenant Andrew Neiman told reporters at a press conference.

Neiman said the officer told investigators he was given the knife by a construction worker, who said he had found it on the property where Simpson's house stood at the time of the June 12, 1994 murders. The home has since been torn down.

Police declined to elaborate on the timeline of when the knife, which was being tested for DNA evidence, was recovered but Neiman said it was still possible that "the whole story is bogus from the get-go."

He declined to name the retired police officer or to say why the knife had been given to police only in the past two months.

Simpson's ex-wife and Goldman were stabbed multiple times in the neck and head but the murder weapon was never found at the time of the trial that ended in 1995 with Simpson's acquittal.

Simpson cannot be prosecuted again for the two murders since that would constitute double jeopardy.

Simpson is now in prison on a 2008 armed robbery conviction related to the robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas hotel.

Highlighting the enduring fascination that the case holds for the American public, there were roughly 150 tweets per minute about O.J. Simpson on Friday, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.

The public fascination has been further spurred by an FX cable television miniseries that dramatizes the behind-the-scenes details of the trial.
