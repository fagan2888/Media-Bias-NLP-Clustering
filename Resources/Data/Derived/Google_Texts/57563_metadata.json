As a result, the ABIM Foundation and the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation recently partnered to address how to incorporate stewardship into medical education and training.\n\nThe ABIM Foundation is committed to advancing medical professionalism as defined in the Physician Charter, a document released in 2002 by our organization, the American College of Physicians Foundation, and the European Federation of Internal Medicine. The ABIM Foundation\u2019s recent efforts, such as its Choosing Wisely\u00ae campaign, have focused on the physician\u2019s responsibility for managing medical resources.\n\nThe Macy Foundation\u2019s mission is to improve health by advancing the education and training of health professionals\u2014specifically, by supporting interprofessional education and teamwork, new curriculum content, new educational models, education on how to care for the underserved, and career development for underrepresented minorities.\n\nIn November 2013, the two organizations convened medical educators, students, residents, and other stakeholders for a meeting on \u201cAdvancing the Competency of Stewarding Healthcare Resources in Medical Education and Training.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the convening included identification of five \u201ccritical paths\u201d to making stewardship a bedrock required competency in medical education and training:\n\n* Experiential learning and curricula to reinforce stewardship and address the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d\u2014meaning the \u201cunwritten rules\u201d in medical education and training that may undermine wise use of resources.\n\n* Health care organizational supports for stewardship in patient care and clinical meetings;\n\n* Clinical supports such as decision-support systems and price and cost information;\n\n* Professional self-regulation that supports and includes stewardship in assessments of physicians and other accountability efforts; and\n\n* Sustainability of stewardship efforts across the continuum of medical education, training, and practice.\n\nParticipants also discussed the need for a stewardship competency framework that would enable students and medical residents to:\n\n* Know why to choose wisely by understanding the clinical harms that occur from overuse and the clinical case for stewarding resources;\n\n* Know when to choose wisely by addressing the influence of organizational culture, the incentives for overuse in training and practice, and the needed metrics for systems accountability in delivering high-value care; and\n\n* Know how to choose wisely by demonstrating clinical reasoning and the ability to (1) deal with uncertainty; (2) use evidence, information technology, and decision-support tools; and (3) communicate with patients regarding high-value care.\n\nAlthough there is a need for greater support of stewardship in medical education and training, numerous promising practices already exist. Meeting attendees heard presentations by several winners of the Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely Competition, sponsored by the nonprofit organization Costs of Care and the ABIM Foundation, to identify and recognize champions of high-value care in medical education and training. The competition resulted in more than seventy entries, which were either already-implemented innovations or \u201cbright ideas\u201d for promoting stewardship in medical education and residency. Presenters were:\n\n* Michelle Lin (NYU [New York University] Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital)\u2014She and her fellow resident Larissa Laskowski were emergency medicine residents at NYU when Hurricane Sandy shut down the Bellevue emergency department (ED). Bellevue reopened with a temporary, freestanding ED while the hospital underwent repairs, and Lin and Laskowski were inspired by the resource constraints in this care setting to develop a ten-week curriculum for evidence-based testing and guidelines for avoiding unnecessary care. The curriculum presented common tests administered to patients in an ED and low-, medium-, and high-probability outcomes of administering each test.\n\n* Robert Fogerty (Yale University School of Medicine)\u2014Fogerty, a Yale faculty member, designed and implemented \u201cI-CARE\u201d (Interactive Cost-Awareness Resident Exercise) to integrate cost awareness without disrupting clinical training for Yale\u2019s internal medicine residency program. I-CARE exercises take place during morning rounds; during an exercise, a resident presents a case, and resident teams compete against intern teams to develop a high-value diagnosis plan. The attending physician then reveals the most high-value plan, and each team is given a \u201cbill\u201d based on the chargemaster (a hospital\u2019s comprehensive list of prices for supplies and procedures) for how much they spent during the exercise.\n\n* Amit Pahwa (Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center)\u2014Pahwa was a \u201cbright idea\u201d winner for his proposal to create cost report cards for residents by using billing data that would make lab and imaging use for each trainee available for feedback and allow residents to compare themselves with their peers. Program directors could also use the report cards to assess residents\u2019 performance on providing high-value care.\n\nTo learn more about the contest submissions and future competitions, please visit the Teaching Value site.\n\nAttendees concluded the meeting by brainstorming about future shared efforts to advance stewardship of resources in medical education and training. For example, the ABIM Foundation is strongly considering establishing a stewardship learning network for medical students and residents, collaborating with leading medical education and training organizations on a stewardship faculty development effort, and partnering with other organizations to offer curriculum and technical support to accompany their stewardship efforts.\n\nParticipants left the meeting galvanized by the shared understanding of the paths for advancing stewardship in medical education and training, their collective desired future state, and the energy and creativity of young leaders in advancing the wise use of resources. While challenges remain, the ongoing commitments by the ABIM Foundation, the Macy Foundation, and other participants will assure the advancement of stewardship as a competency in medical education and training.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/01/22/foundations-supporting-stewardship-of-health-care-resources-through-medical-education-and-training/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Foundations Supporting Stewardship of Health Care Resources Through Medical Education and Training"}, "description": "Foundations Supporting Stewardship of Health Care Resources Through Medical Education and Training | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce099\"", "article_summary": "The ABIM Foundation\u2019s recent efforts, such as its Choosing Wisely\u00ae campaign, have focused on the physician\u2019s responsibility for managing medical resources.\nAttendees concluded the meeting by brainstorming about future shared efforts to advance stewardship of resources in medical education and training.\nAlthough there is a need for greater support of stewardship in medical education and training, numerous promising practices already exist.\nDaniel Wolfson and Leslie TuckerJanuary 22, 2014With rising health care costs, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and increasing concern about the effects of unnecessary medical care, there has been more interest in the role of physicians in stewardship of health care resources.\nAs a result, the ABIM Foundation and the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation recently partnered to address how to incorporate stewardship into medical education and training."}
