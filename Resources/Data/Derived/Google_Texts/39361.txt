Prosecutors dropped the drug case against the Hartshorne police chief.

The District 18 Drug Task Force arrested Josh Brillo, 36, and his wife Heather in January after members of the task force said they found a small amount of marijuana at the couple's home.

On April 8, 2016, prosecutors dismissed the case against Josh. According to Josh Brillo's attorney, Russell Uselton, Pittsburg county prosecutors recused themselves from the case so the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office assigned it to the McIntosh County DA who reviewed the file and determined Brillo had not committed any crime.
