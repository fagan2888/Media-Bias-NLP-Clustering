U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was the first choice, with 17 percent.\n\nThat survey was taken before a 16-day partial federal government shutdown. Following the shutdown, just 9 percent of voters said they approved of the job Congress was doing, a 39-year-low, according to the Gallup Poll.\n\nChristie\u2019s Chances\n\nCruz and Walker also disagreed about the credentials of another potential presidential candidate, New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie, who won a second term this month.\n\nCruz pointedly declined to call Christie a conservative.\n\n\u201cI like Chris Christie, I\u2019m glad he was re-elected,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI think his blunt, brash style is refreshing.\u201d\n\nWalker said Christie is conservative \u201con most issues,\u201d and praised him for overhauling New Jersey pension laws despite a legislature controlled by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe difference between Chris and I is just that I have a little bit of a Midwestern filter, but he\u2019s pretty forceful on conservative issues,\u201d Walker said.\n\n2016 Plans\n\nBoth Walker and Cruz declined to rule out mounting 2016 runs. Cruz said his \u201cfocus is on the Senate,\u201d while Walker pointed to his third governor\u2019s race next year. Walker won the governor\u2019s office in 2010 and, last year, a recall attempt set off by his curbs on public-employee unions, which he said were draining the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cThe overall argument I\u2019m making is someone who\u2019s not just been a chief executive, but someone who\u2019s been a proven reformer, who\u2019s taken on the big challenges,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker, who has said Republicans should focus on economic issues over social concerns, said he\u2019d support a federal bill that would extend workplace protections to gays and lesbians, if it was similar to a measure already in place in Wisconsin. The federal bill passed the Democratic-controlled Senate this month, though Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has refused to take it up.\n\n\u201cIn Wisconsin, we\u2019ve had anti-discriminatory laws that are very similar to that for more than 30 years and they\u2019ve worked quite effectively,\u201d Walker said.\n\nObamacare Opponents\n\nCruz indicated he will redouble his efforts to undo President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act offering health care for the uninsured, early next year -- raising the prospect of yet another government shutdown fight in January.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is repeal it in its entirety,\u201d Cruz said of the health-care law. Asked whether he could accomplish that in January, when Congress must vote on whether to continue funding the government, Cruz said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope so.\u201d\n\nAs for what he would put in Obamacare\u2019s place if it were repealed, he offered no new specifics on how to cover individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, instead calling for legislation to allow individuals to buy insurance across state lines and keep coverage when they switch jobs.\n\n\u201cIf your health insurance could be like your car insurance, if it could be portable, it could go with you from job to job, that solves an enormous amount of the problem with pre-existing conditions and you can solve the rest of it with high-risk pools, which Obamacare is eliminating,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nWalker\u2019s Alternative\n\nWalker said Republicans need to offer a market-driven alternative to Obamacare. He\u2019s encouraging residents to join the health-care insurance exchange in his state.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a better free-market alternative, but it\u2019s the law,\u201d Walker said.\n\nOn foreign policy, Cruz criticized Obama for seeking a nuclear weapons deal with Iran in exchange for an end to U.S. sanctions without insisting on preconditions, such as a commitment that the Iranians dismantle nuclear centrifuges, calling it \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis administration\u2019s weakness on this policy is having the effect of encouraging Iran to move faster towards acquiring nukes,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nWalker declined to say whether he thought the U.S. should play a larger role in global disputes, or pull back and focus more on domestic issues. \u201cLike most Americans, I\u2019m somewhere in between the two,\u201d Walker said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael C.
