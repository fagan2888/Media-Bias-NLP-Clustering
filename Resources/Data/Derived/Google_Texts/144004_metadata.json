Yes, self-driving cars will be an estimated $87 billion market by 2030, according to Lux Research prognosticator Cosmin Laslau. But even by then, Google-like autonomous cars will only account for 8 percent of the automotive market, according to the report.\n\nAn Atlantic Special Report\n\nRead More\n\nLaslau labels such cars \u201cLevel 3\u201d vehicles\u2014capable of operating autonomously with the aid of high-resolution maps and other technology but still in need a human in the seat as a backup system. What he calls Level 4 cars are so completely autonomous that automakers can do away with steering wheels and pedals. Those cars won\u2019t even exist 20 years from now. (Note that this is a different level-based schema from the one employed by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.)\n\nLux has no doubt robot cars are coming down the road but in 2030 the highways will be jammed with Level 2 cars that boast technology already showing up today: adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and collision avoidance braking. More than half of cars will offer such features by 2020, and a decade later 92 percent of cars will roll off the assembly line able to operate semi-autonomously.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-driving cars might be almost 10 percent of the automotive market in a decade and a half.", "author": "Todd Woody", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Self-driving cars might be almost 10 percent of the automotive market in a decade and a half.", "title": "The $87 Billion Robot-Car Market", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/05/RTR3OZYH/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-87-billion-robot-car-industrial-complex/371242/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Yes, self-driving cars will be an estimated $87 billion market by 2030, according to Lux Research prognosticator Cosmin Laslau.\nBut even by then, Google-like autonomous cars will only account for 8 percent of the automotive market, according to the report.\nWhat he calls Level 4 cars are so completely autonomous that automakers can do away with steering wheels and pedals.\nIf you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, you can be forgiven for thinking the self-driving car of the future is now.\n(Note that this is a different level-based schema from the one employed by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.)"}
