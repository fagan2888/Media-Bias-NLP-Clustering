We stand proud. Ask Natives \u2026 with no shame.\u201d\n\nVideo of Not Your Mascot\n\nIn the video, the kids wore T-shirts reading, \u201cNot a Mascot,\u201d donated to them by the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation of Brooks, California. In June of 2014, the same nation purchased airtime during the N.B.A. finals to run an anti-R-word spot. The Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation is an avid supporter of the Change the Mascot campaign, a collective effort by the National Congress of American Indians and the Oneida Indian Nation to see that the name of the Washington pro football team is abolished.\n\nTitle VII Program Director Nelson Chaske procured Dr. Melissa Leal, Esselen and Ohlone, and a musician named EchoSlim of Trinidad, to come up with a summer project for the students. Leal immediately thought a music video was apropros.\n\n\u201cI knew that they would be receiving the [\u201cNot a Mascot\u201d] T-shirts, so I thought that it would be a perfect opportunity to engage the students in the discussion of mascots and write a song about it together as a group,\u201d Leal wrote in an email to ICTMN.\n\nLeal said she and Echoslim both were inspired to make the video based on indigenous hip-hop projects in Australian aboriginal communities. Next, the pair will film another video in couple of weeks covering a different topic with kids of the Wilton Rancheria Band of Miwok Indians in California, where Leal is the director of education.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a music video released Tuesday, 30 kids in California participated in a music video to combat racist Indian mascots.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "smoya-smith", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/07/video-kids-use-music-combat-indian-mascots-160986", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/not_your_mascot_youtube.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "VIDEO: Kids Use Music to Combat Indian Mascots"}, "abstract": "In a music video released Tuesday, 30 kids in California participated in a music video to combat racist Indian mascots.", "dc": {"title": "VIDEO: Kids Use Music to Combat Indian Mascots"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/07/video-kids-use-music-combat-indian-mascots-160986", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Change the Name, Mascots, Melissa Leal, Echo Slim, Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, indigenous hip-hop", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-07T18:41-04:00", "dcterms.title": "VIDEO: Kids Use Music to Combat Indian Mascots"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6b8c\"", "article_summary": "Leal said she and Echoslim both were inspired to make the video based on indigenous hip-hop projects in Australian aboriginal communities.\nAsk Natives \u2026 with no shame.\u201dVideo of Not Your MascotIn the video, the kids wore T-shirts reading, \u201cNot a Mascot,\u201d donated to them by the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation of Brooks, California.\nLeal immediately thought a music video was apropros.\nNext, the pair will film another video in couple of weeks covering a different topic with kids of the Wilton Rancheria Band of Miwok Indians in California, where Leal is the director of education.\nIn June of 2014, the same nation purchased airtime during the N.B.A."}
