JERUSALEM — Israel said Tuesday it would act aggressively against any threat after its military shot down a Syrian fighter jet that entered its airspace over the Golan Heights.

The military said a “Syrian aircraft infiltrated into Israeli airspace” early Tuesday and that the military “intercepted the aircraft in midflight, using the Patriot air defense system.”

The Syrian plane, identified by the Israeli military as a Su-24 Russian-made aircraft, penetrated about a half-mile into Israeli airspace and had turned to return to Syrian-controlled territory when it was shot down.
