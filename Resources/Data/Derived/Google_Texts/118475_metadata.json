But really, the pieces accompany each other.\n\nKen Dornstein is the force behind \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d \u2014 he is its primary investigator and its primary funder \u2014 but because he is so close to the tragedy of Lockerbie, he is the force in front of the camera, too. \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d is as much about his personal journey to come to terms with his brother\u2019s death in 1988 at the hands of terrorists as it is an investigation of who really engineered the crash of Pan Am Flight 103. For the New Yorker, Keefe investigates the investigation; the Frontline documentary is the discussed endpoint of the journey, and the reporter independently analyzes a lot of the footage that Dornstein incorporated into the three-hour series. The result is not exactly two different snapshots of the same story; it\u2019s two snapshots that blurrily overlap each other, taken with different exposures.\n\nLiterally, snapshots. The promotional art released by Frontline is Dornstein on a cellphone, looking out the window of a car. The Libyan flag can be seen out the window, hovering in the background. It\u2019s an intimate shot of him in a pensive situation. Meanwhile the photograph accompanying the New Yorker article is starker. Dornstein is looking directly at the camera, almost as if he is surprised at his work by the lens. The flashbulb casts a bright, interrogation room halo on him, and the room he\u2019s standing in. And the room he\u2019s standing in happens to be one of the two rooms in his attic devoted to the investigation, both of which have been turned over into full \u201cHomeland\u201d crazy-wall mode (see: the photo at the top of this story). The viewer is moved to ponder not just the mysteries of Lockerbie, but also to come to terms with what that scale of mystery and tragedy can do to people like Ken, whose older brother died at the age of 25, when Ken was a sophomore in college.\n\n\u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d is just another chapter in the story of Ken coming to terms with the tragedy; in 2006, he wrote \u201cThe Boy Who Fell Out of the Sky,\u201d about his brother David\u2019s unstable charisma and mysterious death. (According to the New York Times, in a class, David actually wrote a draft of a \u201cfictional autobiography\u201d: \u201cThe story of an unknown young writer who dies in a plane crash, leaving behind a cache of papers and notebooks that the narrator stitches together into the story of the writer\u2019s life.\u201d That is, of course, exactly what Ken ended up doing.)\n\nThe Lockerbie crash of 1988 was not that long ago, but as the documentary demonstrates, in terms of national security, it was a palpably different era. The crash was particularly horrible, and the difficulty of finding the perpetrators was particularly complex. The bomb ruptured the fuselage of the plane, which then broke apart midair; it is thought that most of the passengers were alive for the six-mile drop, until they hit the ground. Personal effects and remains were thus remarkably intact: David\u2019s passport and the pack of cigarettes on him were returned to his family. As Dornstein tells Keefe, the bodies of the children on the plane were found farther away from the crash site because the wind swept their smaller bodies further.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new three-part Frontline series goes to the Middle East and Europe to solve the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103", "title": "\u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d: The compelling personal crusade to crack the terror plot behind the 1988 Lockerbie explosion", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new three-part Frontline series goes to the Middle East and Europe to solve the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103", "title": "\u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d: The compelling personal crusade to crack the terror plot behind the 1988 Lockerbie explosion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/27/my_brothers_bomber_the_compelling_personal_crusade_to_crack_the_terror_plot_behind_the_1988_lockerbie_explosion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/frontline_brothers_bomber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new three-part Frontline series goes to the Middle East and Europe to solve the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103", "title": "\u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d: The compelling personal crusade to crack the terror plot behind the 1988 Lockerbie explosion", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/frontline_brothers_bomber.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Frontline, ken dorenstein, lockerbie, my brother's bomber, PBS, The New Yorker, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36e5\"", "article_summary": "The Lockerbie crash of 1988 was not that long ago, but as the documentary demonstrates, in terms of national security, it was a palpably different era.\n\u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d is as much about his personal journey to come to terms with his brother\u2019s death in 1988 at the hands of terrorists as it is an investigation of who really engineered the crash of Pan Am Flight 103.\nKen Dornstein is the force behind \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Bomber\u201d \u2014 he is its primary investigator and its primary funder \u2014 but because he is so close to the tragedy of Lockerbie, he is the force in front of the camera, too.\nThe promotional art released by Frontline is Dornstein on a cellphone, looking out the window of a car.\nPersonal effects and remains were thus remarkably intact: David\u2019s passport and the pack of cigarettes on him were returned to his family."}
