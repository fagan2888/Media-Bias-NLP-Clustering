Among the suspended groups is the one led by Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, a prominent rights activist who is now exiled in Belgium after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nThe U.N. said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has spoken out repeatedly on the importance of civil society.\n\n\"It's clear that every society needs a healthy civil society,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said when asked the U.N. chief's response to the government's action.\n\nHe said the secretary-general's newly appointed special adviser on Burundi was arriving in Bujumbura on Monday and will be holding meetings and reporting back in response to the Security Council resolution adopted on Nov. 12. It condemned ongoing killings in Burundi, threatened sanctions, and asked Ban to deploy a team to Burundi to work with the government, African Union and other partners to \"develop options to address political and security concerns.\"\n\nThe government has been carrying out a disarmament operation in volatile parts of Bujumbura, hoping to get weapons out of civilian hands, but many people here blame the security forces for a wave of extrajudicial killings that have raised international concern. Some of those killed, however, have been supporters of the government, including a military general who had served as a spy chief.\n\nGunfire and loud explosions now characterize life in Bujumbura, and many have fled their homes over safety concerns.\n\nThe U.N. says at least 240 people have been killed since April, but the actual death toll is likely much higher.\n\nAlthough the current conflict appears political, Burundi has a history of deadly conflicts between the country's Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.\n\nNkurunziza took power in 2005 near the end of a civil war in which some 300,000 people were killed between 1993 and 2006.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Burundi's government suspends 10 civic groups amid unrest - AP News: BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 Burundi's government on Monday suspended the .05/27/2016 9:21:46AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 Burundi's government on Monday suspended the licenses of 10 non-governmental organizations", "title": "AP News - Burundi's government suspends 10 civic groups amid unrest", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/11/23/burundis-government-suspends-10-civic-groups-amid-unrest-n2084481", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 Burundi's government on Monday suspended the licenses of 10 non-governmental organizations", "title": "AP News - Burundi's government suspends 10 civic groups amid unrest", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/11/23/burundis-government-suspends-10-civic-groups-amid-unrest-n2084481", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Burundi's government suspends 10 civic groups amid unrest, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 Burundi's government on Monday suspended the licenses of 10 non-governmental organizations over allegations they have been involved in anti-government activities.\nThe U.N. said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has spoken out repeatedly on the importance of civil society.\nAmong the suspended groups is the one led by Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, a prominent rights activist who is now exiled in Belgium after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\"It's clear that every society needs a healthy civil society,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said when asked the U.N. chief's response to the government's action.\nAlthough the current conflict appears political, Burundi has a history of deadly conflicts between the country's Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups."}
