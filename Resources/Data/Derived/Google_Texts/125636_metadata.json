However, town attorney Pat Morell said, \u201cLetters of resignation are sent to the town clerk. The board can act as a formality, but it has no legal effect.\u201d Accepting the resignation, and a subsequent reversal of that resignation, \u201cis at the sole discretion of the town clerk,\u201d said Morell.\n\nClerk Colleen Freese has been out on medical leave for a month and a half, but she appeared briefly at the meeting to read a statement. She had accepted Anderson\u2019s letter of resignation on January 26, but \u201cAs Town Clerk, I decline to grant the letter to withdraw, because there are still possibilities of conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nMorell explained further, that aside from Anderson\u2019s concerns about accepting grants, a conflict of interest exists where Anderson or his employees appear before the Covert town justice, Eileen Schmidt. Schmidt has recused herself from hearing such cases because, as a judge, she is required to avoid the appearance of impropriety or bias. Since Anderson, seated on the town council, would have a vote on the justice\u2019s budget, she would have a conflict of interest, in violation of the Hatch Act.\n\n\u201cAs long as this court has jurisdiction over the police chief\u2019s jurisdiction, I don\u2019t see the conflict of interest going away,\u201d said Morell. \u201cEither Leon directly, or someone who works for Leon, brings tickets to this court. The judge will have to listen to their case and consider their credibility; meanwhile, the board member controls her budget.\u201d\n\nCitizen Barry Ford asked, \u201cHow often does that come up?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d said Morell. \u201cWe only have one judge, so it would have to get reassigned. In that circumstance, it would come up a lot\u2026 the other legal issue is Leon\u2019s parting shot. He said, \u2018I will pursue an Article 78,\u2019 which is the vehicle for challenging an action of a board or an office.\u201d\n\nAnderson was elected to the Covert town board in November, but held office only a few weeks in January before concerns about conflict of interest inspired him to resign. Filling his place was the next topic of interest for the board, although grumblings from the audience indicated that some people thought the board was rushing forward. The town of Covert will be placing a notice in the newspaper soliciting candidates for a one-year appointment to the town council. Applications will be accepted until March 11.\n\nFormer town councilman Chuck Bosman, who garnered the least votes in the three-way race for two seats last November, announced his intention to apply.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Ithaca Times", "description": "Un-resignation Not Accepted", "title": "Police Chief Off Covert Board", "url": "http://www.ithaca.com/news/south_seneca/police-chief-off-covert-board/article_eb7cff20-d029-11e5-898e-931d0c2bca15.html", "image": {"width": 690, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/ithaca.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/f0/0f081236-d02a-11e5-9b2a-97d10c00f2a1/56bb8b91c5d3d.image.jpg?crop=690%2C423%2C235%2C628&resize=690%2C423&order=crop%2Cresize", "height": 423}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theithacatimes", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Un-resignation Not Accepted", "fb": {"app_id": 197614650372133}, "keywords": "south_seneca", "google-site-verification": "oeV8u9GfTPXfM4E0H_qNRsnlXd320HwE48iD6uX7qzc", "news_keywords": "south_seneca"}, "article_summary": "A packed town hall watched the town council mull over a resolution to accept (or deny) Anderson\u2019s resignation.\nFilling his place was the next topic of interest for the board, although grumblings from the audience indicated that some people thought the board was rushing forward.\nThe town of Covert will be placing a notice in the newspaper soliciting candidates for a one-year appointment to the town council.\nHowever, town attorney Pat Morell said, \u201cLetters of resignation are sent to the town clerk.\nHe said, \u2018I will pursue an Article 78,\u2019 which is the vehicle for challenging an action of a board or an office.\u201dAnderson was elected to the Covert town board in November, but held office only a few weeks in January before concerns about conflict of interest inspired him to resign."}
