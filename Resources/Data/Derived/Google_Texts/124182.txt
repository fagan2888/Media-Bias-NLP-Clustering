Islamic State supporters have threatened to kill Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and other Twitter employees for shutting down jihadi accounts.

In a post Sunday on the anonymous forum justpaste.it, which was also shared on Twitter, the group drew an illustration of Mr. Dorsey in crosshairs.

“You started this lost war; we told you from the beginning that it’s not your war but you didn’t understand and closed down our accounts — we’ll come back, but when our lone lions silence your breath, you won’t come back,” the post said in Arabic, CNN reported.

“For the ‘individual jihadi’ all over the world, target the Twitter company and its interests in any place, people, and buildings, and don’t allow any one of the atheists to survive,” the post said.

Twitter said it is working to confirm whether the threats are serious.

“Our security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials,” a spokesman told CNN.

Twitter’s terms of service explicitly ban “direct, specific threats of violence against others.” The social media site has followed YouTube’s lead in actively taking down accounts tied to the Islamic State terror group.
