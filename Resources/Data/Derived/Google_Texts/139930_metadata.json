As part of the NHL\u2019s two-game Stadium Series next season, the Avalanche will face the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday night, Feb. 27, 2016 at Coors Field.\n\nThe NHL\u2019s Winter Classic will be Boston vs. Montreal at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.\n\nThe other Stadium Series game will be Minnesota-Chicago at the University of Minnesota\u2019s TCF Bank Stadium on Sunday, Feb. 21.\n\nThe Avalanche issued a news release in the wake of the league announcement, quoting team president Josh Kroenke and executive vice president/GM Joe Sakic.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud and excited to be hosting this extraordinary event,\u201d said Kroenke. \u201cThe Coors Light NHL Stadium Series has been very successful, and we are honored to be part of it. We would like to thank the National Hockey League for selecting our organization. I\u2019m especially happy for Avalanche fans, who have been instrumental in our team\u2019s success since arriving in Denver.\n\n\u201cThe outdoor game will be the headline event of our franchise\u2019s 20th anniversary season in Colorado, with many other great events planned throughout the year.\u201d\n\nSaid Sakic: \u201cThis is a great day for our organization and our fans. Playing in an outdoor game will be an amazing experience for everyone. To have this game in the state of Colorado, in a terrific venue like Coors Field, is something we are truly looking forward to.\u201d\n\nAt the All-Star Game weekend in Columbus, commissioner Gary Bettman touched on the game at his news conference Saturday, noting, \u201cwhere better to play a Coors Light NHL Stadium Series than at Coors Field. And that game will be played in prime time.\u201d\n\nThe NHL and the NHL Players Association also announced that the World Cup of Hockey will return for an eight-team tournament in Toronto from Sept. 17 to Oct. 1, 2016. The eight teams: Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden, United States, Europe (other European nations), and North American Youngstars.
