Plan ahead and buy a policy that will cover your expenses.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a new problem: Even insurers think it\u2019s unaffordable.\n\nLife insurance firms pitched long-term care policies as the prudent way for Americans to shoulder the cost of staying in nursing homes. But those same companies have found that long-term-care policies are squeezing their profits. Earnings for life insurers slid 11 percent in the most recent quarter, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and long-term care was the chief culprit.\n\n\u201cInsurers that sell these products lose money on them,\u201d said Vincent Lui, a life-insurance analyst at Morningstar. \u201cSo they\u2019re raising prices and also trying to get out of the business right and left.\u201d\n\nFour of the five largest providers \u2013 including Manulife and MetLife \u2013 have either scaled back their business or stopped selling new policies, according to Moody\u2019s. The largest provider, Genworth Financial, continues to offer them, yet has struggled under the weight of rising costs.\n\nThe trends behind the industry\u2019s troubles sound like good news outside the world of insurance. Older Americans are healthier and living longer. But that makes it difficult for the industry to turn a profit. For older Americans and their families, however, there are few options besides private insurance. Medicare doesn\u2019t cover nursing home stays except in certain circumstances. The Obama Administration had planned to make a long-term insurance program part of the Affordable Care Act but eventually abandoned it.\n\nSean Dargan, an analyst at Macquarie Group, expects to see more people turning to Medicaid, the government\u2019s health insurance for the poor, to cover the costs of care.\n\n\u201cIt could really blow a hole through state budgets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think states and the federal government are going to need to think creatively to find a way out of this.\u201d\n\nFor insurance companies, long-term care has proven to be a tough business.\n\nGenworth, based in Richmond, Virginia, has turned in losses for two straight quarters. On March 2, the company reported that it discovered errors in its accounting for funds set aside to cover long-term care claims, knocking its stock down 5 percent in a single day. Analysts say problems with these policies explain why Genworth has lost more than half its market value over the past year, plunging from $17 to a recent $7.79.\n\n\u201cTheir single biggest product is long-term care, and look at their share price,\u201d Lui said. \u201cIt\u2019s one trouble after another.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Tom McInerney, Genworth\u2019s CEO, said his company has been taking steps to make long-term care insurance a viable business, raising prices on older policies, introducing new products and throwing out previous assumptions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly a very high need for these policies,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cGiven high demand and the limited number of insurers offering it today, I think it can be a very good industry going forward.\u201d\n\nWhen they began selling policies widely in the 1980s, the industry made a slew of assumptions about how long people would live, health care costs and interest rates. Nearly all of them turned out wrong, analysts say.\n\nTake life spans. At nearly 79 years, overall life expectancy in the U.S. has never been higher, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s the biggest issue, analysts say, because it means more people who took out policies stick around to make claims, moving into nursing homes and asking insurance companies to help cover the steep bills.\n\nThe rate for staying at a nursing home has gone up an average of 4 percent every year for the last five years, according to Genworth\u2019s annual survey. In 2014, the median bill for a shared room topped $6,000 a month.\n\n\u201cThey were making their best estimates at the time. They just turned out to be wrong,\u201d said Shachar Gonen, a Moody\u2019s analyst who covers the industry. \u201cIf insurers knew full well what they were getting into, they probably would have priced their policies much higher. So who knows if the long-term insurance business would have ever started.\u201d\n\nTo cope with mounting costs and faulty assumptions, insurers have been cutting benefits and hiking their premiums year after year. Average premiums for new policies rose nearly 9 percent over the past year.\n\nAnalysts who follow the industry think insurers have learned from their missteps and probably figured out the right price to charge for long-term care policies to turn a profit. The problem is, it might be too high for most people to pay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the opinion that it\u2019s appropriately priced today,\u201d said Macquarie\u2019s Dargan. \u201cBut it\u2019s also out of reach for most middle-income Americans. And that\u2019s who needs it the most.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK \u2013 Thirty years ago, insurance companies had the answer to the soaring cost of caring for the elderly.
