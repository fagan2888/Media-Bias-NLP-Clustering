(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nIowa Democratic Party Press Secretary Josh Levitt, in a press release previewing the presidential candidates at the Iowa State Fair, wrote that the \u201cGOP candidates in attendance will continue to support out-of-date, out-of-tune policies that leave Iowa\u2019s families behind. And no amount of delicious fried food can make up for the stale taste of their backwards policies.\u201d\n\nCharlie Szold, the communications director for the Republican Party of Iowa, sent out a \u201cwelcome mat preview\u201d to the fair, touting the GOP candidates as the \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d He asserted that Democrat Hillary Clinton had never seen the Iowa-based movie of the same name, pointed out that Clinton was skipping The Des Moines Register\u2019s Iowa State Fair Soapbox, and announced a news conference about how Clinton had lost voters\u2019 trust.\n\nSo when Levitt and Szold met up Thursday at the Iowa State Fair, no one would have been surprised if they engaged in a Monster Arm Wrestling death match, threw cow chips at each other or tried to toss their counterpart off the Sky Glider.\n\nWell, maybe not the last one. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of heights,\u201d Levitt admitted.\n\nInstead, they visited the butter cow, checked out the big bull and snacked on Bauder\u2019s ice cream. To round out their strangely alliterative state fair afternoon, they engaged in a friendly baseball pitching contest on the Midway. A strange outing for two political adversaries in high-profile jobs during the Iowa Caucuses, perhaps. It was not at all unusual for Levitt and Szold, who are buddies.\n\nLevitt, 25, of New York, and Szold, 25, of Connecticut, met eight years ago as freshmen living on the same dorm floor at American University in Washington, D.C.\n\nLevitt was impressed by Szold\u2019s intellect. \u201cCharlie immediately struck me as somebody that was a very deep thinker but also very passionate about what he believed in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from the very get-go we didn\u2019t agree on much, but it was a blast talking to him\u201d about all kinds of issues.\n\nSzold initially homed in on a shared interest (the Mets) but came to appreciate Levitt as a grounding influence to his more volatile personality. \u201cI feel like I can be a little bit more meteoric than Josh, and he kind of brings me back down to earth,\u201d Szold said.\n\nEach has leaned on the other during rough times. Levitt was grateful for Szold\u2019s compassion after the death of a close friend earlier this year. Szold found himself at loose ends after the 2012 election cycle and said Levitt was \u201calways a reasonable guy to talk to.\u201d\n\nNone of that changes the fact that the two of them argue fiercely over politics and policy. Szold credited one of their more heated arguments over Obamacare for inspiring him to make the move from journalism to politics. \u201cI was kind of losing my mind about it a little bit. And I realized that night that if I felt so strongly about something, that it was wrong to sit on the sidelines,\u201d Szold said.\n\nA few days later, Szold called his brother, Tom Szold, who was working at the Republican Party of Iowa for the 2012 cycle, and ended up taking a job as organizational director. When Levitt began exploring an opportunity with the Democratic Party here this cycle, Szold urged him to take it. \u201cCharlie said to me, you gotta do that,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cI think we always thought this would be amazing if this ended up working out.\u201d\n\nAlthough they are passionate about doing their best in high-profile, adversarial roles, they live within a block of each other and spend time together. Szold\u2019s girlfriend is also a friend and former roommate of Levitt\u2019s. \u201cWe are both very committed to doing our jobs very, very well, and it is our jobs to be as strong of an advocate as we can,\u201d Levitt said. But, he emphasized, politics doesn\u2019t define their friendship.\n\n\u201cIf it was a weaker friendship it might be a problem, but we\u2019ve known each other literally for eight years now. That\u2019s literally a lifetime from college and beyond,\u201d Szold added.\n\nIt helps, also, that both state political parties share the priority of keeping the Iowa caucuses the first in the nation. Szold and Levitt have worked together on joint projects such as announcing Microsoft\u2019s sponsorship of the 2016 caucus media center and both parties\u2019 participation in the Iowa Brown and Black Forum.\n\nNeither could recall a time when one of them persuaded the other to his point of view. \u201cWe help each other understand where each side is coming from,\u201d Szold said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to kind of paint yourself into a corner and you start having trouble understanding how anybody can possibly disagree with you.\u201d\n\nLevitt agreed. \u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is it\u2019s more than OK to disagree with somebody and still get along really well,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to hear in a society where polarized politics has become a deal-breaker in all kinds of relationships.\n\nAs for the baseball pitching, Levitt didn\u2019t seem either surprised or dismayed that Szold\u2019s 71-mph fastball blew away his 53-mph effort. Both of them walked away with prizes. And what good would Szold\u2019s oversized, inflatable bat be without Levitt\u2019s inflatable baseball?\n\nBuy Photo Kathie Obradovich (Photo: The Register)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1EcgOeJ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Two close friends talk about life in opposite corners as spokesmen for the Iowa Republican and Democratic parties.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Two close friends talk about life in opposite corners as spokesmen for the Iowa Republican and Democratic parties.", "title": "Column: Caucus politics can't cool longtime friendship", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/caucus/2015/08/21/column-caucus-politics-friendship-republican-democrat/32046239/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two close friends talk about life in opposite corners as spokesmen for the Iowa Republican and Democratic parties.", "title": "Column: Caucus politics can't cool longtime friendship", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df98413a770709437c6466f022d986ab80df0232/c=864-0-4320-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/State fairs", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/State fairs", "title": "Column: Caucus politics can't cool longtime friendship", "author": "Kathie Obradovich", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/kathie-obradovich/caucus", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07685c83f895bf0c6199e8efe706d3aae1292b26/c=1296-0-3888-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebf1a7a0cbe37ff421bdfb019e9283f02cf642ff/c=864-0-4320-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38f287cdb524567757cd04429c93779bc3eea0f2/c=294-0-4890-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/581841430c6ceab62aad91a49b47b140be4e887e/c=0-264-5184-3193&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-08-22T22:16:23.773000-05:00", "shorthed": "Column: Caucus politics can't cool longtime friendship", "articleid": 32046239, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a5076e7a43a0cec6129489319d0fb728e2cd1814/c=0-264-5184-3193/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca1ea7a66e5631d2588dd79efea7d8e7133341ad/c=1624-0-3559-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/21/IAGroup/DesMoines/635757721137277056-0822-Comm-Directors-Fair-01.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "column, caucus, politics, friendship, republican, democrat"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfea2\"", "article_summary": "To round out their strangely alliterative state fair afternoon, they engaged in a friendly baseball pitching contest on the Midway.\nIt\u2019s refreshing to hear in a society where polarized politics has become a deal-breaker in all kinds of relationships.\nSzold credited one of their more heated arguments over Obamacare for inspiring him to make the move from journalism to politics.\n\u201cIf it was a weaker friendship it might be a problem, but we\u2019ve known each other literally for eight years now.\nThe longtime friends met in college, and now hold the same positions in opposite political parties."}
