Police in Pueblo are seeking a man accused of driving a car that crashed early Friday morning, killing a 16-year-old girl, before fleeing.

Frankie Perea, 26, is being sought on a $500,000 cash-only bond on suspicion of vehicular homicide, failure to remain at a scene involving death and driving under suspension, according to a news release.

Perea was the driver, police say, of a Cadillac that failed to negotiate a turn, causing it to lose control and collide with a power pole. Perea fled the scene with two other passengers, according to the release.

Bernadette Trujillo, 16, was killed in the crash.

Police told The Denver Post they suspect alcohol and speed were factors in the crash.
