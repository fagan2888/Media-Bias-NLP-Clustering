In 2008, the American Medical Association adopted a resolution to end discrimination in health insurance coverage for transgender individuals. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ruled for the first time that transgender people are entitled to surgical benefits provided under Medicare Advantage insurers, including gender affirming.\n\n\"Now it's time for our regulatory authorities and officials to expand the definitions of health insurance coverage and critical care to include gender confirmation/reassignment and transgender-inclusive medical care,\" said Flippen. \"Doing this would allow smaller cities, like Wilton Manors, the ability to obtain sustainable transgender-inclusive healthcare which is currently available in other states and regions of our country.\"\n\nThe City of Wilton, a longtime leader in advocating for LGBT equal rights, will also advocate for other governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to support the advocacy efforts outlined in Resolution 2016-039. A certified copy of the Resolution will be transmitted to the National League of Cities, Broward League of Cities, the Florida League of Cities, the Broward County Legislative Delegation, and the U.S. Congressional Delegation for Florida.\n\n\"As a City, we advocate for positive change that eliminates barriers and creates a more equal society for all,\" said Flippen. \"We have made great progress, but there is still more to be done.\"\n\nOn May 24, 2016 at 6:15 p.m., City officials will permanently raise the pride flag at Jaycee Park, located across from City Hall at the corner of Wilton Drive and NE 21 Court. Then on June 18, 2016 the City of Wilton Manors will host the 17th Annual Stonewall Street Festival and Parade.
