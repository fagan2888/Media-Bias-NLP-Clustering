What better way to test your speakers and shake the walls of your house, while driving your parents crazy, than the insane instrumental from \u201cThey Only Come Out at Night\u201d?\n\nWhen a free Edgar Winter Band at Station Square turned up on the Drusky calendar, it occurred to me that I had never seen Edgar Winter live. Or at least I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve been too waaaay too many concerts. (By the way, \u201cEdgar Winter Band\u201d is a bit of a buzzkill; it\u2019s always been the Edgar Winter Group!)\n\nWith Rascal Flatts and Waka Flocka Flame passed off to interns, I had an open Friday night and realized there were worse ways to spend it than with one of rock\u2019s living legends, so don\u2019t laugh at me for reviewing this in 2015.\n\nThe location wasn\u2019t all that appealing as I had stopped by at another one of the free Friday shows and it was set up by the fountain, with a chintzy sound. I did not want to hear \u201cFrankenstein\u201d sounding worse than it did in my bedroom. Fortunately, this special Summer Jam had a big stage on the main road between the Hard Rock and Houlihan\u2019s and there were several hundred people there who had either brought chairs or were standing in front or along the sides. Average age in the 60s.\n\nWinter, with long white hair and shiny silver jacket, hit the stage with \u201cKeep Playing That Rock N\u2019 Roll,\u201d a song from 1971\u2019s \u201cEdgar Winter\u2019s White Trash\u201d that he probably never dreamed he\u2019d be doing at 68. His scratchy voice, comparable to Alice Cooper\u2019s, doesn\u2019t sound any worse for the wear and tear.\n\nWith the second song, he indulged his blues roots while testing the patience of everyone assembled. The three-piece backing band (a tight one) broke down \u201cTobacco Road\u201d so he could flash his scat vocal skills, which are indeed impressive. Then he kept doing it ... and doing it, turning it into a call and response with guitarist Doug Rappaport. You\u2019ve all seen this. Think Robert Plant. The singer scats something like do-do-la-do and then the guitarist plays it, and then he adds more syllables and it escalates from there. We got the idea right away. It went on for an hour (or maybe just 15 minutes \u2014 \u201cSunshine of Your Love\u201d was in there, too), but it was dedicated to his late brother/beloved guitar hero Johnny, so we waited that one out without complaining.\n\nThe blues-rock kept coming in the first hour, with more squealing solos than any of us have likely heard in ages, on \u201cTexas\u201d and \u201cTexas Tornado\u201d and hard-driving, hard-partying Edgar Winter Group cut \u201cHangin\u2019 Around,\u201d \u201cWe All Had a Real Good Time\u201d and the \u201cThe Power of Positive Drinkin.\u2019 \u201dAn instrumental of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cNobody\u2019s Fault But Mine\u201d was tossed in as well.\n\nFinally, he strapped on the portable keyboard and delivered into the monster riff of \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d It was the face-melting moment we were all waiting for, from the metal theme into the rock fusion middle with Winter juggling keyboard, sax and drums. The only thing we didn\u2019t need was the obligatory drum solo breaking the cohesion.\n\nThe Edgar Winter Band rocked to a crowd-pleasing, fist-raising finish that included another pair of classic-rock staples, \u201cFree Ride\u201d (a song from \u201cThey Only Come Out at Night\u201d written by late guitarist and Harrisburg native Dan Hartman) and \u201cRock N Roll, Hoochie Koo,\u201d a song that writer Rick Derringer recorded with brother Johnny.\n\nI don\u2019t have such a list, but if I did, \u201chearing \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 live\u201d might be on it somewhere, maybe down low. Now I can mentally check that off.\n\nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com; 412-263-2576.
