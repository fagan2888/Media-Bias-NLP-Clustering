He will pitch Sunday for the Triple-A Isotopes in Albuquerque.\n\nSo who will be on the mound for the Rockies?\n\nRELATED: Corey Dickerson returning to Rockies lineup soon, Weiss says\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a guy named TBA \u2014 he\u2019ll pitch Sunday,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said before Friday\u2019s series opener. \u201cWe\u2019ll announce a Sunday starter (Saturday). I can tell you we have De La Rosa tonight and (Chad) Bettis tomorrow. That\u2019s the breaking news.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies lost starter David Hale to a strained groin July 10. In his place last week, the Rockies used a piggyback of spot starters Gonzalez Germen and Aaron Laffey. Germen remains on the Rockies\u2019 roster, in the bullpen. Laffey was designated for assignment. Long reliever Yohan Flande will stay in the bullpen with Germen for now.\n\nThat would seem to reduce the potential starters to right-hander Eddie Butler, who would need to be recalled from Albuquerque. Butler was 3-6 with a 4.80 ERA in 11 starts this season before he was sent down in early June. In his six Triple-A starts, Butler is 2-2 with a 6.27 ERA.\n\nWATCH: Do the Colorado Rockies actually think they can contend in the second half of MLB season?\n\nButler\u2019s demotion was intended to give him room to work on his off-speed pitches. Butler, 24, was throwing off-speed pitches at 85 mph, with a fastball at 94. There wasn\u2019t enough separation in his velocity.\n\nButler\u2019s promotion, he said, was mapped for later this season.\n\n\u201cThey were talking to me about wanting me back up here to make a push for the playoffs,\u201d Butler said last month. \u201cThey said, \u2018Once you get that figured out, you\u2019ll be the first guy in the rotation to get back up here.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRELATED: Jon Gray remains in Triple-A after rough start\n\nGray, the No. 3 pick in the 2013 draft and a former University of Oklahoma star, is 2-2 with a 3.66 ERA in his past 10 starts in Triple-A. And he\u2019s earning strikeouts with a K-to-walk ratio better than 2.5-to-1.\n\nBut in his past start, last Sunday, Gray allowed six hits and four runs in just three innings.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jon Gray will wait, Rockies looking elsewhere for starting pitcher", "title": "Jon Gray will wait, Rockies looking elsewhere for starting pitcher", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/jon-gray-will-wait-rockies-looking-elsewhere-for-starting-pitcher/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__jon-gray-rockiesp1-6.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__jon-gray-rockiesp1-6.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T21:44:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T12:38:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In his six Triple-A starts, Butler is 2-2 with a 6.27 ERA.\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 The Rockies probably will continue to wait for prized pitching prospect Jon Gray, despite their need to fill an open slot in the rotation.\nGermen remains on the Rockies\u2019 roster, in the bullpen.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Once you get that figured out, you\u2019ll be the first guy in the rotation to get back up here.\u2019 \u201cRELATED: Jon Gray remains in Triple-A after rough startGray, the No.\nIn his place last week, the Rockies used a piggyback of spot starters Gonzalez Germen and Aaron Laffey."}
