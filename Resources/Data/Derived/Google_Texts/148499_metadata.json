Three of the organizations dropped out of the project. Of the 11 left, three became less active over the nine-month assessment. The study\u2019s authors found that the organizations with the most engagement had staff members experienced in organizational quality improvement and risk management.\n\n\u201cThis outcome suggests that even organizations with good intentions may be unable to achieve the goal of implementing a health IT safety project within a short time frame\u2014even with technical assistance from an outside organization,\u201d the study\u2019s authors said.\n\nThe study also found that the healthcare organizations were more likely to select known issues as problems, rather than issues identified through diagnostic research. It was harder to get resources and find solutions for IT issues that didn\u2019t align with existing priorities within the healthcare organization.\n\n\u201cWhile each hospital and ambulatory site completed a standardized diagnostic assessment designed to assist the staff at hospitals and ambulatory practices as they sought to identify potential targets for risk mitigation, most sites selected intervention targets on the basis of known problems with safety, quality, MU (meaningful use) criteria, or a combination of these items,\u201d the study\u2019s authors said.\n\nAmbulatory practices had more difficulty identifying and fixing IT problems than hospitals, and needed better tools to assist with the process. The study also found a disconnect between the size of IT projects and the amount of staff delegated to handle them. This contributed to what IT projects lacked the most: timely results and adequate resources.\n\nThe ONC says that it hopes the study will lead to IT solutions that integrate better with other patient safety agendas at healthcare organizations. The organization has published a guide to identify unsafe IT practices, and recommended practices for EHR implementation along with the study\u2019s results.", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Many healthcare organizations have little awareness of the risks associated with health IT.", "Description": "Many healthcare organizations have little awareness of the risks associated with health IT.", "og": {"url": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/content/tags/ehr/many-hospitals-clinics-not-prepared-it-risks", "image": "http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/HealthCare/2014/07/17/4997b800-3b94-48f0-a444-026859d6b853/AdvancedMD-In-Article-Text-Ad.png", "site_name": "Medical Economics", "description": "Many healthcare organizations have little awareness of the risks associated with health information technology (IT), according to a report prepared by RAND Health in collaboration with the Office o", "title": "Many hospitals, clinics, not prepared for IT risks"}, "DC.identifier": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/node/384978", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.publisher": "Advanstar Communications Inc", "DC.date": "2014-07-17", "last-modified": "Tue, 26 August 2014 22:31:16 GMT", "DC.creator": "Donna Marbury", "DC.source": "Medical Economics eConsult", "Keywords": "Many hospitals clinics not prepared for IT risks", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "EHR, EHR implementation, meaningful use, Modern Medicine Feature Articles, ONC, risk management, Health Care Information Technology, Practice Management", "emsContentType": "Many hospitals, clinics, not prepared for IT risks", "DC.title": "Many hospitals, clinics, not prepared for IT risks"}, "article_summary": "Many healthcare organizations have little awareness of the risks associated with health information technology (IT), according to a report prepared by RAND Health in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC).\nThe ONC says that it hopes the study will lead to IT solutions that integrate better with other patient safety agendas at healthcare organizations.\nAmbulatory practices had more difficulty identifying and fixing IT problems than hospitals, and needed better tools to assist with the process.\n\u201cThe research report finds that health IT safety often competes with other pressing priorities for limited resources within healthcare organizations,\u201d the ONC wrote in a blog post.\nThe study also found that the healthcare organizations were more likely to select known issues as problems, rather than issues identified through diagnostic research."}
