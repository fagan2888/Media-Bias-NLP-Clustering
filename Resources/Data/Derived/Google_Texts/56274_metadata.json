Trading five Islamist commanders for a single soldier now accused of deserting his comrades is something the administration still says was a good move. It sounds kind of crazy to say, but put it a larger context. While the president has worked against the idea of \u201ccreative destruction\u201d in the American economy, he\u2019s been an enthusiast for the idea when it comes to foreign policy.\n\n\n\nFor example, Saudi Arabia and Iran fighting a proxy war in Yemen under the shadow of a potential nuclear arms race is something any of Obama\u2019s recent predecessors would have sought to avoid. This administration, however, maintains that the president\u2019s policy on Yemen has been a good one. Some of this is just spin, but much of this attitude stems for a belief that the current wreckage and destruction in the region constitute \u201cbumps in the road\u201d that leads to stable, free societies. It\u2019s a long shot, to say the least, but it\u2019s not of much political consequence to the president. Democrats and Republicans alike are afraid to withhold funding for his war efforts and unable to force him to act differently. But what about his designated Democratic successor?\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes ride on many things, but arguably none so much as her ability to defend the Obama doctrine. She has praised the Bergdahl prisoner swap. She will have to keep on praising it, even as the defendant\u2019s trial proceeds \u2013 even as we hear more stories about the subsequent actions of the enemy fighters released or of the American lives lost and objectives squandered in the search for the alleged deserter. The same goes double for the nightmare that followed the Libyan regime change she helped author. That is her main legacy as secretary of state. But her obligation to the Obama doctrine also applies to the disastrous courtship of Vladimir Putin and the nuclear deal with Iran. Clinton will nudge Obama on Syria, where she previously argued unsuccessfully for attacking the despot the U.S. is now aiding against a more virulent foe, and on the rupture of U.S.-Israeli relations. But the presumptive Democratic nominee will mostly have to think of new ways to sell her old boss\u2019 policies. That includes trading accused deserters for Taliban commanders.\n\n\n\n[\u201cThe fact that this administration began these discussions essentially conceding that they\u2019re going to allow enrichment to go forward with the Iranians just shows you that they don\u2019t have the same level of concern that I think I and Senator [Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] and many others out there have, that a nuclear Iran is a problem for the entire world, not just for Israel.\u201d \u2013 Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt Wednesday.]\n\n\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Ruling - Observing that a public unwilling to challenge government\u2019s fixation on spying is silently amending its Constitutional right to privacy, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano writes:\u201c[N]othing will destroy our personal liberties more effectively than the government refusing to honor them and Americans sheepishly accepting that. And without freedom, what are we?\u201d\n\n\n\nBOEHNER SCORES VICTORY WITH BUDGET, MEDICARE PLAN\n\nAfter a long winter, House leaders are having a happy spring. They passed, improbably, a budget with ease on Wednesday. The House today is expected to advance a bill that would end the annual kabuki dance of delaying scheduled cuts to Medicare from the Clinton-Gingrich budget deals of the 1990s. It\u2019s a big win for Speaker John Boehner who touts the deal in a National Review op-ed: \u201cWe know that more and more seniors have been losing access to their doctors because of Medicare rules. If enacted, this bill will permanently replace one of Washington\u2019s most infamous budget gimmicks, SGR, with a more stable system that rewards quality and innovation. In doing so, not only will we reassure seniors that they can count on Medicare and continue to see their own doctor, but we will also put in place a stronger Medicare program for Americans who are trying to care for elderly parents\u2026.This would be the first real entitlement reform in nearly two decades, and that\u2019s a big win for conservatives.\u201d\n\n\n\nMuch less fun than the name implies - Lots of yeas and nays but little legislation on tap today as the Senate holds it\u2019s politically charged \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d Hundreds of amendments have been teed-up in an effort by the parties to make their opponents across the aisle look bad by forcing Senators to go on the record on controversial issues.

It implies that the main challenge is to work imaginatively and empathetically to find common ground, creating conversational topics and cues that help make connections with people, despite their failing memory\u2026[I]t helps if we see that people with dementia are still involved in the struggle all of us are involved in, to make and remake ourselves, to find and assert who we are, even as we change and cast aside parts of who we once were \u2013 jobs, relationships, hairstyles\u2026Instead of squeezing people with dementia into complicated systems designed for people who can remember who the President is, we should find kinder, less judgmental ways to be with them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Under Paul\u2019s original proposal, defense spending would have dropped from $553 billion in the 2011 fiscal year to $542 billion in 2016\u2026 But under Paul\u2019s new plan, the Pentagon will see its budget authority swell by $76.5 billion to $696,776,000,000 in fiscal year 2016.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[Charleston, S.C.] Post Courier: \u201c[Sen.

The [Right to Rise] PAC recently completed a round of fundraisers focused on courting young professionals, with events held in Chicago, Miami and New York\u2026 The competitive GOP field includes several potential top contenders in their 40s and early 50s\u2026. In this group, the 62 year-old Bush stands out as an elder statesman. But political pollsters and demographers who study the data note that while age might help politicians forge connections with the young cohort, generational similarity is not determinative. Voters ages 18-34 want details.\u201d\n\n\n\nReligious right balking at Bush? - NYT examines how the religious right is seeking to unify behind a more conservative alternative to Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\n[Listen to Fox: Jeb Bush will join Brian Kilmeade on \u201cKilmeade and Friends\u201d at 11:30 am ET. ]\n\n\n\nToday - Former Gov.

The former House Budget Committee chairman -- who has been barnstorming the country trying to get enough states on board to ratify a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution -- says fiscal conservatism can't simply be about getting the ledger sheet to show a surplus. It must also be about applying that available money to the right kinds of programs to help socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans help themselves to a brighter future.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Kasich continues his Northeastern swing today with a stop in Maine to push for a balanced budget amendment.]\n\n\n\nFor real? - Howard Kurtz wonders if Kasich\u2019s presidential hopes, that are gaining a lot of media attention, are simply all talk.\n\n\n\nWITH ESTABLISHMENT BEHIND JEB, CHRISTIE ADOPTS HARDER LINE ON IMMIGRATION\n\nNew Jersey Star Ledger: \u201cGov. Chris Christie [R-N.J.] is supporting Texas and other states suing the federal government over President Obama's amnesty program for unauthorized immigrants. Christie this week joined governors in three states \u2014 Texas, Louisiana, and South Dakota \u2014 in a court brief opposing the federal government's request to implement executive orders, according to court documents. The lawsuit stems from court proceedings initiated by 26 states after Obama announced wide-reaching executive actions on immigration in November. New Jersey and the governor did not join the lawsuit. Rather, the governor opted to weigh in with the court arguing Obama's policies should not take effect.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Gov.
