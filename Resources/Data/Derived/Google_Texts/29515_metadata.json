In Georgia, under pressure from Disney and the NFL, GOP Gov. Nathan Deal on Monday vetoed a \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill that would have allowed faith-based organizations to deny service or jobs based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In South Dakota, Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have required students to use the bathroom or locker room that corresponded to their biological sex at birth, while a similar bill in Tennessee, to which GOP Gov. Bill Haslam objected, died in committee.\"\n\n\u2014 \"And a fierce firestorm is building in North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory signed a new law banning cities from enacting local non-discrimination ordinances \u2014 and immediately faced massive pushback from liberal protesters and big businesses alike, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Dow Chemical, American Airlines, and sports leagues.\" http://politico.pro/1RwPoRw\n\nBACK HOME \u2014 \"Supreme Court vise closes on Grassley,\" by POLITICO's Seung Min Kim in Rock Rapids, Iowa: GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley held firm on his decision not to consider President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, in a series of public appearances in Iowa on Monday. \"Repeating himself numerous times, sometimes in a stubborn tone, Grassley stressed to voters: Obama has the right to nominate someone, and the GOP-controlled Senate has a right to ignore him. Pressed about the fact that Obama won a full four years as president in 2012 \u2014 and so, in the view of his supporters, should get a Supreme Court justice of his choosing with nearly a year left in his term \u2014 Grassley shot back that voters elected a Republican Senate in 2014. The GOP is there to serve as a check and balance to Obama, the senator reasoned.\" http://politi.co/1RoKYPT\n\nDays until the Wisconsin primary: 7.\n\nDays until the 2016 election: 224.\n\nThanks for joining us.

Rob Portman today in Dayton, Ohio, according to Portman\u2019s campaign. \"Ohio voters have a crystal clear choice in the U.S. Senate race. Rob Portman is a tested and proven champion for American Free Enterprise. Leadership matters, and we appreciate his 91 percent rating with the U.S. Chamber,\u201d Rob Engstrom, the Chamber\u2019s national political director, said in a statement. Portman voted in line with the Chamber 91 percent of the time last year. And he\u2019s not alone: Every Republican senator facing a competitive general election has voted with the Chamber at least 80 percent of the time.\n\n\u2014 The Chamber is just starting to roll out endorsements, but its most recent voting scorecard gives an idea of where it might get involved on the House side. Thirty-eight representatives, all Republicans, voted with the Chamber 100 percent of the time in 2015, including several who are facing competitive reelection fights, like Reps. Martha McSally of Arizona, Bob Dold of Illinois, Tom Reed of New York and Barbara Comstock of Virginia. Don\u2019t be surprised if the Chamber makes them top priorities in the fall. But several Democrats also scored high marks, though, raising the possibility the Chamber \u2014 which typically backs at least a few Democrats each cycle \u2014 might support them, too. Nebraska Rep. Brad Ashford, a freshman Democrat representing one of the party's most daunting districts, also won the highest Chamber score of any Democratic member, voting with the Chamber 90 percent of the time.\n\n\u2014 The Chamber is also leaping into the Indiana Senate race, backing Rep. Todd Young over Rep. Marlin Stutzman in the GOP primary: A new Chamber TV ad is boosting Young by boasting of his attempts to repeal Obamacare. \"Are you counting down the days until it's over?\" the narrator asks over a black-and-white photo of President Barack Obama on the phone. \"But he's not done, not by a long shot. Thankfully, there's one Hoosier conservative standing up to Obama at every step, every turn. Todd Young is leading the fight to dismantle the worst parts of Obamacare.\" The ad is backed by a $500,000 buy. One Nation, a Republican nonprofit with ties to Senate leadership, is spending $250,000 on advertising for Young, who is running against Stutzman. The winner will face Democrat Baron Hill in November. Watch the ad: https://youtu.be/uB12YE88tHs.\n\nDISTRICT TV \u2014 Van Hollen goes up on the air in the D.C. media market: Rep. Chris Van Hollen\u2019s Senate campaign will start airing ads in the expensive Washington media market for the first time starting today, according to a media-tracking source, four weeks ahead of the April 26 Maryland primary. Van Hollen is spending about $118,000 on broadcast over the next week.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL PICKS \u2014 Retiring Hanna says never Trump \u2014 or Cruz: GOP Rep. Richard Hanna, who isn't running for reelection, told WVRO he won't vote for Donald Trump if he captures the Republican nomination \u2014 or Ted Cruz if he does. \"Do you really want these two men, one [Cruz] who said he would turn the Middle East to glass or another [Trump] one who thinks it's even rational to try to deport 11 million people, to build a wall and have the Mexicans pay for it,\" Hanna said. \"Ted Cruz wants to patrol Muslim neighborhoods, that's downright Orwellian and ridiculous on its face.\" Hanna hasn't endorsed a successor but spoke favorably of Republicans Steve Wells and George Philipps \u2014 and unfavorably of state Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney, who challenged him last year. http://bit.ly/1oit1a4\n\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cClinton super PAC readies early Trump strike,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Shane Goldmacher: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s biggest super PAC has already reserved $70 million in TV ads after this summer\u2019s conventions in battleground states, but the group is preparing for an even earlier assault on Donald Trump \u2014 possibly while he is still busy battling his fellow Republicans to secure his party\u2019s nomination. Guy Cecil, chief strategist for the pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action, said he watched for months as Republicans let Trump carve out his place within the Republican Party relatively unimpeded. He has no plans to allow for a general election repeat. \u2018We learned that you can\u2019t wait until the last minute to go after Trump,\u2019 Cecil told POLITICO in a wide-ranging interview.\u201d\n\n\u2014 His group has already been testing lines of attack, in part by analyzing the effectiveness of the very ads that Republican groups like the Club for Growth, American Future Fund and Our Principles PAC have aired against Trump. Cecil foreshadowed a brutal fall campaign that would question Trump\u2019s character, his temperament and a history of enriching himself at the expense of others. http://politi.co/1VRbvqV\n\n\u2014 \u201cBernie and Hillary prep for New York clash,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni: \u201cIn the 2014 New York Democratic primary for governor, an unknown progressive academic with an odd name staged an implausible challenge to the powerful sitting governor, Andrew Cuomo. Armed with an anti-fracking, anti-corruption screed, Fordham University law professor Zephyr Teachout managed to capture an impressive one-third of the vote -- and even won by some regions by large margins. Now, in advance of the New York\u2019s April 19 presidential primary, operatives for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are closely studying Teachout\u2019s longshot campaign. \u2018They\u2019re very worried about a Zephyr Teachout situation,\u2019 said one Clinton ally close to the campaign. \u2018The left is very mobilized. In New York [for Clinton] it\u2019s not just about winning. They have to win 65 to 35.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1LWoUvV\n\n\u2014 \"Trump's popularity nosedives in critical stretch,\" by POLITICO's Steven Shepard: \"Donald Trump wasn't wildly popular to begin with. And now he's becoming even more disliked among American voters, creating a significant threat to his chances of winning the Republican presidential nomination. Trump is, by far, the GOP delegate leader \u2014 and the only candidate with a realistic shot at winning a majority of delegates before the July convention. But at the same time, nearly two-thirds of Americans view Trump unfavorably \u2014 and his image rating has declined since Republican voting began in February.\" http://politi.co/1MxZbtH\n\n\u2014 New Crossroads ad reminds GOP: Clinton is the target,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cAmerican Crossroads, the high-profile Republican super PAC founded by Karl Rove, is set to kick off a digital ad campaign targeting Hillary Clinton, titled #NeverHillary, on Tuesday \u2014 a move suggesting that the group believes the GOP is at risk of overlooking the main objective of defeating Clinton while a debate over the #NeverTrump movement targeting front-runner Donald Trump consumes the party. The initial ad, focused on Clinton\u2019s past scandals, is just a 15-second video targeted to Washington, D.C., screens backed by a five-figure buy, but a group spokesman said it was the opening salvo of a broader anti-Clinton campaign.\u201d http://politi.co/1RwRRLM\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"Unlike you, Vladimir, I don't get to edit the piece.\" \u2014 President Barack Obama, who said at an awards dinner on Monday night that Vladimir Putin had called him to complain following Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s recent piece in The Atlantic on Obama\u2019s foreign policy. http://bit.ly/1LVwFC9\n\n** A message from Sinclair Broadcast Group: News, opinions, and entertainment surround us 24/7, yet a fundamental truth remains, whether for competitive races or impactful ballot measures, the TV commercial reigns as the medium for reaching potential voters.
