But some battalions have openly said they were made up of volunteers from various countries, including Russia.\n\nUkraine's army has forced the rebels back toward the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, where the separatists have boosted their defense, and fighting has raged since a Malaysian airliner was downed last week.\n\nShelling and explosions were heard around rebel-held Donetsk on Saturday, and many shops were shuttered as Ukrainian forces pressed their military campaign against pro-Russian separatists.\n\n\"Last night was terrible. I was woken up at 3 a.m. by the explosions. The walls shook, the windows shook,\" said Marina, who lives in a southern part of the city.\n\n\"There was shooting all over the city. And it still goes on. Maybe it's a little quieter now, but it's all around.\"\n\nLocal officials said some buildings had been damaged, one by fire, and one woman was wounded.\n\nIn Luhansk, rebels said at least 19 civilians had been killed in fighting overnight and local officials said 60 percent of the city was left with no electricity after power lines were damaged.\n\nKiev's troops have also advanced from the south and their frontline checkpoint on a road from the Azov Sea city port of Mariupol now sits some 10 kilometers outside of Donetsk.\n\n(Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic in Donetsk, Lina Kushch
