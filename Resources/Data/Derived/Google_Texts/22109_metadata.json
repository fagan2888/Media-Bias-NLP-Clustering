Along the way, transgender people marked some major victories, setting up for what could be a great 2016.\n\n1) \u201cCall Me Caitlyn\u201d\n\nThe biggest trans-related news event of the year for cis people was probably Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s coming out party on the cover of Vanity Fair, and it was a pretty big deal for the trans community, too. In a candid interview later followed by a frank reality show exploring her newly-transitioned life, Jenner opened up to the cis community about trans experiences. More importantly, she\u2019s followed up with ferocious advocacy on a variety of issues, including hate crimes. While some in the community think she doesn\u2019t go far enough \u2014 or recognize her privilege as a wealthy woman who can afford the safety of coming out publicly, paired with expensive procedures throughout transition \u2014 she\u2019s having a major impact on the cis community\u2019s views about what it means to be trans.\n\nIn July, she accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, making an impassioned speech about the need to build a better world for trans people, especially children. \u201cTrans people deserve something vital; they deserve your respect,\u201d she said, urging the audience to join her in stamping out transphobia.\n\n2) Medicare and the Affordable Care Act affirmed coverage for transgender care\n\nIn the Medicare realm, a Department of Health and Human Services ruling determined that people covered by the government program were also entitled to transition services, overturning a previous exclusion. Multiple states had already indicated that they viewed health coverage exclusions barring transition care as discriminatory, forcing Medicare\u2019s hand. Trans rights organizations challenged the agency, arguing that for patients with gender dysphoria, medical transition was a proved and medically indicated treatment that should be included in the program\u2019s comprehensive coverage for older adults and disabled Americans.\n\nObamacare also took a stand for transgender people covered under health care exchanges. A new administrative rule barred discrimination on the basis of gender identity, requiring insurers that deny procedures to prove that they\u2019re not doing so because patients are transgender. While this doesn\u2019t outright mandate care for transgender people, it has a similar effect, given that medical transition is supported by most major medical organizations and refusing to cover procedures deemed necessary by clinicians is not permitted. Denying a medically-indicated procedure could result in discrimination claims, an incentive for insurance companies to pay for transition services without comment.\n\n3) Gavin Grimm, Nicole Maines, Tamara Lusardi, and many more earned the right to pee\n\nWhile multiple states attempted to scare voters with threats that transgender people were planning on taking over the bathroom, some trans people won their own victories over discrimination, forcing schools, workplaces, and municipalities to accommodate them by allowing to use the appropriate bathrooms for their gender. If the right to pee doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, imagine not being able to use public restrooms, and the subsequent humiliation, frustration, and potential health care consequences.\n\nIn Virginia, Gavin Grimm successfully won the right to use his school restroom in a case against the Gloucester County School Board. Teenager Nicole Maines also defeated discrimination in her community after a hard-fought case that started with being followed into the women\u2019s restroom by another student\u2019s grandfather. At the time, she was a fifth grader. In April, Tamara Lusardi won a ruling from the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission against the Army, which refused to accommodate her while she transitioned at work, referring to her as male and ordering her to use the men\u2019s room.\n\n4) Jessi Dye and others fought employment discrimination\n\nDiscrimination on the job, especially for transgender women, is a significant issue. Without formal employment protections under the law in many areas, it\u2019s difficult to fight employers who harass transgender women at work or fire them because of their gender identity. A growing body of EEOC rulings and lawsuits, however, is starting to establish precedent for making it easier to law the groundwork for discrimination suits.\n\nJessi Dye successfully fought the man and won, receiving a financial settlement from the nursing home that fired her for being transgender. The settlement also includes a requirement that the home provide anti-discrimination training to staff. Given that she filed the case in Alabama, the victory in a conservative state is an indicator that the times are changing everywhere, not just in more liberal climates.\n\n5) Transgender inmates made strides for human rights\n\nWith help from the Southern Poverty Law Center, Ashley Diamond secured her release from prison after enduring unspeakable abuse from officials and inmates alike. The organization plans to continue litigation in order to protect other women like her who have been denied medical care and safe housing. California, meanwhile, was ordered to provide transition care to Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, who spent years seeking treatment for her gender dysphoria. In Maryland, Sandy Brown used the Prison Rape Elimination Act to successfully sue over sexual assaults committed by prison guards, forcing the state to overhaul its management of transgender inmates.\n\n6) Extra protections for California\u2019s trans foster kids\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 731 into law in October, requiring child welfare workers to place children according to their gender identity, not according to any medical or legal records referencing a conflicting sex or gender. Since many transgender children end up in foster care and experience significant abuse from transphobic or uneducated host families, this law represents a huge shift in the way such children will be handled in California, creating a safer home environment for those who need it most.\n\nThe groundbreaking law is the first in the country to explicitly provide guidance on the placement of trans kids. While the foster system is in need of a range of critical reforms, this is an important step for children previously endangered by inappropriate placements.\n\n7) \u201cGrowing Up Trans\u201d hit Frontline\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Cait who hit the air waves. In June, a feature-length documentary on Frontline explored the lives of transgender children in America, highlighting the fact that people are transitioning at younger ages thanks to a growing awareness of trans issues. \u201cGrowing Up Trans\u201d explored the lives of transgender girls and boys at various stages in transition, including some who were just starting to explore hormones and other options. Like other Frontline features, it reached a wide audience, including cis viewers who weren\u2019t necessarily literate in trans issues, providing a glimpse into the lives of transgender people. This kind of humanization is a major victory, as it can break down the social barriers that contribute to transphobic attitudes by showing viewers that trans kids are just like everyone else.\n\nSuch public discussions offer another important benefit: For trans kids who might feel isolated or confused, they offer a chance to learn more about gender identity and the fact that they aren\u2019t alone.\n\nPhoto credit: Disney | ABC Television Group", "article_metadata": {"description": "2015 marked a major year for the transgender community, between changes to health policy and Caitlyn Jenner's prominent reveal.
