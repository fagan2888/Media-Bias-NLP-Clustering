Ted Cruz picked up the endorsement of one of his Senate colleagues. ( Reuters photo )\n\nWednesday, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) picked up the endorsement of one of his Senate colleagues.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), in his endorsement, said Cruz has always been a \"fierce defender of the Constitution\" and a \"tireless advocate for conservative principles.\" He also noted the Texas senator has spent his entire career fighting for the men and women of the U.S. and \"pushing back against the special interests\" in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Ted is the only candidate who will change the way Washington works and restore the balance of power back to the American people,\" he said. \"It's time for Republicans to rally behind this campaign in order to put forth the best candidate to stop Hillary Clinton in November. I am confident Ted Cruz is that person and I'm thrilled to endorse him for president.\"\n\nBefore joining the Senate, Gardner was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 2005, and became Minority Whip in 2006. He was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.\n\n\"Cory has spent his time in Congress focused on improving the economy, creating jobs, and fighting for the people of Colorado,\" Cruz said. \"He has stood up and been a strong advocate for conservative principles like stopping the train wreck that is Obamacare and this dangerous deal the Obama administration struck with Iran. I am honored to have Cory's support and look forward to working together to continue to coalesce Republicans around this campaign.\"\n\nDraw closer to God.
