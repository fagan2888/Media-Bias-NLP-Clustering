They don\u2019t want to get our hopes up,\u201d he said.\n\nElijah reportedly has lost some eyesight and may have suffered some brain damage, but the extent of both remains uncertain.\n\nThe family is counting on Elijah\u2019s determined spirit, which was displayed frequently as he honed his skills while competing in wrestling in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt got him this far, so now we\u2019ll see what else he can give us,\u201d Olivas said, adding Elijah does what medical staff asks of him.\n\nElijah is able to communicate despite having his jaw wired shut. He is on a feeding tube as doctors focus on rebuilding his stamina.\n\n\u201cHe gets tired really easy when he\u2019s awake,\u201d Olivas said. \u201cWhen they try to do anything with him, he gets tired fast so they\u2019re just talking it really slow with him.\u201d\n\nThe family had hoped Elijah, a Tunnell Elementary School student, would be home in time for the holidays, but doctors say late January is more realistic.\n\nElijah keeps telling his family, \u201cI want to go home,\u201d his dad said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because he really misses his baby sister,\u201d Olivas added.\n\nDue to influenza season between November and March, younger children are not allowed to go beyond the lobby into patients\u2019 rooms, Olivas said.\n\nShortly after the accident, Olivas family and friends began planning fundraisers, including one held at Applebee\u2019s.\n\nA Go Fund Me page created for people to donate money to help the family was nearing $12,500 on Friday, with a goal of $20,000.\n\nBefore the crash, Martinez had picked up the boys for wrestling, as he had done previously, said the Olivas family's attorney, James McKiernan.\n\nBut Martinez was acting strangely while driving them to Nipomo. After the vehicle came to a stop, the 16-year-old took over driving, intending to take Martinez, who reportedly was under the influence of pills prescribed to him, to Marian Regional Medical Center.\n\nHowever, Martinez lunged toward the driver, and attempted to strangle the teen while the vehicle was in motion as the younger boys tried to contain the adult. The driver lost control and the vehicle rolled over, ejecting Elijah whose seat belt came unlatched during the fracas.\n\nA civil lawsuit could be filed at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just still investigating the situation trying to determine the responsible parties,\u201d said McKiernan, who is based in San Luis Obispo.\n\nA national wrestling association may be one defendant in a future lawsuit since the crash occurred while Martinez was fulfilling his duties as a coach, the attorney said, adding that for now, the focus is on getting the family stabilized and Elijah out of the hospital.\n\nHe said they remain hopeful they will be able to negotiate a settlement.\n\nMeanwhile, the criminal case continues against Martinez. On Monday, he appeared in San Luis Obispo County Superior Court for an amended arraignment after the District Attorney\u2019s Office added a count of felony mayhem.\n\nEarlier, he was charged with multiple counts, including assault causing great bodily injury, felony battery, willful cruelty to a child, interfering with a driver\u2019s control of a vehicle, and being under the influence of a controlled substance.\n\nAs Elijah battles back from his injuries, Martinez, a youth wresting coach, remained in San Luis Obispo County Jail on Friday with bail set at $100,000, according to the Sheriff\u2019s Office website.\n\nTwo weeks ago, his family solicited character-reference letters from family, friends and ex-wrestlers of Martinez, asking via social media that they be sent to his defense attorney, Angela Kowal. She did not returned a call seeking comment.\n\nMartinez is scheduled to next appear in court Dec. 14 for a pre-preliminary hearing for the case being prosecuted by Deputy District Attorney Lindsey Bittner.\n\nThe District Attorney\u2019s Office is asking that anyone who may have been a witness to the accident involving the dark green Toyota Avalon, or who stopped to render aid or direct traffic, contact investigator Neil Clayton at 805.781.5877.\n\n\"We just want to make sure we get everybody,\" Clayton said.\n\nThe crash occurred just after 5:30 p.m. Oct. 19 on Thompson Road, which runs parallel to Highway 101 in southern San Luis Obispo County.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk North County editor Janene Scully can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
