There are just three days left to make a final pitch to undecided voters and to encourage supporters to turn up Tuesday.\n\nHere's the election buzz for Saturday.\n\nObama message targets women\n\nWith many in his party facing tough races, President Obama is appealing to a group that has been critical to his electoral success: women. Obama carried 55% of the female vote in his 2012 re-election bid against Mitt Romney and 56% in 2008 when he defeated John McCain.\n\nPresident Obama campaigns with Rhode Island Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gina Raimondo on Friday in Providence, R.I. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nDuring a swing through Rhode Island Friday, the president talked up issues like paid family leave, day care and equal pay, saying: \"When women do well, everybody does well.\"\n\nMobilizing female voters will likely be critical for Democrats locked in tight races.\n\nErnst to pull an all-nighter\n\nRepublican Joni Ernst is leaving nothing to chance in the battleground Senate contest in Iowa. She announced that she's embarking on a 24-hour blitz that will run until Tuesday morning to wrap up her campaign. Ernst is facing Rep. Bruce Braley in the race to succeed Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.\n\nJoni Ernst, Republican candidate for Senate in Iowa, waves to supporters on Oct. 30 in Ames, Iowa.

President Obama finished 2012 with a 72-hour marathon, while Bob Dole wrapped up his unsuccessful 1996 presidential campaign with a 96-hour tour across the country.\n\nOh what a tangled voting web we weave\n\nHere's another wrinkle for Election Day: Several recent court decisions have changed voting regulations in key states, modifying laws ranging from the length of early voting periods to measures on showing ID at the polls.\n\nVoters at the polls Nov. 6, 2012, in Columbus, Ohio.

Meanwhile, Democrats are relying on boosting turnout and have expressed concern about confusion at the polls and voters being turned away on Election Day.\n\nWeiland vs. Reid\n\nRick Weiland isn't running against Harry Reid in South Dakota's Senate race, but you'd be hard-pressed to tell. Weiland, a Democrat, has started a national petition to encourage another Democratic senator, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to challenge Reid for party leader.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nWeiland's beef is likely based on the fact that he wasn't Reid's preferred choice in the open-seat Senate race. After the race briefly appeared to become competitive, Republican Mike Rounds is pulling away from Weiland and independent Larry Pressler, according to recent polls.\n\nIt doesn't sound as if Weiland is going to call a truce with Reid anytime soon. \"This is a fight I intend to continue no matter how long it takes,\" he said.\n\nSaturday surrogate highlights\n\nPresident Obama is in Michigan on Saturday to stump for Rep. Gary Peters, the Democratic candidate in the state's open Senate race, and Mark Schauer, the party's candidate for governor. Meanwhile, first lady Michelle Obama will be in Illinois to boost Democrats, including Gov. Pat Quinn who's in a tight race.\n\nOn the GOP side, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a potential 2016 contender, will stay in his home state and lend support to Gov. Rick Scott. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, another possible 2016 candidate, heads to Alaska to boost Dan Sullivan, who's trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, according to The Washington Post.\n\nHanging chads\n\nThe 2014 election could bring about several milestones.
