She knows what it\u2019s like to wonder about the future.\n\n\u201cEvery day we tell kids, \u2018You are going to go to college,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nAnd she is fluent in Spanish and knows some Arabic, which comes in handy when the seventh-graders in her reading class are inclined to behave like, well, seventh-graders.\n\n\u201cI can text your mom in English, Spanish and even a little Arabic if I catch you saying a bad word,\u201d Liz\u00e1rraga will tell them when they try to play her.\n\nTom Boasberg, superintendent of Denver Public Schools, said first and foremost, Liz\u00e1rraga and another TFA corps member with deferred status, Alejandro Fuentes Mena, were hired to work in DPS because they are great teachers.\n\n\u201cI think beyond that, teachers who can really connect with the life circumstances of our kids, that\u2019s a huge additional plus,\u201d Boasberg told me.\n\nDPS has taken some grief about hiring these two, but Boasberg is unapologetic.\n\n\u201cWith the president\u2019s order they are fully, legally able to work in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado is one of the first states to take TFA corps members who have temporary resident status through the DACA program.\n\nAs you may recall, DACA offers young people without legal status who came to the U.S. before they were 16 years old the opportunity to live and work here temporarily without fear of immigration action.\n\nIncidentally, part of the stipends for these teachers is paid for with a grant from the Ben and Lucy Ana Walton Fund, part of the Walton Family Foundation.\n\nYes, those Waltons.\n\nI wonder if this is the kind of thing critics are referring to when they decry the \u201ccorporatization\u201d of public schools. If so, I think I like it.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you get a situation that is a winner all around, but that\u2019s what we have here. It\u2019s a wonderful thing.\n\nE-mail Denver Post editorial writer Alicia Caldwell at acaldwell@denverpost.com.
