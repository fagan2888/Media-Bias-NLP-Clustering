We did not expect what was happening politically between Russia and the United States to affect what happens in space,\u201d Russian Federation spokesman Yevgeniy Khorishko told The Washington Times. \u201cPolitics should not overshadow this partnership when there are this many years of cooperation. We have good assets and experience to do this job together. It is natural for us to continue.\u201d\n\nSince its space shuttle program ended in 2011, NASA has relied on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) via Soyuz rockets launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, others, such as the European Space Agency, have been developing their own means for putting people into orbit.\n\nWashington\u2019s already-strained relations with Moscow reached the breaking point earlier this year when pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine sought to break away from Kiev\u2019s government. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and has massed troops on the border with its smaller neighbor. Western nations have accused Moscow of fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine and supporting rebels battling Ukrainian forces \u2014 charges that Russian officials deny.\n\nIn response to NASA\u2019s memo, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin publicly accused Washington of sending mixed messages, tweeting, \u201cYet, apart from the ISS, we didn\u2019t cooperate with NASA anyway.\u201d\n\nRussia also boosted its space agency\u2019s budget by $52 billion and announced it was declining a NASA proposal to extend the ISS beyond 2020. According to The Moscow Times, Russia\u2019s space agency, Roscosmos, would \u201cbe looking to other projects and partners.\u201d\n\nBut Russian officials told The Times that NASA\u2019s memo has not hurt \u201clong-standing cooperative efforts\u201d between the two countries and that they believe the U.S. and Russia need one another to conquer the final frontier.\n\n\u201cI have noticed some changes in who is participating at conferences, but for the most part it has not really affected any of the ongoing joint programs,\u201d said Alexander Trofimov, who specializes in scientific and military affairs at the Russian Embassy in Washington.\n\nMr. Trofimov said \u201cmany technologies developed by both Russia and the U.S. are used by one another,\u201d such as space-based satellite navigation systems and rocket building. He also noted the unprecedented cooperation that allowed 1975\u2019s Apollo-Soyuz project, the first joint U.S.-Soviet space flight and the last flight of an Apollo spacecraft.\n\n\u201cIf it were not for that joint effort, we may not have the Soyuz rockets that are taking both Russian and American astronauts to the ISS today,\u201d Mr. Khorishko said.\n\nWashington and Moscow have cooperated on space exploration since 1993, when they merged the Russian space station Mir and the U.S. station Freedom to create the International Space Station.\n\nU.S.-based satellite launch companies who spoke to The Times only on the condition of anonymity said that the continued use of Russian cosmodromes is vital.\n\nNASA declined to comment and referred to a statement it released in May: \u201cSpace cooperation has been a hallmark of U.S.-Russia relations. We have not received any official notification from the Government of Russia on any changes in our space cooperation at this point.\n\n\u2022 Jeffrey Scott Shapiro is a legal analyst for The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moscow wants to work with Washington to further space exploration despite a recent NASA memo noting the crisis in Ukraine has nearly severed prospects for partnership, Russian officials say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Moscow wants to work with Washington to further space exploration despite a recent NASA memo noting the crisis in Ukraine has nearly severed prospects for partnership, Russian officials say.", "title": "Moscow: Continue U.S. cooperation in space", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/20/moscow-continue-us-cooperation-in-space/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/20/rocket.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/20/rocket.jpg", "description": "Moscow wants to work with Washington to further space exploration despite a recent NASA memo noting the crisis in Ukraine has nearly severed prospects for partnership, Russian officials say.", "card": "summary", "title": "Moscow: Continue U.S. cooperation in space"}, "Author": "Jeffrey Scott Shapiro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "NASA, Russia, Washington, Moscow, International Space Station"}, "article_summary": "Washington and Moscow have cooperated on space exploration since 1993, when they merged the Russian space station Mir and the U.S. station Freedom to create the International Space Station.\nWe have not received any official notification from the Government of Russia on any changes in our space cooperation at this point.\nNASA declined to comment and referred to a statement it released in May: \u201cSpace cooperation has been a hallmark of U.S.-Russia relations.\nMoscow wants to work with Washington to further space exploration despite a recent NASA memo noting the crisis in Ukraine has nearly severed prospects for partnership, Russian officials say.\nWe did not expect what was happening politically between Russia and the United States to affect what happens in space,\u201d Russian Federation spokesman Yevgeniy Khorishko told The Washington Times."}
