Bloomberg, who endorsed Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, said he\u2019s told Obama the same thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job to pull them together,\u201d Bloomberg said during a question-and-answer session at the Sarasota Opera. \u201cThere is more that he could do to pull them together.\u201d\n\nLater Bloomberg suggested Obama could have been finding out when members of Congress and their spouses had birthdays, and send them flowers as a token gesture.\n\nBloomberg said it is all about having a more human touch with members of Congress.\n\nBut while he criticized the president for not doing more to build relationships with Congress, he praised Obama for working on health care reform. Bloomberg said the roll out of the Affordable Care Act was \u201cterrible\u201d but said at least Obama\u2019s trying to do something about people who cannot afford health care.\n\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s trying,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nLater, Bloomberg said Obama\u2019s critics are going to jump on him no matter what he does.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing Obama can do that Republicans won\u2019t criticize,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nRead more about what Bloomberg had to say about his own presidential ambitions from my story from the weekend here.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "During Sarasota stop, former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg says President Barack Obama could do more to bring Congress together.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "A good florist would go a long way in improving President Barack Obama\u2019s relationships with the U.S. Congress, according to former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s trying,\u201d Bloomberg said.\nBloomberg, who endorsed Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, said he\u2019s told Obama the same thing.\n\u201cThere is nothing Obama can do that Republicans won\u2019t criticize,\u201d Bloomberg said.\nBloomberg said the roll out of the Affordable Care Act was \u201cterrible\u201d but said at least Obama\u2019s trying to do something about people who cannot afford health care."}
