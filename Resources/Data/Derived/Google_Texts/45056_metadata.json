Brian Owens doesn\u2019t struggle with the memory of being shot in the face. But he has a hard time describing how it felt.\n\nThe closest he can come: \u201cIt kind of felt like being punched really hard with a screwdriver going straight into your jaw.\u201d\n\nFew know better than Owens the dangers of responding to a domestic violence call.\n\nThe Maury County Sheriff\u2019s lieutenant still vividly remembers the day he was shot, how the dispatcher\u2019s voice sounded when he was sent out to a home on Sowell Mill Pike and how he expected the call to be a bad one.\n\nIt was.\n\nThere was a domestic disturbance between Damon Grady Brewer and his wife, Denise. Damon Brewer was drunk and threatened to shoot both his wife and himself. As Owens and his partner approached the home, they heard sounds of a fight inside.\n\nWith weapons drawn, the deputies stepped onto the porch. Owens tried the front door knob. It was locked.\n\n\u201cHe heard me trying the door and shot five times,\u201d Owens recalled. \u201cThe first shot hit me, and the other four shots missed me and my partner.\u201d\n\nOwens remained \u201cvery conscious\u201d as he took cover behind his patrol car.\n\n\u201cIt was then that I realized I couldn\u2019t talk and was bleeding profusely out of my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cI could tell I had a lot of damage done to my neck from the inside. That\u2019s when it started hurting.\u201d\n\nA powerful .357 magnum slug had punched dead center through Owens\u2019 chin, blasting out three teeth and shattering his jaw. After nicking a vertebra just under his skull, it lodged inside his neck.\n\nThat was nearly five years ago.\n\nDamon Brewer later hanged himself in the Giles County Jail. Denise Brewer survived. And despite all the reasons not to, Owens returned to the force just as soon as he recovered.\n\n\u201cThe thought of getting out of it never really occurred to me,\u201d Owens said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I love, and just because that happened to me, I wasn\u2019t going to let that stop me. I still love it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d been a patrolman for several years before that fateful day, and being in law enforcement was all he ever wanted to do. He served in the military police right after high school. When he was discharged, he started working at the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nSince he returned to the department after his recovery, Owens said he\u2019s been asked several times if he could\u2019ve avoided being injured. Sure, the training was focused on safety. But there will always be days like that one in December 2008, when something happens that you don\u2019t expect, he said.\n\n\u201cI did it the only way it could have been done, but if it\u2019s gonna happen, it\u2019s just gonna happen,\u201d Owens said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s one of the realities that we face as law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got to respond to a call and provide a solution as quick as we can. I\u2019m still here and I\u2019m thankful for that,\u201d he added. \u201cProtecting lives and property is what we do, and I hope to continue to do that.\u201d\n\n\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\n\nStaff writer Ric Bohy contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lt.
