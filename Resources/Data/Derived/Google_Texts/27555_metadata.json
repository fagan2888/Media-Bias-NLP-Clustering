Then came the simple matter of his wardrobe for \u201cCelebrity Name Game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not going to wear a suit. I\u2019m going to break that rule,'\u201d Ferguson said. Wrong decision, he quickly realized, after taping the first few episodes of the syndicated daytime show debuting Monday.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the shows back, I couldn\u2019t tell who was in charge,\u201d he said.\n\nOn came the business suit, fitted over the sly, irreverent style that his nighttime fans know from CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,\u201d which began airing in 2005.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t have tackled a game show without the opportunity of making it his own, Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cI liked this one because the format was loose and it left a lot of room for playing around and improvisation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a new format, which meant that people weren\u2019t in love with the game itself and wouldn\u2019t get mad at me if I started messing around with it.\u201d\n\nThe challenge, Ferguson said, is to mess around while still observing the rules of the game. He\u2019s getting the hang of it as he tapes 180 episodes in a three-month production window, with hopes that the show is renewed so he can do more mischief.\n\nCourteney Cox is confident he\u2019s right for the job. The \u201cCougartown\u201d and former \u201cFriends\u201d star is an executive producer on the show along with her ex-husband, David Arquette.\n\n\u201cCraig is the perfect host,\u201d Cox said. \u201cHe is hilarious, irreverent and so spontaneous. He is unflappable and really enjoys himself, which is contagious for everyone around him.\u201d\n\nThe show, based on the board game Identity Crisis, pairs celebrities with contestants to figure out \u2014 using improvised clues \u2014 the names of actors, singers, athletes, politicians and other famous folk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Craig Ferguson plays it loose with new game show", "title": "Craig Ferguson plays it loose with new game show", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Craig Ferguson plays it loose with new game show", "title": "Craig Ferguson plays it loose with new game show", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/craig_ferguson_plays_it_loose_with_new_game_show/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/tv-craig-ferguson.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Craig Ferguson plays it loose with new game show", "title": "Craig Ferguson plays it loose with new game show", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/tv-craig-ferguson.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynn Elber", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ab6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Craig Ferguson approached his first TV game show host\u2019s job with a subversive attitude.\nI\u2019m going to break that rule,'\u201d Ferguson said.\nOn came the business suit, fitted over the sly, irreverent style that his nighttime fans know from CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,\u201d which began airing in 2005.\nHe wouldn\u2019t have tackled a game show without the opportunity of making it his own, Ferguson said.\nThen came the simple matter of his wardrobe for \u201cCelebrity Name Game.\u201d\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not going to wear a suit."}
