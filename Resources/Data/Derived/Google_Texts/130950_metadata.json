The White House\n\nThe way some outlets have covered the story, you would think the president violated sacrosanct State of the Union tradition by rolling out content in advance on social media.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a break with tradition. But here\u2019s why it makes sense in today\u2019s environment.\n\nPolitical campaigns and corporations have millions of dollars to spend to market their brand, product, and ideas. In the White House, that budget is zero\u2014so you\u2019d better get creative.\n\nIn 2010, more than 48 million people watched the State of the Union address. But Americans increasingly get their content online, not on television. The average American watched six fewer hours of live TV per month in 2014 than he or she did in 2013\u2014and twice as many households are now \u201cbroadband only,\u201d meaning they don\u2019t subscribe to cable.\n\nRather than fight the inevitable, the Obama administration has adapted\u2013and used a variety of social media platforms to outline the president\u2019s major State of the Union proposals in advance.\n\nIt was a shrewd way to take the president\u2019s agenda directly to the platforms where people get their information, unfiltered, and reach the communities that care the most about specific issues.\n\nThat\u2019s why senior adviser Valerie Jarrett took to LinkedIn to announce the president\u2019s renewed push for paid sick days and family leave\u2014directly reaching affected employees and telling employers that the administration means business.\n\nTo explain the administration\u2019s proposal to improve and expand access to broadband, President Barack Obama taped a video on an iPad from the Oval Office and posted it Upworthy, the Web site popular with millennials.\n\nThe video the White House posted on its Facebook page\u2013with the hashtag #FreeCommunityCollege\u2013 to explain the president\u2019s education proposal, has been viewed more than 8 million times. (The Republican response, a Taylor Swift GIF post from House Speaker John Boehner, was not comparable by any means.)\n\nThe strategy of rolling out proposals on platforms that cater to their target audiences is about more than appearing hip to young voters\u2014it\u2019s about understanding the ways in which our media landscape is changing and recognizing that traditional modes of communication are giving way to more dynamic methods of digital content consumption.\n\nThese sorts of social media efforts are becoming the norm for politicians of all stripes. Jeb Bush\u2019s recent super PAC announcement was made not via press release but broadcast to the world via shaky Instagram video.\n\nWhile televised speeches and traditional media will continue to have their place, a digital-first approach holds tremendous opportunity for those who wish to speak directly to targeted audiences without the media filter.\n\nThat\u2019s why the president has an interview on Thursday with YouTube stars Bethany Mota, GloZell Green, and Hank Green\u2013whose combined following is almost 14 million.\n\nStephanie Cutter is a partner at Precision Strategies.
