This means the war for talent is on, and if you\u2019re not thinking ahead then you\u2019re already behind.\n\nUnfortunately a horde of new patients isn\u2019t the only issue facing healthcare recruiting. The skills gap is also making competition for the best candidates downright brutal. According to Careerbuilder, 23 percent of employers have open healthcare positions they just can\u2019t fill due to the difficulty of finding candidates with the right skills.\n\nThings are especially dire if you\u2019re looking to recruit doctors or other medical professionals. Currently the U.S. is suffering a shortfall of about 20,000 doctors, but it\u2019s about to get much worse. Projections estimate by 2020 this shortfall will grow to encompass more than 90,000 doctors. One of the major reasons for this shortfall is a retiring physician population; today nearly half of all doctors are over the age of 50.\n\nWith so many challenges, finding the right person for your open positions can feel insurmountable. Every challenge, however, is really an opportunity in disguise. To find the right people faster than your competition, you\u2019re going to need to display some ingenuity. You\u2019re going to need to be one step ahead of the pack.\n\nHere are a few ways to beat your competition to the best people and jump the skills gap in a single bound:\n\nLook for temp talent\n\nSometimes the best way to find great people is to hire temporary talent. Temporary workers can help your organization plug holes in your workforce while you continue the hard work at recruiting. But these temporary workers can often impress you so much they transition into full time superstar employees.\n\nAccording to a Careerbuilder survey, 27 percent of employers are looking to hire temporary talent this year. This number might not seem impressive until you consider the year before only 12 percent of employers were looking for temporary workers. Obviously the temporary market is heating up, since temp workers are a great way to test-drive a candidate before you commit to a long-term commitment.\n\nReduce employee turnover\n\nSpeaking of a long-term commitment, a way to cut down on your recruiting volume is to ensure employees stick around. Currently 75 percent of employed healthcare workers don\u2019t feel they\u2019re being paid enough. These dissatisfied employees will be dreaming of greener pastures, leaving you with open positions to fill. They\u2019ll also be leaving you with a big bill: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reports it costs on average over $36,000 to replace a registered nurse.\n\nHow do you reduce employee turnover and save money? One way is to ensure candidates will fit into the company culture before hiring. It\u2019s not enough for candidates to have the right skills, they also need to sincerely enjoy the work environment and mesh well with coworkers and patients.\n\nIt\u2019s important to use the interview process to ask about working style, communication skills, and their ideal workplace. Know what your candidate wants out of the job, before you hire someone who will soon set sail for brighter shores.\n\nFind better ways to evaluate high candidate volume\n\nThe Society of Human Resource Management discovered the typical time-to-hire is between 29 and 43 days. You certainly can\u2019t afford to wait this long to fill some of your essential healthcare positions, especially not with 32 million additional patients on the way. You need a faster way to evaluate candidates.\n\nThe one-way video interview can help. In a one-way video interview, candidates answer employer\u2019s questions on video. These video answers can then be watched at any time and for any duration. If you discover someone is all wrong for the job, you can easily move on to the next person without losing any extra time.\n\nA typical phone screen will have you stuck on the line for 30 minutes or more, when you could have watched about 10 one-way video interviews in that time, according to research from the Aberdeen Group. This allows you to focus your time and efforts on the right people.\n\nBuild up talent pipelines\n\nUsing new technology to solve old problems is a great way to get ahead of the hiring curve when it comes to filling your healthcare positions. Social media might be how you keep track of far-flung family members, but it can also be a vital recruiting tool.\n\nYou can use social media to connect with candidates on a more personal level, evaluate their professionalism, and build up your talent pipelines. This is probably why 94 percent of recruiters are currently using social media in the hiring process.\n\nTwitter chats, Facebook discussions, and LinkedIn posts can all be great places to connect with talent and see the way they think about industry-related issues. Some of these people might be great hires, but they\u2019re just not right for your current positions. Thanks to social media connections, you can build a relationship with these smart candidates so when the right opening comes along, you already know the perfect person for the job. Like video interviews, social media shortens time-to-hire, while also helping you build up a tech-savvy employer brand.\n\nWith 32 million patients coming, you can\u2019t afford to be left behind in the stampede. It\u2019s time to get ahead of the curve so you never miss out on hiring the best.\n\nWhat are some ways you plan to use to win the healthcare war for talent?
