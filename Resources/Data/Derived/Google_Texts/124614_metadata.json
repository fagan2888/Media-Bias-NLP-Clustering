What they found was a widespread and lucrative scam operation. The report ranked the groups by the amounts they spent during the 2014 election cycle, and found that the bottom 10 PACs spent a combined $54 million overall, but just over $3.5 million was actually spent on candidates running for office. The rest was pocketed by consultants or vendors, and it was all (probably) legal, owing to our grossly complex and loophole-ridden campaign finance laws.\n\nWhat the report did was to spell out in quantifiable terms one of the defining characteristics of the modern conservative movement \u2013 it is a lucrative moneymaking machine for scam artists and hucksters. If you\u2019re a politically engaged conservative, you\u2019re being inundated by radio hosts, right-wing publications, think tanks, and all manner of unscrupulous activists who purchased your email address and want to exploit your love of Ronald Reagan or Ted Cruz to squeeze a few dollars out of you. And there\u2019s at least one 2016 presidential candidate who\u2019s in on the grift: Mike Huckabee.\n\nThe New York Times reported yesterday that Huckabee, who is entertaining another presidential bid, was until recently a pitchman for a shady company that claims it can \u201creverse diabetes\u201d with cinnamon and chromium picolinate. Huckabee\u2019s also lent his name, face, and reputation to people claiming to have \u201cnatural\u201d methods to reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, financial firms that perpetrate blatant fraud upon their customers, and a group that claims to have found the cure for cancer in the Book of Matthew.\n\nThat\u2019s bad enough, but it\u2019s made even worse by the fact that part of Huckabee\u2019s public image is that of a person who took control of his own health and transformed his life for the better. He testifies for the efficacy of the cinnamon cure for diabetes by claiming that similar \u201ctechniques\u201d worked to treat his own diabetes. He\u2019s abusing that image to sell people with life-threatening health problem bottles of dodgy herbal supplements and cockamamie Bible-based cancer cures. At best he\u2019s a scam artist; at worst he\u2019s a monster.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s people know that this doesn\u2019t make him look good, which is why they\u2019re adamant in pointing out that the former governor isn\u2019t in the cinnamon-and-insulin business anymore. Per the Times: \u201cMr. Huckabee\u2019s spokeswoman, Alice Stewart, said his contract to promote the diabetes cure ended the first week in March. \u2018It was something created several months ago, back in 2014, but due to possible future plans, they have concluded the relationship.\u2019\u201d If Huckabee does run, this shady business will follow him around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Huckabee is a grifter and charlatan.
