And the veteran journalist says he\u2019s disappointed that in nearly 45 years, it appears not much has changed in the way of safety.\n\nThe VA Puget Sound Health Care System mostly trailed the top performers in the Department of Veterans Affairs health care network in evaluations for overall quality of care over the past year-and-a-half, reported The Seattle Times.\n\nKen Schram said on KIRO Radio\u2019s Andrew Walsh Show he nearly died decades ago in surgery at a VA hospital.\n\nHe thinks it was about 1975 when he, working without medical coverage, needed surgery for kidney issues. From what Schram knows, the urologist that was assigned to him at the VA hospital failed to properly tie his renal artery, and he bled out on the table.\n\n\u201cI wound up having to receive 17 pints of blood and everybody thought I was going to die.\u201d\n\nDuring the procedure, the doctors needed to bring him back to a certain amount of consciousness. He was still in surgery, but he couldn\u2019t feel any of the pain. In disbelief that he was on the operating table and awake, he tried to tell the doctors he could hear them.\n\n\u201cI could hear voices but I couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying,\u201d recalled Schram. \u201cSomeone lifted my eyelid and I saw them and the next thing I know, I woke up in intensive care.\u201d\n\nSchram credits his survival not to his original urologist, but to a another doctor brought in from Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane.\n\nThe doctor said Schram was tough, he had the will to live, and he was too young to die.\n\nWhen he first started having medical issues, Schram was hesitant to visit a veteran\u2019s hospital because they had such terrible reputations, but he said he had little choice.\n\n\u201cOne would think that in 45 years, the VA would have caught up with itself,\u201d Schram said. \u201cThe report (\u2026) illustrates how poorly we treat our veterans.\u201d\n\nThe Puget Sound VA received some of the worst scores in a measurement of how many patients die in the hospital while receiving acute care. It often had a mortality ratio more than twice that of facilities that received five stars.\n\n\u201cWe send (U.S. soldiers) over to put them in harm\u2019s way, to face death, to face maiming, to face dismemberment, to face PTSD,\u201d said Schram. \u201cWe ask huge amounts of dedication from them and then we drop the ball when it comes to taking care of them in the aftermath.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A KIRO Radio host recalls a life-threatening experience at a veteran's hospital after reading a review of veteran affairs hospitals in the Puget Sound area.
