Lanza\u2019s act was one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. But the man who knows that Adam Lanza would have effortlessly added his name to his list of victims is Lanza\u2019s own father. In a riveting interview in the new issue of the New Yorker, Peter Lanza opens up about the son he lost and the pain he lives with.\n\nTo be the father of a man who committed an atrocious act \u2013 a man who killed small children \u2013 is to live with a burden few of us can even imagine. The elder Lanza no longer knows what to do with family photographs. He can\u2019t display photos of Adam, but he feels it\u2019s wrong to leave up pictures of his surviving son, Ryan. He hadn\u2019t seen Adam in two years before the shooting at Sandy Hook, and he asks himself what he could have done differently, because \u201cNo outcome could be worse.\u201d\n\nAs Andrew Solomon poignantly writes in his profile, there is ongoing dispute over how to calculate the losses of that December day in Newtown, Conn. Twenty-eight people died, but the tally often stops at 26. Adam Lanza\u2019s mother, whom he shot in the head four times, owned the rifle that fueled his rampage, so her victimhood is often mingled with blame in the accounts of what transpired. Peter Lanza says that \u201cThe reason Adam shot Nancy four times was one for each of us: one for Nancy; one for him; one for Ryan; one for me.\u201d And though Lanza\u2019s life ended that day, he\u2019s rarely counted in the same breath as the children he murdered. That\u2019s what Peter Lanza lives with every day. The death of his 20-year-old son. The knowledge of the harrowing grief he caused. When Solomon asks Lanza what, if anything, the family did as a funeral for Adam, he replies, \u201cNo one knows that. And no one ever will.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Lanza chose to tell his story to Andrew Solomon, whose exquisite 2012 book, \u201cFar From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity,\u201d explored what it\u2019s like to raise children far outside the ordinary experience, including children who kill. And Solomon\u2019s handling of Lanza\u2019s story is almost as powerful as Lanza\u2019s own testimony. He sensitively reveals a man who now lives in a state of \u201csustained incomprehension\u201d \u2014 a seemingly decent man who had a son he says it\u2019s \u201cclear\u201d was loved. A man who bred a monster and who now warns, \u201cI want people to be afraid of the fact that this could happen to them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The father of Sandy Hook Adam Lanza reveals what it's like to raise a murderer", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The father of Sandy Hook Adam Lanza reveals what it's like to raise a murderer", "title": "\u201cHe would have killed me in a heartbeat\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/10/he_would_have_killed_me_in_a_heartbeat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/adam_lanza1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The father of Sandy Hook Adam Lanza reveals what it's like to raise a murderer", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/adam_lanza1.jpg", "title": "\u201cHe would have killed me in a heartbeat\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cHe would have killed me in a heartbeat\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adam Lanza, Andrew Solomon, Asperger Syndrome, Far From The Tree, New Yorker, Newtown school shooting, Peter Lanza, Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd46\"", "article_summary": "To be the father of a man who committed an atrocious act \u2013 a man who killed small children \u2013 is to live with a burden few of us can even imagine.\nTopics: Adam Lanza, Andrew Solomon, Asperger Syndrome, Far From The Tree, New Yorker, Newtown school shooting, Peter Lanza, Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting, Life NewsThe man says resolutely that Adam Lanza \u201cwould have killed me in a heartbeat, if he\u2019d had the chance.\u201d They\u2019d be chilling words coming from anyone who\u2019d ever encountered Lanza, the young man who on Dec. 14, 2012, shot and killed his mother, then killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School before turning the gun on himself.\nBut the man who knows that Adam Lanza would have effortlessly added his name to his list of victims is Lanza\u2019s own father.\nThat\u2019s what Peter Lanza lives with every day.\nIn a riveting interview in the new issue of the New Yorker, Peter Lanza opens up about the son he lost and the pain he lives with."}
