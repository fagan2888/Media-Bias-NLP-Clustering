AURORA — A huge, 14-pound rabbit was found in Aurora — but the animal’s owner has not been located.

The Flemish Giant was found under a car in the Smoky Hill area on Friday, and the man who found him contacted Aurora Animal Hospital.

While this rabbit may seem large by regular standards, vets say Flemish Giants can grow to between 40 and 50 pounds.

Aurora Animal Hospital said the rabbit was covered in fleas when it was brought in, but the staff cleaned him up.

“If the owners don’t come forward, (the man who found him) will adopt him,” said hospital assistant manager Kelly Holmes.

If you know who the rabbit belongs to, please contact Aurora Animal Hospital at 303-680-7305.
