The University of Southern Mississippi is one of 13 schools nationally losing its Army Reserve Officer Training Corp. program at the end of the 2014-2015 year.

And Gov. Phil Bryant and University of Southern Mississippi President Rodney Bennett want to know why.

The Army is closing 13 of 273 ROTC programs nationwide. The Army said in letters to the schools that it is responding to downsizing and other financial constraints.

Bryant and Bennett told a news conference Thursday in Hattiesburg that 87 students are now enrolled in the ROTC program with 17 scheduled to be commissioned as lieutenants in May 2014.

USM's program began in 1950.

Bryant and Bennett have asked Army Secretary John McHugh to conduct another review of the USM program.
