Vulnerabilities that have scored as high or critical [like in this instance] are a real concern and indicate serious problems. These are items that should be immediately addressed without delay. It\u2019s also a real concern that these critical issues were not discovered earlier and that customer data has potentially been exposed for such a long period of time.\u201d\n\nThe New Mexico health exchange launched as a hybrid, Nu\u00f1ez explained: While the state ran the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) enrollment for around 125 employers, providing coverage for about 600 total residents, individuals within the state bought their coverage from HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange, during the last enrollment period. New Mexico\u2019s individual-enrollment marketplace is expected to open in November 2014.\n\n\u201cWe operate the SHOP, and to the extent that we have personal information there, we would protect it,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. He added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any occurrences of any breaches or anything like that, so our vendor is just responding to the audit, and that\u2019s what we know so far. . . . We are working to address the issues identified in the audit with our systems integrator and have every expectation of holding all of New Mexico citizens\u2019 personal information in high regard and confidential.\u201d\n\nA DHHS OIG spokesperson said he could not comment on the details of the report. NRO has filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for a redacted copy, which is pending.\n\nPaul Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, a New Mexico\u2013based free-market think tank, says that such vulnerabilities are \u201cnot a surprise, given the complexities and rushed nature of the project.\u201d\n\nBut, he says, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning any time consumer information may be unknowingly put out in public. It\u2019s a very serious [risk] of identity theft.\u201d\n\nHHS\u2019s inspector general may later issue a modified version of the report \u201cwhich does not contain sensitive information that would identify specific weaknesses attributed to the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange,\u201d according to records reviewed by NRO.
