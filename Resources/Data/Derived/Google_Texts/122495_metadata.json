A new study published this week shows that non-white children have particularly low use.\n\nResearchers from The University of Michigan surveyed 601 parents about their car seat usage for 1 to 12-year-old children that received treatment at the emergency room. They found that non-white parents were nearly four times less likely to use appropriate child car restraints than white parents.\n\nDoctors and policy makers have known of this disparity and attributed it to socioeconomic variables. But the new study shows that differences remained even after accounting for education and income.\n\n\u201cPeople have suggested that racial disparities in restraint use are due to differences in socioeconomic status,\u201d said lead author Dr. Michelle Macy, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan, in an email. \u201cOur results demonstrate the answer is more complicated than that.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the authors noted that because race continues to be a \u201csignificant predictor\u201d of appropriate car seat usage, \u201csuggests that modifiable factors not measured in our study, such as parental knowledge, motivation, barriers, and sociocultural norms, may contribute to disparities.\u201d\n\nOthers point out that income and education are not the only factors when accounting for differences in racial and socio-economic disparities.\n\n\u201cInjury prevention often suffers with greater social stress,\u201d said Dr. Lee Sanders, co-director of Stanford\u2019s Center for Policy, Outcomes and Prevention. \u201cFactors like single-parent families and greater number of kids can make it difficult to keep up with changes from kid to kid.\u201d Both of these factors are associated with lower socio-economic status and were not directly accounted for in the study.\n\nLaws on injury prevention vary from state to state which may make it difficult for anyone, but particularly adults with greater social stressors, to track what kind of car seat is appropriate at what age.\n\n\u201cState laws generally fall short of \u2018optimal\u2019 child passenger safety recommendations,\u201d said Dr. Macy. This may be due in part to state legislators lagging behind recent changes to the American Academy of Pediatric guidelines released in March 2011 that place greater emphasis on child size than child age when determining when to transition from car seats, booster seats, and ultimately the front seat.\n\n\u201cKeep kids in a rear seat whenever possible,\u201d said Dr. Macy, \u201cusing a rear-facing car seat beyond 1 year and until the child outgrows the car seat\u2019s rear-facing weight or height limit.\u201d She added that children should be in a booster seat from the time they outgrow their forward-facing car seat \u2014 until an adult seat belt fits properly.\n\nHaving the proper car seat and knowing how to use it is one thing, but getting your kids to stay in them is another.\n\n\u201cOne of the most effective methods is to tell the kids that you won\u2019t start the car until they are safely in their seat,\u201d said Dr. Sanders, \u201cand don\u2019t let the kid trying to get out of their seat or complaining, fool you into thinking they are safe without their child seat.\u201d\n\nRegardless of race, proper child passenger restraint use is known to save lives. California has been one of the leaders in keeping its guidelines up-to-date with the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many studies have shown that parents don't always use carseats and booster seats, and their kids could be at increased risk in a crash.
