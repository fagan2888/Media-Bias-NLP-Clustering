CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) â€” Police say a 30-year-old man stabbed his wife, the couple's two young sons and his wife's father at a home in Cheyenne, then fled in a car and is believed to have been killed in a collision on a Colorado interstate.

The Cheyenne Police Department says in a statement Saturday that police went to the home late Friday after receiving several hang-up 911 calls. Officers found four people, including a four-year-old and a six-year-old, with multiple stab wounds from a knife. The victims were taken to a hospital and are in stable condition.

Police say officers were told that Randall Van Woerkom had attacked his family after he was confronted by allegations of infidelity.

The officers then tried to call him, but were told at about 1 a.m. Saturday that he was thought to have been involved in a fatal crash on Interstate 25 in Weld County, Colorado. Authorities there are working to confirm the person's identity.
