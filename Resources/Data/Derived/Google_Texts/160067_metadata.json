But Obama\u2019s problem this time will be mostly with Democrats, who, under pressure from unions and environmentalists, resist creating the largest free-trade zone ever.\n\nThose, of course, are the same constituencies that led the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trade pact signed when a Democratic president stood up to such critics \u2014 and Hillary resided at the White House.\n\nAs secretary of state during Obama\u2019s first term, Hillary was the one who first came up with the idea of the \u201cpivot,\u201d and it formed the basis of her boss\u2019 goal of \u201crebalancing to the Pacific.\u201d\n\nBut the idea soon disappeared from the administration\u2019s talking points, overtaken by other world events.\n\nYet one item, the TPP, remained on the agenda. Negotiators from the pact\u2019s 12 countries continued their talks quietly.\n\nSources in DC and in Tokyo tell me that some issues remain between them: American automakers dislike Japanese competition, and Japan\u2019s beef and other agricultural producers feel the same about their US rivals. But on both sides, it seems, negotiators believe they\u2019re finally now close to inking a deal.\n\nIts prospects could surely advance this week, with Abe in Washington. Negotiators believe once there\u2019s an agreement between Japan and America, the largest economies in the envisioned bloc, the rest of the TPP partners will sign on.\n\nUnless, of course, Congress kills the whole thing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and her progressive crowd, joined by some on the right, are mounting a fight against the TPP.\n\nRemember then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s instructions that \u201cwe have to pass ObamaCare to find out what\u2019s in it\u201d?\n\nNow Democrats in Congress, including Pelosi, want the opposite: Sign the TPP first, then Congress will tweak and rewrite it to assure there\u2019s nothing truly free-trade about this \u201cfree-trade\u201d agreement.\n\nA small number of Pat Buchanan-like Republican protectionists and those who oppose anything Obama are along for the ride.\n\n\u201cNo negotiating country will compromise on sensitive issues unless they know that what the US says will be final, and that there will not be a \u2018yes, but Congress wants more\u2019 argument,\u201d a Tokyo official told me. But some in Congress want exactly that. They could sink whatever progress there is in the negotiations.\n\nThe \u201cfast track\u201d bill to prevent that by giving Obama a free hand in the negotiations is still in some doubt. And even if it passes, lawmakers could still nix the final deal once it comes back for Congress\u2019 OK.\n\nThe TPP can be Obama\u2019s real legacy. It will last for decades and positively transform trade between America, Japan and some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, as well as countries like Taiwan, which will be associated with the pact.\n\nIt could boost economic growth and help, finally, take the US economy out of its maddeningly slow recovery from its blah years.\n\nIt\u2019ll also give the Asian bully, China, a run for its money. Unlike Obama\u2019s other legacy \u2014 a pact that would allow Iran to dominate the Mideast, with nukes no less \u2014 this one deserves full support from Americans and their representatives in Washington.\n\nWhich makes Hillary a key player. Support from her could push fence-sitting Democrats in favor of Obama\u2019s deal. Unfortunately, in her presidential quest, Hillary now needs to shore up her own support from the party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nSo as of yet she\u2019s playing it cool, first hinting she\u2019s for it and then maybe against it.\n\nTrue, the deep mutual hate-fest between the Obamas and Clintons is well-known, and Hillary might not want to help the president burnish his legacy. But this is a part of his record that she herself was involved with \u2014 and she\u2019d share the credit.\n\nSo how about it, Hill? Yes, supporting Obama on this may be politically problematic in the short run.\n\nBut if you do become president, won\u2019t you want the economy to be humming nicely again \u2014 you know, like it did back in the Clinton years?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton was the first member of the Obama administration to promote the sound idea of a \u201cpivot to Asia.\u201d\nSo why is she now so ambivalent about what would become the chief legacy item of", "title": "Will Hillary stand up for Asia-trade treaty --- and the US economy?", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hillary21.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@bennyavni", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-9655051\"}", "sailthru.tags": "free-trade,hillary-clinton,trans-pacific-partnership,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-27 21:16:59", "sailthru.title": "Will Hillary stand up for Asia-trade treaty \u2014 and the US\u00a0economy?", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hillary21.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Hillary Clinton was the first member of the Obama administration to promote the sound idea of a \u201cpivot to Asia.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo why is she now so ambivalent about what would become the chief legacy item of her idea: the mega trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership?\r\n\r\nThe TPP \u2014 a free-trade pact involving 12 major democracies in Asia and the Americas \u2014 will be a hot item this week, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe here to meet with President Obama and to address Congress Wednesday.\r\n\r\nMost Republicans are expected to back the deal.
