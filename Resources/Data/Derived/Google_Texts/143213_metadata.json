And according to professional income tax preparers, the road is littered with missed opportunities.\n\nThe biggest mistake individual filers make as the April 15 filing deadline nears is not taking all the personal deductions they\u2019re entitled to take, they say. People may not be aware of them, while many miss out by not keeping records of their deductions during the year.\n\nChild care expenses, license tabs and unreimbursed job-related expenses often are missed. Some out-of-pocket medical costs, including health insurance premiums, co-pays and prescription costs, also are missed.\n\nBesides interest on home mortgages and property taxes on one\u2019s home, some filers don\u2019t realize that the real estate taxes they pay for cabins and bare land also are deductible. The cost of safety deposit boxes can even be claimed, as long as they hold qualifying documents. Some teachers fail to claim the up to $250 allowed for money they spend on their classrooms. Some nurses forget to deduct the cost of their scrubs.\n\nBut the biggest misses come in failing to keep track of charitable contributions, says Jennifer Miller, a licensed certified public accountant with Kolquist, Seitz & Goldman in Duluth.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t keep track of the little checks,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey\u2019re better at the bigger ones that are over $250. But under $250, people are bad about it. And a lot of people miss deductions because of that.\u201d\n\nContributions of clothes, household items and other in-kind donations of goods to nonprofits such as Goodwill Industries and the Salvation Army often are missed, noted Ben Bergstedt, a registered tax associate at H&R Block at 4602 Grand Ave. in Duluth. Just\n\nbe sure to get a receipt with the estimated value of the donated items, he says.\n\nThe number of miles driven to and from medical appointments and for hospital stays often are missed. So is the use of a personal vehicle to do volunteer work.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re driving for charitable work, keep a log keeping track of those miles,\u201d said Craig Chilcote, a CPA and co-owner of Anderson Kuiti & Asuma in Duluth.\n\nMissed education credits\n\nAt H&R Block, Bergstedt sees many parents who are unaware of the education credits they have coming. The Minnesota K-12 education credit provides parents with a tax credit for money spent on required school supplies, such as gym suits, paper folders and three-ring binders, as well as fees for class field trips during the school day and the rental of musical instruments for band. The refundable credit, however, doesn\u2019t include costs for participating in team sports.\n\nIt can result in refundable credits of up to $1,625 for students in kindergarten through sixth grades and $2,500 for grades seven through 12.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of families, especially low-income families, that\u2019s a lot of credit,\u201d Bergstedt said.\n\nParents with dependent children in college often know they can can get a refundable tax credit for the tuition and related fees they pay.\n\n\u201cWhat they forget is all the books and all the expenses at colleges,\u201d Bergstedt said, noting that up to $4,000 of those college-related expenses can be claimed to get a maximum of $2,500 in refundable credits.\n\nCollege students who are self-supporting and pay their own college costs are even less aware of the credit, often failing to list their tuition and fees as well as the cost of books, he said.\n\nHealth insurance mandate\n\nBut the biggest change in this year\u2019s income tax filing is the result of the Affordable Care Act, Bergsted says.\n\nEveryone who files a return must now show proof of having essential health insurance coverage. For those who have plans through their employer, it\u2019s already noted on their W-2s. But those who purchased health coverage through a health insurance marketplace will need their Form 1095-A in order to finish their tax returns.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have health insurance, they will be penalized,\u201d he said.\n\nThe penalty is $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater. But the penalty can be avoided for those who qualify for exemptions.\n\nLife events \u2014 such as getting married, getting divorced, having a baby, buying a house, starting a business, retirement or a death in the family \u2014 make tax returns more complicated. But tax planners say they can help people navigate those changes as well as help in yearlong tax planning.\n\n\u201cA lot of times we can help with not only what is happening today, but with planning for the future,\u201d Chilcote said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business,news,Money", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Candace Renalls", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "Tax time is on its way.
