Daily Kos columnist and #BlackLivesMatter activist Shaun King has been hired by the New York Daily News to be their new social justice writer.

CNN reports that the newspaper announced the hiring move in a staff memo yesterday that created this new role for King because of how impressed they said they were with King’s writings on issues like inequality and race relations.

Executive Editor Jim Rich said, “His passion and attention to detail on topics that are of critical importance to our readers — both online and in print — make him a perfect fit for the Daily News.”

In his farewell post on Daily Kos, King explained, “The New York Daily News isn’t a decidedly liberal outlet. The audience is also very different, but I hope to bring much of what you have welcomed here to the New York Daily News audience.”

King’s name might be familiar to casual news observers because back in August, he was accused of being white despite saying he’s biracial, a controversy that blew up for a few days and then seems to have fizzled out. Regardless, this will be viewed by some as a controversial hire for a paper that has typically been considered less predictably politicized than some of the other New York papers.
