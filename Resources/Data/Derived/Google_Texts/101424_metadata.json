Chris Hawkins scooped it up and ran 94 yards for the third of the four second-quarter touchdowns for the Trojans, who lost their conference opener at home to Stanford last week.\n\n\u201cThey showed a great deal of heart, effort, work ethic and pride,\u201d USC coach Steve Sarkisian said.\n\nDemario Richard ran for 131 yards and two scores for the Sun Devils in their Pac-12 opener.\n\nArizona State had won three of four in the series, last year on Bercovici\u2019s \u201cHail Mary\u201d 46-yard pass to Jaelen Strong as the game ended.\n\nThere was no miracle on this night.\n\nKessler completed 19 of 33 passes. His string of 103 passes without an interception, dating to the final 12 passes last season, ended when Kareem Orr picked off an attempt at the Sun Devils 1 in the first series of the game.\n\nAdoree Jackson had three catches for 131 yards, Juju Smith-Schuster five for 103 yards.\n\nBercovici was for 23 of 44 for 272 yards, but 195 of those yards came in the second half when USC had the game in hand.\n\n\u201cI think this is the best team we\u2019ve had overall,\u201d Arizona State coach Todd Graham said, \u201cWe\u2019re just not playing that way.\u201d\n\nUSC took the lead early after Richard\u2019s fumble. On third-and-13, Kessler threw wide to Jackson, who broke tackles down the sideline on an 80-yard touchdown play.\n\n\u201cWhen I caught it and ran down the sideline and Steven (Mitchell) was pushing me and I was just carrying the pile of people,\u201d he said.\n\nThen came USC\u2019s 28-point, second-quarter eruption.\n\nEarly in the quarter, Bercovici threw deep from midfield and USC\u2019s John Plattenberg intercepted. A roughing-the-passer penalty on Arizona State\u2019s Demetrius Cherry kept the subsequent nine-play, 74-yard drive going, Kessler throwing a 27-yard TD pass to Steven Mitchell Jr.\n\nThe third touchdown of the quarter followed Zane Gonzalez\u2019s missed 52-yard field goal. Kessler\u2019s 45-yard pass to Jackson set up a 5-yard TD toss to Smith-Schuster.\n\nArizona State\u2019s best drive of the half ended when De\u2019Chavon Hayes burst up the middle on a 16-yard run and was stopped just start of the goal line. On the next play, Bercovici ran into his running back Richard and dropped the ball.\n\nHawkins picked it up and was untouched to the end zone.\n\n\u201cWe had a pretty basic play on, they got some really good pressure from the backside,\u201d Bercovici said. \u201cDemario and I mishandled the snap. That\u2019s on me as a quarterback. You have to make sure those situations, first-, second-down, worst-case situations, just take a knee at quarterback and move on.\u201d\n\nGraham wished it had been a quarterback sneak, about the only time the quarterback is under center in his system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m voting for,\u201d he said. \u201cNot being in the gun is what I\u2019m voting for.\u201d\n\nThere was time for one more Arizona State turnover.\n\nHayes fumbled on the kickoff return and Kessler threw a 10-yard TD pass to Smith-Schuster with three seconds left in the half to make it 35-0.\n\nKessler moved past Rodney Peete into fifth on USC\u2019s career completions list with 642 and past Carson Palmer into third in career touchdowns (74).\n\nArizona State\u2019s D.J. Foster became the fourth player in NCAA history with 2,000 yards rushing and passing.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 19 USC Trojans take advantage of turnovers, roll past Arizona State Sun Devils", "title": "No. 19 USC Trojans take advantage of turnovers, roll past Arizona State Sun Devils", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/no-19-usc-trojans-take-advantage-of-turnovers-roll-past-arizona-state-sun-devils/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__cody-kesslerp1.jpg", "height": 489}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__cody-kesslerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T11:13:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:50:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc8c\"", "article_summary": "19 Southern California capitalized on Arizona State\u2019s miscues to roll past the Sun Devils, 42-14 on Saturday night.\nUSC (3-1, 1-1 Pac-12) scored touchdowns after all four Arizona State turnovers in the first half and led 35-0 at the break.\n\u201cNot being in the gun is what I\u2019m voting for.\u201dThere was time for one more Arizona State turnover.\nArizona State\u2019s D.J.\nAnd Arizona State made plenty of them."}
