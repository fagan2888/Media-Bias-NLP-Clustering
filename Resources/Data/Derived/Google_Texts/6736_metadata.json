A few medical schools are also recognizing how health care is a similar high-stakes field, where people in power make quick decisions under intense pressure. ( Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images )\n\nJane Lazarre was pacing the hospital waiting room. Her son Khary, 18, had just come out of surgery, but the nurses weren\u2019t letting her in to see him.\n\n\u201cThey told us he would be out of anesthesia in a few minutes. He never came out,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThe minutes became an hour, the hour became two hours.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband became more and more frightened. It was just a routine knee operation. Lazarre asked the nurses what was going on.\n\n\u201cThey said Khary was having \u2018trouble\u2019 coming out of anesthesia,\u201d Lazarre says.\n\nThey called the surgeon in a panic. He went to check on their son and said that Khary had come out of anesthesia violently \u2014 thrashing and flailing about. He told Lazarre that with most young people his age, there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. The doctors and nurses would have gently held him down.\n\n\u201cBut with our son, since he was so quote \u2018large and powerful\u2019 they were worried he might injure the medical staff. So they had to keep sending him back under the anesthesia,\u201d Lazarre says.\n\nKhary was 6 feet tall. But he was slim.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the giant they were describing him as,\u201d Lazarre says.\n\nBaby or \u2018Militant Black Panther\u2019?\n\nShe pauses. Lazarre is white. Her husband is black. She says she started learning the role race would play in her sons\u2019 lives the day her older son, Adam, was born.\n\n\u201cHe was a tiny little 6 pound baby. The nurses were white,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd whenever he cried, they would refer to him as the militant Black Panther.\u201d\n\nLazarre says there\u2019s no doubt in her mind that what happened with Khary and his knee surgery was because of race.\n\n\u201cI understood, certainly not for the first time, that my son, and my sons both, were viewed as being dangerous, being potentially frightening to people who were white,\u201d she says, adding that it was likely the surgeon didn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cLike most white people, I don\u2019t think he was conscious of it at all.\u201d\n\nLazarre and her husband insisted on seeing Khary.\n\n\u201cAnd he was indeed obviously agitated, and flailing about, covering his head with his arms,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we saw right away that he was scared, not angry or violent.\u201d\n\nHe was scared. Lazarre and her husband leaned over and whispered in Khary\u2019s ear: \u201c\u2019It\u2019s going to be okay, you can calm down.\u2019 And he began coming out of the anesthesia more normally.\u201d\n\nLazarre wrote about this experience in her book \u201cBeyond the Whiteness of Whiteness: Memoir of a White Mother of Black Sons.\u201d It will be republished in a new 20th anniversary edition next year with a new preface from Lazarre. She says there\u2019s still so much that hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nDisparities Persist\n\nEven as health overall has improved in the U.S., the disparities in treatment and outcomes between white patients, and black and Latino patients, are almost as big as they were 50 years ago. A growing body of research suggests that doctors\u2019 unconscious behaviors play a role in these statistics, and the Institute of Medicine has called for more studies looking at discrimination and prejudice.\n\nOne study found that doctors were far less likely to refer black women for advanced cardiac care than white men with identical symptoms. Other studies show that African Americans and Latino patients are often prescribed less pain medication than white patients with the same complaints.\n\n\u201cWe know that doctors spend more time with white patients than with patients of color,\u201d says Howard Ross, founder of management consulting firm Cook Ross.\n\nHe\u2019s developed a new diversity training curriculum for health care professionals that focuses on the role of unconscious bias in these scenarios.\n\nDoctors and nurses don\u2019t mean to treat people differently, Ross says. But, just like police, they harbor stereotypes that they\u2019re not aware they have. Everybody does.\n\n\u201cThis is normal human behavior,\u201d Ross says. \u201cWe can no more stop having bias than we can stop breathing.\u201d\n\nUnconscious biases often surface when we\u2019re multitasking or when we\u2019re stressed. They come up in tense situations where we don\u2019t have time to think. Like police on the street at night who have to decide quickly if a person is reaching for a wallet, or a gun. It\u2019s similar for doctors in the hospital.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with people who are frightened, they\u2019re reactive,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing triage in the Emergency Room, for example, you don\u2019t have time to sit back and contemplate, \u2018why am I thinking about this,\u2019 You have to instantaneously react.\u201d\n\nDoctors are trained to think fast, and to be confident in their decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost a trained arrogance,\u201d Ross says.\n\nThis leads to treatments prescribed based on snap judgments, which can reveal internalized stereotypes. A doctor sees one black patient who doesn\u2019t take his medication, perhaps because he can\u2019t afford it. Without realizing it, the doctor starts to assume that all black patients aren\u2019t going to follow instructions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taught to learn things in a way that involves pattern recognition,\u201d says Rene Salazar, a doctor and professor at UC-San Francisco Medical School. He says he\u2019s fallen prey to his own biases in the exam room.\n\n\u201cThese preconceived ideas that because someone is from a certain class or a certain background that they\u2019re going to want pain medication for a particular reason that\u2019s not related to your pain,\u201d he says, is one example.\n\nSalazar did a training with Howard Ross\u2019 firm to get a handle on his unconscious biases. Now he teaches a similar course to all new students at the medical school at UCSF, so they can catch their biases early.
