Total housing inventory was at a five money supply at the end of June, down from 5.1 months in May. (A six-month supply is considered a healthy market.)\n\nHomes are selling even faster than in pre-recession years. More than a quarter of today\u2019s sellers can unload their property in less than two weeks, according to Coldwell Banker.\n\nThat\u2019s great news for home sellers but it\u2019s creating a stressful and competitive environment for potential buyers, especially as the busy summer selling season draws to a close. Follow these steps to craft an offer that stands out from the crowd and negotiate the best possible deal.\n\n1. Have squeaky clean finances. Today\u2019s sellers won\u2019t even look at an offer from a buyer who hasn\u2019t been pre-approved for a mortgage. You\u2019ll need documentation to show that you\u2019ve already been thoroughly vetted by a lender. (If you\u2019re applying with a co-buyer, make sure you\u2019re both pre-approved.) Once you\u2019ve got that letter in hand, keep as low a financial profile as possible.\n\nRelated: 9 Real Estate Trends to Watch in 2015\n\nOpening a new line of credit or changing jobs in the midst of purchasing a house could create issues with your lender that could hold up (or tank) your mortgage. Instead, start socking away as much extra savings as you can\u2014you\u2019ll need it for closing costs and other expenses that crop up during the home purchasing process.\n\n2. Forget about the low-ball offer. The days of submitting in an offer far under the list price of a home have long since gone. Most buyers are pricing their homes closer to market value, and offers that are too far below could be viewed as insulting. The average sale-to-list price ratio is 98.5 percent, according to Housing Pulse.\n\nIn metro areas where home prices are on the rise (which is most areas of the country), making an offer at or above the list price for the property is the only way to have it taken seriously.\n\n3. Conventional loans are the new cash. All-cash offers are still preferred by sellers, but the days when they\u2019re on the wane. Cash offers now comprise 35 percent of home sales, down from nearly half of all deals in March 2011, according to CoreLogic.\n\nStill, the more money you can flash upfront the better. Sellers tend to prefer conventional mortgage with a 20 percent down payment to one with an FHA loan and a down payment of just 3 percent. \u201cA bigger down payment makes you a stronger buyer,\u201d says Zillow\u2019s real estate expert Brendon DeSimone.\n\nSweeten the pot even more by putting down extra earnest money with your offer.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for Another Real Estate Bubble\n\n4. Write a letter. As cheesy as it sounds, accompanying your offer with a heartfelt letter about what the house means to you as well as a photo of your family could pay off. \u201cEveryone has heart strings,\u201d says Sandra O\u2019Connor, a broker in Greensborough, N.C., and a regional vice president with the National Association of Realtors.\n\nMost sellers won\u2019t select your offer based solely on the letter but if yours is tied with another, the letter could give you the lead.\n\n5. Respond quickly. Responding quickly and completely to everything the seller asks will show that you\u2019re serious about the property and could give you another small advantage over the competition. If you\u2019re buying the property with a spouse or partner, designate one person the realtor\u2019s contact and authorize him or her to make quick decisions for all buyers whenever possible. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit on it for a day or be the last one to respond if there are multiple bids,\u201d says Danielle Moy, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent in Chicago.\n\n6. Be OK with walking away. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the frenzy of a hot market, but you don\u2019t want to end up in contract and then worry that you\u2019re overpaying for the property. A quarter of homeowners surveyed by RedFin last year had buyer\u2019s remorse, reporting that they wouldn\u2019t repurchase the home that they live in.\n\n\n\nBefore negotiations start come up with a purchase price that you won\u2019t go beyond and stick to it. \u201cThen go in with the understanding that if someone pays $1 more than that price, you\u2019ll be OK with that,\u201d says Scott Tamkin, an agent with Keller William Realty in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n7. Keep looking through the fall. Fewer people look to buy houses in the fall, so you\u2019ll have less competition. Plus, sellers who weren\u2019t able to find buyers in the summer or who have been forced for some reason to list their home in the off-season may be more willing to entertain your offer. Plus, with interest rates poised to rise, waiting to buy until next summer could end up making a purchase far more expensive.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The summer has been a hot one for the real estate market, with home prices jumping 6.5", "title": "Found Your Dream Home? 7 Tips for Getting the Best Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/19/Found-Your-Dream-Home-7-Tips-Getting-Best-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06122011_HOME-SOLD_ARTICLE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/19/Found-Your-Dream-Home-7-Tips-Getting-Best-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06122011_HOME-SOLD_ARTICLE.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The summer has been a hot one for the real estate market, with home prices jumping 6.5", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Follow these steps to craft an offer that stands out from the crowd and negotiate the best possible deal.\n\u201cA bigger down payment makes you a stronger buyer,\u201d says Zillow\u2019s real estate expert Brendon DeSimone.\nRelated: Get Ready for Another Real Estate Bubble4.\nMore than a quarter of today\u2019s sellers can unload their property in less than two weeks, according to Coldwell Banker.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit on it for a day or be the last one to respond if there are multiple bids,\u201d says Danielle Moy, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent in Chicago."}
