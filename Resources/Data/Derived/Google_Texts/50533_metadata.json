It\u2019s that healthcare clients have gotten a lot more particular about their CFO candidates. The need today is for true financial leaders, strategic partners to the CEO.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand my clients are looking for very operationally-oriented CFOs,\u201d says Arnold, principal of Arnold Partners. \u201cThat means they are looking for a financial leader that can provide guidance and direction for the entire organization. They are not a backroom accountant. They are not merely a Wall Street-facing investor relations person. They are really integrated into the organization. They are leading by example, and they are leading by providing services to the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there is a focus on the role of the CFO as a conduit for fundraising,\u201d Arnold explained, a role that many CFOs in healthcare must increasingly fill.\n\nThe stuff of great leaders\n\nBut what exactly defines a CFO leader?\n\nFor Arnold, \u201cFirst I think of someone that has gravitas. By that I mean a presence that encourages people to follow \u2013 a person who is able to take a difficult stand on an issue and stand their ground when the going gets tough. Often, the CFO is the one person in an organization that may have to adopt a contract vision in order to put a balance on what may be a euphoric idea.\u201d\n\n[See also: CFO tapped to lead Pennsylvania Hospital.]\n\n\u201cIt is the CFO\u2019s job to rationalize those ideas and make sure they are the right ones,\u201d Arnold continued. \u201cA great CFO is able to do that in a way that doesn\u2019t turn people off. It\u2019s an art to be able to say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u2019 A CFO has to be the voice of reason in the room.\u201d\n\nThat is where the role of strategic partner also comes in. A CFO leader doesn\u2019t have to be a visionary, but they do have to be a \u201cvision enabler.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually the vision comes from the CEO or the board of directors as to what the organization is trying to be,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cThe CFO is there to rationalize that and finance that, to execute on the strategic plan, and contribute to it also. I think of the CFO as more the executor of strategy rather than the creator of strategy, although there certainly are some cases where the CFO is playing a very important role in creating strategy.\u201d\n\nFrom bean counter to strategic thinker\n\nOne healthcare CFO that spends the lion\u2019s share of her work week in strategic matters is Robin Norman, senior vice president and CFO at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Va.\n\nNorman has been in the role of CFO for 16 years at Virginia Hospital Center, and has logged 35 years total with the organization. In fact, other than a brief job at a wholesale drug firm straight out of college, \u201cthis has been my career,\u201d she said.\n\nNorman agrees that health systems increasingly want the CFO to \u201craise their game\u201d and be a true strategic partner to the CEO.\n\n\u201cI tend to spend more of my time on strategy than I do on day-to-day finance things,\u201d Norman confirmed. \u201cFortunately I have a good team and they make sure that the finances are good. I certainly spend time with them, but it\u2019s much more about strategy.\u201d\n\nMost top-level strategic decisions tend to be made by the executive team of the CEO, the CFO (Norman) and the chief medical officer.\n\nSkills and qualities that set leaders apart\n\nNorman has explicit ideas about the skills a CFO needs if they want to be a true leader.\n\n\u201cI would start with the ability to teach and educate,\u201d Norman explained. \u201cThey need to be able to explain finance to a lot of people for whom it is not their forte. They have to be able to do it in everything from a one-to-one setting to a board meeting or public presentation. Teaching and presentation skills would be number one, followed by working as a team member and understanding the bigger mission and how finance fits into that.\u201d\n\nNext on the list: commitment and compromise.\n\n[See also: The power of presentations: CFO tips.]\n\n\u201cTo be a leader you have to be a quick study, and you have to be willing to compromise for the greater good. What is best for you and your department may not be best for the organization,\u201d Norman said. \u201cAnd you have to be willing to sell those decisions \u2013 and whether you completely agree with them or don\u2019t completely agree with them should never be obvious to anybody you are talking to.\u201d\n\nNorman confirms that not all CFO or finance managers have the right stuff to be leaders.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is a leader. I have very skilled people that probably wouldn\u2019t make the best CFO even though they are very talented and very knowledgeable about the industry,\u201d Norman said.\n\nBut for those that do have what it takes, having leadership qualities can put a finance manager on the fast track to career advancement, perhaps even to the very top, Norman said.\n\n\u201cI think it is very possible to move from the CFO to a CEO role,\u201d Norman concluded.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/moving-cfo-finance-leader", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare-leader.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "When assessing CFO candidates, hospitals today are seeking \"true financial leaders\" who can be strategic partners to the CEO.
