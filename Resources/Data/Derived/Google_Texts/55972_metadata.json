They are also the concerns of Steven Brill\u2019s bestselling new book, America\u2019s Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System.\n\nBrill\u2014a journalist, lawyer and founder of numerous media ventures\u2014burst onto the healthcare reform scene in 2013 with an explosive expose\u0301 in Time that painstakingly demonstrated the wreckage inflicted by massive itemized medical bills on some very unfortunate uninsured and underinsured people. His new book traces the emergence, travails, accomplishments and shortcomings of Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA). His reporting on the \u201cbackroom deals\u201d that helped sculpt the ACA provide a valuable illustration of just how much influence the \u201cmedical industrial complex\u201d has accrued.\n\nFor the pharmaceutical industry, the stakes were high, particularly as some Democrats were talking about allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies over prices (which is what the rest of the world does already). Brill describes how a deal was ultimately hashed out in meetings between industry lobbyists, Max Baucus\u2019 Finance Committee staff and the administration. \u201c[My] five principal CEOs,\u201d he quotes from a note written by head pharma lobbyist Billy Tauzin to a White House staffer, \u201chave accepted the terms we discussed with the Committee yesterday.\u201d Those terms, not surprisingly, did nothing to substantially contain astronomically high U.S. drug prices.\n\nBrill stumbles, however, in his prescriptions for the future. As Brill describes, a historic consolidation of the healthcare industry into large, integrated, regional systems is underway, and some evidence has already demonstrated that such consolidation carries the peril of monopolistic pricing. His solution is to accommodate this trend toward \u201cbranded, integrated and regulated oligopolies\u201d and also to heavily regulate it, while at the same time encouraging these systems to cut out the middle man and become insurers themselves (which some have done already). Through greater administrative simplicity, redefined provider incentives and a cap on profits, Brill envisions huge potential savings.\n\nUnfortunately, insurer overhead (which his plan would not eliminate) is only one part of the massive administrative waste of the U.S. healthcare system. In reality, the only system that could achieve profound administrative savings would be one in which hospitals receive a \u201cglobal budget\u201d from a single governmental payer to cover all operating expenses for all patients.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/17765/obamacare-and-its-discontents", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/Obama_500_641_s.jpg", "description": "Steven Brill's new book outlines the shortcomings, as well as the accomplishments, of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obamacare and Its Discontents"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2011\"", "article_summary": "They are also the concerns of Steven Brill\u2019s bestselling new book, America\u2019s Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System.\nUnfortunately, insurer overhead (which his plan would not eliminate) is only one part of the massive administrative waste of the U.S. healthcare system.\nBrill describes how a deal was ultimately hashed out in meetings between industry lobbyists, Max Baucus\u2019 Finance Committee staff and the administration.\nThrough greater administrative simplicity, redefined provider incentives and a cap on profits, Brill envisions huge potential savings.\nHis new book traces the emergence, travails, accomplishments and shortcomings of Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA)."}
