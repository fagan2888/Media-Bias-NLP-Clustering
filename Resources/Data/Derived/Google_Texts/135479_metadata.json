The helicopter crew then lowered both the individual and the rescue swimmer onto the beach, Ameen said.\n\nThe helicopter crew had been on a training flight when the rescue swimmer looked out the window while they were flying over the inlet and saw a personal watercraft with nobody on it, Ameen said.\n\nThe crew then scanned the area and a saw a person in the water close to the jetty, Ameen said. The crew circled around while the rescue swimmer was putting his gear on. By that point, the watercraft had slammed into the jetty. That\u2019s when the rescue swimmer was lowered down to the water.\n\n\u201cHe (the individual) was getting pushed toward the rocks. The timing could not have been better,\" Ameen said. \u201cThe person was wearing a wet suit and life jacket. It helped him a lot.\"\n\nAmeen said the Coast Guard strongly advises everyone to stay out of the water when the weather creates heavy surf.\n\n\n\nSteven Falk: 732-643-4267; sfalk@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
