Right now, Americans are anxious about their security and their futures.\n\nWe want to save the American Idea for the vast majority of Americans who believe it\u2019s just not there for them anymore. We want America to lead again. We want America to be confident again. That is our mission.\n\nTo do that, we can\u2019t just be an opposition party. We have to be a proposition party.\n\nIf we do not like the direction the country is going in \u2014 and we do not \u2014 then we have an obligation to offer an alternative. So in the coming months, we will put forward a bold, pro-growth agenda. It will show where we stand. By giving the people a clear choice in 2016, we will seek a mandate to do big things in 2017 and beyond.\n\nThe process will be driven by the people\u2019s representatives. Every representative \u2014 and their constituents \u2014 will have a chance to provide their say. These discussions will focus on five areas.\n\nFirst, national security. How do we go about building a 21st-century military? What do we need to do to make sure we\u2019re equipped to defeat ISIS and the threat posed by radical Islamic terror? How do we make sure we are secure here at home?\n\nNext, jobs and economic growth. Our economy is far from its potential. Wages are still stagnant. How do we fix our tax code? How do we rein in our regulatory state? How do we maximize our energy potential?\n\nThird, health care. Obamacare has driven up premiums, limited choices, and taken away access. These are not signs of success \u2014 they are signs of failure. If and when we repeal Obamacare, what solutions will lead to lower costs and a truly patient-centered health care system?\n\nFourth, poverty and opportunity. There are 46 million Americans living in poverty today, and a big part of the reason is we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. How do we lift people up, bring them back into the workforce, and restore upward mobility?\n\nThe last piece of this agenda \u2013 and it\u2019s so critical to all the others \u2013 is restoring the Constitution. The president\u2019s executive overreach has undermined the Constitution and damaged the people\u2019s trust. What needs to be done to restore the separation of powers and protect our constitutional liberties?\n\nThese are the ideas that we will be advancing.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a big job ahead of us, but this is nothing short of a generational defining moment. Everything is at stake. There is a real hunger for solutions \u2013 for a nation that unifies and reaches its potential.\n\nWe see it as our duty here in the people\u2019s house to offer real ideas, to tackle the real issues head on. We want a confident America. Now it\u2019s time to get to work. ####\n\nPrevious weekly party remarks are available here.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThree, maybe four takeaways from the GOP debate\n\nOpening his final act, Obama makes Clint Eastwiid\u2019s day\n\nObama\u2019s mystical farewell tour: What\u2019s he claiming now?\n\nGov.
