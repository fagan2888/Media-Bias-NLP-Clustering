The democratic primary caucus is on Saturday (03-26-16). And while frontrunner Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders marshal support in Seattle, a lesser known national candidate \u2013 Rocky De La Fuente \u2013 has come to Alaska.\n\nDownloadable audio.\n\nSixty-one year old Roque \u201cRocky\u201d De La Fuente is the most determined democratic candidate you\u2019ve never heard of. The Mexican-American businessman filed his candidacy on October 1st, months after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But it was another candidate who sparked his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen Mr. Trump called everyone every name in the book. I was expecting to have a worldwide contra reaction. I was expecting the President of the United States, the president of Mexico, or the President of Argentina. There wasn\u2019t one single person that said A, B, or C,\u201d De La Fuente explained. \u201cSo the question is, I said, \u2018Somebody has to stand to that man.\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s affront on the Latin-American community inspired De La Fuente. But the two men are similar in a few ways: both are wealthy businessmen with no political experience who want to shake up the establishment and appeal to working-class Americans. But De La Fuente\u2019s base is very different. He advocates for immigrants and the homeless.\n\nDe La Fuente was caucusing in Arizona recently and met a young girl named Renata, who started crying. \u201cShe says, \u2018I won\u2019t be able to see my grandfather.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 She said, \u2018Somebody\u2019s building a wall.\u2019\n\nImmigration reform and naturalizing illegal immigrants is at the top of his priority list. \u201cWe have 11 million people in this country that do not have their papers. I consider those 11 million people assets. I don\u2019t consider them liabilities. They\u2019re here. I didn\u2019t bring them here. But if we\u2019re going to grow this country and we\u2019re going to generate 34 million jobs, I need those 11 million here. I need them working. I need them legal. And I need them to pay taxes.\u201d\n\nDe La Fuente is pro-gun and supports the Affordable Care Act, but thinks it needs to be change. He endorses gay marriage and abortion, but thinks states should have the right to choose. He\u2019s an unusual blend of stances. And he thinks it\u2019s enough for him to be an alternative to front runner Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Clinton, De La Fuente said, \u201cThe lady thinks she\u2019s queen. She thinks she deserves everything. And she does not. This is a democracy. This is not a dynasty. Do we have to elect the wife of a president?\u201d\n\nDe La Fuente has picked up zero delegates, but as far as fringe candidates go, he\u2019s doing okay. He appeared on more state ballots than former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who withdrew after a poor showing in Iowa.\n\nTo his disappointment, though, he will not appear on the ballot in Washington this weekend. \u201cEven though I qualified for 44 states and all the caucusing states, in Seattle they put me as \u2018other.\u2019 The democratic party has told me, \u2018Washington, you cannot vote for this man because he does not exist.\u2019\n\nSo, he came to Alaska, which he\u2019s visited numerous times on cruise ships. For a state large in size, there are few delegates up for grabs \u2013 just 20. De La Fuente will need at least 15% of the caucus to pick up any. This will be difficult given the foothold of Clinton and Sanders in Alaska. Jane Sanders, Bernie Sanders\u2019s wife, visited Alaska last week.\n\nKCAW asked De La Fuente why he keeps with the race, given the odds. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a 56 kilometer race. So you cannot judge a race just because somebody is leading the first 10 kilometers or the first 20 kilometers. The question is, \u201cWho is going to cross that finish line?\u201d\n\nDe La Fuente\u2019s campaign \u2013 which is entirely grassroots \u2013 even developed a game called \u201cRocky Run.\u201d Available on iPhone and Android, De La Fuente is a horse you can pit against horses \u201cHillary Pigton\u201d and \u201cDon Bulltromp.\u201d With the brush of a finger, you can jump over obstacles.\n\n(Sounds of game)\n\nAnd his eyes light up when he mentions that the Democratic National Convention will be in Philadelphia. Because as you may have noticed, he shares a name with another underdog, Rocky Balboa.\n\nAll my life, I\u2019ve been an underdog. All my life, I\u2019m a minority. We have two type of people: we have the hard-working people that work and we have the government that\u2019s trying to do everything they can to stop us. Imagine if we can all be working with the same objective. And let\u2019s make America ten times greater than what it is today.\n\nDe La Fuente will be in Sitka for the caucus, where he hopes to win over minds and maybe, some votes.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "MasterSlider 2.12.2 - Responsive Touch Image Slider", "og": {"site_name": "KCAW", "description": "Alaska's democratic primary caucus is on Saturday (03-26-16).
