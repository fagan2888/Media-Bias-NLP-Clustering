JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A Clarksdale police corporal who was shot in the face two months ago has returned home.

Media outlets report Derrick Couch was discharged from the hospital Wednesday. A police escort took him from the hospital to his home in DeSoto County.

Couch had been hospitalized since he was shot Feb. 13 while responding to an armed robbery call. Couch, who lost an eye and suffered some brain damage from the shooting, spent weeks in recovery and rehabilitation.

Officials said if the bullet hadn’t hit soft tissue in Couch’s eye, it would have likely fragmented and caused fatal injuries.

Couch is expected to attend a benefit in his honor April 22 at Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale.

The two men suspected in the robbery have been arrested and charged.
