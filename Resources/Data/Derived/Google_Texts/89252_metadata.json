In a series of recent speeches, the president has gone beyond the typical give and take of partisan sniping to hint that something darker and more sinister may lie behind the hard time that many Republicans in Congress are giving him.\n\n\u201cHe has suggested on multiple occasions that Republicans aren\u2019t just opposing him out of partisanship, but out of personal animus or spite,\u201d Blake wrote in a post with the headline \u201cObama\u2019s new argument: Republicans are picking on me because they don\u2019t like me.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the president\u2019s argument is his presumption of conservative motives. And let\u2019s be frank about it, even if the commander in chief won\u2019t: There\u2019s an odor of racism that fouls the air around much of the conservative opposition. This view is shared by a great number of progressives, including some prominent figures who have dared to express it, including former President Jimmy Carter, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, and Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC.\n\nAnd, of course, conservatives are loath to agree. Right-wing television talking head and syndicated columnist George Will dismissed the racism charges in a recent appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d saying that liberals overuse claims of racism because he thinks they have nothing else to offer society. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in the law,\u201d Will said during the broadcast. \u201cIf you have a law on your side, argue the law; if you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have neither, pound the table. This is pounding the table.\u201d\n\nProving racism is, in a practical sense nowadays, impossible. Legislators can claim with popular support to be taking a principled stand against, say, the Affordable Care Act or curbing federal spending without ever talking about how their positions disproportionately affect communities of color. Then, if challenged, they claim to be victims of reverse racism.\n\nI believe that\u2019s a dodge, a way of avoiding the unpleasantness of being called a racist and slinging that muddy clump back at the person who tossed it first. But what if I\u2019m wrong? Who can say with absolute authority what feeling or reasoning flows through the hearts and minds of the Obama administration\u2019s opponents? What if their claims of pure racial motives, so convincing nowadays to those predisposed to believe them, are accurate?\n\nHistory has a way of providing insight, if not perfect answers.\n\nIn early 1938, a backbench Democratic senator from Mississippi named Theodore Bilbo made his mark on Washington, D.C., by leading a delegation of fellow Southerners in opposition to an anti-lynching bill. Such legislation, urged on by leaders of the NAACP and other civil rights activists of the time, had failed repeatedly since the early 1920s, but it was expected to pass this time.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. Sen. Bilbo and his confederates engaged in one of the longest, hate-filled filibusters in Senate history. At one point, as historian Robert L. Fleegler wrote in the spring 2006 edition of The Journal of Mississippi History, Sen. Bilbo declared from the Senate floor:\n\nIf you succeed in the passage of this bill, you will open the floodgates of hell in the South. Raping, mobbing, lynching, race riots, and crime will be increased a thousandfold; and upon your garments and the garments of those who are responsible for the passage of the measure will be the blood of the raped and the outraged daughters of Dixie, as well as the blood of the perpetrators of these crimes that the red-blooded Anglo-Saxon white Southern men will not tolerate.\n\nIn his day and in his home state, Sen. Bilbo was a hero to many of his constituents. He was seen as a principled leader who represented the will of his electorate. By today\u2019s standards, however, he was a straight-up, fire-breathing white supremacist\u2014a racist. It is because of legislators such as Sen. Bilbo that the Senate apologized in 2005 for its repeated failure to pass anti-lynching legislation.\n\nHistory has harshly judged Sen. Bilbo. His rancorous words and behavior seem absurd from today\u2019s point of view\u2014and, to be fair, were much more severe than the veiled racism that some accuse modern conservatives of employing. But as I listen to the ping-pong political debates that bounce from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other, I wonder how history will ultimately judge the actions and inactions of our modern-day leaders. Will these politicians and pundits seem just as absurd a century from now? What\u2019s more, judging by their words and actions, I\u2019m little convinced that today\u2019s legislators even care about what future historians will say of their brief moments in office.\n\nBut rest assured that in due time, whether any of us live long enough to see it, the truth will one day be clear for all to know.\n\nSam Fulwood III is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and Director of the CAP Leadership Institute.
