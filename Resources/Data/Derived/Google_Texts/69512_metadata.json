Amtrak employees are instructed to report conduct \"indicative of criminal activity\" to law enforcement.\n\nAmong them:\n\nUnusual nervousness of traveler\n\nUnusual calmness or straight ahead stare\n\nLooking around while making telephone call(s)\n\nPosition among passengers disembarking (ahead of, or lagging behind passengers)\n\nCarrying little or no luggage\n\nPurchase of tickets in cash\n\nPurchase tickets immediately prior to boarding\n\nSo to avoid getting hassled by the state, don\u2019t act nervous, but don\u2019t act too calm either. Don\u2019t stare straight ahead unless you\u2019re on the telephone, in which case don\u2019t look around. And disembark right amidst all the other passengers with lots of luggage.\n\nIn a country in which police officers shoot and kill many more unarmed people than their analogues overseas, having the DEA hassle you and cost you $60 isn\u2019t the biggest of law-enforcement abuses. It is, nevertheless, worth remembering that these sorts of incidents happen, because unlike misconduct that results in death or serious injury, relatively modest violations of rights like this often go unreported. Heuser didn\u2019t complain to the DEA. \u201cI\u2019ve had my friends complain to the police before,\u201d he explained, \u201cand they basically said, you better watch yourself pal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The train service sells out its customers to the DEA.", "title": "More Reasons to Be Nervous About Amtrak: Illegitimate Federal Agent Hassles", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/21/more-reasons-to-be-nervous-about-amtrak", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14322307126733.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14322307126733.jpg", "description": "The train service sells out its customers to the DEA.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "More Reasons to Be Nervous About Amtrak: Illegitimate Federal Agent Hassles"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "War on Drugs", "published_time": "2015-05-21T18:01:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Around the same time, the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request after getting reports about Amtrak passengers having their rights violated.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my friends complain to the police before,\u201d he explained, \u201cand they basically said, you better watch yourself pal.\u201d\nDon\u2019t stare straight ahead unless you\u2019re on the telephone, in which case don\u2019t look around.\nScott Shackford reported here recently on the terrible tale of a young man having his life savings of $18,000 in cash stolen by federal agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on an Amtrak train from Michigan to Los Angeles.\nAmtrak employees are instructed to report conduct \"indicative of criminal activity\" to law enforcement."}
