I'm optimistic there will be better earnings and the price-earnings ratio can actually rise, says Byron Wien, Blackstone Advisory Partners, revealing his top predictions for the markets this year.

This will be 20% year for market: Wien

The stock market will be up 20 percent in 2014 but could experience a correction early in the year of as much as 10 percent, Byron Wien predicted in a CNBC interview on Tuesday—a day after releasing his annual Top 10 Market Surprises for 2014.

"This will be a 20 percent year," the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners emphasized on "Squawk Box."

In Wien's top prediction for 2014, he described stocks as a "Dickensian market," referring to "the best of times and the worst of times."



While the correction could be 10 percent early on, "the market will really pick up speed later on in the year when some of the negatives clarify," such as Obamacare glitches getting worked out and the political environment in Washington improving, he said.

Wien also said the U.S. economy will finally break out of the doldrums in 2014, with growth exceeding 3 percent—noting "it was picking up at year-end."
