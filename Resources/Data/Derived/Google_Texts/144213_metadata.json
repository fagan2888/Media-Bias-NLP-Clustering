Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.), would authorize the House or Senate to sue the executive branch for not enforcing laws and provide an expedited process through federal district courts. The bill is one of several the House GOP is pushing to combat the \u201cimperial presidency.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say the legislation is necessary in light of the numerous administrative actions taken by President Barack Obama to change and selectively enforce laws, including immigration, marriage, welfare rules, and his signature legislative achievement, Obamacare.\n\nThe administration has unilaterally altered Obamacare at least 20 times. Most recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that millions have been exempted from the individual mandate due to a rule change.\n\nThe administration also announced last week that individuals would be able to keep their so-called \u201csubstandard\u201d health insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacare until October 2017.\n\nAdditionally, Obama unilaterally instituted the Dream Act by creating a deferred action program for young illegal immigrants and changed work requirements in welfare.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) said the Obama administration has \u201cignored\u201d the Constitution.\n\n\u201cFrom Obamacare to welfare and education reform, to our nation\u2019s drug enforcement and immigration laws, President Obama has been picking and choosing which laws to enforce,\u201d he said. \u201cIn place of the checks and balances established by the Constitution, President Obama has proclaimed that \u2018I refuse to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer\u2019 and that \u2018where [Congress] won\u2019t act, I will.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout the Obama presidency we have seen a pattern: President Obama circumvents Congress when he doesn\u2019t get his way,\u201d Goodlatte said.\n\nDemocrats called the vote a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is simply another attempt by the majority to prevent the President of the United States to implement duly enacted legislative initiatives that they [the Republicans] oppose,\u201d Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.) said.\n\nThe administration\u2019s unilateral changes are simply the \u201creality of implementing sometimes complex laws,\u201d Conyers said, referring to Obamacare.\n\nJonathan Turley disagrees. He testified at a House hearing last month that America is at a \u201cconstitutional tipping point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that I happen to think the president is right on many of these policies does not alter the fact that I believe the means he is doing [it] is wrong, and that this can be a dangerous change in our system,\u201d the liberal law professor said. \u201cAnd our system is changing in a very fundamental way. And it\u2019s changing without a whimper of regret or opposition.\u201d\n\nArguing that Obama should agree with the legislation, Gowdy gave a \u201cpop quiz\u201d on the House floor prior to the vote.\n\n\u201cThat may seem unfair to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but I\u2019m going to give them a hint,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer to every one of the questions is the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to read a quote and then you tell me who said it,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201c\u2018These last few years we\u2019ve seen an unacceptable abuse of power having a president whose priority is expanding his own power.\u2019 Any guess on who said that? Mr. Speaker, it was Sen. Barack Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s another one: \u2018No law can give Congress a backbone if it refuses to stand up as a coequal branch the Constitution made it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019I taught the Constitution for 10 years, I believe in the Constitution,\u2019\u201d Gowdy again quoted then-Sen. Obama.\n\n\u201cSo my question Mr. Speaker is what\u2019s changed?\u201d Gowdy asked. \u201cHow does going from being a senator to a president rewrite the constitution? What\u2019s different from when he was a senator?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill pushes back against Obama\u2019s \u2018imperial presidency\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The House of Representatives passed the \u201cEnforce the Law Act\u201d Wednesday, a bill designed to push back against the numerous unilateral moves the Obama administration has used to circumvent the law.", "title": "House Passes \u2018Enforce the Law\u2019 Act", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/house-passes-enforce-the-law-act/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Barack-Obama-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The House of Representatives passed the \u201cEnforce the Law Act\u201d Wednesday, a bill designed to push", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Barack-Obama-150x150.jpg", "title": "House Passes \u2018Enforce the Law\u2019 Act", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @LizWFBThe House of Representatives passed the \u201cEnforce the Law Act\u201d Wednesday, a bill designed to push back against the numerous unilateral moves the Obama administration has used to circumvent the law.\n\u201cFrom Obamacare to welfare and education reform, to our nation\u2019s drug enforcement and immigration laws, President Obama has been picking and choosing which laws to enforce,\u201d he said.\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) said the Obama administration has \u201cignored\u201d the Constitution.\n\u201cIn place of the checks and balances established by the Constitution, President Obama has proclaimed that \u2018I refuse to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer\u2019 and that \u2018where [Congress] won\u2019t act, I will.\u2019\u201d\u201cThroughout the Obama presidency we have seen a pattern: President Obama circumvents Congress when he doesn\u2019t get his way,\u201d Goodlatte said.\nAdditionally, Obama unilaterally instituted the Dream Act by creating a deferred action program for young illegal immigrants and changed work requirements in welfare."}
