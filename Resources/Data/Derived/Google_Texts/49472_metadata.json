It\u2019s the first of America\u2019s major stock indexes to climb back above its 200-day moving average this year.\n\nThe 200-day today\u2013a widely watched technical level\u2013is at 17153 Friday, and the Dow has been above it nearly all session. It was recently trading at 17180, up 185 points.\n\nThe Dow\u2019s climb back to its 200-day average is the latest bullish technical indicator to be tripped amid the stock-market rally over the past few weeks.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether this move above that mark is a harbinger of better things to come for the broader market \u2014 or a mere cocktail-party factoid. It will need to stay over the always-moving 200-day level to build on the case being made by the bulls that after sideways 2015 action, the 7-year-old bull market still has life in it.\n\nRemember: Getting back above the 200-day in October didn\u2019t lead to notable additional gains, and falling back below it in December cleared the way for January\u2019s skid.\n\nWith today\u2019s 1%-plus climb, the blue-chip index is off just 1.3% this year, a smidge better than the S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, is down 5.5% for 2016.\n\nWhile the S&P is just a handful of points below its 200-day of 2020, the Nasdaq\u2019s lagging performance has that index 3% under its 200-day average of 4880. Until all three are able to get several percentage points above the longer-term technical levels\u2013which continue to fall daily, making doing so easier as time goes on\u2013there will be plenty of doubters about this move higher.\n\nAnd for good reason, considering how last Autumn\u2019s stock rebound last roughly a month before the indexes went sideways into year-end. This rebound is now a month old itself, and who knows how the FOMC on Wednesday might change investors\u2019 calculus yet again.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Often seen as the tortoise, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has become the hare.
