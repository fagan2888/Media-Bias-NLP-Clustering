Among other findings:\n\nCaregiving spouses are less likely than other caregivers to receive in-home support from health care professionals: Some 84 percent of spousal care recipients received no professional health care on site, compared with 65 percent of nonspousal care recipients.\n\nSpouses are also less likely to receive help from family, friends or home care aides: 58 percent of the spouses reported no additional help from others, compared with 20 percent of nonspouses.\n\nIn addition, spouses who are caregivers are on average a decade older than nonspousal caregivers (median age 64 vs. 54). They were also poorer, less likely to be employed and less educated than nonspousal caregivers.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\n\n\n\u201cThe challenges spouses who are caregivers face are daunting,\u201d said Susan Reinhard, senior vice president and director of the AARP Public Policy Institute and coauthor of the report. \u201cNearly three-quarters of the spouses they care for were taking five or more medications, which are not easy to coordinate. And some of these medications were administered in nonpill forms, including injections and infusion pumps, with greater frequency than one might expect.\u201d\n\nThe report says it is unclear why spouses receive less help, hypothesizing that it could be choice, lack of awareness about resources, financial limitations or fear of losing independence. The report calls for additional research to help tailor interventions that support but do not supplant the primary bond between spouses.\n\n\u201cAs a former spousal caregiver, I certainly understand the desire to take care of all of a spouse\u2019s needs,\u201d said coauthor Carol Levine, director of the Families and Health Care Project for the United Hospital Fund. \u201cBut the care that is needed and the responsibilities thrust upon family caregivers by our health care system \u2013 typically, without adequate support \u2013 are more than any family caregiver, particularly an older spouse, can handle alone.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 42 million unpaid family caregivers in the United States.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nPhoto: CandyBoxImages/iStockphoto\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Spouses who are caregivers are significantly more likely than other family caregivers (adult children, for example) to perform many of the tasks that health care professionals do \u2013 including medication management, wound care, using meters and monitors, and more.
