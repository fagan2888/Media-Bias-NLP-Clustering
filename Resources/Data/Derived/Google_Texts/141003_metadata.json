But he sure was adamant that everything President Obama does is wrong and it can all be fixed with a president who isn\u2019t afraid to LEAD.\n\nBut that was back in October \u2013 one might think that Jindal has had some time since then to digest the various issues confronting the U.S. abroad and cobble together a semi-reasonable platform that incorporates a well-considered and coherent critique of the president\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nHah. No.\n\nYesterday, Jindal tweeted out his strategy for taking on terrorism: \u201cDefeat the terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe mission for our military should be clear \u2013 defeat the terrorists. Sign our petition if you agree: http://t.co/z8VSKyzfl4 \u2014 Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) February 24, 2015\n\nIt\u2019s devilishly simplistic \u2013 the earnest, real-world version of \u201cSomeone Should Do Something About All The Problems.\u201d There are terrorists out there? Let\u2019s defeat \u2018em! Boom. Done. How has no one thought of that already?\n\nNow, you might object to me mocking this \u2013 it is, after all, only a tweet, and Twitter is not the medium for laying out complex strategies for dealing with hostile non-state actors. But, alas, \u201cdefeat the terrorists\u201d is Bobby Jindal\u2019s full and complete strategy for combatting terrorism. In a Fox News Op-Ed published on Monday, Jindal objected to the Authorization for Use of Military Force proposed by the White House, arguing that Congress should remove any restrictions on the president\u2019s ability to combat the Islamic State:\n\nThe president\u2019s prohibition on ground troops is not a military strategy, it is a political strategy designed to appease the left in this country, which also happens to populate his entire administration. The prohibition is designed by the left to be a check on the next president. The mission for our military should be clear \u2013 defeat the terrorists. Instead, the president is forecasting our playbook to ISIS.\n\n\u201cDefeat the terrorists\u201d is not an especially clear strategy either. It\u2019s actually deliberately vague, but it also sounds very commander-in-chief-ish, so it accomplishes precisely what Jindal decries about Obama\u2019s strategy: it appeals to his party\u2019s hawkish conservative base. Personally, I\u2019d be very interested to hear a few specifics from Jindal as to what \u201cdefeat the terrorists\u201d entails, given that we\u2019ve been pursuing some variant of that strategy for almost 14 years now and at great cost, only to see terrorism stubbornly undefeated. But Jindal doesn\u2019t do specifics. His plan is to just turn things over to the military and let them call the shots: \u201cThe military must be given the mission, and they should then propose the specific tactics. If that includes some use of ground troops, then that\u2019s what has to be done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP governor has a plan for defeating terrorism -- well, not so much a \"plan\" as a really manly slogan", "title": "Bobby Jindal goes macho: Behold his tough-guy talk about beating up terrorists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "GOP governor has a plan for defeating terrorism -- well, not so much a \"plan\" as a really manly slogan", "title": "Bobby Jindal goes macho: Behold his tough-guy talk about beating up terrorists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/25/bobby_jindal_goes_macho_behold_his_tough_guy_talk_about_beating_up_terrorists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bobby_jindal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP governor has a plan for defeating terrorism -- well, not so much a \"plan\" as a really manly slogan", "title": "Bobby Jindal goes macho: Behold his tough-guy talk about beating up terrorists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/bobby_jindal.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Bobby Jindal, Foreign policy, hawk, hector", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Yesterday, Jindal tweeted out his strategy for taking on terrorism: \u201cDefeat the terrorists.\u201dThe mission for our military should be clear \u2013 defeat the terrorists.\nBobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) February 24, 2015It\u2019s devilishly simplistic \u2013 the earnest, real-world version of \u201cSomeone Should Do Something About All The Problems.\u201d There are terrorists out there?\nBut, alas, \u201cdefeat the terrorists\u201d is Bobby Jindal\u2019s full and complete strategy for combatting terrorism.\nThe mission for our military should be clear \u2013 defeat the terrorists.\n\u201cDefeat the terrorists\u201d is not an especially clear strategy either."}
