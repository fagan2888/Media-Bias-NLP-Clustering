However, with that self-imposed deadline approaching, CBS News\u2019 Sharyl Attkisson learned some of those who get their insurance through work are losing their coverage.\n\nAttkisson said on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that she learned that the government had earlier estimated that millions of workers would be dropped from their employee insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and for some it's already happening.\n\nNew Hampshire small business owner Nancy Clark was featured last year in a White House video blog, but things haven't gone quite according to plan for her plan. Last month, her insurer said it was hiking rates 39 percent starting next year. That's a $30,000 increase in costs to her.\n\nSo Clark decided to terminate the insurance she's offered her eight employees and turn to Obamacare, but there's been one problem after another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing technical difficulties. That's the nature of the beast,\u201d said Clark.\n\nVirginia Beach business owner Betsy Atkinson is also cancelling company insurance because her plan doesn't meet new Obamacare requirements and she can't afford to offer employees one that does.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to go find their own insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney has given repeated assurances that nothing will change for those insured through work, but in 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated Obamacare would \"collectively reduce the number of people with employer-sponsored health coverage by about 14 million.\"\n\nThe reason is some big companies will opt to save by paying the relatively small penalty for dropping employee insurance. Small businesses don't have to supply insurance and may find new policies too costly.\n\nFor her part, Clark plans to help employees pay for their outside insurance and remains an avid Obamacare supporter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that HealthCare.gov will be fixed,\u201d she said.\n\nClark told Attkisson that about half her employees who are having their work insurance cut have enrolled on HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe administration told Attkisson that the Affordable Care Act has slowed health care costs and premiums, saying \"the law is making it easier for businesses to offer coverage, just like it did in Massachusetts, when employer coverage increased after reform passed.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some people who get their health insurance through their jobs are losing it because of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-small-businesses-cancelling-health-insurance-plans-for-employees/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/26/77d4a171-b270-4a9e-9775-95fc751fc399/thumbnail/1200x630/d5bde7d3daed31d05f8b10607077b6fa/attkisson.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Some people who get their health insurance through their jobs are losing it because of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Some small businesses cancelling health insurance plans for employees"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some people who get their health insurance through their jobs are losing it because of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Some small businesses cancelling health insurance plans for employees", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/some-small-businesses-cancelling-health-insurance-plans-for-employees/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/some-small-businesses-cancelling-health-insurance-plans-for-employees/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-small-businesses-cancelling-health-insurance-plans-for-employees/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbsthismorning", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/26/77d4a171-b270-4a9e-9775-95fc751fc399/thumbnail/1200x630/d5bde7d3daed31d05f8b10607077b6fa/attkisson.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-small-businesses-cancelling-health-insurance-plans-for-employees/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/some-small-businesses-cancelling-health-insurance-plans-for-employees/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSThisMorning"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1feb\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration is promising the federal health care website, HealthCare.gov, will run smoothly by the end of this weekend.\nClark told Attkisson that about half her employees who are having their work insurance cut have enrolled on HealthCare.gov.\nFor her part, Clark plans to help employees pay for their outside insurance and remains an avid Obamacare supporter.\nThe reason is some big companies will opt to save by paying the relatively small penalty for dropping employee insurance.\nSo Clark decided to terminate the insurance she's offered her eight employees and turn to Obamacare, but there's been one problem after another."}
