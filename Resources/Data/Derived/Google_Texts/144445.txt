National Journal's Ron Fournier said Thursday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber's comments about how the law was written to take advantage of the stupidity of the American voter have only undermined "the president’s credibility even further."

"It undermines the central element of the Democratic party that a government is honest and transparent and can get things done well,” Fournier said.

He said he thinks that honesty and transparency in government shouldn’t be affected by party lines or covered as such by the media.

“I’ve been really struck by the fact that ok, this is a Democratic lie so we’ll pass on it," he said. "I’ve seen in the past where Republicans have taken a pass on Republican lies. It’s like we have blue lies and red lies in this country. You know, a lie is a lie is a lie. This is not only a lie but it is insulting to the American people to say that we’re stupid and yes it is going to affect the president’s ability to have any credibility with the public and defend this law.”
