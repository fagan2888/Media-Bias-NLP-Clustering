The band is giving fans an early listen, streaming the song and lyrics for \u201cYou Got Spirit, Kid\u201d via Coheedandcambria.com, with the digital download of the single available globally on July 10.\n\nThe Color Before The Sun is the outfit\u2019s eighth studio album and their first non-conceptual release, with the previous offerings forming the larger story of The Amory Wars, a science fiction saga depicting the story of Coheed and Cambria Kilgannon. The Color Before The Sun was recorded at St. Charles Studio in Nashville, and produced by Jay Joyce (Cage The Elephant, Eric Church).\n\nThe Color Before The Sun marks the first time Claudio Sanchez is exposing his raw feelings, narrated from his own perspective. \u201cI kind of want people to know that Coheed can write that sort of record,\u201d he explained of the album\u2019s departure from The Amory Wars. \u201cI\u2019ve always said in the past that there\u2019s never been a limitation on the band. It makes no sense to me to draw a line in the sand and never cross it.\u201d\n\nThe New York-based band\u2019s album arrives via the recently formed label, 300 Entertainment who pride themselves on being an independent, creative driven record label that focuses on intense artist development.\n\n300 Entertainment co-founder Lyor Cohen offers, \u201cCoheed and Cambria have created a lane and legacy for themselves that is very much their own. Their DIY approach fits the ethos of 300. They\u2019ve taken some brave artistic steps on this forthcoming new album and we are looking forward to sharing it with the world.\u201d\n\nFunny or Die recently shared an unexpected, new song from the band, with the quartet putting Supreme Court Justice Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinions from the Affordable Care Act and Same-Sex Marriage rulings to music, which can be seen in this clip: http://bit.ly/1eNN7Fs. The video, which has been viewed over 250,000 times, was not only picked up by music and comedy outlets but led a chorus of tweets and re-tweets from politicos including Michael Moore, Paul Begala and Chris Hayes.\n\nCoheed and Cambria return to the road in August with several festival appearances including headlining spots at Riot Fest and Fun Fun Fun Fest as well as a trio of special European performances of In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3.\n\nCoheed and Cambria on tour:\n\nAugust 8 \u2013 Nashville, TN \u2013 Ink-N-Iron Festival\n\nAugust 9 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 Wrecking Ball Atlanta\n\nAugust 14 \u2013 Kent, England \u2013 Hevy Fest 2015\n\nAugust 15 \u2013 Amsterdam, Netherlands \u2013 Neverender IKSSE:3\n\nAugust 16 \u2013 Holte-Stkenbrock, Geramyn \u2013 Serengeti Festival\n\nAugust 18 \u2013 Frankfurt, Germany \u2013 Neverender IKSSE:3\n\nAugust 19 \u2013 Cologne, Germany \u2013 Neverender IKSSE:3\n\nAugust 20 \u2013 Gampel, Switzerland \u2013 Open Air Gampel Festival\n\nAugust 21 \u2013 Hasselt, Belgium \u2013 Pukkelpop\n\nAugust 28-30 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Riot Fest\n\nSeptember 11-13 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Riot Fest\n\nSeptember 13 \u2013 Sterling Heights, MI \u2013 Chill on the Hill\n\nSeptember 19-20 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Riot Fest\n\nOctober 25 \u2013 Sacramento, CA \u2013 Aftershock Festival\n\nOctober 31 \u2013 Phoenix, AZ \u2013 Monster Mash Music Festival\n\nNovember 6-8 \u2013 Austin, TX \u2013 Fun Fun Fun Fest\n\nCoheed and Cambria is Claudio Sanchez (vocals/guitar), Travis Stever (guitar), Josh Eppard (drums) and Zach Cooper (bass).\n\nwww.coheedandcambria.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/coheedandcambria\n\nwww.twitter.com/coheed\n\nwww.instagram.com/coheedandcambria\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Icon vs. Icon", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.iconvsicon.com/2015/07/07/coheed-and-cambria-to-release-the-color-before-the-sun-on-october-9th/", "article_author_name": "Jason Price", "image": "http://www.iconvsicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/coheed-cambria-2015-1.jpg", "site_id": "36e6c1437c4211982ac398315ba8cdd5", "article_published_time": "2015-07-07T14:35:15+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T00:32:00+00:00", "keywords": "300 entertainment, claudio sanchez, coheed and cambria, heavy metal music, josh eppard, music, rock music, the amory wars, the color before the sun, travis stever, you got spirit kid, zach cooper, blog", "wp_version": "7.8.0.2"}, "generator": "Woo Framework Version 2.8.08", "og": {"site_name": "Icon vs. Icon", "description": "Coheed and Cambria release their new album,\u00a0The Color Before The Sun, on Oct. 9 via 300 Entertainment.
