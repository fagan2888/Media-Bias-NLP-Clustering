The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed the deadline for doing that is April 15. Anyone who completes the application by then will be covered starting May 1 and will not be subject to a financial penalty for not having insurance.\n\nMobile lawyer Henry Brewster, who took it upon himself to organize sign-up events throughout the city, said he is sponsoring one more for Saturday at his law office at 205 N. Conception St. from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe had 76 people come through on Monday, which was our heaviest day other than that one big push on Saturday in the churches,\u201d he said.\n\nHelp by phone\n\nThe following organizations have \u201cnavigators\u201d and \u201ccertified application counselors available to answer questions and provide help enrolling in a health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act: Providence Hospital (CARE) \u2013 251-633-1540 Enroll Alabama \u2013 251-471-5277 251-471-527 Mobile County Health Department \u2013 251-690-8158 251-690-8158 Franklin Primary Health Center \u2013 251-432-4117 251-432-4117 Mostellar Medical Center \u2013 251-824-2174 251-824-2174 The following organizations have \u201cnavigators\u201d and \u201ccertified application counselors available to answer questions and provide help enrolling in a health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act:\n\nOf those people, Brewster said, only about 10 actually finished the process. He said the website was down much of the day, first for a scheduled maintenance and then because of heavy volume.\n\n\u201cThis was a terribly frustrating day,\u201d he said.\n\nBrewster said he and other volunteers gave folks as much information as they could. He said he does not know how many of them since have been able to enroll on their own, but he said he suspects some of them \u2013 plus others \u2013 might show up Saturday. He said he thinks interest has picked up as people discover that their neighbors have found good deals on the exchange.\n\nBloomberg reported Thursday that many of the people who signed up late were younger, which would be good news for insurance companies who were counting on the younger and healthier to balance the sicker enrollees whom companies no longer can deny or charge more.\n\nThe story quotes Daniel Liss, the co-founder of Bama Covered, which was active on the state\u2019s college campuses.\n\nBrewster said he saw the trend first hand.\n\n\u201cI saw more young folks on Monday and definitely on the weekend than I had in six months,\u201d he said.\n\nBrewster said his interest in health care goes back to the early 1990s, when then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton led a White House task force that drafted legislation to extend coverage to the uninsured. Even though Brewster has lost many hours from his law practice, he said, it has been particularly gratifying to see people hugging volunteers who have just helped them sign up.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people who were really moved by this,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, news", "title": "Obamacare deadline passes, but efforts to enroll the uninsured go on", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare deadline passes, but efforts to enroll the uninsured go on\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/live/2014/04/obamacare_deadline_passes_but.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/henry-brewsterjpg-f56732146dd9c6a7.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12581202\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-03T21:58:49Z\", \"author\": \"Brendan Kirby\", \"tags\": [\"@river-mobile\",\"@river-state\",\"Affordable Care Act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/henry-brewsterjpg-f56732146dd9c6a7.jpg", "description": "Thanks to an extension announced by the Obama administration last month, people who did not sign up because of problems with HealthCare.gov have a grace period.
