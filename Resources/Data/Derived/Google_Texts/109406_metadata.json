I find it hard to believe that Gov. Chris Christie knew nothing about his staff\u2019s plotting a massive traffic jam on the ramp to the George Washington Bridge for political retribution.\n\nOn the other hand, I also find it hard to believe that Obama didn\u2019t know his own IRS was auditing his political enemies.\n\nAnd I find it hard to believe that Obama didn\u2019t know you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep your doctor under Obamacare.\n\nBut most of all, I find it hard to believe that MSNBC host Al Sharpton didn\u2019t know Tawana Brawley was lying when she claimed to have been gang-raped by rogue cops on the Wappingers Falls, N.Y., police force.\n\nBack in November 1987, 15-year-old Tawana Brawley was found curled up inside a plastic bag in an apartment building parking lot. She had feces and racist graffiti all over her body, her clothing was torn and burned, and she was apparently unconscious.\n\nWhen she emerged from her (fake) unconsciousness, she claimed she had been held captive in the woods for several days, while being raped and beaten by six white men, including policemen and the local prosecutor.\n\nThe story being utterly preposterous, every law enforcement agency in the universe was called in to investigate \u2014 the FBI, local, county and state police. Gov. Mario Cuomo directed the state attorney general, Robert Abrams, to investigate Brawley\u2019s claims.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton was one of Brawley\u2019s \u201cadvisers\u201d throughout this massively expensive investigation, along with lawyers Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason \u2014 both later disbarred.\n\nEight months and 1.3 million taxpayer dollars later (in today\u2019s dollars), the purported attack was exposed as a complete fraud. It turned out that Brawley made up the gang-rape story to avoid explaining to her volatile stepfather why she hadn\u2019t come home for four nights straight.\n\nAmong other findings, the grand jury\u2019s 170-page report noted these facts:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Al Sharpton should never be allowed to accuse anyone of wrongdoing, especially about who knew what when.", "title": "Is Chris Christie less believable than Tawana Brawley?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/al_sharpton-480x384.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/01/15/is-chris-christie-less-believable-than-tawana-brawley/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Al Sharpton should never be allowed to accuse anyone of wrongdoing, especially about who knew what when.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/al_sharpton-480x384.jpg", "description": "Al Sharpton should never be allowed to accuse anyone of wrongdoing, especially about who knew what when.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@AnnCoulter"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2744\"", "article_summary": "Back in November 1987, 15-year-old Tawana Brawley was found curled up inside a plastic bag in an apartment building parking lot.\nAnd I find it hard to believe that Obama didn\u2019t know you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep your doctor under Obamacare.\nChris Christie knew nothing about his staff\u2019s plotting a massive traffic jam on the ramp to the George Washington Bridge for political retribution.\nOn the other hand, I also find it hard to believe that Obama didn\u2019t know his own IRS was auditing his political enemies.\nBut most of all, I find it hard to believe that MSNBC host Al Sharpton didn\u2019t know Tawana Brawley was lying when she claimed to have been gang-raped by rogue cops on the Wappingers Falls, N.Y., police force."}
