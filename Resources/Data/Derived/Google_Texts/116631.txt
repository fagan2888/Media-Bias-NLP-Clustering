Holy Helbig!

Holy Family senior quarterback Chris Helbig picked up where he left off last season, completing 29-of-45 passes for 607 yards and six touchdowns on Friday in a 49-43 win over Mountain View.

The 607 passing yards is a state record, breaking Air Academy’s Adam Brown’s mark, who threw for 589 yards against Sand Creek last year. He spread the ball evenly, connecting with six different receivers, three of which had more than 100 yards apiece.

Helbig, who’s been receiving Division I looks in both basketball and football, owns the Tigers’ single-season passing yards record, throwing for 3,117 last year — good enough for 11th all-time in state history.

After one game, Helbig is on pace to throw for 6,070 yards, shattering Bear Creek’s Justin Holland’s record of 4,181 in 1998. It is doubtful he’ll continue at that pace.
