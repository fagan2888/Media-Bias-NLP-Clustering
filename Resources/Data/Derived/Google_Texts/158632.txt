The Bureau of TennCare has dropped Northrop Grumman as the developer of the state's uncompleted Medicaid eligibility system.

The Virginia-based aerospace and technology firm won the state's $35 million bid in 2012 to develop an updated computer system that would determine Medicaid eligibility based on new Affordable Care Act requirements.

The system was supposed to be operational by Jan. 1, 2014, but remains uncompleted. The delays have caused persistent issues for the agency, which faced a federal lawsuit this summer over noncompliance with application processing deadlines.

TennCare hired consulting firm and Big Four auditor KPMG in December to help decide whether to select a new vendor.

"The state and current vendor have mutually decided it to be in their respective best interests to terminate the current contract early," the agency said in a press release.

According to budget documents filed with the state, $4.6 million of the $35 million has been paid to Northrup Grumman, of which $468,000 was state funding.

TennCare will begin the process of selecting a new vendor for the eligibility system development, according to the release, though a timeline has not been announced. The state will continue to use the federal health insurance marketplace to process TennCare applications.
