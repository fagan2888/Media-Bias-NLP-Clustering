The proposal doesn\u2019t apply to policies offered through employers.\n\nOklahomans experiencing rate shock will have at least two alternatives to Blue Cross: CommunityCare, a Tulsa-based provider of health maintenance organization (HMO) policies, and UnitedHealthcare, a big national insurer that wants to enter the Affordable Care Act market here for the first time.\n\nThey also will have opportunities to reduce their monthly payments even if they stick with Blue Cross, by considering different provider networks, policy types, and deductible and coinsurance options the company already offers.\n\n\u201cThe big story is, rates are going up,\u201d said Mike Rhoads, deputy commissioner of the Oklahoma Insurance Department.\n\nRhoads said the increases reflect several factors. Among them:\n\n\u2022 Medical cost inflation is averaging about 6 percent to 9 percent across the board.\n\n\u2022 Companies made inaccurate cash flow estimates for 2014 and 2015 and now have more data.\n\n\u2022 Prescription drug costs were higher than estimated, partly because of expensive Hepatitis C treatments.\n\n\u2022 Companies underestimated how much treatment Affordable Care Act policyholders would seek once they obtained insurance.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t get the numbers right in 2015. They were guessing,\u201d Rhoads said. \u201cEvery carrier I talked to had lost money.\u201d\n\nSign up for a weekly newsletter from Oklahoma Watch\n\nThe premiums paid by any individual policy purchaser could vary significantly from the average rates. The variables include age, location, tobacco use, policy type, deductible and coinsurance options, and most important, the amount of any federal subsidy for which he or she qualifies. For some policyholders, the net increase could be zero. For some, it could be more than company-wide averages cited in rate filings. Any policy-type rate increase exceeding 10 percent is subject to approval later this year by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Oklahoma Insurance Department also has jurisdiction over Oklahoma rates. So far it has not attempted to reduce those approved by the federal government. Enrollment for 2016 coverage will begin Nov. 1. Blue Cross The 31 percent company-wide rate increase proposed by Blue Cross is cited in an actuarial memo the company submitted in May to the federal government. It was part of a detailed rate filing required by the Obama administration for proposed plan-specific rate hikes exceeding 10 percent. Final approved rates won\u2019t be announced until this fall. Tulsa-based Blue Cross offers a number of provider networks in Oklahoma. It listed three individual networks exceeding the 10 percent threshold: Blue Preferred PPO, 44 percent; Blue Advantage PPO, 34 percent, and Blue Preferred PPO MSPP (a multi-state network), 23 percent. PPO stands for preferred provider organization. PPO plans generally pay more if patients use doctors and medical facilities in the \u201cpreferred\u201d network. They cover a smaller portion of costs if patients seek treatment \u201cout of network.\u201d HMO plans generally require patients to only use medical professionals and facilities that belong to its network. That restricts patient freedom to see anyone or go anywhere they want for treatment, but it allows the HMOs to control costs better. Blue Cross is the dominant insurer in Oklahoma\u2019s Affordable Care Act market. In 2014, it collected more than half of all premiums paid by individual policy purchasers here. Ted Haynes, president of Blue Cross Blue Shield Oklahoma, said in an emailed statement the proposed increases reflected the company\u2019s ability to use data from more than a year of Affordable Care Act market experience to calculate 2016 premiums. \u201cThe main driver of the rate increases of our individual ACA plans are the higher than expected claims experience with the members in these plans,\u201d Haynes said. \u201c\u2026We are committed to our members to maintain the affordability of our products.\u201d Haynes said the out-of-pocket cost to customers could be considerably less than the unsubsidized rates since most Obamacare market users qualify for federal subsidies. He also noted that the percentage increases did not reflect the fact that some policies might have been underpriced in comparison to competing plans. Blue Cross declined to provide any information about the dollar costs associated with its rate filings or plans. Other than the percentage figures reported higher in this story, all plan-specific details were redacted from the actuarial memo submitted to the federal government. The details will become public later this year. Other Insurers CommunityCare, also based in Tulsa, mainly issues HMO plans in Oklahoma. Its proposed rate filing and supporting documents for 2016 HMO plans are not publicly available yet. That\u2019s because it did not propose any HMO individual plan rate increases exceeding 10 percent and because HMO rate filings are exempt from the Open Records Act, according to the Oklahoma Insurance Department. CommunityCare Vice President and spokesman Greg Burn did not respond to interview requests. UnitedHealthcare was not required to report 2016 premium rate increases because it did not offer individual policies in Oklahoma\u2019s Affordable Care Act market in 2015. It has filed proposed rates for next year, but they will not be posted publicly until this fall. A company spokeswoman in Houston declined to provide Oklahoma Watch with any information about UnitedHealthcare\u2019s proposed rates for 2016. Blue Cross, CommunityCare and United Healthcare will be the only insurance companies offering Obamacare-compliant policies to Oklahomans next year. One competitor, Assurant Health, recently announced plans to curtail its health policy business nationwide and has begun notifying its Oklahoma policyholders. Another company, GlobalHealth of Tulsa, is expected to drop out of the market. Aetna Life Insurance Co. and its Coventry Health Care subsidiary bailed out of the Oklahoma market this year. The proposed rate increases are unfortunate but not necessarily surprising, said Andrew Rice, former executive director of the Variety Care Foundation in Oklahoma City. Variety Care provides low-cost medical care to lower-income people. \u201cIt just points to how expensive the care is,\u201d said Rice, who also was a state senator. \u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with the ramifications of a broken system. It\u2019s evidence of how much time it\u2019s going to take to get the metrics going in the right direction \u2026 It\u2019s going to take years.\u201d Support Oklahoma Watch\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport the only statewide investigative reporting publication in Oklahoma.
