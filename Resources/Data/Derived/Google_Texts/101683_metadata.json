But it's telling that Morgan said the demographic profile of its new Obamacare enrollees was about what they were expecting. Presumably, they're also seeing new enrollees pay their first premiums at about the rate they expected.\n\nNote that these are no longer just vague predictions. Anthem and other insurers filed their rate increase applications with the state last week, and final rates will be set a few weeks from now.\n\nObamacare got off to a rough start. But despite endless hysterics from an endless stream of conservative talking heads\u2014enrollment numbers are low, there aren't enough young people, nobody is paying their premiums, blah blah blah\u2014Obamacare is working.
