The Dirty Girl Mud Run is a 5K obstacle course for women that was held in Raleigh last year.

It's set again for May, but organizers announced Monday that the race will be in Archdale. That’s just south of High Point - and 88.6 miles from downtown Raleigh.

The name on the race website was changed Tuesday from the “Raleigh” mud run to the “Raleigh-Greensboro” mud run.

Plenty of angry racers contacted 5 On Your Side after they said organizers pointed to a written policy that "aims to have venues within 90 miles of the advertised market." They were told the policy means the entry fees of up to $75 per person will not be refunded.

“I would have never signed up if I knew it was going to be someplace, like, outside of Greensboro," runner Kim Foresta said. "I'm not thinking of driving an hour and a half and getting back in the car with mud all over me.”

Race organizers said they were bombarded with calls Tuesday and offered to waive parking fees at the event. They are also looking into transportation options for registered runners.

Tia Mattson, chief marketing officer with Dirty Girl Mud Run, said the group is “trying to take special consideration when possible” in issuing refunds. About 2,000 people have signed up for the run.

“It’s not our policy to do mass refunds,” she said. “(We’re) planning to contact every one that reached out to us.”

Mattson said Archdale was chosen because there was no suitable or available venue in Raleigh for the date of the run. She said the company did not mean to misrepresent the area.

5 On Your Side’s Monica Laliberte said the incident should serve as a reminder for runners to check policies before they sign up and make sure the venue is clearly mapped out.
