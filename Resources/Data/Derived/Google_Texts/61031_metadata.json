Pierone, Jr.\n\nPierone has been doing all he can to not return the drone, even though he does not have a warrant nor has he been able to articulate any law that Rubeka broke with the drone.\n\nIn fact, he admitted they are trying their best to comb the law books to find something; anything; that they can charge Rupeka with. All they needed was just more time to read the books, which is why it is \u201cstill under investigation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all a day in the life for Rupeka of Capital District Cop Block, who recently made national headlines after he was pepper sprayed and arrested for flipping a cop off.\n\nThat cop was fired and Rupeka was awarded a settlement from the Saratoga Springs Police Department, part of which he used to purchase a DJI Phantom 3 quadcopter, the one they confiscated.\n\nThe latest incident with Fougere took place Friday, September 25 in front of the New York State Police Headquarters in Latham, about ten miles from Albany, where he had his original drone confiscated.\n\nFinding him suspicious because he was flying a drone, Fougere began bullying him for his identification, telling him he was required to hand it over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going around, you\u2019re videotaping our state police facility for no apparent reason and if I\u2019m asking you who you are, you have to provide identification,\u201d Fougere told him.\n\nBut Rupeka reminded him that he was under no obligation to provide identification unless the trooper was able to articulate a reasonable suspicion that he was somehow involved in a crime.\n\nAnd while Fougere refused to acknowledge that, his sergeant stepped out of the building to ensure he had no grounds to detain Rupeka, making Fougere look like a baby-faced rookie.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s been on the force for a few years and can be seen in this not nearly as embarrassing video where he talks about the importance of strapping your child seat in tightly.\n\nClick on the audio clips below to hear the conversations between Rupeka and Pierone as well as internal affairs that went nowhere.\n\nAnd watch the two videos below, the first one showing his stand-off with Fougere, in which he emerged victorious, the second one showing his standoff with Pierone, who up to now, has been victorious in keeping Rupeka\u2019s personal property.\n\nRupeka has provided us with Pierone\u2019s contact info.\n\nPierone\u2019s cell phone: 518-858-9641.
