—Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged voters Sunday to elect her to office and avoid the negative economic consequences she said come with a Republican presidency.Appearing at a town hall meeting at Gilbert H. Hood Middle School, Clinton warned that a Republican president would work to provide more tax breaks to millionaires and corporations...“Look at any of the proposals that Republicans have made and they add up to trillions of dollars of more tax breaks as opposed to my approach,” she said to loud applause from the hundreds of supporters who filled the school’s gymnasium. “We need the wealthy to pay more taxes, and we don’t need any tax increases for the middle class — that’s my policy.”..Clinton told the audience there have been three Republican presidents and two Democratic presidents, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton, over the last 35 years. She said there is no comparison to the economic benefits of having the two Democrats in office over the three Republicans...“We know that our economy does better when a Democrat is President— incomes go up for everybody, not just those at the top,” Clinton said. “We know how important it is when it goes down, and you are four times more likely to have a recession when you have a Republican in the White House. ”..Clinton praised President Barack Obama for his work to help hold the economy together despite the financial upheaval of the Great Recession of 2008. She said he doesn’t get enough credit for his actions in helping reverse the downturn and allowing the country to begin making economic progress...In asking for voters’ support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary, she went on to say that the next President will have to take a hard look “at how we do more to help families deal with the problems that keep you up at night— a relative with Alzheimer’s, with substance abuse — the challenges I’ve heard about from one end of New Hampshire to the other.”..Clinton said New Hampshire suffers from one of the highest rates of heroin overdoses in the country, and much more needs to be done to address the problem.“I can’t tell you all of the answers, I don’t know them, but I know we have to work together to find them, and I will do whatever I can as your President,” she said...Clinton said more should be done to make community colleges tuition free. She said the colleges have become in the 21st century what high schools were in the 20th century.“We need to add those two years, so that young people can get the training and the credentialing they need to get good jobs,” Clinton said...She added that four-year colleges need to be made more affordable and the cost of student debt needs to drop dramatically.“If you can refinance a mortgage or a car payment, you’ve got to be able to refinance your student debt,” she said...
