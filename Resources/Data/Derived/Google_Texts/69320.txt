But there's a backstory to the current chaos of the GOP conference and the withdrawal of Kevin McCarthy from the speakership race. The GOP leadership in the House and Senate has failed to pass legislation to repeal the Obama agenda and put the measures on the president's desk. If he vetoes them, so be it. We go to 2016. But it's all been broken promises.



Former Bush speechwriter Peter Robinson just reminded readers on the Ricochet website of an interview he had with Kevin McCarthy before the 2014 midterms.



Robinson: "You will pass a reform agenda, putting bill after bill on President Obama's desk?"



McCarthy: "Yeah, that's our job."

It never happened. No bills passed by the House and Senate to repeal Obamacare. No pro-growth tax reform (especially corporate tax reform). No broad-based energy bill. No bill to retract Obama's illegal executive immigration actions.
