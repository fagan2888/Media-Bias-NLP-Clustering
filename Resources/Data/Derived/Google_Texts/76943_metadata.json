Oral-B cites orthodontists can charge up to $10,000, with few health insurance providers willing to cover some of the total cost. So some teens have started to make their own.\n\nDIY braces are the subject of several recent YouTube videos. In these videos, teens are tying elastic bands around their teeth in order to fill gaps in their smile. One YouTube user in particular, Shalom DeSota, demonstrates the method after she claims to have used it to fill her own gap big enough \"to fit a hanger.\" \u201cIt's going to hurt really bad, especially for the first few days,\u201d DeSota said. \u201cYou're going to want to give up, but don't, because it's totally worth it in the end.\u201d\n\nActual dentists would have to disagree. PopSugar reported The American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics have spoken out against teens using this alternative method, saying though it may be cheaper, it runs the risk of causing severe, irreparable tooth and gum damage\n\nHow so?

And when the gums are subject to pressure, the blood supply cuts off and ultimately causes inflammation and infection.\n\nThat doesn't mean teens genuinely eager to close the gaps in their smile are out of options. PopSugar found many dental schools offer affordable orthodontic care, including braces. Dental school students are in training, which means they've learned how to correctly and healthily straigten teeth.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diy, braces, teens, use, home, method, avoid, high, costs, dentist, risk, severe, damage", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dentists speak out against the rise in homemade braces.", "title": "Teens Are Dangerously Making Their Own Braces", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/diy-braces-teens-use-home-method-avoid-high-costs-dentist-risk-severe-damage-348046", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/16/diy-braces-teens-use-home-method-avoid-high-costs-dentist-risk-severe-damage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dentists speak out against the rise in homemade braces.", "title": "Teens Are Dangerously Making Their Own Braces", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/diy-braces-teens-use-home-method-avoid-high-costs-dentist-risk-severe-damage-348046", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/16/diy-braces-teens-use-home-method-avoid-high-costs-dentist-risk-severe-damage.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/16/diy-braces-teens-use-home-method-avoid-high-costs-dentist-risk-severe-damage.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-16T17:41:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-16T17:54:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dentists speak out against the rise in homemade braces."}, "article_summary": "In these videos, teens are tying elastic bands around their teeth in order to fill gaps in their smile.\nDIY braces are the subject of several recent YouTube videos.\nThat doesn't mean teens genuinely eager to close the gaps in their smile are out of options.\nOral-B cites orthodontists can charge up to $10,000, with few health insurance providers willing to cover some of the total cost.\nAnd when the gums are subject to pressure, the blood supply cuts off and ultimately causes inflammation and infection."}
