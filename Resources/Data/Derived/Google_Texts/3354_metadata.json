I don\u2019t play golf, so maybe I don\u2019t get it. But you golfers out there, is this not obsessive?\n\nIf Obama went to church two out of every three days on vacation \u2013 I know this would never happen, but stick with me here \u2013 wouldn\u2019t he be labeled A RELIGIOUS FANATIC and watched carefully by the MSM for signs that he\u2019s a lunatic?\n\nObama is golfing like there\u2019s no tomorrow \u2013 and who knows? Given his foreign policy, he may be right \u2013 playing today in Hawaii for the eighth time on a vacation that\u2019s 13 days old, for the second time in a year that\u2019s two days old, and for the 159th time in a presidency that\u2019s getting old.\n\nObama is golfing with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, the prime minister\u2019s teen-aged son, Max Key, and White House aide Marvin Nicholson. The New Zealand media has reported that Mr. Key owns a home in Hawaii.\n\nObama was not as successful in front of the pool as he was yesterday. From the pool report:\n\nAt 9:56 a.m., the pool was escorted to the second green of the Kaneohe Bay golf course to glimpse President Obama on the course. The foursome pulled up in two golf carts with the president and the prime minister riding together. Obama, in a lavender golf shirt, khaki pants and khaki baseball cap, grabbed two clubs from his bag before striding toward the green. The group joked as they golfed and appeared to be playing a fairly casual round. Obama initially putted from just off the green, announcing that he was opting to putt. When he left his ball well short of the flag, Obama said, \u201cI guess I should have chipped it after all.\u201d The president\u2019s second putt rolled close to the hole, and he opted for a gimme shot rather than putting a third time. Nicholson and Max Key appeared to be partners. When Max sank a putt, Obama joked, \u201cHe\u2019s doing it in front of the cameras, too.\u201d Obama told Max it was a good shot and gave him a high five. The four continued to banter as they played, with Obama ribbing Nicholson when a putt went astray. As the pool was led away from the green, Obama was joking with the prime minister about the challenge of beating the younger players in their group.\n\nThe round with the New Zealand PM is a rare example of Obama combining some work with play on the fairway. He usually golfs with youngish aides when at the White House or friends while traveling.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88c6\"", "article_summary": "Obama is golfing with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, the prime minister\u2019s teen-aged son, Max Key, and White House aide Marvin Nicholson.\nWhen Max sank a putt, Obama joked, \u201cHe\u2019s doing it in front of the cameras, too.\u201d Obama told Max it was a good shot and gave him a high five.\nObama, in a lavender golf shirt, khaki pants and khaki baseball cap, grabbed two clubs from his bag before striding toward the green.\nThe four continued to banter as they played, with Obama ribbing Nicholson when a putt went astray.\nAs the pool was led away from the green, Obama was joking with the prime minister about the challenge of beating the younger players in their group."}
