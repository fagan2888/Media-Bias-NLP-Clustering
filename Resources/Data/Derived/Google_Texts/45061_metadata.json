His projections of growth for the area compare closely to the state average, he said, although the area is doing better than a lot of areas in Texas.\n\nPerryman, Lindale native and president and chief executive officer of Waco-based The Perryman Group, gave his annual economic forecast for the Tyler area, as well as the state and nation.\n\nThe event, which drew a crowd of about 620 people, is put on each year by the Tyler Area Chamber of Commerce and the Tyler Economic Development Council.\n\nLOCAL ECONOMY\n\nDuring a news conference before the luncheon, Perryman said the health care industry will continue to have a major impact to the local economy.\n\n\u201cThrough thick and thin, in good economies and bad, it keeps growing and growing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Affordable Care Act had a lot of good intentions and will bring more access to health care and will have a positive affect once several things with it are fixed. \u201cThe most important thing about it is give us the rules \u2026 now, people just don\u2019t know,\u201d he said of the changes being made to health care.\n\nPerryman expects sales tax and employment figures for the area to continue to be very close to the state average.\n\nHe said alcohol sales in Tyler have been \u201cremarkably on target\u201d from what they projected they would be before they came into effect. He said they are generating about $36,000 to $37,000 per month in sales tax revenue for Tyler, which is \u201cvery positive\u201d for the economy.\n\nCommercial and residential real estate has picked up since the recession, he said. There are few cities of Tyler\u2019s size doing the amount of construction seen here now.\n\nPerryman said another sector growing in the Tyler area is energy. \u201cWe will continue to see expansion as we will all over Texas,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough East Texas isn\u2019t seeing a big surge in the oil and gas industry as in West and South Texas, it is doing well, he said, adding that East Texas has energy infrastructure that supports the industry across the state and nation.\n\nTEXAS\n\nThe state is doing well and is one of the best states in the country for job growth, creating about 300,000 jobs per year, Perryman told the luncheon crowd.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing a lot of things right in Texas right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state didn\u2019t have the terrible housing crisis like most of the country, he said. \u201cIt has a healthy banking community, good cost structure and good infrastructure in key places.\u201d\n\nHe said the technology industry also is doing well here, but what is driving the state is the oil and gas sector.\n\nHe said 1973 was a peak year for oil production in Texas but declined every year until 2008. Since then, the state has made up 30 years of that decline, he noted.\n\nIn 2010, Texas was producing 1 million barrels per day and now produces about 3 million barrels per day, he said.\n\nShale formations being discovered in Texas and elsewhere contain mostly natural gas. He said out of the three largest shale plays in the country, Texas has two of them in South and West Texas.\n\nLarge companies that four years ago were looking to import natural gas are now looking to export it, he said.\n\nPerryman believes the real estate and oil bust in the 1980s was very different than the recent one experienced. \u201cI think it\u2019s in a much better place today,\u201d he said, adding that it has a lot to do with today\u2019s more diverse economy.\n\nHe said Texas is adding about 1,000 people to its population every day so infrastructure such as roadways needs to be improved. Education also needs to be bettered \u201cif we want to compete with the national economy of the future,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Texas has consistently seen big businesses open locations here.\n\nNATIONAL FORECAST\n\nPerryman said there was a lot of mess in Washington, D.C., this past year with the fiscal cliff, Affordable Care Act, government shutdown and debt ceiling woes. He told the crowd that the nation would not default on its debt and will always increase the debt ceiling because it doesn\u2019t have a choice to avoid an economic collapse. But suspending the debt ceiling leaves everyone wondering what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nPerryman said the good thing that came out of the shutdown was that \u201cpeople sent a message to Washington \u2014 we\u2019re fed up.\u201d He said it was the first time Republicans and Democrats worked together to come up with something.\n\nThe country is growing at 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year, which is bringing up the economy.\n\n\u201cThings are getting better, but they\u2019re not getting better enough,\u201d Perryman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very slow, sluggish recovery.\u201d\n\nHe said the country does not have back the jobs back it lost during recession, and corporate America is sitting on money, which doesn\u2019t help the economy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "Economist Dr. Ray Perryman believes the Tyler area economy will continue to grow closely with Te...", "title": "Annual forecast projects growth - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/192607/annual-forecast-projects-growth", "image": "http://www.focusinon.me/photos/i-ZXHfT7G/0/L/i-ZXHfT7G-L.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce31\"", "article_summary": "The event, which drew a crowd of about 620 people, is put on each year by the Tyler Area Chamber of Commerce and the Tyler Economic Development Council.\nHe said out of the three largest shale plays in the country, Texas has two of them in South and West Texas.\nPerryman, Lindale native and president and chief executive officer of Waco-based The Perryman Group, gave his annual economic forecast for the Tyler area, as well as the state and nation.\n\u201cTexas is leading the world in economic growth right now,\u201d he said during a news conference before the 30th annual Economic Outlook Conference Thursday.\nHis projections of growth for the area compare closely to the state average, he said, although the area is doing better than a lot of areas in Texas."}
