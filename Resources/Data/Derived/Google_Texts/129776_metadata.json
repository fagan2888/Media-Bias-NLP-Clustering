He loves both nerd chic and chic nerds, and can be seen hosting events where they meet \u2014 like #TNW2015.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s running for President included several references to his take on Net Neutrality. It reminded me, naturally, of my recent trip to Disney World.\n\nF**k it, we'll do it live! Our biggest ever edition of TNW Conference is fast approaching! Join 10,000 tech leaders this May in Amsterdam. Learn more\n\nBecause while waiting in the long, long line for Thunder Mountain, it\u2019s hard not to hate the guys with VIP tickets who glide right to the front. But the \u201cwildest ride in the west\u201d is not the most important ride in 2015. That\u2019s internet access.\n\nAnd if Cruz has his way, Comcast and Verizon will be like Disney World. Netflix will pay through the nose for that sweet, sweet VIP broadband while the next disruptive company \u2013 the one that you can\u2019t even imagine yet? It will be stuck in line with me, and you\u2019ll have to imagine it. Because it will never see the light of day.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to wrap my head around those who claim to love the internet and innovation and yet want to stifle competition by killing Net Neutrality. President Cruz asks us to, \u201cImagine innovation thriving on the internet\u201d while saying Net Neutrality would cause the internet to \u201coperate at the speed of government.\u201d\n\nThen it hit me: it used to be that only we nerds used a lot of technology. This ranged from nerds-lite, like me, who can\u2019t code, to bona fide nerds who get annoyed when a guy who can\u2019t even code calls himself a nerd.\n\nBut then, like a turtlenecked Prometheus, Steve Jobs gave the fire of technology to the rest of mankind. And also like Prometheus, the gods did smite Steve Jobs in an internal organ, and he was taken from us.\n\nI digress. The point is that everyone uses amazing technology, but many can be confused about how it works.\n\nHere\u2019s where the snake oil salesmen come in.\n\nThey tell people\u2026 what\u2019s that impolite term for what they tell us? Oh yes: LIES. Lies designed to make money. For example:\n\nThrottles and Fast Lanes are Somehow Good for Consumers.\n\nThe complaints against Net Neutrality are well represented in the Orwellianly named, \u201cInternet Freedom Act.\u201d\n\nDid you ever notice how laws with \u201cFreedom\u201d in the name aren\u2019t pro-freedom? It\u2019s kind of like how countries with \u201cDemocratic\u201d or \u201cPeople\u2019s\u201d in the name are neither democratic nor pro-people.\n\nThe false arguments go like this: Innovation thrives on the internet only when providers can charge whatever they want to whomever they want and dole out whatever speeds they want \u2013 and if you don\u2019t let providers do this, the lack of profit will kill incentive to investment and thus the internet.\n\nFirst of all, no one\u2019s saying don\u2019t make any profit. We\u2019re saying don\u2019t make MONOPOLY profits.\n\nSecond, we have a same system in the Netherlands where I live, and our internet speed would make an American blush.\n\nNow, admittedly, the Netherlands and the USA are different markets, but the point is: Dutch companies still invest and still profit without being a monopoly or charging content makers rent.\n\nThird, anyone who says monopolies create new products and lower prices versus companies that compete is living in one of those countries with \u201cPeople\u2019s\u201d in its name.\n\nWithout competition, Apple offered choice in iPhone size like Henry Ford offered Model T color: you could have any screen you liked as long as it was 3.5 inches. With competition you can get a 6 plus, a 6 or even a 5. Remember when cute little phonette seemed big?\n\nPro-business people are supposed to support competition, right? And they usually do until they become monopolies. Or start receiving money from monopolies. Then they say things like this:\n\nThere was already plenty of competition for Broadband in America; 75 percent of American households have access to two or more providers.\n\nSure, this was true in when you looked at the old definition of broadband, 4MB download. But 4MB is high speed like Dancing with the Stars is high culture.\n\nIt\u2019s not. 25 MB download speed, the standard set by the FCC in January, is barely high speed. And only 25 percent of households don\u2019t deal with a monopoly in getting that 25 MB access. 19 percent have no high speed access at all!\n\nSo, are opponents (a) stupid and under informed, or (b) lying, perhaps due to pressure from moneyed interests? I hate having this conversation with my kids:\n\n\u201cPapa, are the people making big decisions crooked liars?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, Charlie, don\u2019t worry. They\u2019re probably just dumb.\u201d\n\nAnd Commander in Chief Cruz might be. But for most everyone else, it\u2019s a Santa Claus lie. I suspect that, to paraphrase Upton Sinclair, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get a man to understand something when he\u2019s a goddamn liar in the pocket of cable companies.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an idea for the cable companies: make content that people want. Pull a Netflix or an Amazon. My pitch: \u201cBetter Call Lowell,\u201d a show that envisions the rise of Lowell C McAdam, CEO of Verizon, back in his days as a heroic cable repairman.\n\n\u201cDammit, ma\u2019am \u2014 I can\u2019t stay and make love to you while your husband\u2019s gone! First of all, you\u2019re a married woman. But more importantly: I said I\u2019d be at my next stop between 10 am and 5 pm, and when a cable man makes a promise, he keeps it!\u201d\n\nBut whatever the cable companies do, they should quit fighting the new rules and stop complaining in Morse code. They should stop acting like losers, and act like winners.\n\nPretend they won the Superbowl and declare, \u201cI\u2019m going to Disney World!\u201d They\u2019ll love paying to skip the line at Thunder Mountain.
