Two people are dead after a car crash early Sunday morning on County Road 173 south of Cody Taylor Lane in Bonifay.

According to Florida Highway Patrol (FHP), the driver and the passenger were heading southbound on CR-173 when they passed another vehicle in a "no passing zone."

The driver of the vehicle lost control and entered into a ditch. The vehicle overturned several times and the two occupants were ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead on scene. Officials say neither occupant was wearing a seatbelt, and alcohol may have been a factor.

Officials have released the name of one of the occupants, Mary Elizabeth Sewell, 39, of Bonifay. The other occupants family has not been notified, so FHP has not released their name.

At this time officials are still investigating who was driving the car at the time of the crash
