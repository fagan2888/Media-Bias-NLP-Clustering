(RALEIGH)--As NCNN first reported earlier this week, state employees could lose an option to their health insurance and see costs rise under changes to be considered by the North Carolina State Health Plan board of trustees.

The proposal could eliminate the current PPO 80/20 plan and force those members to take either the PPO 70/30 plan or the Consumer-Driven Health Plan, both of which have premiums. State Employees Association of North Carolina Director Chuck Stone says it's a slap in the face. He says there are alternatives to this cost cutting move, such as tying reimbursements to Medicaid rates.

Executives who run the health plan have recommended to the trustees that they consider eliminating coverage for spouses, meaning they would likely have to seek coverage through the Affordable Care Act.

The board of the State Health Plan is scheduled to vote on the change Friday.
