The debate doesn't leave a lot of time for candidates to leave an impression, said O'Reilly. \"Do you have one thing that you think tomorrow is going to really be a stunner?\"\n\nCarson said yes, but he didn't want to give anything away ahead of time. Fifty percent of people still don't know who he is, Carson said, and he views that as a \"tremendous advantage.\" In the debate, Carson looks forward to changing the minds of people who think \"he's a great doctor, but doesn't know anything about anything else.\" He predicted, \"I think we'll blow that one out of the water.\"\n\nCarson added that all his debate notes are in his head. He will have an easier time than some candidates because he doesn't need to stick to talking points, he said.\n\n\"I only need to talk about what's true. I don't have to try to remember talking points or the multiple things that people have told me,\" Carson said. \"I just need to talk about what's true. And I think people will see that.\"\n\nHe plans to steer clear of inflammatory language like the time where he said Obamacare was the worst thing since slavery because he has \"learned that if you use inflammatory language people are not able to hear your message.\"\n\nO'Reilly said he detected some uncharacteristic nervousness in fellow candidate Donald Trump, and wondered if Carson might also be apprehensive.\n\n\"Not at all,\" laughed Carson. \"It's not brain surgery.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former pediatric neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson told Bill O'Reilly Wednesday he doesn't have any cheat sheets or notes for Thursday's debate \u2013 and he's not too worried, because it's not brain surgery.\nBill O'Reilly asked whether Carson would stand out on the crowded GOP stage, and he asked the doctor if he had any strategy to get attention.\nInterestingly enough, people have been saying that to me all along, Carson said.
