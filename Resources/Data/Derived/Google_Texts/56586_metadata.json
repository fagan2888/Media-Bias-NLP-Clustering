( Courtesy: Compassion & Choices )\n\nThree terminally ill patients lost a court battle in California Friday over whether they should have the right to request and take lethal medication to hasten their deaths.\n\nSan Diego Superior Court Judge Gregory Pollack said he would dismiss the case, adding that the issues were beyond his role as a judge to decide and should instead be put to the state Legislature or voters to establish new law.\n\nPlaintiffs vowed to appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly frustrating, but it\u2019s a temporary setback,\u201d said Elizabeth Wallner of Sacramento, a plaintiff in the case who was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. \u201cI am optimistic that we\u2019ll prevail in the end. It\u2019s too big of an issue to leave uncovered.\u201d\n\nWallner began a series of treatments for her cancer in 2011, including surgeries to remove her colon and parts of her liver, radiation, and numerous rounds of chemotherapy. In the midst of her treatment, she realized that she wanted to have control over her own death.\n\n\u201cI was throwing up in the bathroom, and my son was taking care of me,\u201d she said. He was 16 at the time. \u201cI looked over at his face and I saw him just absolutely stricken, watching his mother experience this. I thought, \u2018That\u2019s enough. My son doesn\u2019t need to see this.\u2019 I should have the right to make that decision when it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThe case seeks to challenge current California law (Section 401 of the penal code), which makes it a crime to deliberately aid or advise another person to commit suicide. Plaintiffs say this prohibits people\u2019s doctors from discussing or prescribing medications that could end their lives, and that prohibition violates their rights to privacy, liberty and free speech under the California Constitution.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs \u2014 the three patients and a physician \u2014 argued that the option to hasten death is an extension of previously recognized legal rights to make end-of-life decisions, including the right to refuse life-sustaining treatments, like a feeding tube or ventilator.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re suffering, and you know you\u2019re going to die anyway, it should be up to you to decide when enough is enough,\u201d said Kevin Diaz, an attorney with Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group representing the plaintiffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep trying any way we can to make sure this is an option.\u201d\n\nBut state Attorney General Kamala Harris, one of the defendants in the case, argued that there is no right to assisted suicide embedded in California law. Health statutes that protect patients\u2019 rights to withdraw treatment do not include a right to provide proactive assistance to end someone\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cNo court has ever extended the right to privacy to encompass an affirmative medical intervention to kill oneself,\u201d Julie Trinh, deputy attorney general, wrote in a legal brief.\n\nShe wrote that while the court has sympathized in the past with the plight of the terminally ill, it concluded that the question of allowing physician-assisted suicide is a legislative matter, rather than a judicial one.\n\nThe judge in this case agreed. He said he would issue a formal ruling on Monday.\n\nA bill that aims to legalize physician-assisted suicide in California (SB128) has been tabled for the rest of the year, after stalling in the Assembly Health Committee. Several attempts in other states to pass a similar bill this year have also failed.\n\nThe practice is legal in five states. The courts authorized the practice in Montana and New Mexico. Vermont passed a law in its legislature, while voters approved ballot measures in Washington and Oregon.\n\nThere is one other lawsuit pending in California.\n\nThe three patient plaintiffs in this case are worried that the legal process will be too slow to provide relief for them. Christy O\u2019Donnell, a single mother from Santa Clarita (Los Angeles County) who is dying from brain cancer, broke down in tears after the hearing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left to live,\u201d she said. \u201cThese options are urgent for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three terminally ill patients had filed the case challenging California law, which makes aiding someone's death a felony.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Judge Says He Will Dismiss Right-to-Die Lawsuit\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/07\\/24\\/judge-says-he-will-dismiss-right-to-die-lawsuit\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-24 14:43:34\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-07-24 17:39:36\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":51616,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Physician-assisted Suicide\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/242238.jpeg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Three terminally ill patients had filed the case challenging California law, which makes aiding someone's death a felony.", "title": "Judge Says He Will Dismiss Right-to-Die Lawsuit", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/07/24/judge-says-he-will-dismiss-right-to-die-lawsuit/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/242238.jpeg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "physician-assisted suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf1d\"", "article_summary": "San Diego Superior Court Judge Gregory Pollack said he would dismiss the case, adding that the issues were beyond his role as a judge to decide and should instead be put to the state Legislature or voters to establish new law.\nThe three patient plaintiffs in this case are worried that the legal process will be too slow to provide relief for them.\nPlaintiff Christy O'Donnell, who is terminally ill with lung cancer, speaks at a news conference outside San Diego Courthouse after the hearing.\nHealth statutes that protect patients\u2019 rights to withdraw treatment do not include a right to provide proactive assistance to end someone\u2019s life.\nIn the midst of her treatment, she realized that she wanted to have control over her own death."}
