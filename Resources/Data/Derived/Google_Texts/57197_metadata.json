No one was hurt, but the house was destroyed, he said.\n\nFire investigators shoveled through charred debris Sunday morning in front of the house, which was missing a section of roof. Most of its front facade had burned away.\n\nNeighbor Cecelia Rooney, 97, said she saw the flames Saturday evening.\n\n\"It's a shock,\" she said.\n\nFire companies from Point Pleasant, Point Pleasant Beach, Laurelton and Herbertsville responded to the fire, which remains under investigation, Hobson said.\n\nJoshua Schnoor, of Barnegat, set up a gofundme account on Saturday to help the residents of the home, Stacey and Ted Vadurro and their two daughters ages 6 and 2, because Schnoor's wife is a friend with Stacey Vadurro. Schnoor said it was a no-brainer to help the family out when he was contacted on Sunday evening by the Asbury Park Press.\n\n\"Around 7:30 p.m. Saturday night, my wife got a call about what happened to the Vadurro's house and she went running over there to help them,\" Schnoor said. \"When my wife got over there, she said everything is gone. I asked her if I should set up a gofundme account to help them. She said do it.:\n\nAnd that's what Schnoor did.\n\nAs of 7:30 p.m. Sunday, March 8, almost 12 hours later, the gofundme account set up for the Vadurro's has raised over $12,000.\n\nSchnoor also said that a list of items, which are described on the gofundeme account, are being accepted as donations for the Vadurro family and those items can be dropped off at International Tan, located at 2428 Bridge Ave in Point Pleasant during normal business hours.\n\nStaff writer Sherlon Christie contributed to this report.
