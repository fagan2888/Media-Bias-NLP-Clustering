Malika Haqq, 31, took to Instagram on Friday to share a deep message about acceptance and the inability to change people's actions and fans were quick to assume that the reference is in regards to rumors that the BFF of Khloé Kardashian was caught texting her then-boyfriend French Montana.



Hollywood Life reports that Haqq, who appears occasionally on Kardashian's family's hit series, "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," is accused of exchanging "inappropriate texts" with Kardashian's now ex-boyfriend Montana, 29. Although neither party has confirmed or denied the allegations, Haqq appears to be attempting to remain positive amid the allegations.







Hours after MediaTakeOut.com released a report regarding the cheating allegations, Haqq took to Instagram to post this message:

"We cannot change our past...We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one thing we have, and that is our attitude."

Despite a source confirming to the site that the flirty texts were the result of Montana and Kardashian's split, a new source reveals that it's unlikely that reality star would forego her longtime friendship with Haqq over a short-term dating relationship.

"Khloe has been down with Malika since forever. They have the kind of friendship that even if Malika was f------- Khloe's man, they'd still be friends," the insider admitted. "Besides, I don't think Khloe was into [French Montana] like that."
