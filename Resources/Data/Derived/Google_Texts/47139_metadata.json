He thought that the previous governor, Republican Bobby Jindal, was wrongly rejecting the federal funds to expand the program.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s move makes it the 31st state to expand eligibility for the program. The expanded eligibility is for incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or about $33,000 for a family of four.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s move comes as ObamaCare supporters are hoping that more states in the south will come around to Medicaid expansion. Alabama\u2019s Republican governor, Robert Bentley, for example, has said he is \u201clooking\u201d at the possibility.\n\nPresident Obama will be touting Louisiana\u2019s move on Medicaid expansion, which the White House says will provide coverage to 193,000 uninsured people, when he visits the state on Thursday as part of his post-State of the Union travel.\n\n\"We want to bring our federal tax dollars back home to help us ensure healthier outcomes for our people,\u201d Edwards said on Tuesday. He has set a goal of July 1 for the expansion to kick in.\n\nExpansion supporters argue that states are missing out on federal dollars by rejecting expansion.\n\nOpponents often cite cost, noting that states eventually will have to pick up 10 percent of expenses, as well as ideological objections to expanding government-run healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Louisiana becomes the 31st state to expand the program.", "description": "Louisiana becomes the 31st state to expand the program.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Louisiana becomes the 31st state to expand the program.", "title": "Louisiana expands Medicaid under Dem governor", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/265592-louisiana-governor-signs-order-for-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/batonrougecapitol01122016getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/265592-louisiana-governor-signs-order-for-medicaid-expansion", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-12T15:28-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-12T15:28:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/265592-louisiana-governor-signs-order-for-medicaid-expansion", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Louisiana becomes the 31st state to expand the program.", "card": "summary", "title": "Louisiana expands Medicaid under Dem governor"}, "dcterms.title": "Louisiana expands Medicaid under Dem governor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd166\"", "article_summary": "Louisiana\u2019s new Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, on Tuesday signed an executive order to expand Medicaid in the state under ObamaCare.\nAlabama\u2019s Republican governor, Robert Bentley, for example, has said he is \u201clooking\u201d at the possibility.\nHe thought that the previous governor, Republican Bobby Jindal, was wrongly rejecting the federal funds to expand the program.\nLouisiana\u2019s move comes as ObamaCare supporters are hoping that more states in the south will come around to Medicaid expansion.\nExpansion supporters argue that states are missing out on federal dollars by rejecting expansion."}
