The company also has a special unit that provides consulting services to Medicaid providers.\n\nIndiana-based industry publication Inside Public Accounting ranked BerryDunn No. 3 on its 2014 list of the fastest-growing U.S. accounting firms, with year-over-year revenue growth of 17 percent.\n\nUnlike some other firms, BerryDunn\u2019s growth has been entirely from within, Bascomb said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done it by acquiring firms,\u201d she said.\n\nBerryDunn has 252 employees, most of them in Maine, New Hampshire and West Virginia, Bascomb said. Revenue for its 2014 fiscal year, which ended June 30, was $51.7 million, she said.\n\nThree factors have led to BerryDunn\u2019s recent growth, Bascomb said.\n\nThe company has a high rate of client retention, and the clients themselves have grown, she said. Those factors, in addition to BerryDunn\u2019s fast-growing tax planning and government consulting business, contributed greatly to the revenue boost.\n\nOne high-profile government consulting job the company worked on was an analysis of the state of Maryland\u2019s health care exchange under the Affordable Care Act before it launched in fall 2013.\n\nBerryDunn\u2019s consultants warned of problems with the Maryland Health Connections website. State officials ignored the warnings, and the website later turned out to be so deeply flawed that it had to be scrapped and rebuilt. Just this week, an investigation was launched into allegations of fraud in connection with the site\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cOne of the key things with our consultants is they are objective, and they are going to tell you if something doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Bascomb said.\n\nOther areas of growth include business valuation, which involves determining the total monetary worth of a business; and succession planning, the process of preparing a company for a change in its top management.\n\nThe qualities that make a good accountant are attention to detail and, contrary to the stereotype, the personality to communicate well with others, Bascomb said.\n\n\u201cThey have to be good at working with people,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company has beefed up its management staff with a series of promotions over the past year. A total of 25 employees at its offices in Portland, Bangor, Boston and Manchester, New Hampshire, have received promotions.\n\nIt has not been difficult to find qualified job candidates in New England, Bascomb said. The accounting industry has recovered from a dark period, following the 2002 downfall of Enron accounting firm Arthur Andersen, in which fewer college students sought to enter the profession.\n\nNow, many students are becoming certified public accountants, and BerryDunn has established relationships with colleges and universities in the region to connect with recent graduates, Bascomb said.\n\n\u201cQualified candidates for what we do are definitely here,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With its fiscal 2014 revenue at $51.7 million, the 40-year-old Portland company has hired 24 new employees.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "With its fiscal 2014 revenue at $51.7 million, the 40-year-old Portland company has hired 24 new employees.", "title": "Accounting firm BerryDunn in a major expansion - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2014-08-26T20:52:18-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/08/27/accounting-firm-berrydunn-in-a-major-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With its fiscal 2014 revenue at $51.7 million, the 40-year-old Portland company has hired 24 new employees.", "title": "Accounting firm BerryDunn in a major expansion - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-08-27T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-26T20:52:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e5f\"", "article_summary": "3 on its 2014 list of the fastest-growing U.S. accounting firms, with year-over-year revenue growth of 17 percent.\n\u201cOne of the key things with our consultants is they are objective, and they are going to tell you if something doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Bascomb said.\nUnlike some other firms, BerryDunn\u2019s growth has been entirely from within, Bascomb said.\nThree factors have led to BerryDunn\u2019s recent growth, Bascomb said.\nThe 40-year-old company has hired 24 new employees in the past year, a growth spurt of about 10 percent, said Cheryl Bascomb, BerryDunn\u2019s marketing director."}
