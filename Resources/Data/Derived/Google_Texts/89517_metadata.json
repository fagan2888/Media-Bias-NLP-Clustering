The email was then forwarded to the CMS communications director with the following message: \u201cPlease delete this email-but please see if we can work on call script.\u201d\n\nAccording to veteran journalist Sharyl Attiksson, this revelation is \u201csignificant\u201d for a number of reasons:\n\nFirst, the email to be deleted included an exchange between key White House officials and CMS officials. Second, the email was dated October 5, 2013, five days into the disastrous launch of HealthCare.gov. Third, federal law requires federal officials to retain copies of \u2013not delete\u2013 email exchanges. And fourth, the document to be deleted is covered under Congressional subpoena as well as longstanding Freedom of Information requests made by members of the media (including me).\n\nMembers of Congress are now requesting answers from Tavenner, including why she instructed a subordinate, CMS Director of Communications Julie Bataille, to delete the email exchange rather than telling her to retain it as she claimed was the official policy.\n\nAs Attkisson notes, those copied on the email exchange included Jeanne Lambrew, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, White House health care advisor Christopher Jennings, as well as other HHS and CMS officials.\n\nIn the 2013 email exchange, Tavenner reportedly explained how CMS staff were dealing with the high volume of Obamacare applications as Healthcare.gov failed. She noted officials were accepting PDF files that \u201clook and act like a paper application\u201d while also trying to accept some information online. Eventually, another official asked for more details on the process.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently informed Congress that they would not be able to produce some of Tavenner\u2019s emails requested under a subpoena as they were deleted. Lawmakers, who are investigating the \u201cprocesses and procedures\u201d that led to the disastrous rollout of Healthcare.gov, were told \u201cmost but not all\u201d of the emails would likely be provided.\n\nTavenner blamed the email loss on the \u201cextremely high volume of emails\u201d that she receives on a daily basis.\n\nThe Friday letter from lawmakers asks Tavenner if any other emails were purposefully deleted and how CMS intends on attempting to recover them. Lawmakers also requested an explanation regarding several redactions made in some documents already provided to Congress.\n\n\u201c[N]ow we know that when HealthCare.gov was crashing, those in charge were hitting the delete button behind the scenes,\u201d Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nDespite the \u201cdelete\u201d request, CMS spokesman Aaron Albright told FoxNews.com that the email exchange was saved anyway.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 4, "twitter": {"description": "Congressional investigators are demanding answers from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner after she reportedly instructed a subordinate to \u201cdelete\u201d an Obamacare-related email conversation involving key White House officials.
