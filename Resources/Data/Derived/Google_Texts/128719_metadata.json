A rare but sometimes deadly aftershock of near-drownings are so-called secondary drownings as the body tries to expel water from the lungs. Most episodes of secondary drownings occur seven or so hours after mishaps in the water but may happen as soon as two hours afterward \u2014 with the danger passing in 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\u201cThey may be completely fine,\u201d Louis Profeta, an emergency room physician at St. Vincent Health in Indianapolis told Fox 5. \u201cThe lungs start to fill up with water. It\u2019s not necessarily the water they\u2019ve inhaled, but it\u2019s a biological, physiological response to near-drowning.\u201d That response occurs as the larynx in the throat relaxes to allow water into the lungs, with sudden mood swings also a symptom of trouble.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve had a child that\u2019s had a near-drowning episode, I would certainly hope that you\u2019d bring them into the emergency department,\u201d Profeta said. \u201cBut if they look fine and you\u2019re at home and all of a sudden the child takes a turn for the worse, starts coughing a lot, complaining of having trouble breathing, you need to bring them immediately to the emergency department.\u201d\n\nHaving seen many such cases for years, Profeta says children may appear listless and sick, as if suffering from an asthma attack or other respiratory illness \u2014 and suggested that parents \u201ctrust their gut.\u201d Symptoms progressed quickly for 10-year-old Johnny Jackson of Goose Creek, S.C., six years ago when his mother Cassandra sent him to bed, fatigued from a day of swimming.\n\n\u201cMy friend went back into the room where Johnny was sleeping and noticed what appeared to be cotton balls stuffed in his nose,\u201d Jackson told ABC News, referring to her son\u2019s foaming of the mouth. \u201cShe asked if I put them there and I said no \u2014 I went in and saw him and screamed for help. I rolled him over and his body was very limp and I realized he'd soiled himself again and was very purplish-blue looking,\u201d\n\nJohnny\u2019s tongue had been swollen too, she added. While no government keeps statistics on such secondary drownings, experts generally recognize that small amounts of water inhaled into the lungs may pose a later threat as fluid accumulates hours after the exposure, with death a possibility.\n\nAmong all drownings in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children between the ages of 1 and 14 account for some 20 percent of victims. More than half of drowning victims who received emergency room care required further hospitalization, with some experiencing brain injuries debilitating to varying degrees. According to the data, 80 percent of drowning victims are men and boys, with African-American boys three times as likely to drown as their white counterparts.\n\nMore than 3,500 Americans drown every year, or about 10 per day.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "secondary drowning, secondary drownings, pediatric drownings, children drownings, children and drowning risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hours after a near-drowning mishap, children may experience coughing and trouble breathing after pulling water into the lungs; parents are advised to take children to the emergency room when such symptoms present.", "title": "Kids Who Nearly Drown Once Are At Greater Risk Hours Later", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/children-risk-secondary-drowning-even-hours-after-first-incident-shown-coughs-trouble-breathing", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/secondary-drownings-occur-hours-after-water-mishaps.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hours after a near-drowning mishap, children may experience coughing and trouble breathing after pulling water into the lungs; parents are advised to take children to the emergency room when such symptoms present.", "title": "Kids Who Nearly Drown Once Are At Greater Risk Hours Later", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/children-risk-secondary-drowning-even-hours-after-first-incident-shown-coughs-trouble-breathing", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/secondary-drownings-occur-hours-after-water-mishaps.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/secondary-drownings-occur-hours-after-water-mishaps.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-06T13:56:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T13:56:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hours after a near-drowning mishap, children may experience coughing and trouble breathing after pulling water into the lungs; parents are advised to take children to the emergency room when such symptoms present."}, "article_summary": "A child who\u2019s coughing and having trouble breathing hours after nearly drowning should be taken to the emergency room, doctors say.\nChildren who experience cough and trouble breathing should be taken to the emergency room for treatment for \"secondary drowning,\" which occurs hours after near-drowning mishaps when water enters the lungs.\n\u201cThey may be completely fine,\u201d Louis Profeta, an emergency room physician at St. Vincent Health in Indianapolis told Fox 5.\nMore than half of drowning victims who received emergency room care required further hospitalization, with some experiencing brain injuries debilitating to varying degrees.\nAccording to the data, 80 percent of drowning victims are men and boys, with African-American boys three times as likely to drown as their white counterparts."}
