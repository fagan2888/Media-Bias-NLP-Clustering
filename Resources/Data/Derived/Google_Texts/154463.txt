A Wichita mother was arrested Saturday evening after leaving her two young children alone while she ran an errand.

Officers were called around 6 p.m. to Inwood Crossing Apartments near K-96 and Rock Road.

Sgt. Jeff Swanson said the 24-year-old mother left her 3-year-old and 3-month-old children in the apartment while she left to run an errand.

The 3-year-old then called is aunt, because he was scared, Swanson said. She picked up the two children.

When the mother got home and realized her kids were not there, she called police.

Officers arrived and later arrested the mother for aggravated child endangerment. The kids were released to family members.
