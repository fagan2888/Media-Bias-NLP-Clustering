Law enforcement is frantically trying to respond to the drugs proliferation in their communities. Much-needed treatment can be difficult to come by.\n\nAddiction cuts across all cultural, racial, economic and gender lines and can have a profound impact on not only the user, but the people around him or her.\n\nAs part of a project planned for this fall by The Star-Ledger and NJ.com, we want to know how heroin or opiate addiction has affected you \u2013 whether you\u2019re a current or former user, a friend or family member whose life has been impacted by heroin or prescription opiate abuse.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to collect stories of despair and struggle, hope and redemption.\n\nIf you are a current or former New Jersey resident and would like to share your story, please fill out the brief survey below. Readers who submit their stories are only asked to share their first name and those submitted will not be published until the project\u2019s completion, which is anticipated in the coming months.\n\nIf you would be willing to talk further with a reporter, we have left users the option to submit their contact information. This is entirely optional and will never be published.\n\nThrough your stories, we hope to show the broad and deep impacts of the heroin and opiate crisis in New Jersey, from Sussex County to Cape May, Trenton to Toms River. We hope you\u2019ll help us.\n\nAnyone with questions or concerns can contact Stephen Stirling at sstirling@starledger.com or Ashley Peskoe at apeskoe@nj.com.
