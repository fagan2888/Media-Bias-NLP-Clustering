Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., one of the sponsors of the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s time to allow Americans to travel freely to Cuba.\u201d\n\nProud to be part of emerging coalition of #GOP senators seeking to expand #trade & travel between US & #Cuba http://t.co/acBEzZHtqt \u2014 Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) January 29, 2015\n\nEarlier this month, the White House acted on its own to loosen decades-old restrictions on travel, trade, investment and remittances.\n\n>>>What You Need to Know About Obama\u2019s New Cuba Policy\n\nThe eased restrictions for travel from the U.S. to Cuba apply to 12 categories of people, including Americans with family in Cuba, employees on official business for the U.S. and foreign governments, and journalists.\n\nGeneral tourist travel is still prohibited.\n\nThe new legislation would repeal all restrictions on U.S. citizens\u2019 travel to Cuba. It would also relax restrictions on related banking transactions.\n\nThough the bill has Republican support, it\u2019s questionable if the bill will ultimately be voted on in the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been critical of the administration\u2019s Cuba policy, as has Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American leading the opposition effort.\n\nCritics of Obama\u2019s new Cuba policy say it empowers the Castro regime.\n\nAlso today, Sens. Flake and Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote a letter backed by seven GOP senators to President Obama encouraging the \u201cmodernization\u201d of relations with Cuba \u2014 and that Congress plays a role in doing so.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that changes to the current trade and travel relationship will advance our goal of bolstering the vulnerable private sector and increasing entrepreneurship while decreasing the role of state-controlled enterprises,\u201d wrote the Republican senators.\n\n\u201cWith the significance of your recent announcements related to Cuba, we look forward to Congress turning its attention toward modernizing U.S.-Cuba policy to the benefit of U.S. citizens and the Cuban people alike. Congress must play an integral role in reforming our policy toward Cuba.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation today that would end the travel ban between the U.S. and Cuba.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation today that would end the travel ban between the U.S. and Cuba.", "title": "Some Republicans Want to \u2018Modernize\u2019 US-Cuba Relationship", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal397308.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tAjGfE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation today that would end the travel ban between the U.S. and Cuba.", "title": "Some Republicans Want to \u2018Modernize\u2019 US-Cuba Relationship", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal397308.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "cuba,International", "published_time": "2015-01-29T17:37:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Cuba, embargo, travel, Jeff Flake, Castro, Obama, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacea\"", "article_summary": "Critics of Obama\u2019s new Cuba policy say it empowers the Castro regime.\nThe bill has an equal number of Democratic and Republican co-sponsors, showing how the Cuba issue defies normal party lines.\nThough the bill has Republican support, it\u2019s questionable if the bill will ultimately be voted on in the Senate.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been critical of the administration\u2019s Cuba policy, as has Republican Sen.
