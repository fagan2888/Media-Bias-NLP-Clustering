But there\u2019s no need to stop there.\n\nWith 78,000 abandoned buildings and a Banksy tag potentially worth $1 million or more, graffiti could help save the day.\n\nMotor City needs to raise funds where it can, as well as slashing its obligations, if it\u2019s to emerge sustainably from bankruptcy. It\u2019s a controversial idea to sell civic art to fix a financial problem, but it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out \u2013 especially when fewer than 3,000 of the items in the 66,000-strong Detroit Institute of Art collection are at issue, at least in the auction house\u2019s initial appraisal.\n\nRelated: Government Pensions Under Fire Again\n\nThe top end of the Christie\u2019s estimate amounts to nearly 10 percent of the city\u2019s $11.5 billion of unsecured obligations, as defined by Kevyn Orr, the city\u2019s emergency manager. That\u2019s enough to make a difference, whether to the city\u2019s pensioners or to other creditors.\n\nYet Detroit could try additional creative fundraising ideas.\n\nTake the recent surge in contemporary art prices, which has carried along graffiti maestro Banksy. A mural entitled \u201cSlave Labour\u201d that was removed from a location in London\u2019s Wood Green sold for more than 750,000 pounds ($1.1 million) in June, according to news reports.\n\nRelated: 15 of the Most Expensive Auction Items Ever Sold\n\nIf Banksy could be persuaded to daub just 1 percent of Detroit\u2019s empty buildings with scenes worth that much, the total value would match the museum art assessed by Christie\u2019s \u2013 and buyers might even pay to dismantle empty buildings so that they could take their purchases away.\n\nOf course that assumes way too much activity for one elusive graffiti artist \u2013 even if he fancied a sojourn in Detroit, which has become a magnet for creative types in recent years. Anyway, the supply glut would surely hit prices. But once Orr opens the door to art sales, he can think bigger.\n\nWith contemporary art wildly popular among the finance set, the well-heeled bosses of the hedge funds which now surely own some of the city\u2019s bonds might even appreciate the chance to bid on a Motown Banksy.\n\nThe authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists.
