You still see it. Just not as much.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a horrible turn,\u201d Bibbs said at the Broncos\u2019 rookie minicamp. \u201cI\u2019m used to running backs controlling the game. If you can hand off the ball and get those sure yards, you can dictate the game. You put the ball in the air and anything can happen. I always thought running the ball was a great thing. I guess somewhere along the line, people disagree with that.\u201d\n\nWhen Bibbs left Colorado State after playing only one season with the Rams, the plan was to get selected in the fifth, sixth or seventh round during the May 8-10 draft.\n\nBut when no running back was selected in the first round, and the first rusher didn\u2019t come off the board until two-thirds through the second round, that pushed all of the others back in the draft.\n\nAnd for Bibbs, getting pushed back from the end of the draft meant falling off to the pool of undrafted free agents.\n\nWith the Broncos, Bibbs is a longshot to make the 53-man NFL roster. He only got a $2,000 signing bonus, second-lowest among the team\u2019s undrafted free agents.\n\nThen again an undrafted defensive back named Chris Harris only got a $2,000 bonus in 2011. And Bibbs may have signed with the right team. Here are the combined NFL starts of Denver\u2019s running backs: zero.\n\nIf Montee Ball starts the season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, it will be his first. Ronnie Hillman has played two seasons with zero starts. C.J. Anderson got some mop-up carries in the Super Bowl but little other experience as a rookie last season.\n\nTo twist a favorite idiom of coach John Fox, Denver running backs don\u2019t have skins on the wall.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re leaning pretty heavy on Montee,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAnd rightfully so. We\u2019ve got guys who played in games last year, C.J. and Ronnie Hillman. We have some young guys here and we\u2019ll see what they can do.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos probably will start the season with four running backs, even if one is stashed on the practice squad. Don\u2019t be surprised if the Broncos sign a veteran after June 1, when free agents no longer count in the compensatory draft-pick formula. Michael Bush, Ronnie Brown, Felix Jones and Bernard Scott are among the running backs still on the streets.\n\n\u201cBy no means is our roster set in stone,\u201d Fox said.\n\nUntil then, the Broncos will take a look at their three undrafted rookie tailbacks: Bibbs, Brennan Clay and Juwan Thompson.\n\nThe Broncos like Bibbs for a couple of reasons. One, they know he has the type of pure running skills that translate to the NFL. He not only rushed for 1,741 yards and averaged 6.2 per carry last season, his 31 touchdowns that led the nation proved he knows how to negotiate through goal-line scrums.\n\nTwo, he comes from a pro-style offense at CSU and coach Jim McElwain, who is respected in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI know I have the talent to play at the top level,\u201d Bibbs said. \u201cI know there are guys at the top and I\u2019m a guy who is trying to fight the guys at the top.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kapri Bibbs trying to stick with Denver Broncos as undrafted rookie RB", "title": "Kapri Bibbs trying to stick with Denver Broncos as undrafted rookie RB", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/17/kapri-bibbs-trying-to-stick-with-denver-broncos-as-undrafted-rookie-rb/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__20140518_CC3_SP18FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__20140518_CC3_SP18FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T19:44:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:06:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Before the Broncos determine whether to save Kapri Bibbs a roster spot, the undrafted running back must first save his position.\nTo twist a favorite idiom of coach John Fox, Denver running backs don\u2019t have skins on the wall.\nMichael Bush, Ronnie Brown, Felix Jones and Bernard Scott are among the running backs still on the streets.\nUntil then, the Broncos will take a look at their three undrafted rookie tailbacks: Bibbs, Brennan Clay and Juwan Thompson.\nWith the Broncos, Bibbs is a longshot to make the 53-man NFL roster."}
