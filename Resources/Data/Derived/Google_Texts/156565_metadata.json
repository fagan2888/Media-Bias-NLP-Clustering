The process requires significant outreach efforts, education and input based on strong evidence about potential impacts. Public health professionals are able to mobilize important partner networks around issues of concern and facilitate planning and decision making. Further, public health strategic plans can delineate the critical next steps that are needed in order to have the biggest impact on livable communities.\n\nFEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Federal Government\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) leads public health efforts at the national level. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is the department\u2019s prevention agency, provides resources to states, communities and territories through financial grants, contracts and cooperative agreements aimed at capacity building and core public health functions.\n\nThe CDC funds an array of efforts to create healthier communities across the U.S. by working with community-based organizations and centers, schools, health care settings, work sites, transportation specialists, architects and planners, among others. Currently funded efforts you may encounter include:\n\nStates and Territories Cooperative Agreements\n\nThe CDC supports states and territorial health departments through five-year cooperative agreements that allow the departments to provide communities with technical assistance, training and consultation to develop and implement policy, systems and environmental change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC supports states and territorial health departments through five-year cooperative agreements that allow the departments to provide communities with technical assistance, training and consultation to develop and implement policy, systems and environmental change. YMCA Pioneering Healthier Communities\n\nSince 2005, the CDC has given funding and provided technical assistance to the YMCA to bring together local leaders to build coalitions and plans for improving community health. By 2013, 150 local communities were supported.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2005, the CDC has given funding and provided technical assistance to the YMCA to bring together local leaders to build coalitions and plans for improving community health. By 2013, 150 local communities were supported. Partnerships to Improve Community Health (PICH)\n\nPICH provides funding to a variety of governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations \u2014 including school districts, local housing and transportation authorities, public health offices, American Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages \u2014 to work through multi-sectorial community coalitions. The goal is to reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and obesity) by using population-based strategies that have both a broad reach and moderate-to-large effects on risk factors including tobacco use and exposure, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and a lack of access to chronic disease prevention, risk reduction and management opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPICH provides funding to a variety of governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations \u2014 including school districts, local housing and transportation authorities, public health offices, American Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages \u2014 to work through multi-sectorial community coalitions.

Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) The program supports the implementation, evaluation and dissemination of strategies, including the effective implementation of existing policy, systems and environmental improvements. Funded projects focus on implementing locally tailored evidence- and practice-based population-wide improvements in priority populations that are experiencing chronic disease disparities and associated risk factors including tobacco use and exposure, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and a lack of access to chronic disease prevention, risk reduction and management opportunities.\n\nState Governments\n\nPublic health departments operating at the state level have authority over state-based public health issues and perform a number of functions, one of which is to deliver chronic disease prevention and control programs. (Livable communities work often resides in several program efforts.) State health departments are typically funded by the federal government, appropriations from a state\u2019s legislature and, less significantly, from private sources including foundations.\n\nLocal Government\n\nLocal health departments (LHD) are the frontline service practitioners of public health initiatives. As the place where state and local health policies and programs come together, LHDs are valuable livable community stakeholders. The local coalitions they work with or lead can be important allies in making livable community advancements.\n\nNext page: Connecting with the public health network in your state. \u00bb\n\n", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:Livable Communities", "Division1": "Division:Livable Communities", "page_title": "How to Work With Public Health to Advance Livable Communities", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2014-12-30T11:22:56.686-05:00", "keywords": "public health, older adults, aging, retirement, healthy places, livability", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/tool-kits-resources/info-2014/public-health-livable-communities.html", "author": "Jennifer Wallace-Brodeur", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.V6HLPNL96MSFqwBKhkRboeXr3key6dQ00kk1-RY1f1g\",\"checksum\":\"3fb857bd676324a12000b81ca5971516\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/tool-kits-resources/info-2014/public-health-livable-communities.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "source": "livable_communities", "type": "info", "description": "The strong connection between health and livability benefits efforts on behalf of both.", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Health", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "The strong connection between health and livability benefits efforts on behalf of both.", "title": "The Public Health and Livable Communities Connection - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/tool-kits-resources/info-2014/public-health-livable-communities.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/livable-communities/images-2014/200-stretching-livable-communities-public-health.imgcache.rev1406124635700.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/livable-communities/tool-kits-resources/info-2014/public-health-livable-communities", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "IALevel1": "livable-communities", "IALevel2": "tool-kits-resources", "s43": "11.HealthCareservices|MyHealth", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "article_summary": "FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe Federal GovernmentThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) leads public health efforts at the national level.\nPublic health professionals are able to mobilize important partner networks around issues of concern and facilitate planning and decision making.\nLocal GovernmentLocal health departments (LHD) are the frontline service practitioners of public health initiatives.\nFurther, public health strategic plans can delineate the critical next steps that are needed in order to have the biggest impact on livable communities.\nPublic health professionals often track these issues over time and can help articulate the need for action substantiated by data demonstrating connections to health concerns, contributors to risk factors, and community health hazards."}
