The struggling hospital in Marshalltown is seeking partnership options.

Central Iowa Healthcare officials announced Thursday that they've hired a consulting firm, Juniper Advisory, to "explore various partnership options" that could include joining a large system or even a sale.

Public reports show the system lost $3.8 million in 2013 and $1.8 million in 2014. Hospital President John Hughes says the 2015 report also will show a loss.

The system's board chairwoman, Carol Hibbs, says a new electronic medical records system and Affordable Care Act billing codes have hampered billing and slowed reimbursements.

The system operates the 49-bed Marshalltown as well as clinics in Marshalltown, Conrad, State Center and Toledo.
