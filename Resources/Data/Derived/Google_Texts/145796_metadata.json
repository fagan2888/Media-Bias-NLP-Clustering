But the cities took drastically different approaches to try to win the Republican National Convention: Dallas went straight for hearts, and Denver tried to appeal to minds. Put another way: Dallas put on a showstopping performance, and Denver hosted a business meeting, albeit with a few flourishes (including an appearance by the Denver Broncos\u2019 mascot horse Thunder).\n\nI wouldn\u2019t discount either approach: Denver is seen by many as a favorite alongside Dallas, and its bid leaders have a chance of winning the convention for Denver if they can shore up fundraising, the biggest weakness of the bid . Friday morning, before I left Dallas to return to Denver, I attended a closing news conference with that city\u2019s bid leaders, including former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Though the RNC will make the official host announcement during its August meetings in Chicago , they said the Site Selection Committee could vote on a single choice as soon as June 30, leading to negotiations with that city in July. Cleveland and Kansas City, Mo., also are in play.\n\nIf nothing else, Dallas is known for its confidence and for doing everything big. It didn\u2019t disappoint during the RNC delegation\u2019s 48-hour visit, from Wednesday afternoon to Friday morning. Below is a video showing portions of the show Dallas put on inside its arena, the American Airlines Center.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise rundown \u2014 in seven paragraphs \u2014 from the Dallas Morning News\u2019 Tom Benning in Friday\u2019s newspaper (the story is well worth a read in full):\n\nThere was breakfast at Savor at Klyde Warren Park and lunch at Cloud Nine, where desserts were shaped like Reunion Tower. Oil baron Ray Hunt hosted a reception at the Hunt Oil Building, and real estate magnate Harlan Crow hosted one at his home. Both are big Republican donors. Two live elephants \u2014 Suse and Esa, from Oklahoma \u2014 welcomed the GOP convention scouts to the AAC on Thursday morning. As did a crowd of cheering volunteers. As did cheerleaders for the Dallas Mavericks and Dallas Stars. As did the Kilgore College Rangerettes. As did Dallas\u2019 Salvation Army band. Linda Gray, who plays Sue Ellen Ewing on Dallas old and new, surprised the entourage at a luncheon. And Jerry Jones arranged for the Cowboys\u2019 team buses to take the group to AT&T Stadium, which is still being considered for opening or closing ceremonies. State signs with the party\u2019s elephant mascot stood in the AAC\u2019s lower bowl, matching the home states of the top officials in attendance. Videos played of Reagan\u2019s acceptance speech from the Dallas convention. And live vocalists performed a rousing song about Dallas. Then came the balloons. Then came the confetti. Then came the fireworks.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the RNC visitors ended the Dallas trip impressed beyond belief, or simply exhausted by Dallas\u2019 efforts. Regardless, you can\u2019t say Dallas, which joined the RNC\u2019s bid competition late in the game, didn\u2019t give its all. Benning reports that when site committee chairwoman Enid Mickelsen was asked later to name Dallas\u2019 top attribute, she said: \u201cSetting aside the enthusiasm?
