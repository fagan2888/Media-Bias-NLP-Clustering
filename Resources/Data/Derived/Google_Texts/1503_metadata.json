And he\u2019s far from the only Texas lawyer who feels that way. Another local attorney called the new system \u201ca disaster,\u201d comparing it to the botched Obamacare rollout. A third attorney said e-filing in Tarrant County so far has been a nightmare.\n\n\u201cWe had to file a response to a motion, and [the system] kicked it back,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe judge was understanding and didn\u2019t disallow our response or dismiss our case, but he could have.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had several issues with it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur office has had four or five in the last 30 days.\u201d\n\nBefore this year, attorneys, paralegals, and other filers could walk down to the district and county clerks\u2019 offices and file documents pertaining to a case. An optional electronic filing system existed, but not every county offered that option.\n\nBut on Jan. 1, a Texas Supreme Court mandate went into effect requiring all civil and family court cases to be filed electronically in the state\u2019s 10 most populous counties, including Tarrant, Dallas, Collin, Denton, Bexar, Harris, and El Paso. All case filings with the Texas Supreme Court, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and 14 appellate courts must also be done electronically. By 2016 all 254 Texas counties must have e-filing in place for civil and family cases. Pro se litigants \u2014 people representing themselves \u2014 are not required to file electronically.\n\nIn the new system, documents must be scanned and sent to one of eight private providers, which then sends them to the district or county clerk in the county where the action was filed. There is one free provider on the list, as well as some less expensive options. Many of the more expensive providers offer additional services that make the filing process much easier, such as such as monthly invoicing, sending documents to opposing attorneys, and converting documents into searchable PDF files, which is required by law. (Anyone can convert a document into an easily searchable PDF, but it takes time and the proper software.)\n\nPreviously, filers hand-delivered, faxed, or e-mailed documents directly to the clerk\u2019s office.\n\nIn just its third week, the new system is getting a lot of negative reviews from the Fort Worth legal community. One lawyer called it \u201cglitchy\u201d but also noted that other counties aren\u2019t having as difficult a time with the transition as Tarrant. All of the other top counties already had optional e-filing systems.\n\nStatewide, attorneys are worried about the system\u2019s cost, privacy, and the fact that it creates a new middleman in the legal process by requiring filers to use a third-party provider.\n\nThe increase in volume of documents filed online has been staggering. David Slayton, director of the Texas Office of Court Administration, the office responsible for putting the system in place, said that, previously, no more than 2,500 documents were filed online on a given day.\n\n\u201cYesterday there were almost 12,000 documents filed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve received more than 59,000 documents since Jan 1. That\u2019s already more than the total volume we\u2019d averaged in a month.\n\n\u201cObviously lawyers are having success in filing documents across the state.\u201d\n\nThe first e-filing system in Texas was put into place in Jefferson County in the late \u201990s, when a major asbestos lawsuit overwhelmed a court\u2019s regular filing system. A local judge implemented the online system to better handle the volume. The push for a statewide online filing system has been gaining momentum ever since.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court had been hearing from attorneys and judges and others all across the state that e-filing needed to be mandatory and it needed to be through a single system statewide,\u201d Slayton said. \u201cSo in December of 2011, the court held a public hearing, and there was fairly unanimous support.\u201d\n\nCritics of the system say it creates a new cottage industry of middlemen who offer different bells and whistles along with basic filing services. They say the new system, designed to be more efficient and less costly, could end up being more expensive, because of the varying costs of the third-party services.\n\nCoby Wooten, a Fort Worth attorney and president of the Tarrant County Trial Lawyers Association, noted that some of the third-party providers charge by the page for filing documents.\n\n\u201cEvery bit of the cost has to be passed on to the client,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I file a document that has a 300-page attachment, you\u2019re looking at something that could cost you $3,000.\u201d\n\nSlayton said the feedback he\u2019s been getting has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\u201cWhen an issue is identified, we have to figure out [whether] the issue is at the state level, the filer, or the clerk\u2019s office,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time we receive word of any issue, we have to attempt to resolve it.\u201d\n\nWooten and others also worry about whether the system is adequately protected, noting that sensitive information is being passed to a third party over the internet.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want you putting Social Security numbers or driver\u2019s license numbers on documents, but what if you have to file medical records with the courts?\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019re passing stuff through the internet. It could be hacked and stolen.\u201d\n\nSlayton said that the system meets national encryption standards and that the Texas Supreme Court enacted rules requiring attorneys to redact some personal identifying information before documents are filed.\n\n\u201cThat information just resides on the e-filing system for the period of time between the filer hitting \u2018submit\u2019 and the clerk accepting the document,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a public-access system.\u201d\n\nCelestina Contreras, a professor at Texas A&M University School of Law \u2014 formerly the Texas Wesleyan Law School \u2014 said she has been getting as many as 20 e-mails a day from other attorneys who are confused about the new filing system. She also serves as staff attorney at the school\u2019s law clinic, which gives legal advice to disadvantaged people.\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re filing everything through e-filing, there\u2019s a [costly] program that will redact [sensitive] information for you,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to have to submit it as an exhibit and redact it yourself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be changing the document,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is scratching their head asking, \u2018Do we submit this as a changed document? Do we request that it only be read in chamber?\u2019 There are so many questions out there.\u201d\n\nAt a training session in September at the A&M law school, Tarrant District Clerk Thomas Wilder couldn\u2019t answer a lot of the questions about the system, Contreras said. A second training session scheduled for December was canceled due to the winter storm.\n\n\u201cWe did not get to go through that second training session when all of these answers were going to be forthcoming,\u201d she said.\n\nWooten was critical of Wilder\u2019s office, noting that in Dallas County, where the optional form of e-filing already existed, District Clerk Gary Fitzsimmons sent an e-mail to the various legal associations in that county preparing them for the change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any help from the [Tarrant County] district clerk\u2019s office at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt definitely snuck up on my office. I\u2019d be willing to bet that most lawyers didn\u2019t know it was coming until December.\u201d\n\nHe said his organization was never contacted about the change.\n\n\u201cThey probably could have reached out to the various bar associations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may still. I haven\u2019t heard about anyone contacting our association leading up to Jan. 1 saying \u2018This is what we need to be doing.\u2019\n\n\u201cSome of these other counties that have had e-filing for a while \u2014 it\u2019s a no-brainer for them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never had to do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Fort Worth Weekly", "description": "Fort Worth attorney Jason Smith had been screaming at his computer for an hour, over complications in using the state\u2019s new electronic filing system, when a reporter called.
