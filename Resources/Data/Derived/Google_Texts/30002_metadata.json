Anarchy!\" Seattle police are now trying to move them off the balcony.\n\nEli Sanders\n\n\n\n5:07 PM: Mayor Ed Murray just released a statement on the Black Friday protests that reads, in its entirety:\n\nWhile I understand the hurt and frustration that our city has experienced in the past days, this is a city that respects the rule of law. I support the First Amendment rights of protestors, but violence against property or police officers will not be tolerated in our city.\n\n5:03 PM: Brendan Kiley was heading downtown to cover the protests down there, but he learned the police line is still in effect.

They do, but she and her friends leave the protest saying they don't want to be blamed for this, which will reflect badly on everyone.\"\n\nEli Sanders\n\nHere's the dumpster they were arguing over.\n\n4:16 PM: Eli says the game of cat and mouse between police and protesters continues at Boren. He says the protesters want to get back down to Westlake by 5 pm, but he hasn't heard why that's the deadline.\n\nEli Sanders\n\n\n\n4:10 PM: Meanwhile, back up at Broadway and Pike:\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\"If we don't get it, shut it down: justice for Mike Brown.\"\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\n4:06 PM: \"Before the current standoff,\" Eli writes, \"protesters ran en masse from Pike to Pine on Boren to try to get back downtown that way.\" They \"were blocked,\" he says.\n\nEli Sanders\n\n\n\n4:03 PM: \"Some sort of explosive smoke device being used now at Boren and Pine,\" Eli Sanders writes.\n\nEli Sanders\n\n\n\n3:53 PM: Here are protesters shutting down the Comet.\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\n3:52 PM: This is the scene at Boren and Pike right now:\n\nEli Sanders\n\n\n\nEli Sanders\n\n\n\n3:47 PM: Eli reports there's a standoff at Boren and Pike.

One protester said these businesses are being targeted because their owners have asked for increased police presence in the neighborhood and have specifically complained about black youth.\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\n\"When you have more police on the streets,\" the demonstrator said, \"you have more confrontations.\"\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\n3:20 PM: Brendan Kiley says there was a brief face-off between protesters and police at Broadway and Pine before the police retreated to their corner. Now, he says, the crowd is moving back down Pine toward downtown.\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\n3:17 PM:\n\nEli Sanders\n\nEarlier, when the protesters took over the top floor of Westlake Mall and all you could hear were chants, I noticed these two women chatting away at a table for two as if nothing was going on. \"We're from Bellingham,\" Maddie Newman, the woman on the left, told me. \"We came here to shop.\" When I said it was amazing that they were managing to continue their conversation, Joanna Newman, right, said: \"What else can you do?\" I asked what they thought about the message of the protest. \"I agree with it,\" Joanna Newman said. \"And everyone has a right to their opinion. I'm glad. It's the right thing to do\u2014get their point across.\"\n\n3:07 PM:\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\nMoment of silence with raised fists at Broadway and Pine.\n\nBrendan Kiley\n\n\n\n2:47 PM: Here's what SPD is saying about the single reported arrest from the protest:\n\nThe man we arrested kicked and damaged an officer's bicycle.

Bike cops ignored them.\"\n\n2:28 PM: With regard to that previous SPD tweet, Eli reports that the doors at Pacific Place are not locked at the moment. He just walked out with no problem.\n\n2:26 PM:\n\nEli Sanders\n\nShopper going up, protesters going down at Pacific Place.\n\n2:19 PM: SPD says on Twitter:\n\nSome protesters have evidently chained some of the @pacific_place doors shut.

Blocked cars are occasionally honking and there's an Occupy-style \"mic check\" going on in which protesters appear to be sharing a phone number for legal assistance in case of arrest.\n\nEli Sanders\n\nNow protesters are walking through traffic back down 5th toward Westlake. Lots more honking cars.\n\nEli Sanders\n\nAnd they're going into the mall.\n\n1:33 PM: Kelly O says the scene at Westlake Park right now is a sea of umbrellas.\n\nKelly O\n\nSee?
