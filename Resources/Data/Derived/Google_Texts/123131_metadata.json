CNN called the race with 48% of districts reporting, and Brat holding the lead with over 26,000 votes.\n\nThough Cantor outspent Brat by nearly 10-1, it became clear by the end of that night in June that dollars don\u2019t vote \u2013 people do.\n\nBrat was funded by Tea Party supporters, and his win marked the first time in more than a century that a candidate has triumphed over a majority leader \u2014 a victory made even more exceptional because Brat won with only $200,000.\n\nSince then all eyes have been on the Center of the Universe, as Ashland, Va. is known, where two professors squared off to fill the former House Majority Leader's spot. Brat ran against fellow Randolph Macon College professor Dr. Jack Trammell, the Democratic Party nominee who won his primary unanimously. Trammell was voted in mostly for show, because no Democrat wanted to run against the second most powerful Republican in the House.\n\nBoth men, thrust into the spotlight after Brat's win, attempted to dodge the newly interested media.\n\n\"I need a few days to decompress after that election,\" Brat told a CNN crew in June when he briefly emerged from his home to get a haircut.\n\nTrammell\u2019s online political presence was initially minimal, but he quickly launched a Facebook page, established a Twitter account, and built a campaign website. He said \u201chis life changed that night,\u201d and recounted the 644 emails on his iPhone that collected within an hour after the Associated Press announced his opponent beat Cantor.\n\nNow 21 weeks later, two debates later, and a combined total of $1,797, 767 raised, Brat has emerged the winner. Brat certainly out raised Trammell, as of Oct. 15, he collected $1,321,638 to Trammel\u2019s $476,129.\n\nIf Twitter accounts were any measure of the popular vote, as of 6 p.m. election night, @DaveBratVA7th had over 11,000 followers, while his opponent @Trammell4VA had 1,920. Brat was more active on Twitter though, with 12 times the amount of activity as his opponent.\n\nIf Facebook was an indicator, the race would have been a little tighter, with Trammell garnering over 18,000 likes and Brat a total of 16,381.\n\nThough polling often showed Brat ahead, Trammell always said that analysts weren\u2019t considering outside factors, such as the \u201cWarner effect.\u201d\n\nTrammell hoped his secret weapon would be a lift from the support Democratic Senator Mark Warner had in his election statewide.\n\nThe 7th Congressional District stretches from Richmond northwest to the Shenandoah. It is comprised of 11 counties total; eight counties in their entirety (Page, Rappahannock, Madison, Culpeper, Orange, Louisa, Hanover, Goochland), and parts of four counties (Spotsylvania, Caroline, Henrico, Chesterfield), along with the west end of Richmond.\n\nThe total population, according to a political website, is 643,499, and the median age for its residents is 37. The district is Caucasian by a majority, at 79.1%, with three-quarters of the housing occupied by owners.\n\nThe median income household is $50,990, but the per capita income is $25,861.\n\nRepublicans have represented the district for the past 43 years, though 101 of its 225 years in existence it had been represented by a Democrat.\n\nCantor has resided over these counties since 2001, and the last Democrat to represent the 7th District was John Marsh Jr., from 1963-1971.\n\nBrat framed his challenge against Cantor as another case of a grassroots conservative taking on the GOP establishment, a major theme in Republican contests this year. And Brat made immigration reform the central issue and said Cantor\u2019s position would hurt the economy.\n\n\u201cThe amnesty issue is the symbolic powerful expression about the difference between Eric and I on jobs,\u201d Brat said in June.\n\nBrat and Trammell could not be further from each other on the big issues. Brat wants to defund Obamacare, while Trammell merely wants to make some adjustments. Trammell wants to raise the minimum wage, Brat does not. As for each candidate\u2019s biggest issue, Trammell touts education reform while Brat wants changes to entitlement programs like Social Security.\n\nThe winner will be sworn in this week, and finish Cantor\u2019s vacated seat immediately. The next term begins in January.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All eyes have been on the Center of the Universe, as Ashland, Va. is known, where two professors squared off to fill former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's spot in the 7th District.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "All eyes have been on the Center of the Universe, as Ashland, Va. is known, where two professors squared off to fill former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s spot in the 7th District.", "title": "And the Virginia 7th Congressional District election race goes to\u2026", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2014/11/04/and-the-virginia-7th-congressional-district-election-race-goes-to/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/brat-trammell-debate.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/brat-trammell-debate.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2014-11-04T23:47:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T01:29:05+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "keywords": "virginia results, 7th district, 7th district results, virginia poll results, dave brat, jack trammell, trammell wins, brat wins, virginia election results", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Virginia results, 7th District, 7th District results, Virginia Poll Results, Dave Brat, Jack Trammell, Trammell wins, Brat wins, Virginia election results"}, "article_summary": "As for each candidate\u2019s biggest issue, Trammell touts education reform while Brat wants changes to entitlement programs like Social Security.\nBrat wants to defund Obamacare, while Trammell merely wants to make some adjustments.\nTrammell wants to raise the minimum wage, Brat does not.\nCNN called the race with 48% of districts reporting, and Brat holding the lead with over 26,000 votes.\nBrat ran against fellow Randolph Macon College professor Dr. Jack Trammell, the Democratic Party nominee who won his primary unanimously."}
