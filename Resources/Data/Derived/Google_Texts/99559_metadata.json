CEO Alicia Labrecque said the companies will be able to build space for 2,600 nursing home beds.\n\n\u201cRight now in our nursing home we\u2019re completely full and turning people away,\u201d Labrecque said. \u201cSo it will help us tremendously to be able to take more residents in, especially the longterm care residents.\u201d\n\nA total of $430 million in new nursing home construction was announced in the state Certificate of Need report, and spans from Pensacola to Miami. The largest project to win approval is a 180-bed nursing home in Orlando, while the most expensive is a $30 million facility in Miami.\n\nDespite Friday\u2019s announcement, the number of new nursing home beds is still 500 short of its estimated need. Experts predict Florida will 15,000 more beds in the next 15 years.\n\nThe news comes the same day the federal government released scores on the nation\u2019s nursing homes, using tougher standards. A USA Today analysis found that 61 percent of nursing homes got lower quality of care scores in the new Nursing Home Compare report.\n\n\u201cThere were just far too many nursing homes that were showing good scores, good measures based on self-reported data,\u201d said Brian Lee, founder of Families for Better Care, a nursing home watchdog group. \u201cAnd it just overblew the nursing home quality.\u201d\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
