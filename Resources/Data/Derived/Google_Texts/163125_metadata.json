And by all accounts, the sanctions have done considerable damage to the Russian economy.\n\nThey have also, arguably, done military damage. In reaction to Russia\u2019s adventurism in Ukraine, French President Francois Hollande cancelled the planned sale of two Mistral-class helicopter carrier warships to the Kremlin\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Oil Prices Are Holding Steady, Despite the ISIS Attacks\n\nBut the mutual resolve of the West was never without cracks. The effort was led, in large part, by the United States, and the U.S., relative to many European countries, had very little to lose in cutting off lanes of commerce with Moscow. U.S. trade with Russia makes up a trivial percentage of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nThat was less true of many European nations, which went along with the sanctions regime partly out of anger and concern over Russian aggression but also partly out of fear of flouting the U.S. on an issue the Obama administration had plainly made a major priority.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris last week, which left more than 130 French citizens dead and hundreds more wounded, the relationship between Russia and the West has become more complicated.\n\nPutin committed a substantial military presence to Syria late last summer \u2013 ostensibly to combat ISIS, though most of its efforts have actually been focused on bombing rebel groups challenging Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, one of Russia\u2019s few allies in the region.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush \u2013 We Need U.S. Ground Troops to Fight ISIS\n\nThis week, however, Russia claimed that a passenger jet that disintegrated over Egypt last month, killing hundreds of mostly Russian passengers, had been bombed by terrorists who were most likely affiliated with ISIS.\n\nThe admission was accompanied by an announcement that Russia would dramatically step up its attacks on ISIS in Syria. The Kremlin said that it would increase the number of its attack aircraft in Syria by more than half and would begin sending long-range heavy bombers based in Russia to strike ISIS targets.\n\nFurther, Putin personally ordered Russian naval units in the Mediterranean, including the guided missile carrier Moskva, to await the arrival of an expected French battle group and to coordinate with it and treat it as an \u201cally.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to become increasingly difficult for Western countries to continue applying economic sanctions to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia as his military takes on an increasingly important role in the battle against ISIS. Putin\u2019s country, hammered not just by economic sanctions but by the plunge in global oil prices, has dedicated a huge amount of spending to its military, but how long it can keep that up remains unclear.\n\nRelated: Lindsey Graham Wants to Declare War on ISIS. But Is Anybody Listening?\n\nNowhere is the ambivalence toward continued sanctions on Russia clearer than in France, which now shares the sad distinction with Russia of having its citizens directly targeted for massacre by ISIS. (To be sure, ISIS attacks against civilians have been widespread, indiscriminate, and have touched many countries. But the group has managed to inflict few high-casualty attacks on major world powers so far.)\n\nFrench President Francois Holland will travel to Moscow next week after a trip to Washington. And while it\u2019s unlikely that Putin\u2019s government will make a public appeal for sanctions to be lifted, the issue is already being raised in the French political circles.\n\nA number of former high-ranking French politicians, including former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, have called for France to ease its stance toward Russia.\n\nIt likely won\u2019t be the last call for Western nations to relax the economic pressure on Russia in the interest of furthering the fight against ISIS.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Western governments presented a united front in imposing economic sanctions on Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision first to invade part of Ukraine in 2014 and later to continue supporting separatist rebels in other parts of the war-torn country.
