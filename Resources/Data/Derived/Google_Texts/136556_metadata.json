Sloan said he heard Pitt coaches make comments about that game when he was near their sideline. Nonetheless, he didn\u2019t feel any added pressure when he lined up for the game-winning kick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s every kicker\u2019s dream to be in this situation,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely what separates the good kickers from the bad kickers. I thought of it as just another kick. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nNavy finally got into a rhythm in the second half and put together their most impressive drive of the game to take a 14-13 lead with 14:28 left in the game.\n\nReserve fullback Quinton Singleton\u2019s 9-yard scoring run capped the 16-play, 91-yard scoring drive that took 8:15 off the clock. The teams traded touchdowns in the fourth quarter before Sloan kicked the game-winner.\n\nTom Savage completed 20 of 27 pass attempts for 203 yards and two touchdowns for Pitt (4-3).\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Devin Street caught nine passes for 96 yards with a touchdown and became the school\u2019s all-time leading receiver. Street now has 186 career receptions, surpassing Latef Grim, who had 178 from 1998-2000.\n\nTrailing 14-13 midway through the fourth quarter, Savage threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to freshman Tyler Boyd to give the Panthers a 20-14 lead. Street then caught a short pass for the 2-point conversion.\n\nNavy responded on the ensuing possession and tied the game on a 10-play, 71-yard drive capped by a 2-yard run by quarterback Keenan Reynolds with 3:53 left in the game.\n\nThe Midshipmen then forced a 3-and-out on the Panthers\u2019 next possession and got the ball at Pitt\u2019s 49. Navy ran 11 plays to set up Sloan\u2019s game-winning kick.\n\n\u201cI wish these games weren\u2019t like this, but we\u2019ll take it,\u201d Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \u201cI\u2019m super-happy for Nick Sloan. The guy took a beating last week. He\u2019s the guy who took the blame last week. It wasn\u2019t his fault. We lost as a team and today we won as a team.\u201d\n\nPitt opened a 3-0 lead on its first drive on a 25-yard field goal by Chris Blewitt on a 16-play, 68 yard drive that took 7:32 off the clock. After Don Pearson recovered a fumble by James Conner to open the second quarter, Navy took the lead on a pass from Reynolds that deflected off Geoffrey Whiteside and was caught by senior Marcus Thomas, who ran 58 yards for first career touchdown.\n\n\u201cGive Navy credit, in a 60-minute game, they found a way to win,\u201d Pitt coach Paul Chryst said. \u201cI thought our guy\u2019s effort was nothing short of what I expected. Obviously, we did not make enough plays to win the game.\u201d\n\nAnother 44-yard field goal by Blewitt pulled Pitt to within 7-6 with 9:23 left in the half. The Panthers then took a 13-7 lead eight minutes later on a 12-yard pass from Tom Savage to Street.\n\nThe Panthers completely dominated the first half and held the edge in total plays (44-22), time of possession (22:07-7:53) and yardage (252-135).\n\nNavy entered the game ranked sixth in the nation with 304.2 rushing yards per game, and managed 220 against the Panthers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of Nick,\u201d Navy linebacker Cody Peterson said. \u201cAfter last week, it\u2019s tough for a kicker because you\u2019re in the limelight with that one play. By no means was it his fault because there were so many plays in that game. He came back this week with ice in his veins and made it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One week after missing an extra point in the second overtime that cost his team, Navy kicker Nick Sloan redeemed himself Saturday against Pittsburgh.
