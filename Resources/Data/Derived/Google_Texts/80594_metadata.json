Largely because of relatively low payment rates to providers, Medicaid enrollees have less access to a regular source of health care and tend to receive worse care, such as being assigned to less-skilled surgeons.\n\nThird, Medicaid recipients receive a disproportionate amount of non-emergency care in emergency rooms. Recent data suggests that the Medicaid expansion has made this problem worse, not better.\n\nFourth, Medicaid expansions tend to cause people to replace their (often superior) and privately financed coverage with Medicaid.\n\n***\n\nFifth, Virginia\u2019s Medicaid spending is already rapidly increasing, threatening other state priorities. Over the past 25 years, Virginia\u2019s Medicaid spending, adjusted for population growth and inflation, more than tripled. Between 1989 and 2014, Medicaid more than doubled as a percentage of total state spending, while the share of spending going to elementary and secondary education, higher education, and transportation has all dropped.\n\nSixth, states adopting the ACA Medicaid expansion have experienced much larger enrollment and spending increases than expected. More than twice as many people enrolled in Kentucky as expected, more than doubling the expansion\u2019s cost to the state. Twice as many as expected also enrolled in Washington, and nearly three times as many as expected enrolled in California. In Michigan, costs are 50 percent higher than anticipated, and Ohio\u2019s costs are more than twice what was anticipated.\n\nSeventh, expanding Medicaid means many lower-income people in Virginia will lose insurance through the ACA exchanges.\n\nAlthough exchange plans are generally unattractive to people who have to pay the plan\u2019s full cost, many Virginians in households earning between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level (between $11,770 and $16,240 for a single person) are enrolled in exchange plans because large subsidies reduce their premiums and deductibles. These people will lose eligibility for subsidies if the state expands Medicaid.\n\n***\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe has recently discussed a new plan that will expand Medicaid by shifting the cost to federal taxpayers through higher federal deficits. All states should consider the federal government\u2019s deteriorating budget situation and that it may not keep its commitment of greater Medicaid spending.\n\nIn 1990, Washington spent $41 billion ($75 billion in 2015 dollars) on Medicaid, equal to about 3 percent of all federal spending.\n\nIn 2015, Washington will spend about $320 billion, or nearly 9 percent of all federal spending. Both President Obama and the bipartisan deficit commission recommended several ways to trim federal Medicaid spending, including eliminating a state\u2019s ability to use the method the governor discussed.\n\nInstead of expanding Medicaid based on the false promise of free federal dollars, an uncertain proposition at best, Virginia should reform its current program so it better meets the needs of current enrollees and state taxpayers.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond Times-Dispatch", "description": "With the dawning of a new legislative year, Virginia policymakers will inevitably face another round of pressure to expand Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program.", "title": "Blase: Medicaid needs reform, not expansion", "url": "http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/article_624bfaa4-4fa1-5dec-af8c-c6a6a508f811.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/2d/42d75e05-64f3-5a7b-ac27-f84cee1a900d/56731ecf3c5e0.image.jpg?resize=760%2C760", "height": 760}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@richmonddotcom", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With the dawning of a new legislative year, Virginia policymakers will inevitably face another round of pressure to expand Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program.", "msvalidate.01": "669B03D2B6841AE0EB5AEA39929FB0A8", "p": {"domain_verify": "76099571785251a341c8e146d86d708e"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004381960031, "app_id": 359392482564}, "keywords": "#printsection_td_e4,#printsection_td_e04,guest-columnists,view-oped-nosig", "google-site-verification": "wXaa1PI0ELEf5pOWVfpls8JG_g2yaFH-vaqES-qmfuk", "news_keywords": "#printsection_td_e4,#printsection_td_e04,guest-columnists,view-oped-nosig"}, "article_summary": "Second, a large body of research shows that Medicaid enrollees tend to suffer worse health care outcomes than similar patients without Medicaid.\nTwice as many as expected also enrolled in Washington, and nearly three times as many as expected enrolled in California.\nBoth President Obama and the bipartisan deficit commission recommended several ways to trim federal Medicaid spending, including eliminating a state\u2019s ability to use the method the governor discussed.\nOver the past 25 years, Virginia\u2019s Medicaid spending, adjusted for population growth and inflation, more than tripled.\nFirst, a recent study by a team of renowned economists from MIT, Harvard, and Dartmouth shows that Medicaid enrollees place a low value on the program."}
