'US Healthcare BPO Market - Payer (Claims Processing, HR Services, and Finance and Accounts), Provider (Medical Billing and Coding), and Pharmaceutical (Clinical Trials, Contract Manufacturing, and Non-Clinical Services) - Trends and Global Forecasts to 2018'

The US healthcare payer, provider, and pharmaceutical outsourcing markets are valued at $11.1 billion, $6.8 billion and $65.6 billion, respectively, in the year 2013. The U.S. healthcare payer market has been greatly impacted by the introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).

The US healthcare BPO (business process outsourcing) market has great potential for growth owing to the measures taken by the government to curb ever-increasing healthcare costs. Other factors that have led to the growth of the market include developments and innovation in information technology and regulatory changes. Approximately 75% of US healthcare companies outsource their work to external locations. This is due to the shortage of qualified staff in key positions - such as nurses and coders - and due to the new set of rules and regulations that they need to comply with. Some services that are commonly outsourced are insurance claims processing, adjudication and receivables management, billing and coding services, radiology reporting, transcription services, and clinical outsourcing, among others.

Implementation of various reforms such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as the conversion from the ICD-9 coding system to the ICD-10 coding system (to be implemented by October 2014) has created an upward growth trend. Furthermore, constant improvements in the quality of work from destination countries have reinforced the confidence of various healthcare payers, providers, and pharmaceutical companies in outsourcing. This is considered as the key driver of the healthcare process outsourcing market. On the other hand, data security and confidentiality concerns are the restraints for the growth of the market.
