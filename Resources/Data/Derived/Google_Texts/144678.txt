Evelyn said Dispatcher Barb Jones helped calm her and her sister, while police raced to the home. Police caught Hayes after a short foot chase.

Jones and the Gonzalez sisters were reunited Wednesday afternoon outside the family’s home.

“I could tell as soon as I heard her voice, I knew this was a real situation,” Jones said Wednesday.

“It was great because I finally met the person who kind of saved our life,” said 12-year-old Evelyn Gonzalez.

Coincidentally, this week is National Telecommunicator Appreciation Week.
