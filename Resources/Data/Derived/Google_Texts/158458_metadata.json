He wrote a scathing commentary about Abbate and staunchly defended the young student.\n\n\u201cLike the rest of academia, Marquette is less and less a real university,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd when gay marriage cannot be discussed -- certainly not a Catholic university.\u201d\n\nMcAdams soon discovered how true that statement was. On Tuesday, he was placed under investigation, suspended and banned from campus.\n\n\u201cYou are relieved of all teaching duties and all other faculty activities,\u201d Dean Richard Holz wrote to McAdams in a letter. \u201cYou are to remain off campus during this time.\u201d\n\nMcAdams, who has taught at Marquette for 37 years, will maintain his salary and benefits during the inquisition.\n\nHe was not told why he was under investigation or why he was suspended \u2013 but he suspects that Abbate accused him of harassment because of the blog post.\n\n\u201cIt would be odd to be charged with harassing someone by reporting something accurately on my blog,\u201d McAdams told me. \u201cA lot of politically correct faculty have wanted my head on a pike.\u201d\n\nThe university released a statement to television station WITI about the professor\u2019s suspension \u2013 and referenced their policy about harassment.\n\n\u201cAs stated in our harassment policy, the university will not tolerate personal attacks or harassment of or by students, faculty and staff,\u201d the statement read. \u201cTo be clear, we will take action to address those concerns. We deplore hatred and abuse directed at a member of our community in any format.\u201d\n\nDoes the university also deplore the deliberate silencing of professors and students who oppose gay marriage? Will the university take action against the teaching assistant for standing in opposition to Catholic doctrine? Will the university tolerate a teaching assistant who stifles free speech?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of keeping your mouth shut,\u201d McAdams told me. \u201cStudents are subjected to a good bit of indoctrination.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Abbate said what she said to the student. The young man, who asked not to be named, secretly recorded the entire conversation. Under Wisconsin law, he was within his rights to do so.\n\n\u201cAre you saying if I don\u2019t agree with gays not being allowed to get married that I\u2019m homophobic?\u201d the student asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying it would come off as a homophobic comment in this class,\u201d the teacher replied.\n\nMcAdams accused Abbate of using a tactic \u201ctypical among liberals now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpinions with which they disagree are not merely wrong, and are not to be argued against on their merits, but are deemed \u2018offensive\u2019 and need to be shut up,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter Abbate\u2019s classroom antics were exposed she came under fierce attack from conservatives and those who appreciate and respect public discourse. However, Abbate objected to those who were critical of behavior.\n\nShe accused those who disagreed with her of \u201ccyberbullying and harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is astounding to me that the university has not created some sort of policy that would prohibit this behavior which undoubtedly leads to a toxic environment for both students and faculty,\u201d she told the website Inside Higher Ed.\n\nSo not only does Teaching Assistant Abbate want to silence opposition to her beliefs in the classroom \u2013 she also wants to silence opposition outside of the classroom.\n\nMcAdams was soon attacked by a politically correct assortment of lesbians, feminists and white privilege advocates at the university. I refer you to his blog for the colorful, detailed account of what they tried to do to McAdams.\n\nAnd now it appears Marquette University is conspiring with Abbate to chill if not silence dissenting campus voices.\n\n\u201cShame on her,\u201d McAdams told me. \u201cSomeone should tell her you don\u2019t call opposition to gay marriage homophobia. People have a right to express that opinion.\u201d\n\nBut they apparently don\u2019t have that right at Marquette University.\n\nI\u2019m not Catholic \u2013 but it seems to me Marquette University is one of those CINO schools \u2013 Catholic in Name Only.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marquette University seems to be sending a message to students and faculty who support Catholic doctrine regarding marriage: if you oppose gay marriage keep your mouth shut..05/26/2016 19:52:24PM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Marquette University seems to be sending a message to students and faculty who support Catholic doctrine regarding marriage: if you oppose gay marriage keep your mouth shut.", "title": "- Catholic University Marquette Suspends Professor Over Anti-Gay Marriage Controversy", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/12/18/catholic-university-marquette-suspends-professor-over-antigay-marriage-controversy-n1933853", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/18/36.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Marquette University seems to be sending a message to students and faculty who support Catholic doctrine regarding marriage: if you oppose gay marriage keep your mouth shut.", "title": "- Catholic University Marquette Suspends Professor Over Anti-Gay Marriage Controversy", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/12/18/catholic-university-marquette-suspends-professor-over-antigay-marriage-controversy-n1933853", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/18/36.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Catholic University Marquette Suspends Professor Over Anti-Gay Marriage Controversy, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m not Catholic \u2013 but it seems to me Marquette University is one of those CINO schools \u2013 Catholic in Name Only.\n\u201cAnd when gay marriage cannot be discussed -- certainly not a Catholic university.\u201dMcAdams soon discovered how true that statement was.\nMarquette University seems to be sending a message to students and faculty who support Catholic doctrine regarding marriage: if you oppose gay marriage keep your mouth shut.\nPeople have a right to express that opinion.\u201dBut they apparently don\u2019t have that right at Marquette University.\nAnd now it appears Marquette University is conspiring with Abbate to chill if not silence dissenting campus voices."}
