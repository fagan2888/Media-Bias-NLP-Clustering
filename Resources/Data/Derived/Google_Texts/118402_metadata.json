This tendency has also been found in animals as well. For example, gophers whisper sometimes and bats too in order to avoid detection by moth prey.\n\nScientists Rachel Morrison and Diana Reiss of the City University of New York recently found with the help of their study that cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) make a very low sound when they think that a predator or unwelcomed visitor is nearby.\n\nThe findings came as a surprise for the researchers as they were initially studying the loud calls and mobbing behavior that tamarins often belt out in response to seeing people they fear.\n\nAlthough zoologists are aware of the fact that there are various animals that like to whisper based on certain circumstances, but it was the first time for the researcher to observe the same in nonhuman primates.\n\nCotton-top tamarin is a primate, which is known as the world's smallest primates. It exists in the tropical forests of northwestern Columbia in South America.\n\nThe study saw the researchers analyzing audio spectrograms. Their findings revealed that the tamarins were communicating, but the level was extremely low.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36c3\"", "article_summary": "Cotton-top tamarin is a primate, which is known as the world's smallest primates.\nIt has been revealed by scientists that humans are not the only creatures who know how to whisper.\nTheir findings revealed that the tamarins were communicating, but the level was extremely low.\nFor example, gophers whisper sometimes and bats too in order to avoid detection by moth prey.\nAlthough zoologists are aware of the fact that there are various animals that like to whisper based on certain circumstances, but it was the first time for the researcher to observe the same in nonhuman primates."}
