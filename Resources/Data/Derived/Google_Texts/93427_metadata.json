Estlow, a former executive with the Rocky Mountain News and the E. W. Scripps Co., has died at the age of 95.\n\nEstlow graduated in 1942 from the University of Denver, where he played football and set the single-game rushing record, 172 yards, in a 1941 contest against the University of Wyoming.\n\nAfter a long, storied career in the newspaper industry, which brought him to New York City and Cincinnati, among other places, Estlow returned to Denver in 1985 and renewed a relationship with DU, serving on its board of trustees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a substantial loss,\u201d said William Dean Singleton, former owner of The Denver Post and a friend of Estlow\u2019s for 40 years. \u201cHe was a giant in the industry.\u201d\n\nEstlow was a reporter with the Rocky Mountain News and eventually became the tabloid\u2019s vice president and general manager.\n\nIn 1965, he became vice president of business with E.W. Scripps, at the time headquartered in New York City. In 1976, he was named chief executive of Scripps.\n\nBy the time the Colorado native retired from Scripps, Estlow had helped to take the company public, pushing annual revenues under his leadership from $500 million to $1.1 billion, according to a University of Denver magazine article in 2012.\n\n\u201cEd Estlow\u2019s leadership skills were only surpassed by his kindness. His courageous decisions at the helm of Scripps set the stage for many years of success, and his generous mentoring had a profound impact on many of the company\u2019s employees,\u201d said Rich Boehne, chief executive and president of Scripps since 2008. \u201cEd was fond of many places in this world, but his true love was Denver.\u201d\n\nBob Burdick, a former Rocky editor and president, met Estlow about 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cHe was a very good friend and a mentor,\u201d Burdick said.\n\n\u201cA man of impeccable character, a superb businessman as well. I and others who knew him will miss him a great deal.\u201d\n\nIn 1944, Estlow married Charlotte Ann Schroeder. The couple met at DU and remained wed until her death in 2013. They had four daughters: Susan Lyday, Nancy Gwin, Sally Baier and Mary Erculiani.\n\nThe Edward W. and Charlotte A. Estlow International Center for Journalism and New Media at the University of Denver is named in their honor.\n\n\u201cHe was a steady hand when DU needed a steady hand,\u201d chancellor emeritus Dan Ritchie told the University of Denver magazine. \u201cI think his blood is crimson and gold.\u201d\n\nSingleton first became friends with Estlow when the two were business competitors.\n\n\u201cWhen I met him, I was 24 and he was the CEO of E.W. Scripps,\u201d Singleton recalled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very close friends ever since. He helped guide me through the industry.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former leader at Rocky Mountain News, Scripps dies at 95", "title": "Former leader at Rocky Mountain News, Scripps dies at 95", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/09/former-leader-at-rocky-mountain-news-scripps-dies-at-95/", "image": {"width": 350, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__estlowp1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__estlowp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T20:16:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T15:20:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cdb\"", "article_summary": "Edward W.
