Many on both sides expected the veto override move to fall short of the needed majority since nearly all of the lawmakers who sent the budget bill to the governor's desk- knowing in advance he planned to veto the provision that would end Medicaid expansion - were supporters of his Arkansas Works plan.\n\nState Senator Bart Hester of Cave Springs in Benton County made the motion on the Senate floor to override the governor's veto. No one re-hashed remarks made earlier this fiscal session but speaking afterward, Sen. Hester said the fight is not over.\n\n\"Time is on my side. There's never been a Medicaid program that has met expectations. They are all over enrollment predictions and over budget. Time is going to be my friend and we'll come back next year and show that this was not a good plan,\" said the northwest Arkansas Republican. \"We'll continue to argue.\"\n\nState Senator Gary Stubblefield, of Franklin County in western Arkansas, has opposed the governor\u2019s Arkansas Works plan. He voted to override the line item veto from his fellow Republican too.\n\n\u201cWe have done something, the governor has done something with these tactics that he\u2019s using to get this thing through that I\u2019m not sure he hasn\u2019t circumvented the Constitution of the State. It\u2019s just never been done before, defunding a measure and then refunding it through a line-item veto,\u201d said Sen. Stubblefield.\n\nProponents of the move including Republican Senate President Jonathan Dismang and Democratic Joint Budget Chair Larry Teague have said it is a constitutionally sound use of the line item veto.\n\nLast week, Sen. Dismang said additional legislation could be presented in a special session to safeguard the governor\u2019s veto and the intent of the majority of the legislature at the time to keep Medicaid expansion through 2021 via the circuitous line item veto route. A minority of the Republican party had been blocking the overall Medicaid budget bill which required a three-fourths majority to pass. The line item veto was crated to work around the impasse.\n\nMedicaid expansion is made possible by the Affordable Care Act and covers over 267,000 low-income Arkansans. The state will have to contribute up to 10 percent of the program\u2019s coverage costs by 2021.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arkansas Politics Blog", "description": "An attempt in the Arkansas Senate on Tuesday to override Governor Asa Hutchinson\u2019s veto \u2013 that allowed for Medicaid expansion to continue \u2013 failed on a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/arkansas-senate-upholds-governors-veto-continue-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201604/arkansas_senate.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An attempt in the Arkansas Senate on Tuesday to override Governor Asa Hutchinson\u2019s veto \u2013 that allowed for Medicaid expansion to continue \u2013 failed on a", "title": "Arkansas Senate Upholds Governor's Veto To Continue Medicaid Expansion"}, "story_id": 475786489, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarkauffman"}, "author": "Jacob Kauffman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Arkansas Senate Upholds Governor&#039;s Veto To Continue Medicaid Expansion"}, "nid": 58238, "datePublished": "2016-04-26", "keywords": "Arkansas Politics Blog, Arkansas Healthcare", "wordCount": 429, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "State Senator Gary Stubblefield, of Franklin County in western Arkansas, has opposed the governor\u2019s Arkansas Works plan.\nState Senator Bart Hester of Cave Springs in Benton County made the motion on the Senate floor to override the governor's veto.\nAn attempt in the Arkansas Senate on Tuesday to override Governor Asa Hutchinson\u2019s veto \u2013 that allowed for Medicaid expansion to continue \u2013 failed on a voice vote.\nMedicaid expansion is made possible by the Affordable Care Act and covers over 267,000 low-income Arkansans.\nThe line item veto was crated to work around the impasse."}
