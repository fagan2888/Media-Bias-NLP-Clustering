They are Amendment B, Referred Law 19, and Referred Law 20, which deals with the minimum wage.\n\nThen there are nine proposed initiated measures where organizers are still circulating petitions to get enough signatures.\n\nThey include everything from capping interest rates on payday lending to legalizing medicinal marijuana to decriminalizing the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana and pot paraphernalia.\n\nThere are also two measures that have received the Attorney General's explanation, but have not yet been submitted to the Secretary of State's Office for final approval to begin circulating petitions. Both deal with establishing nonpartisan elections.\n\nFinally, three other measures that still need Attorney General's and Secretary of State's approval and written explanation before organizers can begin circulating petitions; one of which increases the minimum sentences for certain crimes against children.\n\nIf all 17 measures get put on next year's ballot it would be a record. The previous record was in 1916 and 1918; both had 13 ballot measures.\n\nThe Secretary of State's Office is encouraging voters to read the title and the Attorney General's explanation on the petition before signing. If they still have questions or are confused after reading the petition, they can review the petition on the Secretary of State's website or contact the the sponsors of the petitions. That information can be found on this link.\n\nBy state law, circulators are to provide each person who signs the petition a form containing the title and explanation of the measure or amendment as prepared by the Attorney General.\n\nBallot Issues {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
