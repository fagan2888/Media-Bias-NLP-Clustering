How true and timely are the words of the prophet Isaiah which we have just heard: \u201cYou have brought abundant joy and great rejoicing\u201d (9:2)! Our heart was already joyful in awaiting this moment; now that joy abounds and overflows, for the promise has been at last fulfilled. Joy and gladness are a sure sign that the message contained in the mystery of this night is truly from God. There is no room for doubt; let us leave that to the skeptics who, by looking to reason alone, never find the truth. There is no room for the indifference which reigns in the hearts of those unable to love for fear of losing something. All sadness has been banished, for the Child Jesus brings true comfort to every heart.\n\nToday, the Son of God is born, and everything changes. The Savior of the world comes to partake of our human nature; no longer are we alone and forsaken. The Virgin offers us her Son as the beginning of a new life. The true light has come to illumine our lives so often beset by the darkness of sin. Today we once more discover who we are! Tonight we have been shown the way to reach the journey\u2019s end. Now must we put away all fear and dread, for the light shows us the path to Bethlehem. We must not be laggards; we are not permitted to stand idle. We must set out to see our Savior lying in a manger. This is the reason for our joy and gladness: this Child has been \u201cborn to us\u201d; he was \u201cgiven to us\u201d, as Isaiah proclaims (cf. 9:5). The people who for for two thousand years has traversed all the pathways of the world in order to allow every man and woman to share in this joy is now given the mission of making known \u201cthe Prince of peace\u201d and becoming his effective servant in the midst of the nations.\n\nSo when we hear the story of the birth of Christ, let us be silent and let the Child speak. Let us take his words to heart in rapt contemplation of his face. If we take him in our arms and let ourselves be embraced by him, he will bring us unending peace of heart. This Child teaches us what is truly essential in our lives. He was born into the poverty of this world; there was no room in the inn for him and his family. He found shelter and support in a stable and was laid in a manger for animals. And yet, from this nothingness, the light of God\u2019s glory shines forth. From now on, the way of authentic freedom and perennial redemption is open to every man and woman who is simple of heart. This Child, whose face radiates the goodness, mercy and love of God the Father, trains us, his disciples, as Saint Paul says, \u201cto reject godless ways\u201d and the richness of the world, in order to live \u201ctemperately, justly and devoutly\u201d (Tit 2:12).\n\nIn a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this Child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential. In a world which all too often is merciless to the sinner and lenient to the sin, we need to cultivate a strong sense of justice, to discern and to do God\u2019s will. Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy, drawn daily from the wellspring of prayer.\n\nLike the shepherds of Bethlehem, may we too, with eyes full of amazement and wonder, gaze upon the Child Jesus, the Son of God. And in his presence may our hearts burst forth in prayer: \u201cShow us, Lord, your mercy, and grant us your salvation\u201d (Ps 85:8).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "VATICAN:", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 Christmas Eve homily text: \u2018Everything changes\u2019", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/12/24/pope-francis-christmas-eve-homily-text-everything-changes/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/thumbRNS-PopeFrancisDec24.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/12/24/pope-francis-christmas-eve-homily-text-everything-changes/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/12/24/pope-francis-christmas-eve-homily-text-everything-changes/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "VATICAN:"}, "article_summary": "The true light has come to illumine our lives so often beset by the darkness of sin.\nThe text of the pope\u2019s Christmas Eve homily as provided by Vatican Radio.\nSo when we hear the story of the birth of Christ, let us be silent and let the Child speak.\nJoy and gladness are a sure sign that the message contained in the mystery of this night is truly from God.\nTonight \u201ca great light\u201d shines forth (Is 9:1); the light of Jesus\u2019 birth shines all about us."}
