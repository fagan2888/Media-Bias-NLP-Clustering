(Oct. 18) AP\n\nPennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens addresses the media during a news conference on Oct. 8, 2014, at the Blooming Grove Township Municipal Building in Blooming Grove, Pa.. In background is an enhanced photo of suspected killer Eric Frein, who has been hiding in the deep woods in the Poconos for over three weeks. (Photo: Butch Comegys, Scranton Times & Tribune, via AP)\n\nPolice investigators believe the man suspected in the shooting death of a Pennsylvania state trooper was spotted in the woods of eastern Pennsylvania on Friday night.\n\nA woman told police investigators that she had seen Eric Matthew Frein, the subject of a massive manhunt, dressed in all black. Frein was not far from Pocono Mountain East High School, according to CNN.\n\nFrein's face was described as being covered in mud and he was said to be armed with a long rifle with a scope.\n\nThe 31-year-old Frein is suspected in the Sept. 12 ambush that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounded trooper Alex Douglass outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks.\n\nCNN reports that authorities believe the man seen Friday was Frein and are renewing focus on the area. Frein used to attend the local high school in Swiftwater, Pa., and used to work at a camp in the area.\n\nABC News reported the new sighting has \"high credibility\" with investigators.\n\nFrein has been described as a survivalist with a hatred for law enforcement. He has managed to elude a manhunt that has sometimes numbered 1,000 officers.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1wcyUoH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Police believe Eric Frein was spotted in the woods in Eastern Pennsylvania on Friday.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Police believe Eric Frein was spotted in the woods in Eastern Pennsylvania on Friday.", "title": "Police: Trooper shooting suspect spotted in Pa. woods", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/18/eric-matthew-frein-manhunt-trooper-slaying/17504825/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police believe Eric Frein was spotted in the woods in Eastern Pennsylvania on Friday.", "title": "Police: Trooper shooting suspect spotted in Pa. woods", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/90ba96b129d7ea25395309377753537d19f262d5/c=372-0-2028-1656&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/East High School", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/East High School", "title": "Police: Trooper shooting suspect spotted in Pa. woods", "author": "Bryan Alexander", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9660d5080c0bd03b8655dff162784c34bfcf6039/c=74-0-1316-1656/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41e2667bd08dc187ee2548a073480f2e1d422b69/c=372-0-2028-1656/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ccffb7b8c9dd119fe3ced4f110b0494b30262c1f/c=99-0-2301-1656/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80875f05fc7c52ea5051b845b56b69cedcef190e/c=0-150-2400-1506&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-10-18T16:38:34.837000-04:00", "shorthed": "Trooper shooting suspect spotted in Pa. woods", "articleid": 17504825, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/316efcb3a0182a6aa77996b6010917f4823fe4fb/c=0-150-2400-1506/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/883ffe07cd594ae7b3eebc273e361fb967f5e065/c=269-0-1196-1656/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/18/635492433460596199-AP-POLICE-BARRACKS-SHOOTING-67874046.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "police, eric matthew frein, pocono mountain, pennsylvania"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd4a\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Butch Comegys, Scranton Times & Tribune, via AP)Police investigators believe the man suspected in the shooting death of a Pennsylvania state trooper was spotted in the woods of eastern Pennsylvania on Friday night.\nFrein used to attend the local high school in Swiftwater, Pa., and used to work at a camp in the area.\nBryon Dickson and wounded trooper Alex Douglass outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks.\nIn background is an enhanced photo of suspected killer Eric Frein, who has been hiding in the deep woods in the Poconos for over three weeks.\nA woman told police investigators that she had seen Eric Matthew Frein, the subject of a massive manhunt, dressed in all black."}
