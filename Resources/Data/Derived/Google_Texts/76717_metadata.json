There are almost 3.7 million uninsured California residents eligible for government subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to Forbes.\n\nFrom Oct. 1 to 5, Covered California reported 987,440 unique visits to the state-run online enrollment system, as well as 59,003 phone calls.\n\nThough open enrollment has been popular, some physicians, private insurers and residents are wary of the overall change taking place within the California health care system.\n\n\u201cIt will be a fast-food chain type of health care,\u201d Dr. Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist based out of California, told GoBankingRates. \u201cDoctors will not have time or resources to treat patients comprehensively enough, since they will have to rush them through in order to survive financially.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the Affordable Care Act will affect health insurance rates for uninsured Californians:\n\nMen/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act\n\nPost-Affordable Care Act\n\n% Increase Age 27 $145 a month $179 a month 23% Age 40 $192 a month $219 a month 14% Age 64 $542 a month $514 a month -5%\n\nRelated article: 10 Huge Ways Obamacare Will Impact Your Life\n\nNew York: 19.6 million residents\n\nUnlike many other states, New York already has a lot of the same benefits and requirements that the Affordable Care Act is now enforcing. The state already doesn\u2019t allow insurers to reject applicants with pre-existing conditions and maintains a standard set of deductibles and co-pays.\n\nHowever, New York\u2019s individual market has a small pool of sick residents at very high costs for healthier residents, which is why currently only 17,000 New Yorkers buy their own insurance and 2.6 million lack coverage.\n\nNew York expects to see more than 600,000 residents enter its individual insurance market, most of whom are looking to avoid the penalty fee attached to the Affordable Care Act if they remain uninsured. About 70 percent of this group is eligible for federal subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe people who are going to come in are healthy people who can\u2019t afford the coverage now,\u201d Gary Claxton, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told CNNMoney. \u201cThat will substantially lower the average cost of care.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how much the Affordable Care Act will lower the individual health insurance premiums in New York:\n\nMen/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act\n\nPost-Affordable Care Act\n\n% Decrease Age 27 $500 a month $356 a month -29% Age 40 $500 a month $356 a month -29% Age 64 $500 a month $356 a month -29%\n\nRelated article: Obamacare Could Help Medical Tourism Thrive\n\nOhio: 11.5 million residents\n\nIn the past, Ohio residents who tried to buy health insurance through the individual market were refused coverage 33 percent of time, one of the highest rates of any state, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nNearly 1.7 million residents of Ohio who are uninsured can buy coverage through the new government-operated online marketplace. The majority of Ohio\u2019s population currently receives employer-based health insurance.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) estimates that 916,000 Ohioans will qualify for government subsidies to buy insurance premiums, according to Cleveland.com. While many uninsured residents of Ohio are looking forward to finally receiving coverage, some are wary about the changes they will see in the day-to-day health care system.\n\n\u201cFrom what I can tell, Obamacare assumes that keeping prices low merely is a matter of regulating what health care can charge, as though that isn\u2019t going to result in rationing, shortages and long waits,\u201d Joel Selmeier, a self-employed resident of Cincinnati who buys his own insurance, told GoBankingRates.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Affordable Care Act will affect health insurance rates and premiums for uninsured individuals living in Ohio:\n\nMen/Women Pre-Affordable Care Act\n\nPost-Affordable Care Act\n\n% Decrease Men % Decrease Women Age 27 $174/$227 a month $169 a month -3% -26% Age 40 $264/$372 a month $206 a month -22% -45% Age 64 $852/$841 a month $484 a month -43% -42%\n\nRelated article: Obamacare Costs Vs.
