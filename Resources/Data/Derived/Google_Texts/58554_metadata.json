Taking risks means some failure. Not everything will work out. There will be winners and losers. To think that the government can impose regulations on business that will assure that everything will go right and that no one will be hurt is the antithesis of the capitalistic thesis. Central governments cannot manage a total economy such that everything works perfectly for everyone.\n\nHowever, as the federal government both expands its entitlement programs\u2013Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, food stamps and the like\u2013to the point where more than 50% of the (voting) population depends upon them and, at the same time, heightens regulations on the private sector such that it becomes more difficult to take risks, be incredibly successful, and, even, to fail, the American dream that everyone even wants the opportunity to be successful will be a thing of the past.\n\nThe solutions are to reign in the many entitlement programs such that they are safety nets, not cushy hammocks. They must be fiscally sound over the long term. As demographics, such as life expectancies, change, so must these programs. Good policy has to trump good politics. Then, many of the regulations directed toward the business sector that have been put into place over the past few years need to be revisited in the context of their impact on the overall economy, jobs, salaries, and standards of living.\n\nIf the U.S. is going to remain a world leader, it must maintain economic leadership. Emphasis has to be restored to the importance of economic strength and growth\u2019s impact on global leadership.\n\nRobert A. Howell is the David T.
