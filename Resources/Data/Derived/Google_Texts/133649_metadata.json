Mountaineers are always free, and we\u2019re always Mountaineers, so please indulge me today as amid the political news we highlight some of the best of my beloved, and always underappreciated, home state on its birthday.]\n\nBuzz Cut:\n\n\u2022 Why the IRS scandal won\u2019t die\n\n\u2022 Obama takes credit for ending the Iraq war, except when he doesn\u2019t\n\n\u2022 Big ObamaCare subsidies not big enough\n\n\u2022 Power Play: The bellwether of 2014\n\n\u2022 Hallowed hollow\n\nWHY THE IRS SCANDAL WON\u2019T DIE\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen is on the Hill today for another round of contentious hearings on mounting allegations of misconduct at the agency. Taking center stage: the vanished emails of key figures in the scandal. The agency, accused of harassing conservative groups, claims that emails from individuals who are the focus of congressional investigators are gone and unrecoverable. A dubious claim. As the partisans haggle over \u201crecycled\u201d hard drives and the existence of back-up servers, though, let\u2019s not forget why we care. This isn\u2019t just an ordinary story about an over-powerful government agency run amok. The allegations here are of political corruption in which officials appointed by the party in power allegedly sought to impede and punish those of the opposing view with the intent to alter the outcome of two elections. That\u2019s not just the usual stuff we read about with regulators gone wild \u2013 consequences of an obtuse and overbroad bureaucracy that rains misery on citizens just and unjust. This is an allegation of rigging two elections by high officials in an agency with enormous powers to harass and intimidate.\n\n[Famous West Virginians in politics and government - Ward Hill Lamon was Abraham Lincoln\u2019s devoted bodyguard and trusted confidante. Lamon, sent by Lincoln to Richmond the day before the president\u2019s assassination, famously warned the president not to go to the theater without him. Other notable names: Booker T. Washington, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, Robert Byrd and Henry Louis Gates]\n\nOutbox - It would be bad enough if the emails \u2013 which happen to involve the central figures in the scandal from the precise period of time of the alleged wrongdoing \u2013 were gone. But that fact that the agency withheld word of their disappearance until now reeks of a cover-up and calls into question all the previous claims of transparent cooperation. The Obama administration, its back against the wall, cries out \u201cThe server ate my emails.\u201d And there\u2019s this: The emails in question are between scandal figures and those outside the agency. That matters because the most important question in the whole affair is: At whose direction and with whose knowledge did the targeting of the president\u2019s enemies occur? We know Democratic senators were pushing the IRS to move against conservative groups. The narrative from the administration is that a rogue executive, Lois Lerner, pushed subordinates to overzealous enforcement against conservative groups. But were any of the senators calling for a crackdown or their staffs in communication with Lerner or her subordinates? There\u2019s evidence that Lerner colluded with an official at the Federal Elections Commission about targeting. Which other agencies was she sending to? And, the biggest question, what about the White House and officials in the president\u2019s political shop?\n\n[Strange but true - West Virginia was the site of the only known aerial bombardment in U.S. history, when federal forces responded to a 1921 uprising of coal miners in Logan County, including a bomber squadron led by aviation pioneer Billy Mitchell.]\n\nWhat\u2019s so special? - If this was a simple corruption case, it would be much simpler. But the charge here isn\u2019t that individuals acted for personal profit. The claim from Republicans is that IRS officials were deliberately suppressing efforts to defeat Democrats, including the president, in elections. That\u2019s a big claim, and Republicans will pay hell for it if it turns out not to be true. But given the most recent revelations, it hardly seems like the alleged beneficiaries of the misconduct ought to be the ones investigating. The Obama administration has gone to remarkable lengths to avoid having special prosecutors rooting around, the idea of having partisans investigating their fellows for political malfeasance is probably too much even for this team. An irony: If the IRS really is the victim of its own shoddy IT department, this may be an even more consequential technological failure for the Obama administration than even the crashed launch of ObamaCare.\n\n[Famous West Virginians in the arts - Hawkshaw Hawkins was a rising star in country music \u2013 he had already scored hits with \u201cPan American\u201d and \u201cThe Sunny Side of the Mountain\u201d \u2013 when he was killed in the same 1963 plane crash that claimed Patsy Cline. Other notable names: Brad Paisley, Don Knotts, Davis Grubb, Steve Harvey,John Knowles, Bill Withers, John Corbett and Pearl Buck]\n\nIssa calls White House to testify Tuesday - Daily Caller: \u201cHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa requested the testimony of White House Counsel\u2019s Office lawyer Jennifer O\u2019Connor at next Tuesday\u2019s hearing on the IRS lost emails scandal. Issa wrote a letter to O\u2019Connor, who worked at the IRS in the first months of its conservative targeting scandal in 2013 and was promoted to the White House earlier this year, asking her to appear alongside IRS commissioner John Koskinen at Tuesday\u2019s Oversight hearing. Issa made clear that he thinks O\u2019Connor \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that ex-IRS official Lois Lerner\u2019s emails were missing.\n\n[Fun fact - West Virginia may be the most unusually shaped state in the Union. Its crooked borders run an astonishing 1,170 miles. It is the only state with two panhandles and includes the famous Mason-Dixon Line.]\n\nOBAMA TAKES CREDIT FOR ENDING THE IRAQ WAR, EXCEPT WHEN HE DOESN\u2019T\n\nWaPo: \u201cPresident Obama surprised a few people during a news conference Thursday by claiming that the 2011 decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq, a politically popular move on the eve of an election year, was made entirely by his Iraqi counterpart. The implication ran counter to a number of claims that Obama has made in the past, most notably during a tight campaign season two years ago, when he suggested that it was his decision to leave Iraq and end an unpopular war.\u201d\n\nThat was then - \u201cFour years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did.\u201d \u2013 President Obama, campaigning in Sept., 2012.\n\nThis is now - \u201cWell, keep in mind that wasn\u2019t a decision made by me. That was a decision made by the Iraqi government.\u201d \u2013 President Obama asked by reporters Thursday if he regretted his 2011 decision not to leave some U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\n[Famous West Virginians in military history - Gen. Chuck Yeager was the first person known to have flown faster than the speed of sound, piloting the experimental plane he dubbed \u201cGlamorous Glennis\u201d on Oct. 14, 1947. He knew how to fight, too. Other notable names: Ebenezer Zane, Gen. Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson and Gen. Thomas Jessup]\n\nBIG OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES NOT BIG ENOUGH\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study found 43 percent of ObamaCare enrollees report having difficulty paying their premiums, even with government subsidies. Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York crunches the numbers: \u201cOf the 8 million, about 85 percent, or 6.8 million, actually paid for coverage. Of those, about 87 percent, or 5.9 million, receive taxpayer-paid subsidies to help them pay. In other words, nearly everyone who has bought insurance through the Obamacare exchanges has done so with money from the government. And the subsidies are significant \u2014 an average of $264 a month, according to HHS. The average monthly premium is $346, according to the report, so minus the $264 subsidy, the average subsidy recipient is paying a net cost of $82 a month for coverage. The government pays the rest\u2026 After Democrats finish crowing about what a success Obamacare is, it's likely they will argue that subsidies must be extended to more and more Americans to pay for coverage that Obamacare has made more and more expensive. Republicans will resist, but at the same time realize Obamacare has changed the health care system in ways that will be difficult to overturn and hard to fix.\u201d\n\n\u2018Start over\u2019 Obamacare - Reuters: \u201cU.S. Republican party officials are putting together a new election year messaging campaign to reach women voters on issues including Obamacare, jobs and education as they seek to gain an advantage in the Nov. 4 congressional elections. About three weeks of internal polling and focus group research has identified jobs and household finances as the most important issues among 1,206 likely women voters, according to the Republican National Committee, which commissioned the surveys along with the National Republican Congressional Campaign\u2026. The research identified the phrase \u2018start over\u2019 as a message that resonated with many women on Obamacare. The Republicans have been seeking to bridge the gap between loyal voters who want the healthcare law thrown out and those who favor retaining its consumer protections as part of a different reform environment.\u201d\n\n[Fun fact - Modern outdoor advertising as we know it got its start in Wheeling, W.Va. around 1909 when Bloch Brothers Tobacco began deploying artists to paint bridges and barns with their slogan: \u201cTreat Yourself to the Best, Chew Mail Pouch.\u201d]\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nDoes your state celebrate its birthday? Not too many do, but West Virginia makes a big production on of the event on June 20 each year \u2013 government offices close and historical re-enactors start popping up. Why? Aside from the special pride Mountaineers take in their beautiful state, their story is unlike any other in the union. The very short version is that when Virginia left the Union, West Virginia left Virginia. But the two-year-long effort, and the exploits and intrigues that surround it, is a great story for every American to know. The stakes were high, especially since the state was smack-dab in the central front of the war, and the consequences were enormous.

Scott Walker, R-Wis., in a secret probe have gone public accusing Walker of being at the center of a scheme to illegally coordinate fundraising with outside groups. The Hill: \u201cAccording to the [court documents]\u2026 prosecutors allege \u2018a concerted effort to circumvent Wisconsin's campaign finance contribution prohibitions, limitations and disclosure requirements\" to boost him in 2011 and 2012 during his gubernatorial recall election and help other state senators facing recall elections.\u201d The probe has been decried by Walker supporters as a partisan political operation aimed at the governor as he seeks re-election. Watchdog.org: \u201cLooking at the same documents, two judges have already ruled that John Doe prosecutors have absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing. U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa, who last month shut down the investigation through a preliminary injunction, described the prosecutors\u2019 claims against Walker as \u2018simply wrong.\u2019\n\nClinton donor bans Free Beacon from Razorback stacks- Washington Free Beacon: \u201cA Hillary Clinton donor who serves as dean of the University of Arkansas libraries has banned the Washington Free Beacon from the school\u2019s special collections archives, after the news outlet published revealing stories about Hillary Clinton based on documents available at the university library.

Mitt Romney, who wipes the 2016 field by a more than 2-1 margin, a new Suffolk University-Boston Herald poll reveals. The poll of 800 likely Granite State voters has less encouraging news for another ex-Massachusetts politician, former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown. He trails incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen by 10 points and is now viewed unfavorably by 46 percent of New Hampshire voters. But the biggest loser in the Suffolk-Herald poll is President Obama, whose approval rating has tumbled to an all-time low in New Hampshire. Just 39 percent of Granite State voters give a thumbs up to Obama\u2019s job performance, while 52 percent disapprove, according to the poll.\u201d\n\nPOWER PLAY: THE TAR HEEL TOSS UP IN 2014\n\nPolls have Republican state Rep.

Cory Gardner,[ R-Colo.,] is proposing that women be allowed to buy birth control pills without a prescription. Gardner made the suggestion Thursday after being criticized by Democrats on women\u2019s rights. Gardner, a Republican, is challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in November\u2019s Senate election. Udall aired an ad this week accusing Gardner of wanting to ban birth control because he backed a measure to give legal rights to fertilized eggs. Planned Parenthood also hit Gardner on the issue in an ad Thursday. Gardner has since disavowed the so-called personhood proposal. In a piece for the Denver Post, he said it would be safer and cheaper if the pill was available over the counter. Gardner and Udall are competing for the votes of a small number of suburban women who often decide statewide Colorado elections.\u201d\n\nFRIENDLY MEETING TURNED SHOUTING MATCH\n\nJackson (Miss.) Clarion-Ledger: \u201cWhat was supposed to be a meet-and-greet with citizens at a supermarket for Chris McDaniel turned into a shouting match between the U.S. Senate candidate and an onlooker.

But when the state went into a hiring and travel freeze, she still went on a trade mission trip to Turkey.\n\nPICK SIX\n\nRepublicans are hoping to pick up an additional six seats to gain control of the Senate this November.

The two clans get together every year around West Virginia Day to celebrate their famous fight. The struggle between Devil Anse and his kin against the Kentuckians of Randolph \u201cOld Ranel\u201d McCoy\u2019s family has gotten the Hollywood treatment, but the story stretches all the way back to the Civil War and the 1865 murder of Old Ranel\u2019s brother by a local militia that included Devil Anse.
