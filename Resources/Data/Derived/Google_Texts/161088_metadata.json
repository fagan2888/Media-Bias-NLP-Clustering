Mike Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on Thursday (March 26), the day after receiving a letter from church leaders pleading with him to veto it and threatening to move their 2017 General Assembly outside the state.\n\nThe bill protects business owners who invoke their religious beliefs to deny service to LGBT customers. A photographer, for example, may refuse to take pictures of a lesbian wedding on the grounds that his faith rejects gay marriage.\n\n\u201cPurportedly a matter of religious freedom, we find RFRA contrary to the values of our faith \u2014 as well as to our national and Hoosier values,\u201d stated the letter, which was signed by Sharon E. Watkins, the church\u2019s general minister and president, as well as the leaders of its overseas and domestic missions.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian church, we are particularly sensitive to the values of the One we follow \u2014 one who sat at table with people from all walks of life, and loved them all.\u201d\n\nThe General Assembly will bring more than 6,000 church members to whatever U.S. city the church decides upon and is expected to generate about $5 million in tourism dollars. After Pence signed the law, ministry leaders said they are weighing the costs of moving not only the General Assembly, but smaller meetings \u2014 such as the more frequent gatherings of the 125-member board of directors \u2014 which most often meets in Indianapolis.\n\nAssociate General Minister and Vice President Todd Adams said the church\u2019s board will decide whether to yank the General Assembly from Indianapolis at its next meeting, which begins on April 10.\n\nOther businesses and conventions, including Gen Con, the world\u2019s largest gaming convention, which brings an estimated $50 million to the state each year, have also threatened to find another place to hold their events.\n\nNCAA President Mark Emmert on Thursday afternoon said in a statement that his organization, which hosts the men\u2019s basketball Final Four in Indianapolis next week, is \u201cespecially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees\u201d and that it will examine how Indiana\u2019s RFRA could impact future NCAA events in Indiana.\n\nPence, after signing the law, told reporters that Indiana \u201cshould have done this a long time ago,\u201d and he rejected the idea that Indiana would pay a financial price for the law. The state\u2019s economy is doing well and the media have misconstrued the bill, which does not sanction discrimination, he said, but protects government from forcing people to act against their deeply held religious beliefs.\n\nPence, a Republican, cited similar laws in dozens of other states, and the national Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which came into play in the controversial Supreme Court Hobby Lobby decision in 2014. Then, the court allowed the business an exemption from a part of the Affordable Care Act that Hobby Lobby owners find objectionable on religious grounds.\n\n\u201cFaith and religion are important values to millions of Hoosiers and with the passage of this legislation,\u201d Pence said in a statement, \u201cwe ensure that Indiana will continue to be a place where we respect freedom of religion and make certain that government action will always be subject to the highest level of scrutiny that respects the religious beliefs of every Hoosier of every faith.\u201d\n\nMost Inspiring LGBT Religious Leaders Most Inspiring LGBT Religious Leaders\n\n1 of 89 Rev.
