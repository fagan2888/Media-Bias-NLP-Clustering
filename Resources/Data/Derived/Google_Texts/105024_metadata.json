In comparison to the U.S. average in 2011, after statistically accounting for their age, people living in Massachusetts were admitted to the hospital 10 percent more often and visited the emergency room 13 percent more often. They also used long-term-care services 31 percent more often and outpatient services at hospitals 72 percent more often than the national average.\n\nAnother reason for higher spending is that the cost of health care in Massachusetts is between 3 and 5 percent higher than the national average, according to recent analyses.\n\nThe authors wrote that health care spending in Massachusetts grew faster than both the national average and the state\u2019s economy from 2001 to 2009, but that since then, the state\u2019s health care spending has slowed.\n\nAmong its recommendations, the HPC said the state could improve its health care system by making spending more transparent and by rewarding alternative payment methods like the bundling of payments to doctors or hospitals for a range of services, rather than the traditional fee-for-service model that has driven up costs.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts has better overall health care quality performance and offers better access to care than many other states,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, considerable opportunities remain to further improve quality and access as well as population health.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: State's health care spending is the highest per capita in US, though quality and access are strong", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/9/mass-health-carespendingthehighestinus.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/1/9/mass-health-carespendingthehighestinus/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Massachusetts_health_care_010914.1389308561559.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Report: State's health care spending is the highest per capita in US, though quality and access are strong", "title": "One-third of health care spending in Massachusetts is 'wasteful'"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/1/9/mass-health-carespendingthehighestinus/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Massachusetts_health_care_010914.1389308561559.jpg", "description": "Report: State's health care spending is the highest per capita in US, though quality and access are strong", "card": "summary", "title": "One-third of health care spending in Massachusetts is 'wasteful'"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Health Care, Obamacare, U.S., Massachusetts, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d12\"", "article_summary": "Since Massachusetts was the first state in the U.S. to institute universal health care and its system inspired President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, the state is often viewed as a bellwether in terms of the future of health care spending.\nThe authors wrote that health care spending in Massachusetts grew faster than both the national average and the state\u2019s economy from 2001 to 2009, but that since then, the state\u2019s health care spending has slowed.\nThe commission, an independent agency formed in 2012 to analyze the state\u2019s progress on health care reform, found that between 21 and 39 percent of Massachusetts\u2019 spending on health care in 2012 was \u201cwasteful,\u201d which it defined as spending that could have been eliminated without harming customers or lowering the quality of health care.\nIt did note, however, that wasteful health care spending occurs, on average, around the same rate at the national level.\n\u201cMassachusetts has better overall health care quality performance and offers better access to care than many other states,\u201d the report said."}
