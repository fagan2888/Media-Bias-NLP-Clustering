Parents buy their kids phones for many reasons, but it\u2019s especially important for parents to be able to reach their kids at any given time. And we\u2019ve all felt like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction when she declared,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m NOT going to be ignored.\u201d\n\nTired of being constantly ignored by her kids, Sharon Standifird, a mom from Houston, Texas decided she\u2019d had enough. So what did this mom do? According to The Independent, Standifird consulted with designers and developers, and after a few short months, created the ingenious app called, \u201cIgnore No More.\u201d\n\nParents would be wise to forego their latte this week and fork out the inexpensive $1.99 to purchase this fantastic new app available on android, with the iPhone version quick on its heels.\n\n\n\nAccording to Uproxx, \u201cIgnore No More\u201d is an easy to install app. Standifird says, \u2018It takes away texting, it takes away gaming, it takes away calling their friends.\u201d\n\nOnce your child\u2019s phone is locked, their smartphone screen goes completely blank, with the exception of a list of approved contacts. The child has two choices at that point, as per Uproxx. In order for them to be able to resume normal functions on their phone, they can either call their parent and kindly ask for the password to unlock the phone, or they can call 911.\n\nSharon Standifird, parents all over the United States now love you! The Independent reveals the great reviews already posted at the Google Play Store regarding the \u201cIgnore No More\u201d app. One mom, Liane Parker, wrote,\n\n\u201cMy son hates it and I love it,\u201d while another mom, Kamiya Keyes Mewborn declares, \u201cLove the idea, even good for bedtime when you want them off the phone.\u201d\n\nThe fallout will no doubt be the mayhem caused by the grumpy teenagers who baulk at the idea of their parents having the control to lock their phones. Even Standifirds own son admitted, \u201cI thought it was a good idea, but for other people, not me,\u201d as reported by The Independent. Sounds like similar arguments about Obamacare. Is there an app for that?\n\nFrom all the thankful parents to Sharon Standifird \u2014 We give you a virtual high five.\n\nPhoto credit: Bizreport.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "At some point in time, most parents face the fact that their kids do not want to take their parent's calls, return their parent's calls or reply to their", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "At some point in time, most parents face the fact that their kids do not want to take their parent\u2019s calls, return their parent\u2019s calls or reply to their", "title": "New App Forces Kids To Return Mom Or Dad\u2019s Call (Video)", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1417892/nw-app-forces-kids-to-return-mom-or-dads-call-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cell.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T22:33:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-17T22:33:44+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cell.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-08-17T22:33:44+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "android,app,app for dad,app for mom,app that locks kids phone,cell phone,iphone,kids,lock your child\\'s phone,new app,teenagers,teens,mobile", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cell.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "At some point in time, most parents face the fact that their kids do not want to take their parent\u2019s calls, return their parent\u2019s calls or reply to their"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3cb\"", "article_summary": "Parents buy their kids phones for many reasons, but it\u2019s especially important for parents to be able to reach their kids at any given time.\nThe Independent reveals the great reviews already posted at the Google Play Store regarding the \u201cIgnore No More\u201d app.\nSharon Standifird, parents all over the United States now love you!\nAt some point in time, most parents face the fact that their kids do not want to take their parent\u2019s calls, return their parent\u2019s calls or reply to their parent\u2019s texts.\nAnd we\u2019ve all felt like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction when she declared,\u201cI\u2019m NOT going to be ignored.\u201dTired of being constantly ignored by her kids, Sharon Standifird, a mom from Houston, Texas decided she\u2019d had enough."}
