Two people were arrested Friday afternoon when officers found them stripping stolen cars in southeast Wichita. One suspect is still on the loose.

Officers were called around 4:30 p.m. to the report of suspicious characters in the 2600 block of South Roosevelt, near Pawnee and George Washington Boulevard.

Sgt. Brian Sigman said when officers arrived, they found three males, ages 16, 18 and 20, stripping two cars that were reported stolen. When officers approached, the three suspects took off.

The 16- and 20-year-old were taken into custody, but police are still searching for the 18-year-old man.

After the arrests, police found a third stolen vehicle nearby.

The 16-year-old was booked for possession of stolen property, possession of marijuana and obstruction.

The 20-year-old faces charges of possession of stolen property and obstruction.

Sgt. Sigman did not provide a description of the third suspect.
