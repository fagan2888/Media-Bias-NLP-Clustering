A notorious computer hacker who goes by “Weev” has taken credit for a flurry of anti-Semitic and racist fliers that have been mysteriously appearing on printers at over a dozen colleges.

Weev, whose real name is Andrew Auernheimer, told The New York Times that he sent the fliers to every publicly accessible printer in North America and was not intending to target college campuses.

But the fliers caused a stir in the higher education world, which has been embroiled in debates over racial sensitivity and racially motivated incidents.

Auernheimer’s fliers fed into these tensions, as they were covered in swastikas and mentioned “the struggle for global white supremacy.”

“White man, are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy?” the poster declared.

The flier then directed people to the The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website.

Auernheimer told the Times that free speech concerns had driven his act of protest.

“My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners,” he said.

The printings, which occurred at campuses across the country, came at difficult times for several of the schools.

Princeton University received the fliers only months after the Black Justice League, an activist group, led a sit-in that called for former President Woodrow Wilson’s name to be removed from campus buildings because of his racist views and policies.

The posters also appeared at Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Northeastern University, DePaul University, the University of Southern California, the University of Massachusetts and the University of California, Berkeley, among others.

Auernheimer gained notoriety in 2010, when he was part of a group of hackers that cracked into AT&T’s servers and accessed 114,000 customers’ data.
