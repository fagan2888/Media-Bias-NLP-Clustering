Bruce Braley, who has a 100% pro-abortion voting record in Congress. Ernst opposes using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion and supports the legislation that prohibits abortion after 20 weeks on the basis that these children are capable of feeling excruciating pain.\n\nBruce Braley voted against H.R. 7 \u2013 the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act \u2013 which would prohibit taxpayer funding of abortion by codifying the principles of the Hyde Amendment on a permanent, government-wide basis. Braley also voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks based on the scientific evidence that unborn children are capable of feeling pain.\n\nBraley\u2019s pro-abortion position is so extreme that he is a co-sponsor of H.R. 3471, which can most accurately be described as the \u201cAbortion Until Birth Protection Act.\u201d This is an extreme bill that, if enacted, would invalidate nearly all state limitations on abortion, including Iowa\u2019s two laws that protect individuals and private hospitals from being compelled to provide or participate in abortions.\n\nBruce Braley voted to enact Obamacare, which provides government funding for health plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will result in rationing of lifesaving medical treatments. Joni Ernst is needed in the U.S. Senate to help reverse the abortion-expanding and rationing effects of that law.\n\n\u201cThe most vulnerable members of our human family will be well served by Joni Ernst\u2019s election to the U.S. Senate,\u201d said Tobias.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iowa Senate Candidate Joni Ernst Gets Support From Pro-Lifers", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Today, the National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest pro-life group in the nation, endorsed Iowa state Senator Joni Ernst in her campaign for U.S", "title": "Iowa Senate Candidate Joni Ernst Gets Support From Pro-Lifers", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/06/17/iowa-senate-candidate-joni-ernst-gets-support-from-pro-lifers/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/joniernst-190x115.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "iowa senate candidate joni ernst gets support from pro-lifers", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa7c\"", "article_summary": "Joni Ernst is needed in the U.S. Senate to help reverse the abortion-expanding and rationing effects of that law.\nToday, the National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest pro-life group in the nation, endorsed Iowa state Senator Joni Ernst in her campaign for U.S. Senate.\n\u201cAs a state senator, Joni Ernst has been an outspoken leader in the fight to protect innocent human life in Iowa,\u201d said Carol Tobias, National Right to Life president.\nBruce Braley voted against H.R.\n\u201cThe most vulnerable members of our human family will be well served by Joni Ernst\u2019s election to the U.S. Senate,\u201d said Tobias."}
