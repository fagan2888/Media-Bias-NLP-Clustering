RED CLIFF, Colo. (AP) — An Eagle County town already popular among backcountry skiers and snowmobilers is considering building an outdoor ice-climbing park.

The town of Red Cliff is hoping the ice-climbing park will draw more visitors. Vail Daily reports (http://bit.ly/1r3Xh4n ) that the town wants to have the park open just three or four months a year, coming down in warmer months. It would be suitable for beginners.

Red Cliff Mayor Scott Burgess says the climbing park would be the second biggest ice-climbing park in the country behind Ouray. The $250,000 plan awaits a vote by the board of trustees. Avon-based Apex Mountain Guides and other private investors would pay for construction.

If the ice-climbing park is approved, it could be open by the winter of 2015-16.
