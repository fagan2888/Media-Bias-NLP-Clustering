Burwell. The plaintiffs argue that Obamacare subsidies can only go to people in states that created their own state exchanges, which would mean millions of people who get an insurance plan from the federal healthcare.gov exchange would be ineligible.\n\nThe Obama administration and other Democrats contend the language was just a drafting order. But recently unearthed comments by Gruber, an MIT economist who consulted in drafting the Affordable Care Act, imply a more literal meaning.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits \u2026 I hope that that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges, and that they\u2019ll do it.\u201d Gruber said in January 2012.\n\nThe court documents refer to a YouTube video at the 32-minute mark:\n\nThe plaintiff brief goes on to identify how Gruber is characterized by media reports as a \u201ckey architect\u201d of the Affordable Care Act who was paid \u201cclose to $400,000 as a consultant\u201d by the Department of Health and Human Services during 2009 and 2010, according to a Nov. 15 New York Times story. Another Times article on March 29 said Gruber helped congressional staff \u201cdraft the specifics of the legislation.\u201d\n\nGruber made news earlier this year about for talking about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d in selling Obamacare.\n\nDemocrats have warned that $65 billion in funding could be at stake in the lawsuit, The Hill reported.\n\nThe high court will hear the case on March 4, 2015.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset of this case we have argued that the Obamacare statute clearly limits subsidies to exchanges established by states,\u201d Michael Carving, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in in a statement, according to The Hill. \u201c[Our position] is further supported by factors ranging from the law\u2019s legislative history and lower court rulings to Jonathan Gruber\u2019s recently rediscovered statements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber is on the record in a Supreme Court case that could unravel parts of Obamacare.
