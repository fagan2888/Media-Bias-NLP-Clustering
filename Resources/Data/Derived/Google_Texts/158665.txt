President Barack Obama last week signed into law an omnibus tax and spending bill that pauses the medical device tax for 2 years, hours after the U.S. Senate approved the $1.8 trillion measure on a 65-33 vote.

The 2-year pause on the medical device tax, a 2.3% levy on all U.S. sales of medical devices, is estimated to cost $3.4 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

“I’m not wild about everything in it,” Obama said during press conference Dec. 18. “I’m sure that’s true for everybody. But it is a budget that, as I insisted, invests in our military and our middle class without ideological provisions that would have weakened Wall Street reform or rules on big polluters.”

The law also enshrines a research & development tax credit worth$113 billion over 10 years.

The medical device industry has fought tooth-and-nail against the tax since it was 1st floated as a way to fund the Affordable Care Act. Since then, numerous bills to do away with it have circulated on Capitol Hill, including the “Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015,” sponsored by Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), that the CBO evaluated last summer. In June, 46 Democrats joined the vote to approve the Paulsen measure; in August, the Senate said it would take up a companion measure before the end of the year, although those plans might be obviated if the omnibus spending package goes through.

Estimates of the impact of the medical device tax have varied wildly since its 1st airing in 2009; 4 years of political deadlock, which included a federal government shutdown over the issue, have done little to add clarity. Federal government officials have projected that the tax will raise about$30 billion over 10 years. Back in July 2013 a report released by a coalition of medical device lobbying groups estimated that the tax had cost the industry $1 billion during the 1st 6 months of that year.
