Their news divisions are not in-depth information sources. By its very nature, TV is a superficial medium of quick sound bites with no time to explain or probe. The people hired to present the product reflect that.\n\nIn the Republican debates, the Fox and CNN anchors seeking quick 20-second video clips had an easy time of it because of the overpowering presence of Donald Trump. He is a creation of mass media. He shot from the hip to create sound bites and forced others to respond in kind, giving the networks the melodrama they sought.\n\nThe only strong moments directly addressing issues came when candidates stole the microphone to assert themselves and address them.\n\nOne came when Trump and Carly Fiorina got into a schoolyard shouting match over who had the worst business failures. Chris Christie grabbed the mic and told them both to shut up because the kitchen table issues affecting the average middle class bread-earner were more important to address than which of the two had a better personal business career.\n\nThe other strong moment was when Trump got into it with Jeb Bush over speaking Spanish. Bush stammered through a demand for an apology to his Mexican wife, with whom he speaks the language at home, but never could explain why he did interviews in the language.\n\nMarco Rubio grabbed the microphone and turned it into a brilliant policy statement that Bush missed. He noted that he grew up learning Spanish from his grandfather. If a segment of voters chose to get their primary information in that language, he said, \u201cbetter they hear it from me directly than to depend on the Univision interpreter.\u201d\n\nTry as they might, media won\u2019t get a WWE knockdown from the Democrat debate. Hillary Clinton does not want to debate at all and will stick to stilted scripted answers to play it safe. Bernie Sanders is an ideological standard-bearer who would rather discuss arcane government process than tussle personally with Clinton.\n\nThe debate format is flawed. If they were true debates, the moderators should have been unnoticeable in the process. They should have asked issues questions and gone around the stage for each candidate to answer so that voters could compare and contrast their various approaches to governing.\n\nInstead, the moderators took about 25 percent of the air time, and they zeroed-in with individualized gotcha questions. Were we watching a media interview program or an inter-candidate political debate?\n\nCredit our friends north of the border for getting it right. The three major Canadian party leaders are holding debates leading up to the Oct. 19 parliamentary elections.\n\nThe moderator was Toronto Globe and Mail editor-in-chief David Walmsley, a traditional journalist instead of media celebrity. He would bring up an issue, phrase the question to all three and then sit back and let them interact.\n\nI watched one event from Calgary online and learned more about the real thinking on substantive issues of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau (son of the former prime minister) than I have as a U.S. citizen about those who want to be my president.\n\nWhat passed for personal attacks were not the nasty insults we\u2019ve seen here. They were more on the order of colorful turns of phrase to make a point.\n\nFor instance, Mulcair attacked the prime minister\u2019s over-reliance on the energy sector to bail Canada out of recession and remarked, \u201cMr. Harper put all of his eggs in one basket and then dropped the basket.\u201d\n\nWhen Trudeau described the NDP universal child care program as amounting to ineffective \u201cpuffs of smoke,\u201d Mulcair, hinting at Trudeau\u2019s support for marijuana decriminalization, merely replied wryly, \u201cYou know a little about that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThere were few moments like that. Cute sound bites were rare. The three political leaders were there to inform, not entertain.\n\nWe could return civility and depth into our own American political debates. The first step would be to return the formats to issues instead of personalities. And then assign real journalists rather than media egos to moderate.\n\nVic Berardelli is a retired political consultant and author of \u201cThe Politics Guy Campaign Tips \u2013 How to Win a Local Election.\u201d Now an independent unenrolled registered voter, he a former Republican State Committeeman and former member of the National Board of the Republican Liberty Caucus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Democrats hold their first debate next week, only the personal traits of the two main participants will prevent it from reaching the lows of the recent GOP debates.
