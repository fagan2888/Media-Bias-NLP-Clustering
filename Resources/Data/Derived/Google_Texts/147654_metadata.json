Greece has no major debt redemptions due until July.\n\nThe Greek government interpreted the leak as revealing an IMF effort to blackmail Athens with a possible credit event to force it to give in on pension cuts which it has rejected.\n\nHowever the transcript, if genuine, appeared to suggest Thomsen saw more prospect of the IMF applying pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to concede debt relief to keep the fund involved in the bailout and secure Greek cooperation in managing Europe's pressing refugee crisis.\n\n\"Basically we at that time say \"Look, you Mrs Merkel you face a question, you have to think about what is more costly: to go ahead without the IMF, would the Bundestag say 'The IMF is not on board'? or to pick the debt relief that we think that Greece needs in order to keep us on board?\" Right? That is really the issue,\" Thomsen was quoted as saying.\n\nCommenting on the leak, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told weekly newspaper Ethnos: \"It seems that some people are playing games with an aim to destabilize us. We will not allow (IMF's) Thomsen to destroy Europe.\"\n\n(Reporting Lefteris Papadimas in Athens and David Lawder in Washington; Editing by Paul Taylor and Helen Popper)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece demanded an explanation from the International Monetary Fund", "title": "Greece demands IMF explanation over leaked debt transcript", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/02/Greece-demands-IMF-explanation-over-leaked-debt-transcript", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ozabs-uk-malawi-imf_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/02/Greece-demands-IMF-explanation-over-leaked-debt-transcript", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ozabs-uk-malawi-imf_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece demanded an explanation from the International Monetary Fund", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "or to pick the debt relief that we think that Greece needs in order to keep us on board?\"\nTSIPRAS SAYS IMF 'PLAYING GAMES'The purported conversation involved Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF's Europe department, and Delia Velculescu, leader of the IMF team in Greece, and IMF official Iva Petrova.\nATHENS (Reuters) - Greece demanded an explanation from the International Monetary Fund on Saturday after an apparent leaked transcript suggested the IMF may threaten to pull out of the country's bailout as a tactic to force European lenders to more offer debt relief.\nIf concluded the review will unlock a fresh tranche of about 5 billion euros, which Greece needs to pay off state arrears and ECB and IMF maturing debt.\nThey also suggest that Brussels is sticking to unrealistic assumptions about Greece's budget shortfall to minimize the need for debt relief, which is unpopular with Germany and other northern euro zone hawks."}
