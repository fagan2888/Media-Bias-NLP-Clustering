Or maybe even a \u201cGoing Out of Business\u201d sale.\n\nThe list of dramatic markdowns is breathtaking. They include trading away five murderous terrorists for a likely Army deserter, an open invitation to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants to cross the Mexican border, and a decision to recognize the terrorist group Hamas as part of the Palestinian government.\n\nOn the home front, environmental regulations will cost thousands of coal miners their jobs and drive up the cost of electricity for millions. The ObamaCare mess is hardly resolved, and the Veterans Affairs scandal keeps getting worse. The acting agency head reported the deaths of 18 more vets who were kept off the official waiting list in Phoenix.\n\nTicking quietly in the background is the mother of all threats \u2014 an Iranian nuclear bomb. That ticking grew louder last week as the ayatollah mocked our nation by standing in front of a banner that proclaimed, \u201cAmerica cannot do a damn thing.\u201d\n\nTechnically, he\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s not that we cannot stop the mad mullahs\u2019 march. It\u2019s that President Obama has taken the military option off the table, and without it, Iran has nothing to fear. Our impotence was a choice.\n\nAdd to the combustible mix the expansionist moods in Russia and China, and the series of events recalls an observation by the late economist Herb Stein. Speaking in another context, he said that, \u201cIf something can\u2019t go on forever, it won\u2019t.\u201d That sums up the current sense of the nation as a whole.\n\nWhat seemed for years a steady and slow decline increasingly feels like a headlong race to the bottom. America is careening downhill, and a crack-up appears inevitable.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the deal with the Taliban to release five terrorist leaders from Guantanamo brought the first threat of presidential impeachment from a respected member of Congress. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that if Obama tried to release others without lawmakers\u2019 approval, it would lead to \u201cpeople on our side calling for his impeachment.\u201d\n\nThat is the nuclear option, and there is good reason why it has been so rarely invoked throughout history. And yet the intense fever gripping Washington, largely created by Obama\u2019s go-it-alone approach, needs to be broken. The country simply cannot continue to remain the beacon of the free world if we are consumed by our own dysfunction and distrust.\n\nImpeachment is one way to try to resolve a political crisis, but as former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy argues in his new book, public opinion is a vital ingredient, and it is missing. Titled \u201cFaithless Execution,\u201d his book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cBuilding the Political Case for Obama\u2019s Impeachment,\u201d is based on McCarthy\u2019s claim that the legal case is solid that Obama has violated his oath to execute the laws faithfully.\n\nThat\u2019s an arguable point, but even to concede it means nothing because the Democratic Party has been so cowed into supporting Obama, regardless of what he does, that there is no chance to make the political case.\n\nIndeed, we have reached this crisis largely because centrist Democrats have failed to stand up against Obama and demand more moderate policies.\n\nLeaving aside occasional grumbling from party elders, he gets \u00adalmost unanimous support from every Dem in Congress for every piece of his radical agenda. Evidence shows that one of his most pernicious practices, using the IRS to punish conservative groups, grew out of congressional demands from liberals. While that doesn\u2019t excuse Obama\u2019s role, it does demonstrate that his party has enabled and encouraged his improper conduct.\n\nThe result is that the constitutional system of checks and balances has been gutted as Democrats act as an amen chorus for the executive branch.\n\nThe framers put a high bar on impeachment, and merely attempting to draw up the articles is viable only when there is a bipartisan consensus that the president\u2019s immediate removal is necessary. We are a long way from that consensus.\n\nStill, something has to give. And unless Democrats begin to put duty to country over loyalty to Obama, America as we know it is headed to a point of no return.\n\nPol-pal unions wal the shots\n\nAfter reading the City Council letter demanding that Walmart stop giving money to city charities, it\u2019s easy to conclude the council members are misguided, mistaken or just plain nuts.\n\nThey may be all of those things, but they are something else, too: They are union puppets who have sold their souls for votes.\n\nThe 26 council members who signed the letter \u2014 a majority of the entire body \u2014 claim that Walmart and the Walton Family Foundation are trying to \u201cfind a foothold in New York City\u201d by buying \u201cinfluence and support.\u201d\n\nShrinks would call that projection \u2014 accusing others of your own sins. Or maybe it just takes a sellout to know a sellout.\n\nWhatever its motives, Walmart is doing something good with its philanthropy and ought to be applauded.\n\nIt announced that it distributed $3 million last year, including $1 million to the New York Women\u2019s Foundation, which offers job training, and $30,000 to Bailey House, which provides support to low-income residents with HIV/AIDS.\n\nFaced with such generosity, council members demanded that it \u201cstop spending your dangerous dollars in our city\u201d and added: \u201cThat\u2019s right: this is a cease-and-desist letter.\u201d\n\nTsk, tsk. The issue is that unions don\u2019t want Walmart\u2019s non-union competition, and the scandal is that local pols blocked the company from opening a single store in the five boroughs. Never mind that New Yorkers would benefit from new jobs and low prices on a wide array of products.\n\nAlmost as shameful, Mayor Bill de Blasio voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the issue. Asked by reporters, he declined to take a stance on the letter.\n\nApparently he wants to confront inequality only when it means keeping unions happy. Otherwise, the poor can take a hike.\n\nSalute to the heroes of D-Day\n\nThe importance of the D-Day invasion cannot be overstated, but its meaning becomes more easily understood during times of global chaos, such as the one we live in now. The 70th anniversary, then, captured both the magnitude of the unmatched operation and the stakes that led so many young men to bravely face the German guns.\n\nTo fully appreciate their courage, make yourself a promise. Promise that, before you die, you will go to Normandy. Promise that you will stand on the beach, climb into the bomb craters and bunkers and that, most of all, you will walk quietly through the cemeteries, which hold the remains of 9,386 Americans.\n\nMy promise is that you will never regret your visit, nor will you ever forget those brave souls.\n\nGoop in the water\n\nGwyneth Paltrow says water has feelings.
