Does she decide to keep her baby and do her immature best to raise it, or choose adoption for her offspring?\n\nThat quandary anchors the season finale of CBS\u2019 \u201cMom\u201d (9:30 p.m. EDT, Monday) a freshman sitcom that has balanced punch lines and pathos in tackling alcoholism, cancer, broken families and other weighty themes.\n\nAny one of them would have fitted what TV sitcoms once somberly heralded as \u201ca very special episode,\u201d but they are the bread-and-butter of \u201cMom,\u201d starring Anna Faris and Allison Janney.\n\nIt\u2019s a daring approach and, given its lineage, a surprising one: \u201cMom\u201d was hatched by Chuck Lorre, the executive producer behind \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d a show that traffics in superficial raunchiness, and the smartly frothy \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d\n\nThe women of \u201cMom\u201d are winning but brittle and complex characters, deftly played by Faris as Christy, the mother of 16-year-old Violet (Sadie Calvano) and a son (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) from another relationship, and Janney as Bonnie, Christy\u2019s mom and a soul mate in battling alcoholism.\n\n\u201cMom\u201d has its own comedic pacing as well as content. Laughs are delivered at a pace more measured than that of a typical sitcom, giving emotions time to rise and fall convincingly.\n\nFor Lorre, \u201cMom\u201d represents a return to the kind of real-life nuance that he explored in the early 1990s as a writer on \u201cRoseanne\u201d and in a sitcom he created about another single mom with addiction issues, \u201cGrace Under Fire.\u201d\n\nHe got \u201cturned in a different direction,\u201d as Lorre put it, with his hits \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d (which developed its own real-life subplot, ex-star Charlie Sheen\u2019s ugly public clash with Lorre and Warner Bros. Television) and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d which Lorre created and produces with Eddie Gorodetsky and Gemma Baker, was the way back. The show, which ranked No. 20 in recent weekly ratings among advertiser-favored young adult viewers, has been renewed for next season.\n\n\u201cI really wanted \u2018Mom\u2019 to be an opportunity to take chances, to see if storytelling and character development could be expanded, and maintain the promise that it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d Lorre said.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201chigh concept\u201d and nothing remotely funny in breast cancer or seeing your mom relapse into alcoholism, he said, \u201cbut the challenge of it, it seemed worth trying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chuck Lorre\u2019s sitcom \u2018Mom\u2019 adopts serious tone", "title": "Chuck Lorre\u2019s sitcom \u2018Mom\u2019 adopts serious tone", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Chuck Lorre\u2019s sitcom \u2018Mom\u2019 adopts serious tone", "title": "Chuck Lorre\u2019s sitcom \u2018Mom\u2019 adopts serious tone", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/chuck_lorres_sitcom_mom_adopts_serious_tone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/tv-mom-adoption.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chuck Lorre\u2019s sitcom \u2018Mom\u2019 adopts serious tone", "title": "Chuck Lorre\u2019s sitcom \u2018Mom\u2019 adopts serious tone", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/tv-mom-adoption.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynn Elber", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Laughs are delivered at a pace more measured than that of a typical sitcom, giving emotions time to rise and fall convincingly.\nDoes she decide to keep her baby and do her immature best to raise it, or choose adoption for her offspring?\nThere\u2019s no \u201chigh concept\u201d and nothing remotely funny in breast cancer or seeing your mom relapse into alcoholism, he said, \u201cbut the challenge of it, it seemed worth trying.\u201d\nThat quandary anchors the season finale of CBS\u2019 \u201cMom\u201d (9:30 p.m. EDT, Monday) a freshman sitcom that has balanced punch lines and pathos in tackling alcoholism, cancer, broken families and other weighty themes.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A pregnant teenager, the daughter of an unmarried mother and granddaughter of another, is repeating family history."}
