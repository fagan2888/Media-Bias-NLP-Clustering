Denver’s warm weather this weekend could give way to a chance for spring snow Monday.

The National Weather Service is calling for a 50 percent chance of rain showers and thunderstorms Sunday afternoon with a 70 percent chance of precipitation later at night, with rain turning to snow early Monday morning.

Rainfall could be heavy Sunday night.

Current snow estimates predict little accumulation in the metro area, but there’s a chance for “several inches” in the mountains, according to the weather service.

Monday’s high temperature in Denver would also drop to about 57 degrees.

In the meantime, Denver will see a high temperature of 71 Saturday. A slight chance for rain and thunderstorms Saturday afternoon also exists.
