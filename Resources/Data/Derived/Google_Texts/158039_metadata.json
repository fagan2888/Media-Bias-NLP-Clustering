In recent years, the former President has proclaimed himself a vegan, attributing his renewed energy and slimmer body to his plant-based diet. Just one problem: His latest interview about his diet noted that he eats fish and eggs \"once a week or so.\"\n\nThe background: Former President Clinton told AARP magazine that he's lost weight by following a vegan diet. In the interview published in the August/September issue of the magazine, he chirped, \"I\u2019ve stopped eating meat, cheese, milk, even fish. No dairy at all ... I have so much more energy now! I feel great.\u201d\n\nGet insights from Yale MD on what the best diet is for weight loss and health by clicking here.\n\nFormer President Clinton even recommended that the nation follow his plant-based politics, declaring that \"the way we consume food and what we consume\u201d are linked to rising health care costs. After setting himself up as a purist vegan diet role model, he then casually noted that \"once a week or so\" he eats salmon or an omelet, which he claims is necessary to \"maintain iron, zinc and muscle mass.\" Oops.\n\nWhy the brouhaha in the vegan boardroom over this statement? Because of the distinction between following a vegan lifestyle and a plant-based diet. Veganism is clear-cut: No animal products of any kind - and sorry, Mr. President, but that includes those eggs that made your omelet and the fishy in your serving of salmon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You've heard the expression \"Walk your talk?\" Well, people want former President Bill Clinton to follow a diet in line with his talk.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/egg-on-his-face-vegan-bill-clinton-admits-to-eating-omelets-and-salmon", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/83/ee/83ee1a1281c29a3e9c7f651aaa4b074c.jpg?itok=r8mzQxOG", "type": "article", "title": "Egg on his face: 'Vegan' Bill Clinton admits to eating omelets and salmon"}, "twitter": {"description": "You've heard the expression \"Walk your talk?\" Well, people want former President Bill Clinton to follow a diet in line with his talk.", "creator": "@trendclues", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary", "title": "Egg on his face: 'Vegan' Bill Clinton admits to eating omelets and salmon"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-09-08T08:38:59-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "General Health, diets, Bill Clinton, Weight Loss & Dieting, Health & Fitness", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-08T08:38"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The background: Former President Clinton told AARP magazine that he's lost weight by following a vegan diet.\nBecause of the distinction between following a vegan lifestyle and a plant-based diet.\nIn recent years, the former President has proclaimed himself a vegan, attributing his renewed energy and slimmer body to his plant-based diet.\nWell, people want former President Bill Clinton to follow a diet in line with his talk.\nFormer President Clinton even recommended that the nation follow his plant-based politics, declaring that \"the way we consume food and what we consume\u201d are linked to rising health care costs."}
