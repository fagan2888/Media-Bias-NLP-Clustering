Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush was brought by ambulance to a hospital in Houston on Tuesday night, a precautionary measure after experiencing shortness of breath, his office said in a statement.

The 41st President ”will be held for observation, again as a precaution” at Houston Methodist Hospital, the statement said.

The White House said in a separate statement that President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have been made aware of Bush’s hospitalization. The two “send their good wishes to the former President and the entire Bush family during this holiday season,” read the statement.

Bush, who is 90-years-old, recently celebrated his ninth decade by skydiving under a red, white and blue parachute.
