The attorney representing homeowner Ken Row says the mansion should be out of foreclosure long before that.\n\nDax Richard says his client is in the process of paying off the delinquent loan \u2014 reinstatement, as it\u2019s known. Says Richard, \u201cthe new date is Contingency Plan B if the reinstatement doesn\u2019t get done. But I have no reason believe it won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nRichard explains how the 90-year-old home wound up in foreclosure in the first place: Row, he says, \u201cwas trying to get a better interest rate and used tactics that have been obsolete since the 2008 housing crisis, which is to withhold payment.\u201d Clearly, that was a terrible idea. Says Richard, Row realized that, as did Chase, which is now working to settle the matter before the house lands on the auction block. \u201cThe bank very fairly \u2014 and that\u2019s not a word you use with banks a lot \u2014 made a business decision, just like [Row] was trying to make a business decision,\u201d Richard says, \u201cand they shipped him the reinstatement paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe house may still wind up on the market sooner than later. If Row doesn\u2019t get it out of foreclosure, then expect a crowd at the George Allen on August 4. And if he does, well, who knows. Want to buy a house on Stevens Park?\n\nRow, says Richard, \u201chand-selects every flower in that garden, and you don\u2019t take care of something like that with the intention of having it foreclosed. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do going forward. All the attention has perked up his ears.\u201d\n\nOriginal post July 4 at 8:58 a.m.: A virtual browse through Auction.com\u2019s listings reveals one hellacious deal in Oak Cliff: 1704 W. Colorado Blvd., a 90-year-old estate overlooking Stevens Park Golf Course. Per the listing and the county website, the 4,301-square-foot manse hits the auction block Tuesday at 10 a.m. on the north side of the George Allen Courts Building downtown. The estimated opening bid for this foreclosure: a good-God $560,000, or close to half of its market value according to the Dallas Central Appraisal District. (For what it\u2019s worth, Homes.com values the house at $1,183,700.)\n\nA quick skim through The Google Machine reveals The Advocate actually found the find first, back on June 22. We also discovered a few other things, among them: It\u2019s known as the Floreciendo Garden Estate, houses one of Dallas\u2019 few private gardens, rents out for parties (Rachel Stone says that doesn\u2019t sit well with the neighbors), has been a big player during The Garden Conservancy\u2019s Open Day tour and was listed among D\u2018s 10 Most Beautiful Homes in Dallas back in 2009.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of virtual tours available for those in need of some July 4 home-tour porn. Here you go. And here. And here. And for those who like to kick the tires before purchase, here\u2019s a recent permit history.\n\nBest I can tell from our archives it was built by one James Robert Binford in 1925; according to our archives it was quite the party house even then. A March 1, 1929, headline reads \u201cMrs. J.R. Binford Entertains With Tea,\u201d and merely lists some of the 300 guests in attendances, among them women all the way from \u2026 New York City.\n\nAs Jennifer Mitten notes in the comments, Mrs. J.R. Binford was Estelle Zang \u2014 daughter of early Oak Cliff developer John F. Zang, the boulevard\u2019s namesake.\n\nOne warning: This is a \u201cCash Only Purchase.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA3LzkwLXllYXItb2xkLW9hay1jbGlmZi1lc3RhdGUtb25lLW9mLWRhbGxhcy1tb3N0LWJlYXV0aWZ1bC1ob21lcy1oaXRzLWF1Y3Rpb24tYmxvY2stdHVlc2RheS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 12:20 p.m. at July 6: If you spent the weekend trying to raise the pile of cash needed to buy one of the \"10 Most Beautiful Homes in\u2026", "title": "Update: Owner of 90-year-old Oak Cliff mansion trying to save house now set for August auction", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/07/90-year-old-oak-cliff-estate-one-of-dallas-most-beautiful-homes-hits-auction-block-tuesday.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/07/1704Colorado.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-06T12:41:58Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca929\"", "article_summary": "Says Richard, Row realized that, as did Chase, which is now working to settle the matter before the house lands on the auction block.\nIf Row doesn\u2019t get it out of foreclosure, then expect a crowd at the George Allen on August 4.\nSays Richard, \u201cthe new date is Contingency Plan B if the reinstatement doesn\u2019t get done.\nThe attorney representing homeowner Ken Row says the mansion should be out of foreclosure long before that.\nThe law firm holding the note on the Kessler Park mansion now says the sale\u2019s been moved to August 4."}
