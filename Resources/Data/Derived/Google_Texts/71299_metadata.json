That old stinking dead corpse of Marxism, liberal fascism and evolution atheism under Obama has put on new clothes called Obamacare, fighting against 'income inequality' and 'fundamentally transforming America.' Our forefathers like Reagan called it socialism, fascism and voluntary slavery... I call it The Progressive Revolution In his famous speech given in support for Barry Goldwater who was running against LBJ, Reagan with a prophetic wisdom looked down through the ages a saw the demagogue Obama and his abomination, Obamacare, and observed that \"the doctor's fight against socialized medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without socializing the patients.\") Thank you very much. Thank you and good evening. The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks. I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used \"'We've never had it so good.'\"Reagan went on to declare, \"No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income.\".... Remember Reagan was an FDR New Deal democrat who after 30 years of being a witness to failed socialism programs which destroyed the human spirit including the advent of LBJ's Great Slave Society, he eventually saw the light, switched from the Democrat Socialist Party to becoming a Republican and started embracing free market capitalism in every aspect of society \u2013 philosophic, economic, and political.Reagan spoke: \"As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us. We are at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it has been said if we lose that war, and in doing so lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening. Well, I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.\"What \"war\" is Reagan referencing here? \u2013 Yes, Vietnam, Russia, Cuba \u2013 but metaphorically he is referring to the existential Cold War waged against our natural rights, natural law and liberty by the Democrat Socialist Party. This eternal war against God, natural law, natural rights and the Framers will deconstruct America as we know her unless we marginalize and remove from office those politicians, judges, intellectuals who support socialism and progressivism.Reagan thundered that, \"This is the last stand on Earth. And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except to sovereign people, is still the newest and most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is the issue of this election. Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.\"\"You and I are told increasingly that we have to choose between a left or right, but I would like to suggest that there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down \u2013 up to a man's age-old dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order \u2013 or down to the ant heap totalitarianism, and regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course,\" Reagan said.\"In this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \"Great Society,\" or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a \"greater government activity in the affairs of the people.\" But they have been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves \u2013 and all of the things that I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say \"the Cold War will end through acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.\" Another voice says that the profit motive has become outmoded, it must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state; or our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.\"\"Senator Fulbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the president as our moral teacher and our leader, and he said he is hobbled in his task by the restrictions in power imposed on him by this antiquated document. He must be freed so that he can do for us what he knows is best. And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as \"meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government.\" Well, I for one resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me \u2013 the free man and woman of this country \u2013 as \"the masses.\" This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, \"the full power of centralized government\" \u2013 this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy,\" Reagan further said ....Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us that they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. ... We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion now in slavery behind the Iron Curtain, \"Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skin, we are willing to make a deal with your slave masters.\" Alexander Hamilton said, \"A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.\" Let's set the record straight. There is no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace \u2013 and you can have it in the next second \u2013 surrender\". ...Reagan concluded, \"You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, 'There is a price we will not pay.' There is a point beyond which they must not advance. This is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's \"peace through strength.\" Winston Churchill said that \"the destiny of man is not measured by material computation. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we are spirits \u2013 not animals.\" And he said, \"There is something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty.\" \"You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or we will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness. We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny. Thank you very much.\" ENDThis speech, given by Ronald Reagan in 1964, could just as easily be given today and is just as applicable to our current, albeit worse, situation. It was as if Reagan was one of the Old Testament prophets like Moses, Isaiah or Jeremiah, urging this generation to be vigilant for just like in his time Reagan battled LBJ who launched the socialist Great Society revolution in 1964. Always prescient, Reagan predicted that another false prophet would later arise to steal more of your money and freedoms through confiscatory taxation, regulation and government mandates like Obamacare. Reagan was right. How tragic is it that America, this once great nation has failed to learn from our past, therefore we must revisit the tyranny of LBJ's Great Slave Society upon this generation while the Democrat Socialist Party prospers as America's enemy within.President Ronald Reagan, our greatest president of the twentieth century, was a lover of American exceptionalism and instinctively knew that socialized medicine was a communist trap and that socialism historically has always been a destroyer of the family, Christianity and capitalism as well a societal death sentence whatever form it was tried \u2013(Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Russia, China, N.Korea, Vietnam),(Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, the Nazis, South America),(Wilson, FDR, LBJ, Obama, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, America),(Middle East, Arab Nations). The communist/socialist genocide (i.e., democide-government sponsored death of citizens) in the twentieth century alone eclipses 260,000,000 million people according to Professor R.J. Rummel . Thus, Reagan's epic speech \"A Time for Choosing\" forces us to choose \u2013 fascism, socialism and death, vs. God, liberty and LIFE \u2013 which led him to the obvious conclusion: \"If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. [America] is the last stand on Earth.\"Please purchase my latest opus dedicated to that Conservative Colossus, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
