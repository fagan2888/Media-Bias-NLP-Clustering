Send your photographs to pics@tucsonnewsnow.com\n\nA supermoon lunar eclipse was seen in the Arizona skies Sunday night. Send your photographs to pics@tucsonnewsnow.com\n\nHundreds of millions of people caught a glimpse of the lunar eclipse on Sept. 27.\n\nBut due to the timing of the eclipse and clear weather, Arizona residents were treated to some of the best views in the world.\n\nMOBILE USERS: Photos from Tucson News Now viewers can be seen HERE.\n\nThe partial eclipse began over Arizona at 6:07 p.m., about two minutes before moon rise. That meant by the time many in Arizona saw the moon, it was already partially eclipsed. The total eclipse started around 7:11 p.m. and ended at 8:24 p.m. The event ended around 9:27 p.m., when the moon was fully visible again.\n\nNASA covered the eclipse and streamed it live online. Mobile users can watch some of the highlights HERE.\n\nDuring a lunar eclipse, the moon passes through the Earth's shadow, which blocks sunlight from reaching the visible side of the moon. For a short time during the eclipse, the moon turns a dark red color, which earns it the nickname 'blood moon.'\n\nThe eclipse coincided with a 'supermoon,' which means the moon was about as close to Earth as it gets. That made the moon look wider than usual.\n\nThe term 'supermoon' is not scientific, but instead was coined by an astrologer who defines it as when the moon is within 90 percent of its closest approach of Earth. The term gained popularity and is now commonly used when writing about the moon's journey around our planet. The scientific term for the moon's closest approach to Earth is 'perigee'. 'Apogee' is when the moon is farthest from the Earth during orbit.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
