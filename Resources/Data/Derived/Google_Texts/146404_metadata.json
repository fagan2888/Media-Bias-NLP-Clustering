I will miss him more than I can say.\n\nFLOYD NORRIS Notions on high and low finance.\n\nMr. Briloff was an accountant and accounting professor who cared deeply about, and was outraged by, the games accountants play. In the 1960s, he wrote an article in The Financial Analysts Journal detailing how companies could use \u201cpooling of interest accounting\u201d when they made acquisitions to hide costs and later create completely fraudulent profits. Few read it, I suspect, but one who did was Bob Bleiberg , the editor of Barron\u2019s. Steve Anreder, who was Abe\u2019s first editor at Barron\u2019s, says Mr. Bleiberg contacted Abe and asked him to write a piece for Barron\u2019s.\n\nOver the years he wrote dozens more, and became by far the most prominent accounting critic. His articles often caused stock prices to plunge, never to recover.\n\nNone of those articles ever had any information that was not already public. If you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, Abe should not have existed. But he did. What he did was tirelessly go through the financial statements and footnotes, and figure out how accounting rules were being abused.\n\nWhy did others not do that? After Abe, more did. But not enough.\n\nFor a few years in the 1980s, I was Abe\u2019s editor at Barron\u2019s. He became a close friend and inspiration. In recent years, when my New York Times columns appeared on Fridays, he was almost always the first caller when a column touched on accounting rules or audit failures.\n\nAt the end of his life, he was working on what could be done about student loans, which he saw as hobbling a generation of college graduates. He was an emeritus professor at Baruch College in New York, a school that gets hard-working students without a lot of family money.\n\nWhen a Briloff piece was published in Barron\u2019s, the immediate reaction from the company criticized was almost always to angrily protest that their accounting was completely proper and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. That response puzzled me, because the articles seldom alleged otherwise. Instead, they pointed out how the rules allowed misleading reports, and how the company in question had produced such.\n\nIt was not until 2001 that the Financial Accounting Standards Board finally killed pooling of interest accounting, which had enabled many companies, particularly conglomerates, to report profits that simply did not exist. If the rule-makers had acted after Abe first pointed out the abuses, a lot of investor losses would have been avoided.\n\nThe companies would also allege darkly that Abe must have shorted the stock, or at least be in league with the short-sellers. He was not. Abe was not motivated by a desire to get rich. He simply believed that accounting should tell, not obscure, the truth.\n\nIn fact, Abe often bought a few shares of companies he was studying, to make it easier to get shareholder reports in an age when they were not as readily available as they are now.\n\nAll this would be remarkable for any man. But I have left out one salient point: Abe was legally blind.\n\nHe was not completely blind. He could see enough to walk around, and he could write notes. He would send me comments on my editing on normal letter-size pieces of paper, with maybe two or three large-print lines scrawled across most of the page. When we were working on articles, he would come into Barron\u2019s offices in Lower Manhattan to discuss them.\n\nHe did not read the financial reports he dissected and then blasted. Instead, he had them read to him, often by graduate students. I was never present for those sessions, and perhaps the students resented having to be readers for an old man. But I suspect at least some of them learned a lot from listening to Abe\u2019s reaction to what he heard.\n\nI know I did. One of Abe\u2019s articles I edited for Barron\u2019s was about General Motors. It appeared in 1986. Abe chronicled how G.M. had gone from being the Tiffany\u2019s of accounting to using every legal gambit to make its earnings look better. He was particularly outraged by the way it accounted for some acquisitions. In his view, the fact that G.M. was doing those things was an indication that its real business was declining more rapidly than it wanted to admit.\n\nI don\u2019t remember all the details, but I vividly recall that there was one assertion he made that I simply could not see the support for, despite having gone through G.M.\u2019s financial statements for many hours, both with him and by myself. How, I asked him on the phone one day as publication neared, could he say that?\n\nHe responded immediately. If I looked at one footnote from G.M.\u2019s most recent annual report \u2014 he knew the number; I\u2019ll say it was footnote 32, but that could be wrong \u2014 and compared it to footnote 30 from two years earlier, I\u2019d understand. And he was right, even down to the footnote numbers. How, I wondered, could anyone remember such detail?\n\nSomehow, Abe never seemed to become cynical. When Enron was collapsing, and I and others were chronicling how it had abused accounting rules with the evident acquiescence of its auditors at Arthur Andersen, he sounded simply sad as we discussed the details. He talked longingly of Leonard Spacek, the man who had made Andersen the most-respected accounting firm, and wondered what had happened to the culture.\n\nAbe did not introduce me to accounting, or even to accounting games, but he taught me to love the role that accountants should play, and to resent those auditors who seem to think that they work for the people who hire them, not for the investors who depend on them.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131213174943, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Briloff, Abraham J (1917-2013)", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Floyd Norris", "published_time": 1386974983, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-12-17T00:17:55-05:00"}, "keywords": "Briloff Abraham J (1917-2013),Accounting and Accountants,Deaths (Obituaries),Barron's (Newspaper),Baruch College,accounting,Floyd Norris", "GBLC": "accounting;Floyd Norris", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Abe Briloff, an Accountant Who Saw Through the Games ( 20131213 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Floyd Norris", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Floyd Norris", "byl": "Floyd Norris", "twitter": {"description": "An appreciation of Abe Briloff, dead at 97, a prominent professor and accounting critic who dissected how the rules were being abused.", "title": "Abe Briloff, an Accountant Who Saw Through the Games", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/abe-briloff-an-accountant-who-saw-through-the-games/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002602725, "description": "An appreciation of Abe Briloff, dead at 97, a prominent professor and accounting critic who dissected how the rules were being abused.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 13, 2013", "org": "Barron's (Newspaper);Baruch College", "utime": 20131217001755, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131213, "pdate": 20131213, "des": "Accounting and Accountants;Deaths (Obituaries)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "An appreciation of Abe Briloff, dead at 97, a prominent professor and accounting critic who dissected how the rules were being abused.", "title": "Abe Briloff, an Accountant Who Saw Through the Games", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/abe-briloff-an-accountant-who-saw-through-the-games/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/abe-briloff-an-accountant-who-saw-through-the-games/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Abe Briloff, an Accountant Who Saw Through the Games", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 13, 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd65fc\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Briloff was an accountant and accounting professor who cared deeply about, and was outraged by, the games accountants play.\nWhat he did was tirelessly go through the financial statements and footnotes, and figure out how accounting rules were being abused.\nSteve Anreder, who was Abe\u2019s first editor at Barron\u2019s, says Mr. Bleiberg contacted Abe and asked him to write a piece for Barron\u2019s.\nIn recent years, when my New York Times columns appeared on Fridays, he was almost always the first caller when a column touched on accounting rules or audit failures.\nOne of Abe\u2019s articles I edited for Barron\u2019s was about General Motors."}
