Bernero says officials in Lansing "dug into" the city's water safety. "We expected direct answers and we expected positive answers and we didn't get them." Instead, Bernero said, they got "rather vague" answers about lead levels. "We looked into the testing procedures, and we were not convinced the water was safe."

What followed in Lansing was a 12 year project to remove about 14,000 lead water service lines, at a cost of $42 million dollars, and replace them with copper lines. The money to replace the pipes came from a capital improvement fund paid for by the utilities' customers through their water rates.

The program is scheduled to be completed next year.

"We started asking about lead, and what is the safe level of lead, and there isn't one, especially for kids," the mayor said. "So we said the prudent thing to do is to improve the testing and start getting these lead pipes out. Get the lead out."

Now Lansing is trying to help Flint follow their lead to "get the lead out," Bernero said. "Because we've done it in Lansing, we've sent our crews over to Flint."

He said that, along with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, they've designed a lead pipe replacement plan "where we think it can be done in a year, with about 30 crews and $55 million dollars." He added that pipe replacement could cost as little as "3 to 4 thousand dollars a home."

Bernero explains that's because instead of digging a huge trench from the street to each home, "we perfected a system of threading instead of trenching." That involves digging a hole by a house, then pulling up the lead pipes as copper pipe is pulled through.

"You thread it through like you would thread a needle. And it cut the time and money in half to replace these pipes," he said.
