But coupled with the currency change it could fan price increases and hit already strained pocketbooks.\n\n\"The devaluation will temporarily exacerbate inflation, thus contributing to rising discontent, while goods scarcity will worsen on the back of lower oil prices,\" said Risa Grais-Targow at consultancy Eurasia.\n\nThe increase is also insufficient to stem lucrative gasoline smuggling to neighboring Colombia and Guyana.\n\n\"The measures will provide some fiscal breathing room for PDVSA but are insufficient to reduce demand for imports or gasoline, failing to improve the government's supply of foreign exchange or prevent a default later this year,\" said Grais-Targow.\n\nWall Street investors are increasingly concerned about a potential default, with Venezuela facing some $10 billion in debt payments amid a major cash crunch.\n\nDEVALUATION, DIRE DATA\n\nThe devaluation will not significantly impact the remaining U.S. companies operating in Venezuela. Many decided long ago that the stronger exchange rates do not reflect reality and moved their accounts to weaker rates - writing off billions of dollars.\n\n, for instance, wrote off more than half a billion dollars in revenue last month. The change in fuel prices, however, will provide some relief to state-owned PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], which is facing major debt payments this year amid low oil prices. The company said in a statement that if consumption patterns remain the same as last year, some 68 billion bolivars - equivalent to $6.8 billion at the strongest official rate but just $68 million on the black market - will be saved. Venezuela's 91 octane gasoline will rise 1,329 percent to 1 bolivar per liter and 95 octane gasoline will rise 6,086 percent to 6 bolivars. Small queues formed in front of some service stations as drivers filled up before the measure kicks in on Friday. The shift may encourage some drivers to load up on the cheaper 91 fuel - though that would likely hurt foreign firms who have been supplying Venezuela with specialized products for its domestically-produced gasoline. As the economy has deteriorated, Venezuela's central bank has kept negative economic data under wraps, only publishing figures for 2015 last month. In addition to the full-year figures, the bank said month-on-month inflation was 11.4 percent, 11.1 percent, and 8.7 percent in October, November and December of last year, respectively. Critics say the inflation figures are severe low-balls as they exclude transactions made on the black market, where scarce products sell for tens if not hundreds of times their official price. Following the data release, Spanish mobile phone provider Movistar said price-fixed services were out of sync with inflationary reality, warning that this disconnect made investments \"unviable.\" \"An average monthly Movistar plan costs 476 bolivars. Much less than a kilo of ham,\" the company said in a statement. Caracas' annual inflation figure for last year was 159.7 percent. However, outside the capital, where queues are usually longer and scarcity worse, the figure was much higher, reaching 224 percent in the central city of Barquisimeto, for example. The International Monetary Fund estimates Venezuela's annual inflation will jump to 720 percent this year. Economists are predicting another harsh economic contraction. \"Maduro's measures won't solve this crisis, it's too late,\" said Maria Hernandez, 45, as she stood in line at a supermarket. \"Today, for instance, the queue is longer than it was yesterday.\" (Additional reporting by Corina Pons, Eyanir Chinea and Diego Ore in Caracas; Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo; Marianna Parraga in Houston; Editing by Chris Reese and Andrew Hay)\n\nAmerican Airlines", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's central bank on Thursday released long-awaited data sh", "title": "Tough road for Venezuela after dire data, inadequate measures", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/18/Venezuela-2015-inflation-hits-1809-percent-GDP-down-57-percent-cenbank", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-economy_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/18/Venezuela-2015-inflation-hits-1809-percent-GDP-down-57-percent-cenbank", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-economy_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's central bank on Thursday released long-awaited data sh", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Many decided long ago that the stronger exchange rates do not reflect reality and moved their accounts to weaker rates - writing off billions of dollars.\n\"Maduro's measures won't solve this crisis, it's too late,\" said Maria Hernandez, 45, as she stood in line at a supermarket.\n\"Cheap fuel was the only benefit we had left,\" said Angel Pina, 41, at a gas station in Caracas.\nAs the economy has deteriorated, Venezuela's central bank has kept negative economic data under wraps, only publishing figures for 2015 last month.\nUnder Maduro's emergency measures, the price of Venezuela's fuel - the world's cheapest - will be increased for the first time in nearly 20 years and the complex system of fixed exchange rates has been devalued and revamped."}
