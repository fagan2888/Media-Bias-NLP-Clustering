This was only a sample, the auditors believe the total amount of undisclosed money going to lobbyists is much higher.\n\n\"Potentially 75 percent of agencies for which lobbyists reported they had received payments for lobbying activities failed to disclose the lobbying activities as required,\" the report said.\n\nAuditors faulted HUD for not discovering that the housing authorities had used federal funds to lobby\u2014saying it should have better oversight over the authorities and the money they\u2019re spending.\n\nRelated: Employee Misconduct Runs Rampant at the EPA\n\nApparently, HUD officials never verified lobbying forms and said more than half were never even submitted, according to auditors.\n\nThat report came around the same time a separate investigation found that HUD officials violated federal employment law practices and agency policies by hiring former housing authority lobbyist Debra Gross as a top regulator of the same housing authorities she used to represent. The IG concluded that Gross used her new post at HUD to loosen agency regulations intended to improve oversight of how the housing authorities spend their money.\n\nSeparately, another employee who was serving a prison sentence for stalking and threatening murder, was placed on paid administrative leave for at least three years and is still receiving his salary while approval to remove him is pending.\n\nHUD\u2019s IG David Montoya and the Government Accountability Office\u2019s Edda Emmanuelli Perez detailed the many examples of misconduct by HUD officials in testimony before the House Financial Services subcommittee on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Invalid EPA Bonuses Doled Out Like Candy\n\n\u201cWhile our investigation did not result in criminal prosecution, it did discern an institutional failure to follow HUD\u2019s own existing internal policies,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cThere were breakdowns in communication and in responsibility and a failure to adhere to existing policies and procedures.\u201d\n\nMontoya added that the misconduct, which is so engrained in the agency\u2019s culture, has contributed to HUD\u2019s consistently poor ranking on an annual agency employee satisfaction survey. Last year, HUD scored last place in the mid-sized agency category.\n\n\u201cMisconduct and unethical behavior, particularly by high-ranking officials does not, in my view, serve to enhance this unfavorable image,\u201d he said in prepared testimony.\n\nStill, the agency defended its employees, saying the issues of misconduct involved only a few bad apples.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of HUD\u2019s 8,500 employees are hardworking, ethical and dedicated civil servants,\u201d HUD spokesman Jereon Brown said in a statement. \u201cThe misbehavior of a small group of employees erodes the American people\u2019s trust in their government and tarnishes the reputation of HUD\u2019s hardworking employees.\u201d\n\nThe reports come several months after Julian Castro took over as HUD secretary. The IG said the majority of misconduct happened before he arrived in Washington. Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio, is seen as a rising star in the Democratic party. He\u2019s been whispered as a potential VP pick if (when) Hillary Clinton makes a White House run in 2016.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal watchdogs are flagging the Department of Housing and Urban Development for ram", "title": "HUD Execs Flagged for Ethics, Lobbying Violations", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/HUD-Execs-Flagged-Ethics-Lobbying-Violations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/HouseInHands.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/HUD-Execs-Flagged-Ethics-Lobbying-Violations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/HouseInHands.JPG", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Federal watchdogs are flagging the Department of Housing and Urban Development for ram", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Employee Misconduct Runs Rampant at the EPAApparently, HUD officials never verified lobbying forms and said more than half were never even submitted, according to auditors.\nThe IG concluded that Gross used her new post at HUD to loosen agency regulations intended to improve oversight of how the housing authorities spend their money.\nAuditors faulted HUD for not discovering that the housing authorities had used federal funds to lobby\u2014saying it should have better oversight over the authorities and the money they\u2019re spending.\n\"Potentially 75 percent of agencies for which lobbyists reported they had received payments for lobbying activities failed to disclose the lobbying activities as required,\" the report said.\nHUD\u2019s IG David Montoya and the Government Accountability Office\u2019s Edda Emmanuelli Perez detailed the many examples of misconduct by HUD officials in testimony before the House Financial Services subcommittee on Wednesday."}
