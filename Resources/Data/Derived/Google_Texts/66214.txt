Evacuations are underway Sunday morning in the Idaho Creek neighborhood and River Valley Village trailer park near Del Camino and on the west side of Longmont because the St. Vrain River is rising quickly.

East of Longmont, near Del Camino, Mountain View Fire and Rescue spokeswoman Amy Tallent said “we are receiving reports that the river is rising 7 inches every 15 minutes.”

The Longmont Police Department also ordered the re-evacuation of neighborhoods on the west side of town, including The Greens, Champion Greens and Valley because of the rising river. The Royal Street Mobile Home Park remains evacuated.

Rains continue to pound Boulder County.

Tallent said Mead High School, northeast of Longmont, has been opened as a shelter. In Longmont, people needing shelter can go to LifeBridge Christian Church at Colorado 66 and Gay Street, the Memorial Building at Longs Peak Avenue and Coffman Street, or Niwot High School at 8989 Niwot Road.

Tallent said people who assistance evacuating should call 911.
