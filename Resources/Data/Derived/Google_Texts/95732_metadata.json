The snub nosed revolvers and pocket pistols are shooting head-to-head in competition that simulates CCW in the real world. Plus, the story of the moon clip, created for the M1917 Colt. Then John shows you how to improve your AR Trigger in a Brownells Home Gunsmithing Project. And Todd Jarrett shows you how to shoot your AR in unusual positions.\n\nShooting USA\u2019s Impossible Shots \u2013 The Classic 600 Yards of Bob\n\nThere\u2019s an old Montana legend about a cowboy shooting a deer at 600 yards with a handgun. Bob Munden looks to prove him right in a Classic Shot, 600 yards with a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum on a steel target. And Mr. Flintlock is working on his favorite exhibition shot, cutting cards. The question is, how many can he cut with a single shot? Plus Smith & Wesson Pro Jerry Miculek creates the ultimate 3-Gun challenge, Rifle, Pistol, and Shotgun at incredible speeds.\n\nAIR TIMES BY TIME ZONE\n\nThe Shooting USA Hour Wednesdays:\n\nEastern Time: 3:00 PM, 9:00 PM, 12:00 Midnight\n\nCentral Time: 2:00 PM, 8:00 PM, 11:00 PM\n\nMountain Time: 1:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 10:00 PM\n\nPacific Time: Noon, 6:00 PM, 9:00 PM Shooting USA is listed as a one hour show in your cable menu.\n\n\n\nNew Times Shooting USA\u2019s Impossible Shots:\n\nEastern Time: 2:00 PM, 5:30 PM, 10:30 PM\n\nCentral Time: 1:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 9:30 PM\n\nMountain Time: Noon, 3:30 PM, 8:30 PM\n\nPacific Time: 11:00 AM, 2:30 PM, 7:30 PM\n\nA Day in the Life of the Gold Medal Winner:\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what a day in the life of a two-time Olympic Gold medalist entails, you will in the weeks ahead.
