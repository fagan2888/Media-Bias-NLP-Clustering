That\u2019s only a fraction of the 1.4 million to 4 million small businesses that were estimated to be eligible.\n\nIn 2010, that credit was a key selling point for President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in persuading Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA), i.e., Obamacare.\n\nBut the incentive is too complicated, time consuming and insufficient for small business.\n\nOnly companies with fewer than 10 employees and average wages of $25,900 or less are eligible for the full amount, which is worth up to 50 percent of premiums paid by the employer. It phases down as a company\u2019s size and wages go up.\n\nGAO believes the SHOP enrollments are low because employers must spend from two to eight hours collecting employee\u2019s data and tax preparers devote an additional three to five hours calculating the credit.\n\nThe kicker is that beginning in 2014, a small business had to buy health insurance through a government-operated Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange in order to qualify.\n\nThese SHOP exchanges, set up under Obamacare or independently by states like Washington, were supposed to give small businesses a better deal on insurance by increasing competition in the small group market.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\n\n(Oregon\u2019s version of SHOP hasn\u2019t opened yet, but a variety of related information is available at www.oregonhealthcare.gov/small-business.html.)\n\nLast August, Dr. Roger Stark, MD, health policy analyst for the Washington Policy Center (WPC) reported only two health insurers offered insurance through Washington\u2019s exchange. Moda and Kaiser Permanente only covered 115 employers employing 600 people.\n\nStark argues government-run health exchanges duplicate the private insurance market, but limit the options available to small business. Collectively, they cost us billions to operate and is money which would be better spent for schools, roads and training workers.\n\nHe also argues the tax credit puts added burden on taxpayers who don\u2019t receive the credit, yet subsidize it through their taxes.\n\nAssociation health plans (AHP), authorized by the Washington State Legislature with the blessing of then-Gov. Mike Lowry, have been very popular in Washington state and provide reasonably-priced health insurance for small business.\n\nThey grew to the point where they were 60 association plans covering 500,000 Washingtonians when Obamacare was signed into law. Interestingly, nearly half of those now covered were uninsured.\n\nAn AHP market continues to exist for small employers in Oregon and may be positioned for growth, according to a study by the Urban Institue.\n\nAHPs are working.\n\nFor example, the Fremont Brewing Co. in Seattle, which began operations in 2009, wanted to covers its 70 people with good health insurance, so owner Matt Lincecum investigated a number of AHP proposals.\n\nIn Kennewick, Carbintex, a start-up which manufactures a flexible carbon fiber used in shoes and luggage, employed an insurance broker. CEO Junus Khan settled on HealthChoice, an AHP which has been in place for 20 years.\n\nBoth companies wanted the best possible coverage for the lowest price. Just as thousands of employers across America, they found health insurance in a competitive private market, not a government-run exchange.\n\nStark believes Congress should amend Obamacare to allow small employers and their workers to make greater use of the benefits of association health plans.\n\n\u201cIf SHOP exchanges continue, they should be transparent and information-based where individuals and small business could select the plan most appropriate to their needs,\u201d Stark concluded. \u201cThe exchange should be easy to use and should promote decreased health care costs, not complexity and confusion.\u201d\n\nDon C.
