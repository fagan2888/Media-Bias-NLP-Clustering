Obama administration officials view the TPP as a crucial part of its \"pivot\" to Asia.\n\nIn a questionnaire Clinton filled out and submitted to the AFL-CIO earlier this year and obtained by Reuters, Clinton laid out a broad litmus test for the pact, but did not say whether she was for or against it yet.\n\nThe agreement must protect American workers and strengthen national security, she wrote in the questionnaire.\n\n\"My focus is on what is in the final trade agreement because that will directly impact the American people,\" she wrote. \"The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade's sake.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hillary, nurses, union, afl-cio, bernie sanders, endorse", "pubdate": "2015-08-11T05:52:20", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "National Nurses United, the nation's largest organization of nurses, endorsed Vermont Sen, Bernie Sanders for the 2016 presidential race, a blow to Hillary Clinton as the Democratic front-runner seeks to court key labor voters.", "title": "National Nurses Union Spurns Hillary, Endorses Sanders", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/hillary-nurses-union-afl-cio/2015/08/11/id/669488/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=5bc3dfad-92f4-4abc-b3f0-9712ae2721b5&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/hillary-nurses-union-afl-cio/2015/08/11/id/669488/", "title": "National Nurses Union Spurns Hillary, Endorses Sanders", "description": "National Nurses United, the nation's largest organization of nurses, endorsed Vermont Sen, Bernie Sanders for the 2016 presidential race, a blow to Hillary Clinton as the Democratic front-runner seeks to court key labor voters.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1439272340, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "hillary, nurses, union, afl-cio, bernie sanders, endorse", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-08-11T05:52:20"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/hillary-nurses-union-afl-cio/2015/08/11/id/669488/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "National Nurses Union Spurns Hillary, Endorses Sanders"}, "article_summary": "The NNU is the first national union to endorse Sanders, who has been building momentum among more progressive Democrats.\nThe nurses' union polled its members three times to ensure a large number of responses, said DeMoro, who said the support for Sanders was \"overwhelming.\"\nNational Nurses United, the nation's largest organization of nurses, endorsed Vermont Sen, Bernie Sanders for the 2016 presidential race, a blow to Hillary Clinton as the Democratic front-runner seeks to court key labor voters.\nSanders \"aligns completely with the nurses' values,\" said RoseAnn DeMoro, the group's executive director, citing issues such as healthcare and trade.\n\"My focus is on what is in the final trade agreement because that will directly impact the American people,\" she wrote."}
