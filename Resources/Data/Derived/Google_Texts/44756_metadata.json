Weibrecht took a silver medal in super-G at the 2014 Olympics and bronze at the 2010 Olympics. Ligety\u2019s best event is giant slalom \u2014 he is the Olympic champion \u2014 but he is the reigning world champion in super-G and had top-five finishes the previous two super-Gs here.\n\nKjetil Jansrud of Norway had won three straight races but finished second, 0.52 of a second behind. Alexis Pinturault of France, like Ligety one of the tour\u2019s top giant slalom racers, finished third.\n\n\u201cThis start is really daunting and intimidating,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t let that get to you, and I skied way, way, way too conservatively up top. It looks hairy and gnarly, and it\u2019s actually pretty easy if you\u2019re a good technical skier. Pinturault slayed everybody up top, and there\u2019s no reason for me to be losing a second to Pinturault on the first split.\u201d\n\nWeibrecht had trouble negotiating a pair of tight gates near the bottom of the course exiting a section called the Abyss\n\n\u201cThe top was really good, solid skiing,\u201d Weibrecht said. \u201cBy the GS start I just got a little squashed in there, had a mistake and I knew I was losing a little time so I started pushing it a little harder. I had a couple little ragged mistakes. And then down bottom, coming out the Abyss, it\u2019s just a tough switch. It comes at you really quick, you\u2019ve got to be in the right place and you\u2019ve got to commit before you can see the gates. It\u2019s a really, really tough couple of gates.\u201d\n\nWeibrecht had the solace of producing a good result \u2014 for him \u2014 in Friday\u2019s downhill. Starting 62nd, he finished 30th to score World Cup points (top 30) for the first time in downhill since Jan. 23, 2010.\n\n\u201cThe downhill was huge,\u201d Weibrecht said. \u201cI was real excited about that, just to be in the points there is a huge step. I looked it up, it was 1,777 days since I scored a downhill point, so that\u2019s nice, to get that monkey off my back.\u201d\n\nLigety gets to race GS Sunday on a course where he has won four of the past five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to ski GS here,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome hill, had a lot of success here, so I\u2019m looking forward to it for sure.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andrew Weibrecht, Ted Ligety fall short in World Cup super-G", "title": "Andrew Weibrecht, Ted Ligety fall short in World Cup super-G", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/06/andrew-weibrecht-ted-ligety-fall-short-in-world-cup-super-g/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141206_034810_ted-ligety.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141206_034810_ted-ligety.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T15:21:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:59:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff5e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou just can\u2019t let that get to you, and I skied way, way, way too conservatively up top.\nIt\u2019s a really, really tough couple of gates.\u201dWeibrecht had the solace of producing a good result \u2014 for him \u2014 in Friday\u2019s downhill.\nWeibrecht finished 10th and Ligety 11th in a race won by Austrian Hannes Reichelt, but both had hopes of reaching the podium.\nWeibrecht took a silver medal in super-G at the 2014 Olympics and bronze at the 2010 Olympics.\nBEAVER CREEK \u2014 Andrew Weibrecht skied too aggressively at the bottom and Ted Ligety wasn\u2019t aggressive enough at the top, so the two American Olympic medalists had to settle for unsatisfying results Saturday in a World Cup super-G here."}
