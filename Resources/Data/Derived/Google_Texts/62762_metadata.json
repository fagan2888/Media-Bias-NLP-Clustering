It reported losses of $4.3 million in 2014.\n\nThe co-op\u2019s overall membership totals 50,000 enrollees across all its health insurance lines, up 66 percent from the 33,000 the co-op served a year ago. Small group membership consisting of employers with 50 or fewer workers has nearly doubled from 8,000 to 15,000 year over year, according to Ashanin. Large group membership for businesses with more than 50 employees has doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 in the same period, the co-op\u2019s top executive said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cPart of our long-term strategy has always been to incorporate more large groups and diversify our business,\u201d Dr. Martin Hickey, Health Connections CEO, said.\n\nNationwide, a government report released Friday showed that health insurance enrollment for 2015 under the Affordable Care Act missed a goal set by Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell.\n\nThe report from the Obama administration says about 8.8 million consumers were still signed up and paying premiums at the end of last year in the insurance markets created by the president\u2019s 2010 health care law.\n\nBurwell\u2019s goal had been to have 9.1 million customers by then, so the administration didn\u2019t miss its target by much \u2014 about 3 percent.\n\nHowever, the 2015 coverage year had started with 11.7 million people signed up. Measured from that initial starting point, the attrition rate is a lot higher, about 25 percent.\n\nMaterial from The Associated Press was incorporated into this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Molina Healthcare of New Mexico was the most popular choice among the 55,000 people in the state who bought private health insurance this year through the state's health exchange.
