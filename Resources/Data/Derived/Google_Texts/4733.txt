Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, calls into Tuesday's broadcast Good Morning America and talks about the state of the 2016 presidential race. Trump talks about Kasich, addresses the chaos at his rallies and comments he has made about women in the past.



"Kasich supported NAFTA," Trump said of the Ohio governor. "He's now supporting TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), which is going to totally destroy Ohio. It's going to take all its car business out of Ohio. And you look at what he's doing, if you look at what he's done. He's in favor of Common Core, expanded Obamacare in Ohio."
