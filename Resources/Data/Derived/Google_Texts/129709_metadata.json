We know those claims are not true and fortunately so does our government which just issued proposed regulations establishing a two-person crew minimum on most trains. We applaud those rules and will push to make them as tough and rigid as possible.\n\nIf former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was alive today, he would probably tell the railroads, \u201cyou\u2019re entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts.\u201d Despite erroneous claims by the industry lobby that there is a lack of \u201cconclusive statistical data\u201d to support a two-person crew standard, we know from data gleaned from reports on accidents, crashes and fatalities as well as the real-life experiences of frontline employees, that the arguments in favor of a two-person crew standard are compelling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe railroads rely on skewed statistical analysis to argue that a lack of accidents from the use of one-person crews means that this two-person train crew rule isn\u2019t needed. The reality is that almost all trains in America operate with two crew members and thankfully, one-person crew operations are still the rare exception. Of course there is not a great deal of data available. More to the point, the safety statistics in today\u2019s industry are a product of the skill and professionalism of the two-person and three-person crews that operate trains across America today.\n\nFederal regulators\u2019 own research underscores the necessity of having at a minimum a federally certified engineer and a federally certified conductor on trains. These employees support each other\u2019s decision-making process. They work together to combat fatigue, especially in the real-world of train crews defined by mandated long shifts and unpredictable work schedules. They support safe operations in the event of emergencies or if one of the crew members becomes incapacitated, a fact that is also recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration as it prohibits cockpit crews of fewer than two pilots.\n\nConveniently, the railroads also fail to mention what happened three years ago in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic. A runaway train carrying 72 cars of crude oil killed 47 people and leveled most of the town. This train was under the control of a single crew member who failed to properly secure the train (because he lacked a co-crew member to assist and support him) ending in a fiery and deadly crash.\n\nThe industry\u2019s assertion that mandates to implement Positive Train Control (PTC) technology in the rail industry are somehow in conflict with the FRA\u2019s crew size rule is absurd. In case facts matter, PTC is simply one more redundant safety tool in rail operations that requires a great deal of train crew interaction in order for it to work. In fact, a fully operational PTC system puts more demands on the attention of the crew because of the distractions it causes. While advancement in transportation technology can provide essential safety support and save lives, it is not, and never will be, a replacement for highly trained, experienced and adequately staffed crews.\n\nBy the way, the public has spoken loudly on the subject. In states across America, both red and blue, an overwhelming majority of Americans strongly support a two-person train crew standard. The numbers are consistently strong cross all political and ideological lines with up to 91 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans favoring federal action to bar one-person train operations.\n\nThe safety arguments support a two-person crew standard. The public supports a two-person crew standard. Now it is time for our government to bar most one-person train operations.\n\nPrevisich jprevisich@smart-union.org is president of SMART Transportation Division and Wytkind edw@ttd.org is president of the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Conveniently, the railroads also fail to mention what happened three years ago in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic.", "description": "Conveniently, the railroads also fail to mention what happened three years ago in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Conveniently, the railroads also fail to mention what happened three years ago in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic.", "title": "FRA rule gives us chance to bar most one-person crew trains", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/273916-fra-rule-gives-us-chance-to-bar-most-one-person-crew-trains", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-23T06:00:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-23T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/273916-fra-rule-gives-us-chance-to-bar-most-one-person-crew-trains", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-23T06:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "John Previsich and Ed Wytkind", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-23T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T06:00:01-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/273916-fra-rule-gives-us-chance-to-bar-most-one-person-crew-trains", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Conveniently, the railroads also fail to mention what happened three years ago in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic.", "card": "summary", "title": "FRA rule gives us chance to bar most one-person crew trains"}, "dcterms.title": "FRA rule gives us chance to bar most one-person crew trains"}, "article_summary": "The reality is that almost all trains in America operate with two crew members and thankfully, one-person crew operations are still the rare exception.\nIn states across America, both red and blue, an overwhelming majority of Americans strongly support a two-person train crew standard.\nNow it is time for our government to bar most one-person train operations.\nThe public supports a two-person crew standard.\nADVERTISEMENTThe railroads rely on skewed statistical analysis to argue that a lack of accidents from the use of one-person crews means that this two-person train crew rule isn\u2019t needed."}
