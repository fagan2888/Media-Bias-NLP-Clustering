But if ISIS, which has sophisticated military equipment, an estimated $2 billion in funding and a thriving black market oil trade, is going to be defeated, the Saudis are going to have to do more.\n\nRelated: Drive ISIS to the Gates of Hell but Bypass Syria?\n\nPart of the reason is that the long-time American ally is home to Mecca. ISIS has its sites set on capturing the spiritual home of Islam, posing a threat to the Saudi homeland.\n\nAnother reason is that Saudis want to protect their own oil interests. A report from Oilprice.com says securing Saudi oil fields is the group\u2019s ultimate goal.\n\n\u201cISIS knows that it will only feel secure once Saudi Arabia is part of the Caliphate and its oil fields are under ISIS control, which is why the group has two logical next steps,\u201d the report said. \u201cFirst, to capture and secure the most important country in the Muslim world: Saudi Arabia\u2026And second, to take on the United States -- the one remaining superpower that could stop its march on the oilfields of Saudi Arabia, and ultimately the rest of the Gulf.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia also has an interest in making sure that ISIS extremists don\u2019t pop up there. Its Ministry of the Interior has a tremendous track record of tackling extremism within Saudi borders. In May, the Saudis arrested 62 people affiliated with ISIS. Earlier this month, they arrested an additional 88 people connected with the group.\n\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)\n\nThe Saudis are also taking steps to protect its border with Iraq and Syria. King Abdullah announced late last week that the Saudis would create a 560 mile border fence to bring the \"number of infiltrators, drug, arms and cattle smugglers to zero,\" according to Saudi state media.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in The New York Times, Nawaf Obaid, a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and Saud al-Sarhan, research director at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, argued that this infrastructure puts the Saudis in the perfect position to crush ISIS.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is the only authority in the region with the power and legitimacy to bring ISIS down. Having effectively eradicated Al Qaeda in the kingdom, the Saudi government, with its experience fighting terrorism, is uniquely positioned to deal with ISIS, which is, after all, an Al Qaeda-aligned organization,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe kingdom has built up an impressive counterterrorism program and its counterterrorism strategies are considered some of the most sophisticated and effective in the world.\n\nLimited Outside of Saudi Arabia\n\nHowever, the Saudis are limited in their capabilities outside of the homeland. They have an Army, Navy and Air Force, but according to a report in Newsweek, they cannot operate much of their sophisticated equipment without assistance from British and American military advisers. For instance, the Saudis have the third largest fleet of F-15s in the world, but don\u2019t know how to repair them.\n\nRelated: Obama's Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells Another Story\n\nThe Saudis \u201chave all the good equipment, but their capacity to use it varies,\u201d Simon Henderson, director of the Gulf and Energy Policy Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy told The Fiscal Times.\n\nHenderson added that any expectation of Saudi boots on the ground should be tempered.\n\n\u201cI would fall over backwards if that happens,\u201d he said, referring to the prospect of Saudi troops in Iraq or Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the Saudis to work with the United States and other countries. It\u2019s another thing for the Saudis to actually go and do favors for us in Iraq or Syria.\u201d\n\nInstead, Henderson predicted that Saudis would use one weapon they have boatloads of: cash. He said he expects them to try to create rifts with ISIS between radical jihadist and tribal groups targeted by the government of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.\n\n\u201cThis is a cleavage that the Saudis could stick a knife in and widen, probably by supplying arms and suitcases of cash,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Saudis are attempting to crush ISIS elements in its homeland, while trying to open rifts among the different group that make up the Islamic State.", "title": "Here\u2019s How the Saudis Will Take on ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/12/Here-s-How-Saudis-Will-Take-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09122014_Saudi_US.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/12/Here-s-How-Saudis-Will-Take-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09122014_Saudi_US.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Saudis are attempting to crush ISIS elements in its homeland, while trying to open rifts among the different group that make up the Islamic State.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe018c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSaudi Arabia is the only authority in the region with the power and legitimacy to bring ISIS down.\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)The Saudis are also taking steps to protect its border with Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the Saudis to work with the United States and other countries.\nBut if ISIS, which has sophisticated military equipment, an estimated $2 billion in funding and a thriving black market oil trade, is going to be defeated, the Saudis are going to have to do more.\nJust as the president was speaking, the Saudis announced they would open their military bases to the United States so that it could train moderate Syrian fighters."}
