But doctors have good reason to hold their applause.\n\nBack in June 2009, Obama told a gathering of the American Medical Association that he was \u201clooking at a range of ideas\u201d to curtail costly medical malpractice lawsuits and \u201cscale back the excessive defensive medicine.\u201d\n\nA few months later, he told Congress that \u201cI\u2019ve talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs\u201d and that he would borrow a page from President Bush and fund demonstration projects for various reforms at the state level.\n\nIn a written note on a 2009 staff memo, Obama made it clear why he was talking up malpractice reform with doctors: \u201cIf this helps the AMA stay on board (with the Affordable Care Act), we should explore it.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Obama got the AMA\u2019s ObamaCare endorsement. But so far he hasn\u2019t delivered any malpractice reforms.\n\nWaste Of Time, Money\n\nThere is widespread agreement that the current medical malpractice system is a costly waste, allowing too many frivolous lawsuits and outsized awards while encouraging overspending on health care.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2011, doctors spent an average of $47,000 to defend against each malpractice suit \u2014 of which two-thirds were dropped, dismissed or withdrawn.\n\nOf the small fraction of suits that made it to a jury, the patients lost 88% of them, according to industry data.\n\nDoctors also waste vast sums of time on malpractice claims that don\u2019t result in payments to patients, according to a report from the liberal Center for American Progress. And it noted that up to 90% of doctors say they practice \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d \u2014 ordering extra tests and procedures \u2014 out of fear of being sued.\n\nChristopher Conover , a research scholar at Duke University, calculated in 2004 that such defensive medicine needlessly added at least $69 billion to the nation\u2019s overall health tab.\n\nObama\u2019s own bipartisan debt commission concluded that the current malpractice system adds more than $2 billion a year in costs to government health programs.\n\nBut while in office, Obama has never seriously pushed any national medical malpractice reforms, and nothing of substance has happened on his watch.\n\nShortly after his 2009 speech to Congress, for example, the Health and Human Services Department announced $23 million in three-year \u201cdemonstration projects\u201d to test \u201cnontraditional\u201d malpractice reform ideas in various states.\n\nCritics pointed out that the studies wouldn\u2019t produce results until long after ObamaCare was enacted. In fact, a comprehensive review isn\u2019t expected until sometime next year.\n\nEven then, it\u2019s not clear what good they\u2019ll do.\n\n\u2018Proving The Obvious\u2019\n\nIn a 2012 letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Sens. Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley and Rep. Lamar Smith complained that all the projects were \u201caimed at proving the obvious\u201d \u2014 that fewer medical mistakes should lead to fewer lawsuits. None of the studies, they said, looked at ways to cut frivolous suits or excessive damage awards.\n\nAnd while ObamaCare was supposed to fund $50 million in research grants, the money was never appropriated. Obama didn\u2019t even bother to request the funds in his annual budgets, according to the American College of Physicians.\n\nObama did, however, keep making promises. In his 2011 State of the Union speech, he said he planned to \u201clook at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year: medical malpractice reform,\u201d citing the debt commission he organized as the reason for raising the issue.\n\nResearch Vs. Reform\n\nThe debt commission, however, proposed \u201can aggressive set of reforms to the tort system.\u201d Obama instead only asked for more research grant money, which never went anywhere anyway.\n\nLast December, Obama again said he was open to any \u201cgood ideas\u201d that would expand access and \u201ccut costs.\u201d\n\nA few days later, 34 House Republicans signed a letter to Obama outlining nine such ideas \u2014 including medical malpractice reform \u2014 and offering to talk about any one of them with the president.\n\nThey\u2019ve yet to hear back from the White House.\n\nThe reason for Obama\u2019s reluctance to push malpractice reform is easy to understand. Democrats fiercely oppose any meaningful changes.\n\nWhen President Bush tried to get comprehensive medical malpractice legislation through Congress in 2005, Senate Democrats filibustered the bill.\n\nAnd if one follows the money, it\u2019s easy to see, in part, why Democrats take this position. Trial lawyers oppose such reforms and give lots of campaign cash to Democrats.\n\nSince 2006, the trial lawyers\u2019 lobby, the American Association for Justice, has given 96% of its donations \u2014 a total of $14.2 million \u2014 to Democrats, according to OpenSecrets.org. It spent another $37 million lobbying Congress over those years.\n\nThe organization\u2019s state affiliates are just as partisan. In fact, 22 of them gave 100% of their money to Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama might be thrilled that 7.1 million people signed up for ObamaCare.
