The cost of health care in the U.S. has been ballooning: A recent report found that the U.S. collectively spends about $9,000 per person on health care each year, which adds up to 17 percent of the country’s GDP.

But what happens when patients can’t afford to pay their bills? At nonprofit hospitals, an unpaid bill either becomes bad debt for the patient or is written off as “charity care.” Nationally, this adds up to $57 billion in uncompensated care. But a group of researchers argue that the way charity care is given out could be made more efficient.

A new report by The Hamilton Project, an initiative of the Brookings Institution, looks at a proposal to improve the charity-care system in the U.S. Three researchers at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management—David Dranove, Craig Garthwaite, and Christopher Ody—argue that the supply and demand for charity care are not geographically aligned. That is, hospitals with the most resources to offer charity care aren’t in the places where people most need it. In high-income areas, hospitals are better funded and more able to provide charity care. But it’s in the hospitals in low-income areas where the demand is highest.
