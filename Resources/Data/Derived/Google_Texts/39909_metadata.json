The notification caused some grumbling at other agencies.\n\nOPM spokesperson Sam Schumach said it was a necessary step to get protections to breach victims in a \"timely and effective manner.\"\n\n\u201cOPM is asking each agency to fund a share of the cost of monitoring and protection services approximately proportional to the number of individuals impacted,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis strategy was developed in concert with the Office of Management and Budget.\u201d\n\nThe full Senate Appropriations Committee will take up the budget bill that funds OPM on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The federal agency played host to recent data breaches that continue to roil the government.", "description": "The federal agency played host to recent data breaches that continue to roil the government.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The federal agency played host to recent data breaches that continue to roil the government.", "title": "Senate panel votes to boost OPM's IT budget after hack", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248851-senate-advances-it-budget-boost-for-opm-after-hack", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/opmbuilding07222015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248851-senate-advances-it-budget-boost-for-opm-after-hack", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-22T16:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",John Boozman,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-22T16:00:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248851-senate-advances-it-budget-boost-for-opm-after-hack", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The federal agency played host to recent data breaches that continue to roil the government.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate panel votes to boost OPM's IT budget after hack"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate panel votes to boost OPM's IT budget after hack"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc657\"", "article_summary": "The budget bill would also fund a number of other financial oversight, consumer protection and management agencies.\nA Senate subcommittee on Wednesday approved a funding bill that would boost information technology spending for the agency at the center of the massive recent hacks that have roiled the government.\n\u201cThis strategy was developed in concert with the Office of Management and Budget.\u201dThe full Senate Appropriations Committee will take up the budget bill that funds OPM on Thursday.\nADVERTISEMENTThat funding level is a $24 million, or 10 percent, increase over the agency\u2019s enacted 2015 budget.\n\u201cOPM is asking each agency to fund a share of the cost of monitoring and protection services approximately proportional to the number of individuals impacted,\u201d he said in a statement."}
