The expansion of government under the liberalism in carnet, Resident Obama, will add up to more than his predecessors combined. What has been the result of all of this deficit spending? We\u2019ve had a failed stimulus, a crashing Obamacare, a border incapable of stopping thousands of children from crossing illegally, a weakened military and a bloated bureaucracy focused on abusing its authority rather than doing the job it\u2019s supposed to do.\n\nCase in point: the government\u2019s response to the Ebola crisis has been rightly criticized. Let\u2019s forget, for the moment, big government\u2019s failure in allowing Ebola from Africa to flow right on to our front doorstep. The response should give pause to any American. Protecting the public health is something most all Americans agree is the responsibility of the government. The government has said they need countless American tax dollars to do this worthwhile job. We\u2019ve been assured by Dan Pfeiffer, senior White House Advisor, that Team Obama has been working on a response to Ebola since the outbreak in West Africa seven months ago.
