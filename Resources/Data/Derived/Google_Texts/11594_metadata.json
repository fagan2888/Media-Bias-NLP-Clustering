Rand Paul, R-Ky., has stated that supporting the \"right to health care ... means you believe in slavery.\"\n\nComedian Sarah Silverman\u2019s liberal leanings are almost as well-known as her raunchy style. Her 2008 pro-Barack Obama video \" The Great Schlep \" attracted 2.2 million views on YouTube; a follow-up from 2012 attracted another 1.1 million views.\n\nRecently, a reader forwarded us this shareable meme from Silverman\u2019s feed at WhoSay , a social media site, that\u2019s critical of presidential candidate and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The meme -- which Silverman had passed along from the Twitter account of actor Michael Sheen -- shows Paul seated at a congressional hearing. The meme purports to quote Paul equating the right to health care with slavery.\n\nWhat do the facts say?\n\nWe were able to track down the source of the comments. They stem from a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions subcommittee hearing on May 11, 2011. Paul\u2019s unusual comparison attracted a flurry of media attention at the time, as well as sniping by Paul\u2019s critics.\n\nThe meme shortened Paul\u2019s comments to fit the available space, but the abridgement doesn\u2019t strike us as twisting the gist of his comments.\n\nHere\u2019s the full excerpt:\n\n\"With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have to realize what that implies. It\u2019s not an abstraction. I\u2019m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. It means that you\u2019re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses.\n\n\"Basically, once you imply a belief in a right to someone\u2019s services, do you have a right to plumbing? Do you have a right to water? Do you have right to food? You\u2019re basically saying you believe in slavery. You\u2019re saying you believe in taking and extracting from another person. Our founding documents were very clear about this. You have a right to pursue happiness but there\u2019s no guarantee of physical comfort. There\u2019s no guarantee of concrete items. In order to give something concrete, you have to take it from someone. So there\u2019s an implied threat of force.\n\n\"If I\u2019m a physician in your community and you say you have a right to health care, do you have a right to beat down my door with the police, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That\u2019s ultimately what the right to free health care would be. If you believe in a right to health care, you\u2019re believing in basically the use of force to conscript someone to do your bidding.\"\n\nA few days after the speech, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a free-market group, posted a longer version of Paul\u2019s speech on YouTube , suggesting that the next 30 seconds or so provided more nuance to Paul\u2019s comments and had been overlooked by commentators. Here is the additional comment:\n\n\"Now just because it's a noble thing to believe that we are obligated as Christians, we are obligated to the Hippocratic Oath, we have always done this. Since the beginning of modern medicine we have always provided 100 percent access. I do it in exchange for privileges. I do it because I believe in the Hippocratic Oath. But my hospital also says to me you can only operate in this hospital if you agree to see everyone coming through the emergency room. I always have. People have always had 100 percent access to our emergency room. Those are for emergencies -- those are not the best place for primary care.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t think Paul\u2019s subsequent comments greatly change what he said earlier, since he\u2019s saying he\u2019s consenting to the servitude of treating non-paying patients as a condition of being allowed to practice at certain hospitals. In this comment, he still sees it as a burden to be borne.\n\nIn addition, Paul says he\u2019s referring to emergency-room care, not to primary care. Primary care was the point of getting uninsured Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act, so they wouldn\u2019t have to resort to going to emergency rooms for basic services.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- who, as it happens, is also running for president in 2016 -- used his perch as the chairman of the subcommittee to ask a witness, physician Dana Kraus, whether she felt like a \"slave\" working at her federally qualified health center.\n\n\"I love my job,\" she responded . \"I do not feel like a slave.\"\n\nEven Matt Welch, the editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, had harsh words for Paul, who has long been identified with the libertarian movement.\n\n\"Could slaves free themselves by changing professions?\" Welch wrote. \"Do doctors in Switzerland get taken away at gunpoint? To treat the analogy with technical seriousness, even setting aside (as if you could) the colossal weight of America's most lasting shame, is to render it ridiculous, in my opinion.\"\n\nWe could not find an instance of Paul addressing these comments further, and Paul\u2019s staff didn\u2019t respond to a pair of inquiries.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSilverman forwarded a social media meme that said Paul has stated that supporting the \"right to health care \u2026 means you believe in slavery.\"\n\nThe meme has been abridged from the full quote, but we see no significant change in his meaning. We also found no evidence that Paul had backtracked on the views he expressed.\n\nWe rate the meme\u2019s claim True.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comedian Sarah Silverman&rsquo;s liberal leanings are almost as well-known as her raunchy style.
