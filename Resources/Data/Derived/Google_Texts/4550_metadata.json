When I, like many others, noted that job growth since Obamacare went into full effect has been the fastest since the 1990s \u2014 which is simply what the BLS data say \u2014 I got a barrage of mail from people claiming that I\u2019m crazy, a liar, etc.. Similarly, but on of course a much bigger scale, a lot of what I\u2019m seeing in reactions to the State of the Union amounts to the assertion that only an imbecile or a hack could believe Obama\u2019s talk about the strength of the U.S. economy relative to other advanced countries \u2014 when that\u2019s a simple fact.\n\nBut that involves grading on a curve, one where the average is dragged down by the awful performance of Europe. What does the economic record look like compared with our own past?\n\nNot great, but not too bad.\n\nUnemployment is, of course, more or less back to pre-crisis levels, but that\u2019s in part due to falling labor force participation. So what\u2019s happening to family incomes? Unfortunately, the Census data on those incomes come with a long lag, but Sentier Research now produces much more timely estimates (using the CPS data), which are shown above. What they say is that after a severe drop, median real household income is also roughly back to pre-crisis levels.\n\nThat\u2019s not a great result; once upon a time we expected median income to be markedly higher at each business cycle peak than it was at the preceding peak. But that wasn\u2019t true under Bush, who also only more or less presided over a return to the previous peak on the eve of the Great Recession \u2014 and the Bush-era economy only got there thanks to a disastrous housing bubble. (As an aside: median income didn\u2019t rise much under Reagan either.)\n\nSo the Obama macroeconomic record isn\u2019t just one of stabilizing the economy after a terrifying crisis; he has also presided over overall income growth that, assuming we don\u2019t have another recession this year, will have been better than his predecessor.\n\nAnd meanwhile we\u2019ve seen a dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured Americans, so while income has been flat, income security is up substantially.\n\nOf course, none of this will make any dent on the conviction of the usual suspects that everything has been a disaster. But really, Obama has cause for satisfaction though not triumph.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160113085528, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 13, 2016", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Yes He Did ( 20160113 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Obama\u2019s macro record: not too bad.", "title": "Yes He Did", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/yes-he-did/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Obama\u2019s macro record: not too bad.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 13, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1452693328, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T13:55:28-05:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20160113135528, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160113, "pdate": 20160113, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Obama\u2019s macro record: not too bad.", "title": "Yes He Did", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/yes-he-did/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/yes-he-did/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Yes He Did", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "(As an aside: median income didn\u2019t rise much under Reagan either.)\nWhat they say is that after a severe drop, median real household income is also roughly back to pre-crisis levels.\nBut that involves grading on a curve, one where the average is dragged down by the awful performance of Europe.\nUnemployment is, of course, more or less back to pre-crisis levels, but that\u2019s in part due to falling labor force participation.\nThat\u2019s not a great result; once upon a time we expected median income to be markedly higher at each business cycle peak than it was at the preceding peak."}
