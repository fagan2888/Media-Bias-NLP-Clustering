The girls, along with their sister Kate, 16, portray the daughters of Kevin Sorbo\u2019s character in the movie. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you\u2019re invited to a movie premiere for a movie that was filmed in your own backyard. The Cottonwood community came out in full force to support the debut of \u201cThe Secret Handshake,\u201d written and directed by friend and neighbor Howie Klausner and filmed predominantly in Cottonwood.\n\n\u201cWe are all super proud of Howie. He is such a talented and humble guy,\u201d said Cottonwood resident Amy Officer. \u201cWe feel blessed to be a part of this experience.\u201d\n\nStarring Kevin Sorbo and Amy Grant alongside a stellar cast of local actors, \u201cThe Secret Handshake\u201d received a standing ovation at a screening at Lipscomb University\u2019s Allen Arena on May 27. The crowd was among the first to see the inspirational family-friendly film.\n\n\u201cThey did the premiere right \u2014 red carpet, backdrop, photographers and an afterparty at Greenhouse in Green Hills,\u201d said Cottonwood resident Sarah Solsvig. \u201cThe movie was great. It was so fun to see Cottonwood\u2019s playground, streets and woods; and the Franklin High School band and stadium; and the Harpeth River. We always say our neighborhood looks like a movie set, and now there\u2019s proof!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cottonwood ladies were all wearing black and white at the premiere, and not on purpose,\u201d said Cottonwood resident Terry Robbins. There certainly seems to be a synchronicity among Cottonwood\u2019s residents, who, in my opinion, deserve their own sitcom. Hmm, perhaps Mr. Klausner should take on the ladies of Cottonwood as fodder for his next project! Who am I kidding? No man in his right mind would sign up to capture that story! (I jest.)\n\n\u201cIt was so fun to see our neighbors and friends come together in support of Howie, and then to see all of his daughters in the movie was an added bonus,\u201d said Cottonwood resident Denise Gilreath.\n\nHowie and Heather Klausner\u2019s daughters, Kate (16) and twins Caroline and Camille (13), play the daughters of Kevin Sorbo\u2019s character in the film. The girls, all of whom have acting credits with Grassland\u2019s Bravo Creative Arts Center, received rave reviews from their neighbors for their on-camera skills.\n\nJust in time for Father\u2019s Day, \u201cThe Secret Handshake\u201d is available on DVD exclusively at all Wal-Mart stores and will soon be available for purchase on Walmart.com.\n\n\u201cOur family watched the DVD together and had to pause it so many times to say things like, \u2018There\u2019s Dad in the bonfire scene holding a chicken,\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s the Cottonwood playground!\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s Camille and Caroline\u2019s house!\u2019 It is so much fun to watch. We are so proud of the Klausners,\u201d said Cottonwood resident Cathy DuPuy.\n\nChances are, if you live in Middle Tennessee, you will see someone you know in this movie! Or, at minimum, you\u2019ll recognize key landmarks. But better still are the poignant messages the movie espouses \u2014 messages of love, loyalty and friendship. What better place to film such a movie than in a neighborhood that embodies all of those qualities?\n\nCongratulations to Howie Klausner, producer Tim Brown and their Grassland-based production company, Town Square Pictures, on a job well done. And congratulations to Cottonwood, Franklin and Middle Tennessee for being so doggone photogenic.\n\nNow, go out and buy \u201cThe Secret Handshake\u201d on DVD and share it with families near and wide!
