They continue to escalate,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Obamacare\u2019s goals is to curtail the growth of health care spending. President Barack Obama often ties his signature health reform program to the slowdown in the health care spending growth, which has been at or near historic lows in recent years.\n\nBut is it due to Obamacare? Not so much, experts say.\n\nA 2013 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Altarum Institute, a health research group, concluded that about three-quarters of the slowdown was due to the lackluster economy. The rest stems from efforts to keep spending down, including cost-containment measures introduced in Obamacare.\n\nAlso, health care spending is once again on the rise \u2014 and it\u2019s expected to continue to accelerate over the next decade \u2014 in large part because of expanded coverage under Obamacare. Health care spending in the U.S. is projected to have increased 5.3% in 2014, according to federal estimates. It\u2019s the first time the rate would exceed 5% since 2007.\n\nVerdict: True.\n\nJeb Bush\n\nReality Check: Bush on ISIS having an Indiana-sized caliphate\n\nBy Ryan Browne, CNN National Security Producer\n\nWhile criticizing Obama\u2019s handling of the counter ISIS campaign, Bush said that the President\u2019s failure to retain U.S. troops in Iraq after 2012 led to ISIS having a caliphate \u201cthe size of Indiana.\u201d\n\nBush said, \u201cWhen he did not renew the agreement with the Iraqi government to allow for troops to stay there, that void was filled by sectarianism that once again kind of unraveled Iraq and it created ISIS. Al Qaeda in Iraq was devastated. It was gone. But a recreation of a caliphate the size of Indiana between Syria and Iraq is because we pulled back and the Iraqis did not have a sustainable kind of national government.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the administration said it withdrew troops due to the failure to reach a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government that would protect U.S. forces in Iraq from legal prosecution.\n\nWhile many analysts agree that al Qaeda in Iraq was largely defeated in 2012 and that the withdrawal of U.S. troops contributed to instability that facilitated the rise of ISIS, did ISIS really have a caliphate the \u201csize of Indiana?\u201d\n\nAccording to the defense research firm IHS Jane\u2019s Intelligence Review, in December 2015, ISIS controlled 30,116 square miles.\n\nThe state of Indiana is 36,418 square miles. The area controlled by ISIS in Iraq and Syria is therefore 83% the size of Indiana.\n\nBut ISIS has lost significant territory in recent months, losing the city of Ramadi to the Iraqi army and the town of Sinjar to Kurdish forces backed by U.S. airstrikes.\n\nIn January 2015, IHS Jane\u2019s said ISIS controlled 35,282 miles squared, which is much closer to the size of Indiana.\n\nVerdict: Mostly True.\n\nReality Check: Bush on Russia\u2019s presence in the Middle East\n\nBy Laura Koran, CNN\n\nCriticizing Obama\u2019s strategy in Syria, Bush said the U.S. has \u201callowed Russia to establish a military presence back in the Middle East for the first time in 40 years. We\u2019ve done this in a way that is devastating.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Russia has maintained a close military relationship with Syria for over 40 years, operating a naval base in the port city of Tartus since 1971.\n\nThe facility was established to receive weapons shipments and remained under Russian control after the fall of the Soviet Union, according to an explainer from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nRussia\u2019s presence in Syria has grown since the start of the civil war there, particularly since it began launching operations from the Khmeimim airbase near Latakia. But Russia\u2019s military presence in Syria long predates the Obama administration.\n\nVerdict: False.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Donald Trump gathered in South Carolina for CNN's Republican Town Hall on Thursday, and CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=322874918", "og": {"site_name": "WTKR.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Donald Trump gathered in South Carolina for CNN\u2019s Republican Town Hall on Thursday, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check team spent the night putting the\u2026", "title": "Republican Town Hall: Reality Check", "url": "http://wtkr.com/2016/02/18/republican-town-hall-cnns-reality-check-team-inspects-the-claims/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtkr.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/s060157699.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwtkr.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/s060157699.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@wtkr3", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wtkr3"}, "keywords": "politics, fact check, politics, republicans, townhall", "msapplication-tooltip": "News from Hampton Roads and Northeast North Carolina", "p": {"domain_verify": "14ec391ba2041a09ff5947d220cebe16"}, "fb": {"pages": 115682686145}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WTKR.com", "google-site-verification": "XCycaK_1hyirMV8YZHhZWCR2QjnXRPqoUIUJs3AWdNE", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTKR3/", "published_time": "2016-02-19T04:14:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T04:14:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WTKR3/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtkr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3f4d94e849e66b7284fb8558e31bc76e?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Republican Town Hall: Reality CheckWASHINGTON \u2014 John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Donald Trump gathered in South Carolina for CNN\u2019s Republican Town Hall on Thursday, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.\nHealth care spending in the U.S. is projected to have increased 5.3% in 2014, according to federal estimates.\nOne of Obamacare\u2019s goals is to curtail the growth of health care spending.\nPresident Barack Obama often ties his signature health reform program to the slowdown in the health care spending growth, which has been at or near historic lows in recent years.\n\u201cThe problem with Obamacare is it does not control the cost of health care."}
