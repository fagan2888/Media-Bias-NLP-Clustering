A new four-year national contract with Aetna spurred a rally Monday for Tenet Healthcare Corp. 's stock price, though Tenet shares are still down almost 40% for the year.The stock rose 11% after Aetna and Tenet announced that the deal would give Aetna's 8.5 million members across its commercial and government-funded insurance lines in-network access to Tenet's 87 hospitals, 2,130 employed physicians and 218 outpatient centers.That network includes two of Tenet's newest hospitals, Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Ala. , and Carondelet Health Network in Tucson, Ariz. , both of which Tenet added under joint ventures with not-for-profit health systems.Investors failed to extend the Tenet stock rally Tuesday. Its share closed at $30.32, down 27 cents or about 1% for the trading session.Tenet's earnings, and consequently its stock price, have been under pressure as insurance enrollment has slowed under the Affordable Care Act.Other large investor-owned hospital companies, including Community Health Services and HCA, have felt the same sting.In its third quarter, ended Sept. 30, Dallas-based Tenet posted a net loss $29 million compared with net income of $9 million in the year-earlier quarter.In November, Tenet said it was selling its five hospitals and clinics in Atlanta to WellStar Health System of Marietta, Ga., for $575 million in cash and the assumption of $86 million of debt.In a statement, Tenet Chief Managed Care Officer Clint Hailey said the Aetna contract extends and expands upon a long relationship with Tenet's largest health plan customer.“It is always our goal to work collaboratively with insurance companies to bring high-quality, convenient and affordable options” to members, Hailey said.On Tuesday, the Modern Healthcare Hospital Stock Index closed at 639.94, down 6.87 or -1.06%.
