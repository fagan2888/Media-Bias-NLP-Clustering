Now, a week later, GOP lawmakers still seem unwilling to compromise unless they are able to dismantle some of the health reform law. One Oklahoma resident wants them to understand the human impact of that political position.\n\nOn the eve of the looming government shutdown, 26-year-old Kendall Brown published an open letter to the lawmakers who wanted to delay Obamacare for one year before agreeing to pass a funding bill. Brown didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cI am dying, because of the political games you are playing right now,\u201d her op-ed began.\n\nThe Oklahoma resident explained that she was born with Crohn\u2019s Disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that has no cure. When Brown was in college, she was removed from her mother\u2019s health care coverage. Since her illness prevented her from being able to take a full course load, she couldn\u2019t meet the credit requirements to qualify as a student to remain on the plan. During that time, she could only afford a limited student health plan, and she accumulated thousands of dollars in medical debt.\n\nOnce Obamacare allowed young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 plans regardless of their academic status, Brown was able to return to her mother\u2019s insurance. That provision of the health law was enacted at a crucial time \u2014 not long afterward, Brown needed to undergo emergency surgery to remove two feet of her intestine that had swollen shut. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford the procedure otherwise.\n\nBut Brown is now 26 years old, and no longer qualifies for coverage under that Obamacare provision. Although she\u2019s currently employed full-time at a nonprofit, the small organization can\u2019t offer her any health benefits. She\u2019s tried to apply for insurance plans on her own, but she\u2019s been denied because of her pre-existing condition. She cannot currently afford the lifesaving treatment to manage her illness, a form of chemotherapy that costs $15,000 for each infusion. She is desperate to enroll in the health law\u2019s new marketplaces so she can have the coverage she needs.\n\n\u201cI tell you this because I am tired of being reduced to a number, a statistic or, even worse, being described as a freeloader that wants to live off of the government health care teat,\u201d Brown explains in her open letter. \u201cI tell you this because if you defund Obamacare, or delay it even for one year, as you are debating today, then this will be my last letter to you. I will be dead before my 27th birthday.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with ThinkProgress, Brown explained that she had been following the political drama in the lead-up to the current shutdown, and she decided to write her letter \u201cout of incredible hurt and anger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that our elected officials are willfully terrible people \u2014 I think they are just so caught up in the game, so dead set on doing whatever it takes to get those votes next re-election season, that they forget that they\u2019re talking about actual people,\u201d the Oklahoma resident explained. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted them to remember from reading my letter.\u201d\n\nBrown believes that Obamacare has already saved her life, because it allowed her to receive surgery while she was covered under her mother\u2019s plan as a young adult. \u201cWithout that surgery I would have died a very painful death,\u201d she noted. And with the law\u2019s state-level insurance marketplaces opening to the public, Brown says her life will be saved all over again. She\u2019ll be able to afford her medications and her regular chemotherapy treatments. She\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid another surgery.\n\nBut she\u2019s still disappointed in her lawmakers. Congress ultimately failed to delay Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces from opening for enrollment, but the federal government has still ground to a halt. And in Brown\u2019s home state of Oklahoma, politicians are still resistant to health reform. Some Republicans continue to fight against the health law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, which would help extend coverage to the state\u2019s considerable uninsured population. Seventeen percent of Oklahoma adults don\u2019t have health coverage.\n\n\u201cI am a very proud Oklahoman, and I plan to make my career and raise a family here, but I do not feel that our state elected officials are serving our best interests,\u201d Brown told ThinkProgress, saying she\u2019s \u201cbaffled and saddened\u201d that her elected officials have dug in their heels against health reform.\n\n\u201cThat, to me, is not in the spirit of being an Oklahoman,\u201d she continued. \u201cI grew up in a small western Oklahoma town, where you took sick neighbors casseroles and you offered to watch each other\u2019s children. In short \u2014 you helped out your fellow man. And that\u2019s what Obamacare is about, for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "26-year-old Kendall Brown has a simple message for the lawmakers who keep attacking Obamacare: \"I am dying, because of the political games you are playing right now.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "26-year-old Kendall Brown has a simple message for the lawmakers who keep attacking Obamacare: \"I am dying, because of the political games you are playing right now.\"", "title": "Oklahoma Woman Tells GOP Lawmakers: Without Obamacare, \u2018I Will Be Dead Before My 27th Birthday\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/07/2744411/uninsured-oklahoma-woman-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kendall-brown-e1381174420516.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "26-year-old Kendall Brown has a simple message for the lawmakers who keep attacking Obamacare: \"I am dying, because of the political games you are playing right now.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kendall-brown-e1381174420516-321x214.png", "title": "Oklahoma Woman Tells GOP Lawmakers: Without Obamacare, \u2018I Will Be Dead Before My 27th Birthday\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kendall-brown-e1381174420516.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kendall-brown-e1381174420516.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-07T15:44:46+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecbc\"", "article_summary": "During that time, she could only afford a limited student health plan, and she accumulated thousands of dollars in medical debt.\nHealth Oklahoma Woman Tells GOP Lawmakers: Without Obamacare, \u2018I Will Be Dead Before My 27th Birthday\u2019 CREDIT: Courtesy of Kendall Brown 26-year-old Kendall BrownAs the deadline approached for Congress to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded, Republicans refused to strike a deal unless it defunded or delayed Obamacare.\nSeventeen percent of Oklahoma adults don\u2019t have health coverage.\nNow, a week later, GOP lawmakers still seem unwilling to compromise unless they are able to dismantle some of the health reform law.\nThe Oklahoma resident explained that she was born with Crohn\u2019s Disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that has no cure."}
