And that\u2019s all that\u2019s missing right now. We played a great game for 57 minutes. We were very solid.\u201d\n\nThe Sharks had lost five of their previous six games, and one of them was only 25 hours earlier at Dallas. But defenseman Brent Burns\u2019 second goal of the game, at 18:21 of the third period, broke a 2-2 tie.\n\n\u201cThey took advantage of a bad line change and bad positioning in our D-zone and they scored that winning goal,\u201d Roy said. \u201cBoth teams played hard and both teams played well. It\u2019s just a frustrating situation right now. We do a lot of good things out there. We just can\u2019t get rewarded with it.\u201d\n\nRoy added, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many pucks we\u2019re missing in front of the net, bouncing. It just does not bounce in our favor right now, unfortunately for us. . . We deserved a lot better than we got.\u201d\n\nRoy lodged a coach\u2019s challenge on Burns\u2019 decisive goal, hoping that video review would reveal that the Sharks had interfered with Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov. The goal stood, though, and Roy lost his only timeout. \u201cI thought they bumped into Varly a bit,\u201d Roy said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how much \u2026 At this time of the game, I had no choice, I had to make the call.\u201d\n\nJoe Pavelski\u2019s empty-netter for the Sharks at 18:40 made it 4-2, and Colorado got back within one on Cody McLeod\u2019s goal 15 seconds later. But with Varlamov still out, Colorado couldn\u2019t get the tying goal in the final minute.\n\nAfter going 0-for-14 on the power play on a three-game road trip, the Avalanche twice scored with the man advantage Sunday getting goals from Jarome Iginla and Francois Beauchemin. However, Beauchemin\u2019s first goal of the season canceled out a short-handed Sharks\u2019 goal from Burns only 21 seconds earlier on the same Colorado power play, and the veteran defenseman knocked in the rebound of Gabe Landeskog\u2019s shot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not getting the job done, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s what matters \u2014 whether you get the two points or not,\u201d said Landeskog. \u2018We didn\u2019t tonight. If you look at the game, we played well and we gave a strong effort. We just kind of let them have the game there in the third. We have to be able to mature and take it into overtime and win in overtime or a shootout.\u201d\n\nIf the Avs are so close, how do they get over the hump?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to start blaming anybody,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe all could do a little bit more. We\u2019re all in it together\u2026Right now, it\u2019s just bad bounces and bad decisions at the wrong time.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "San Jose breaks late tie, holds on to defeat Avalanche", "title": "San Jose breaks late tie, holds on to defeat Avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/san-jose-breaks-late-tie-holds-on-to-defeat-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__avs-sharks-hockeyp1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101__avs-sharks-hockeyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T15:48:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T02:52:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey took advantage of a bad line change and bad positioning in our D-zone and they scored that winning goal,\u201d Roy said.\n\u201cI thought they bumped into Varly a bit,\u201d Roy said.\nBut defenseman Brent Burns\u2019 second goal of the game, at 18:21 of the third period, broke a 2-2 tie.\nAnd that\u2019s all that\u2019s missing right now.\nWe\u2019re all in it together\u2026Right now, it\u2019s just bad bounces and bad decisions at the wrong time.\u201dTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei"}
