(Reuters)\n\nAnother week, another cave from Hillary Clinton. The Democratic front-runner came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal last week, a pact she pushed for when she was secretary of state. The question is not whether she\u2019s pandering but how negative the real-world consequences of her pandering will be.\n\nClinton seems keenly sensitive to that question. She has been carefully calibrating her pandering, keeping her options open and the stakes as low as possible \u2014 and often without granting that activists\u2019 ideas even make sense. Because they often don\u2019t, and she almost certainly knows that.\n\nThe TPP is only the latest example. Though Clinton talked up the treaty when she ran the State Department, she announced last week that the agreement doesn\u2019t meet the \u201chigh bar I have set\u201d for trade deals. Yet the TPP may well be off the docket by January 2017, when she would be inaugurated if elected president. Even if it\u2019s not, she hasn\u2019t adopted the anti-trade hyperbole of others in the race. This leaves her rhetorical space to favor a \u201cmodified\u201d TPP or other future trade deals that, she can argue, do meet her standards. Moreover, she put off announcing her opposition until after Congress voted to give President Obama fast-track trade authority, reducing the likelihood that what she says will make any difference to the treaty\u2019s final outcome.\n\nThen there\u2019s Clinton\u2019s positioning on the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Environmental activists have made a mountain out of this climate molehill, turning what should have been a relatively inconsequential infrastructure approval process into a protracted political battle. Years ago, before the debate had intensified, Clinton signaled that she was inclined to approve the pipeline because it wouldn\u2019t seriously contribute to climate change. Last month, she came out against the project \u2014 but she still didn\u2019t give any credence to the argument that its approval would be a major blow to the climate. She merely argued that the proposed pipeline had become a \u201cdistraction\u201d and that the country needed to \u201cmove beyond it.\u201d In other words, opposing the pipeline is a reasonable price to pay in order to eliminate the question and get to the right choices on issues that really matter. Not coincidentally, Clinton released a workmanlike energy infrastructure plan right after announcing opposition to Keystone XL, focusing on modernizing leaky pipelines, reducing oil train derailments and building on the carbon dioxide markets forming in various places \u2014 not on rejecting oil or gas infrastructure.\n\nClinton also gave in last month on Obamacare\u2019s \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d a charge on generous employer-sponsored health-care plans, which currently enjoy favorable tax status, that is meant to discourage over-spending on health-care services. The Cadillac tax is perhaps the most potent cost-containment mechanism in Obamacare, which is why unions don\u2019t like it: They want to keep their handsome benefits packages, even if it means, in effect, using public subsidies to drive up unnecessary health-care costs. Even though even liberal economists back the Cadillac tax, Clinton surrendered to union pressure last month, saying that she favors repealing it. But she added a big caveat: Congress would have to find some way to replace the revenue that the tax would raise, which is necessary to fund Obamacare\u2019s health-coverage expansion.\n\nOnce again, she seems to be pandering to an element of the base in a way that\u2019s relatively costless in policy terms. It\u2019s unlikely Congress would make up that $87 billion. If she wouldn\u2019t get rid of the Cadillac tax absent a reasonable budget offset, it\u2019s a good bet that the tax\u2019s revenues and cost-containment would stay in place.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s approach to pandering isn\u2019t totally costless.\n\nFirst, there are the effects on Clinton\u2019s image: Even if you believe she is making the inevitable compromises necessary to succeed in politics, Clinton can\u2019t pull them off without looking cynical, including to the people she\u2019s trying to placate.\n\nMore importantly, just because it\u2019s unlikely that Congress would come up with $87 billion to repeal the Cadillac tax doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible; at least some lawmakers in both parties seem determined to get rid of the tax. What excuse would Clinton have to refuse if they got a fully-funded repeal bill passed? On the TPP, meanwhile, the fact that all the major Democratic presidential candidates now oppose the trade deal could make it more difficult for Democrats in Congress to vote for it.\n\nAnd, though Clinton seems to be optimizing her pandering to be relatively inconsequential, she\u2019s still indulging activists\u2019 illogic rather than challenging orthodoxies she probably doesn\u2019t buy into \u2014 and, indeed, shouldn\u2019t. At the least, that sets several bad precedents: Showing she can be pushed into interest group-driven decision-making, entrenching orthodoxies that should be resisted and encouraging activists and interests to demand more policy concessions in the future \u2014 even if they prove to be \u201cdistractions\u201d from what Clinton really wants to do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She's surrendering to interest groups, but trying to do it in a relatively harmless way.
