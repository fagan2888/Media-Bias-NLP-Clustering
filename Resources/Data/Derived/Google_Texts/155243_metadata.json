While many will be using a public insurance exchange for the first time, others will return to switch or renew policies. Renewing should be easy, consisting of logging in and updating your personal information, because you have already made the major decisions.\n\nThose entering the marketplace to downgrade, upgrade or buy insurance for the first time will have to give it a little more thought. In addition to the expected complications of switching health insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services reports that consumers will have 25 percent more options this year.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only thing that's changed. Consumers, doctors and insurance agents have all learned a lot over the past year. If you\u2019re getting into the health insurance marketplace for the first time, here\u2019s what\u2019s important to know.\n\nDon\u2019t Panic! This Year Should Go Better\n\nIt\u2019s hard to forget the dismal rollout of the health insurance marketplace last year. But according to the official marketplace blog, healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace that serves 37 states is on top of it. The blog reports some sections of the site are down to \u201cmake improvements and perform maintenance.\u201d\n\nIdaho is the only state with a new exchange of its own, having relied on the federal marketplace last year. On the flipside, Oregon and Nevada will be switching back to healthcare.gov, but with local assistance through a state-run website. Though they're hybrid exchanges, both are considered state-run.\n\nState-run exchanges generally performed better than the federal exchange last year, but all marketplaces are reporting similar improvements. While it\u2019s too soon to tell how well these changes will improve user experience and decrease wait times, those running them seem optimistic.\n\nKnow Those Key Terms\n\n\u201cOne challenge I've experienced in the past year is explaining to some consumers what it all means,\u201d says Diana Polyakov, a certified insurance agent with Covered California, that state\u2019s exchange. \u201cMy role as an insurance agent switched from selling health insurance to teaching or explaining what certain terms mean.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s part of her job, but the duties of an insurance agent should extend far beyond explaining jargon. Coming to a phone call or agent appointment armed with a knowledge of the terminology will save you both time. Plus, you\u2019ll be able to ask the important questions if you already know what key terms mean. You can find them here or in your current health insurance policy guide.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Stroke causes 1 in every 20 deaths in the U.S. It costs the nation $34 billion annually.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Before logging on, find out what\u2019s changed and what we\u2019ve learned from the year\u2019s exchange.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Lacie Glover", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Before logging on, find out what\u2019s changed and what we\u2019ve learned from the year\u2019s exchange.", "title": "How to Approach the Obamacare Marketplace: 2014 Edition", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/06/how-to-approach-the-obamacare-marketplace-2014-edition", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/60/e9/53dd1c7540adbf7198a13b53a3a6/140318-laptoptaxes-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Before logging on, find out what\u2019s changed and what we\u2019ve learned from the year\u2019s exchange.", "card": "summary", "title": "How to Approach the Obamacare Marketplace: 2014 Edition - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/9b6eabf/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F60%2Fe9%2F53dd1c7540adbf7198a13b53a3a6%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140318-laptoptaxes-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],health care reform,health insurance,Affordable Care Act,picks,Lacie Glover", "published_at": "2014-11-06", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-11-06"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3zcs0", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, health insurance, open enrollment, metal tiers"}, "article_summary": "But according to the official marketplace blog, healthcare.gov, the federal marketplace that serves 37 states is on top of it.\nThis Year Should Go BetterIt\u2019s hard to forget the dismal rollout of the health insurance marketplace last year.\nIf you\u2019re getting into the health insurance marketplace for the first time, here\u2019s what\u2019s important to know.\nWhile many will be using a public insurance exchange for the first time, others will return to switch or renew policies.\nState-run exchanges generally performed better than the federal exchange last year, but all marketplaces are reporting similar improvements."}
