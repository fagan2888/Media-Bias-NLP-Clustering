As he mapped out his vision for America, he was called a \u201ccrapweasel president,\u201d a \u201cshameless snake\u201d and a \u201cbad man\u201d giving a \u201cstupid shit\u201d speech.\n\nViewers disagreed, of course, and gave Obama\u2019s address sky-high marks last night.\n\nIf you follow these regular vile eruptions you can\u2019t be surprised. Over the years during Obama\u2019s annual, thoughtful national address, his feral critics have excitedly denounced him in real time as an \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cflippant\u201d \u201cjerk.\u201d He was \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cthin-skinned,\u201d \u201ccocky and snide\u201d; \u201cpatronizing,\u201d \u201cdemagogic,\u201d \u201cunpresidential,\u201d and really, really \u201carrogant.\u201d And he often gave a \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cCastro-like,\u201d \u201cevil speech.\u201d\n\nBy all indications Obama\u2019s final year in office is going to feature a never-ending geyser from the far-right press, where every move and utterance from the president is met with overwrought name-calling and desperate cries of help. His critics have bronzed and memorialized the art of indignation. (And also berated the president\u2019s wife, endlessly.)\n\nIt must be exhausting.\n\nIt\u2019s only the second week of January and already, aside from the State of the Union outburst, we witnessed the weird and childish media attacks on the president after he teared up in public while remembering child victims of gun violence. (\u201cCheck that podium for like a raw onion \u2026 It\u2019s not really believable.\u201d)\n\nJust four weeks ago two Fox News talkers were suspended, one for calling the president of the United States a \u201cpussy\u201d on national television, the other for claiming, on the same day, that Obama just didn\u2019t \u201cgive a shit\u201d about combating terrorism.\n\nIt\u2019s classic Obama Derangement Syndrome: the inability of adults to rationally deal with the actions of the Democratic president. Remember the collective 2014 meltdown when Obama appeared on comedian Zach Galifianakis\u2019 comedy show? (It was \u201cdreadful\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d) When he ordered \u201cspicy mustard\u201d on his hamburger? (\u201cWhat kind of man orders a cheeseburger without ketchup but Dijon mustard?\u201d) Or when feverish critics blamed Obama for golfing when an earthquake hit the East Coast of America?\n\nAnd note we\u2019re not talking about anonymous online commenters, or a group chat of College Republicans. We\u2019re talking about people who are supposed to be leading lights within the conservative movement. But it turns out they\u2019re immune to intellectual pursuits when it comes to Obama.\n\nThe amazing part is very little of this batty behavior seems to disqualify the participants in the eyes of the elite Beltway media. There seems to be few baseless allegations or insults that critics can hurl at Obama (or Hillary Clinton) these days that\u2019s deemed out of bounds, which of course only fuels the spoiled-rotten behavior.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judging from its response to his State of the Union, we're looking at 12 months of uninterrupted right-wing outrage", "title": "Obama Derangement Syndrome is terminal: The GOP is going to make the next year a living hell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Judging from its response to his State of the Union, we're looking at 12 months of uninterrupted right-wing outrage", "title": "Obama Derangement Syndrome is terminal: The GOP is going to make the next year a living hell", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/obama_derangement_syndrome_is_terminal_the_gop_is_going_to_make_the_next_year_a_living_hell_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/Obama_Biden_Ryan3_2016sotu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judging from its response to his State of the Union, we're looking at 12 months of uninterrupted right-wing outrage", "title": "Obama Derangement Syndrome is terminal: The GOP is going to make the next year a living hell", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/Obama_Biden_Ryan3_2016sotu.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Boehlert", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Fox News, Media Matters, Nikki Haley, Obama Derangement Sydrome", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2449\"", "article_summary": "Viewers disagreed, of course, and gave Obama\u2019s address sky-high marks last night.\nIt\u2019s classic Obama Derangement Syndrome: the inability of adults to rationally deal with the actions of the Democratic president.\n(\u201cWhat kind of man orders a cheeseburger without ketchup but Dijon mustard?\u201d) Or when feverish critics blamed Obama for golfing when an earthquake hit the East Coast of America?\nThe amazing part is very little of this batty behavior seems to disqualify the participants in the eyes of the elite Beltway media.\nRemember the collective 2014 meltdown when Obama appeared on comedian Zach Galifianakis\u2019 comedy show?"}
