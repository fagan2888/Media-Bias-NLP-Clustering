According to Star Tribune, the final vote was 17 in favor and 13 opposed when the bill needed a minimum approval by at least two-thirds of the senators.\n\nAccording to an earlier report by The Inquisitr, the controversial bill was put forward by senator Bruce Burns mainly due to the fact that \u201cstates are finding it increasingly harder to obtain the right mix of drugs required for the lethal injection from suppliers.\u201d The current state law has lethal injection as their main form of execution, and according to The Examiner, the gas chamber is listed as the \u201cbackup\u201d method.\n\nBurns stated that it is indeed becoming harder and harder for some states to get the drugs required for a lethal injection, and he also believes that building a gas chamber might not be worth the expense \u201cfor the rare executions Wyoming does have\u201d.\n\nAccording to Christian Science Monitor, Wyoming only has one inmate on death row at the moment. Dale Wayne Eaton is currently appealing the death sentence that he received in 2004 for the rape and murder of 18-year-old Lisa Marie Kimmell of Billings, Montana. The report continued on to state that the Wyoming firing squad bill isn\u2019t the first of its kind. This form of execution was reportedly brought up in Missouri too.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an attempt to time-warp back into the 1850s or the wild, wild West or anything like that,\u201d said Missouri state Rep. Rick Brattin, who this month proposed making firing squads an option for executions. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I foresee a problem, and I\u2019m trying to come up with a solution that will be the most humane yet most economical for our state.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Inquisitr, Burns talked more Monday on his thought process behind the Wyoming firing squad bill.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I chose firing squad as opposed to any other form of execution is because frankly it\u2019s one of the cheapest for the state. The expense of building a gas chamber I think would be prohibitive when you consider how many people would be executed by it, and even the cost of gallows.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind the Wyoming firing squad as a form of execution has stirred up quite the controversy. What do you think about using a firing squad for execution purposes?
