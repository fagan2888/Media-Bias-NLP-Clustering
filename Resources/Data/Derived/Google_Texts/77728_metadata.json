Three of the five declared candidates attended: State Senator Joni Ernst (R-Red Oak, Scott Schaben of Ames, and former U.S. Attorney and Hawkeye Football standout Matt Whitaker of Ankeny were present. Talk show radio host and college professor Sam Clovis of Hinton and former Grassley Chief of Staff David Young of Van Meter were unable to attend the event.\n\nIFFC President Steve Scheffler encouraged those in present to not only attend the 2014 Iowa Caucus, but to sign-up as delegates to their county conventions. He noted that those affiliated with Mitt Romney were planning on making a push in 2016, but Scheffler said 2014 can\u2019t be overlooked, especially since they are not as well attended. They asked people to pledge to not only attend, but also to work to become delegates.\n\nAll three candidates were given five minutes to give opening remarks. All three gave their standard stump speech. State Senator Ernst spoke first describing herself as a \u201cmom, a solider, and a conservative.\u201d She outlined her experience as a battalion commander in the Iowa Army National Guard and as a county auditor. She emphasized that she was pro-life, pro-traditional marriage and pro-2nd Amendment.\n\nMatt Whitaker shared his biography from playing for former Iowa Hawkeyes Head Football Coach Hayden Fry to his five-year stint as U.S. Attorney under President George W. Bush. He discussed how Washington\u2019s current policies impacted him as a small business owner with 16 employees. Whitaker also started his own law firm in Des Moines with Bill Gustoff and State Representative Chris Hagenow (R-Windsor Heights).\n\nScott Schaben shared his experience working for family to getting into car sales. He said that he would be the candidate who could reach beyond the Republican Party\u2019s base.\n\nSam Clovis and David Young did not have anyone available to speak on their behalf.\n\nThe evening ran late with the Q&A section of the forum with each candidate having the opportunity to answer questions from members of the audience.\n\nThe first question was about foreign companies purchasing American companies and the impact that has on jobs. In particular the Smithville Foods acquisition and what it meant for pork producers.\n\nNext candidates were asked about quantitative easing.\n\nThe next question was on what they would do to address the problem of human trafficking in the United States.\n\nThen the candidates were asked about what they thought about the principle of \u201cnullification\u201d as a response to addressing Federal overreach. There was interesting interaction between Matt Whitaker and the man who asked the question. This was probably one of the more lively interactions of the evening.\n\nAnother audience member asked the candidates about the use of drones in Iowa.\n\nCandidates were then asked if they would allow themselves to take the exception to Obamacare that has been given to Congress.\n\nTom Coates of Norwalk asked the candidates about immigration reform and border security.\n\nOttumwa Pastor and Iowa GOP State Central Committee Member Mark Doland asked the candidates about their position on the IRS trying to restrict political speech in the pulpit.\n\nThere were two more questions asked (unfortunately due to technical issue video was not taken) of the candidates. The candidates were asked their thoughts on the Federal involvement in education and the Common Core State Standards. Ernst said that she was not in favor of the standards. \u201cThe Federal government should not be involved,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cWe need to have standards, but we don\u2019t need the Common Core.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also opposes the Common Core. \u201cThe Federal government does not belong in education,\u201d Whitaker said. He mentioned the college professors who were on the validation committee who could not sign off on it. He described the Common Core as a \u201cone-size-fits-all, cram-it-down-your-throat\u201d reform. He said that lawmakers should be focused on school choice instead.\n\nSchaben said that the Common Core represented another attempt of the Feds \u201creaching beyond to where they should not go.\u201d He said the Common Core will lead to the \u201cdumbing down of kids in Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe candidates were asked about the marriage debate. Schaben said that he doesn\u2019t discriminate against homosexual. \u201cI am ok with gay marriage,\u201d Schaben said. He said he wants to appeal to a broader base and homosexuals are a part of that.\n\nErnst reiterated that she was for traditional marriage between one man and one woman. He reminded the audience that she was a co-sponsor for the Marriage amendment in the Iowa Senate.\n\nWhitaker also said he was for traditional marriage. He took a shot at Schaben saying that he disagreed with him, and that his faith does not allow him to hold that position. \u201cIf we start saying there are more important things than life and marriage we might as well elect a Democrat,\u201d Whitaker stated.\n\nTo close out the evening the candidates were asked whether they would support a budget that includes a dime of funding for Obamacare. Each candidates present said no.\n\nCoretha Rozendaal of Monroe told Caffeinated Thoughts that she came undecided and was leaving undecided. She still had not had the opportunity to meet and hear Sam Clovis or David Young. \u201cThere were two very polished candidates (Ernst and Whitaker) and one who wasn\u2019t so polished (Schaben),\u201d Rozendaal said. She said all gave some good answers.\n\nTom Coats of Norwalk believed that Matt Whitaker had the strongest performance of the evening. \u201cMatt displayed the greatest depth of all of these issues,\u201d Coats said. \u201cHe gained big points on his quantitative easing answer.\u201d\n\nCoats said he wished the other two candidates would have been able to attend. \u201cI especially wanted to hear Sam Clovis, he would have spiced it up more.\u201d Coats emphasized that this was an important election and was thankful for forums like the one IFFC held to get as much input from grassroots supporters.\n\nJonas Cutler of West Des Moines also believed Whitaker had the strongest appearance. \u201cWhitaker came across the most polished,\u201d Cutler said. He was especially impressed with his answer on drone surveillance. \u201cIt was nice to see the candidates differentiate themselves; with a longer forum we can go more in depth with the issues,\u201d he added.\n\nScheffler said Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition planed to have additional forums with the candidates so more voters can get to know them.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2013/09/gop-u-s-senate-candidates-appeal-central-iowa-social-conservatives/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-3-1024x768.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2013-09-10T21:31:43+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "iowa faith & freedom coalition, iowa u.s. senate race, joni ernst, matt whitaker, scott schaben, social conservatives, steve scheffler, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition held a U.S. Senate candidate forum where social conservatives heard from Joni Ernst, Scott Schaben and Matt Whitaker.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition held a U.S. Senate candidate forum where social conservatives heard from Joni Ernst, Scott Schaben and Matt Whitaker.", "title": "GOP U.S. Senate Candidates Appeal to Central Iowa Social Conservatives | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-3-1024x768.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-10T16:36:31-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2013/09/gop-u-s-senate-candidates-appeal-central-iowa-social-conservatives/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition held a U.S. Senate candidate forum where social conservatives heard from Joni Ernst, Scott Schaben and Matt Whitaker.", "title": "GOP U.S. Senate Candidates Appeal to Central Iowa Social Conservatives | Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-3.jpg", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2013-09-10T16:31:43-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Iowa News & Politics", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T16:36:31-05:00", "tag": "Steve Scheffler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf923\"", "article_summary": "The candidates were asked their thoughts on the Federal involvement in education and the Common Core State Standards.\n\u201cWe need to have standards, but we don\u2019t need the Common Core.\u201dWhitaker also opposes the Common Core.\n\u201cThere were two very polished candidates (Ernst and Whitaker) and one who wasn\u2019t so polished (Schaben),\u201d Rozendaal said.\n(Windsor Heights, IA) Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition held a Republican U.S. Senate candidate forum at Walnut Creek Community Church in Windsor Heights, IA with approximately 105 social conservatives from around Central Iowa.\nOttumwa Pastor and Iowa GOP State Central Committee Member Mark Doland asked the candidates about their position on the IRS trying to restrict political speech in the pulpit."}
