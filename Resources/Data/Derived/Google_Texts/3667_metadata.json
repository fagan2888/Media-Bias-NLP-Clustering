Mary!\u201d as their senator of 18 years, Mary Landrieu, took the stage with her family to concede the runoff race to Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA).\n\nIn her speech, Landrieu highlighted accomplishments of her three terms, such as securing federal dollars for coastal restoration and passing the Affordable Care Act, which she said will live on even after she leaves the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known that we\u2019re fighting for a stronger state, a state that\u2019s more committed to justice, openness and opportunity, regardless of where you were born, what zip code you were born into, or the color of your skin,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may not have won tonight, but we certainly have won some extraordinary victories.\u201d\n\nAs the last Democrat and the last woman in statewide office, Landrieu\u2019s widely-predicted loss will have a major impact on Louisiana and the nation, giving Republicans a 54-46 majority in the Senate next year.\n\nJody Gates and Marilyn McConnell, a couple from New Orleans who are both retired healthcare workers, told ThinkProgress that they fear Cassidy\u2019s opposition to women\u2019s equality and reproductive rights, citing his votes against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Violence Against Women Act and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible, and if I had young children, I would live in fear,\u201d Gates said.\n\nLandrieu supporters Jody Gates and Marilyn McConnell. CREDIT: Kira Lerner\n\nAfter the general election in November, national Democratic groups pulled back spending and advertising dollars from Landrieu\u2019s campaign as the odds of her reelection dwindled. Still, the race shaped up to be the most expensive in the state\u2019s history, with Cassidy ultimately drawing more support from outside groups in the final stretch.\n\nLandrieu raised and spent several million dollars more in the race, funded by major donations from Exxon and other fossil fuel corporations.\n\nBut money was not the only factor at play in the race. Democratic party strategist James Carville, who attended Landrieu\u2019s election night party, told ThinkProgress the outcome was \u201cobviously part of a trend nationally\u201d of voters turning against President Obama and his party, a trend he says he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cMy state, the state that I love, has done a colossally dumb thing, here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis week we\u2019ve had unbelievable news on the economy, health care, the deficit is shrinking. We\u2019re insuring more people for less money. For the life of me, I wish people would tell me what they\u2019re mad about.\u201d\n\nThough most analysts have focused on the rising anti-Obama sentiment that drove several long-serving Democrats out of office in the South, several voters complained to ThinkProgress that Cassidy and Landrieu were too similar when it came to energy and the environment.\n\nAs she lagged in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign, Landrieu threw herself behind a single goal\u2014forcing approval of the Keystone XL pipeline before the State Department finished its determination of whether the project is in the US\u2019 national interest. Not only did the bill fail, the move alienated voters concerned with the impact of the oil and gas industry on the coastline and the climate.\n\nSteve Estopinal, the president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority, which is currently embroiled in a lawsuit against a number of major oil and gas companies over the degradation of the coastal wetlands, said neither candidate is on his side when it comes to holding the industry accountable.\n\n\u201cThe other party was just as much in bed with the oil industry as the Republican Party,\u201d he told ThinkProgress. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a party thing.\u201d\n\nGreg Lemons, the mayor of the city of Abita Springs, agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a Democrat running, a very seasoned, good person who\u2019s done a lot of things for Louisiana,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she\u2019s all oil and gas. Then you\u2019ve got a Republican who in his ads says he wants to \u2018unleash\u2019 the oil and gas companies. It\u2019s not a matter of unleashing, it\u2019s a matter of controlling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "As the last Democrat and the last woman in statewide office, Landrieu\u2019s widely-predicted loss will have a major impact on Louisiana.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "As the last Democrat and the last woman in statewide office, Landrieu\u2019s widely-predicted loss will have a major impact on Louisiana.", "title": "Louisiana\u2019s Last Woman In Statewide Office Loses Her Seat", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/12/07/3600449/mary-landrieu-loses/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSCN3583.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the last Democrat and the last woman in statewide office, Landrieu\u2019s widely-predicted loss will have a major impact on Louisiana.", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSCN3583-321x214.jpg", "title": "Louisiana\u2019s Last Woman In Statewide Office Loses Her Seat", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSCN3583.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSCN3583.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-07T09:05:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabe4\"", "article_summary": "Politics Louisiana\u2019s Last Woman In Statewide Office Loses Her Seat CREDIT: Alice OllsteinNEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA \u2014 A crowd of supporters in the packed ballroom of the posh Roosevelt Hotel Saturday night chanted \u201cMary!\n\u201cThe other party was just as much in bed with the oil industry as the Republican Party,\u201d he told ThinkProgress.\nThen you\u2019ve got a Republican who in his ads says he wants to \u2018unleash\u2019 the oil and gas companies.\n\u201cMy state, the state that I love, has done a colossally dumb thing, here,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a Democrat running, a very seasoned, good person who\u2019s done a lot of things for Louisiana,\u201d he said."}
