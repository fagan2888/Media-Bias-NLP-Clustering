And just moments after the announcement, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) answered back with what is doubtless the most perfectly-timed meme ever.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, one of the giant Olympic rings failed to open as planned, leaving a flower-like shape where the top right ring should have been. It was likely the most publicly visible example of the problems that have been plaguing the Sochi Games.\n\nAnd after the seemingly endless delays and glitches in the Obamacare rollout, Cantor suggested that the Olympic ring failure should be the new logo of the ACA.\n\nAnother day, another delay. This should be ObamaCare's new logo: pic.twitter.com/4HGd4zXkMk \u2014 Eric Cantor (@EricCantor) February 10, 2014\n\nWell played, Cantor.
