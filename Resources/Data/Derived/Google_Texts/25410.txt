(WBNG Binghamton) Thousands across the country hoping to sign up for new health insurance online have been experiencing delays, including in right here in New York, a state experiencing a high volume of shoppers.

Officials from the New York State Department of Health addressed the concerns of the controversial Affordable Care Act early Thursday, saying it is continuing to work to improve access and navigation.

"Additional servers were added on Tuesday and Wednesday to enhance capacity, and software upgrades to enhance performance have been completed. Technicians monitor visits to the site 24/7 for quality control purposes, to identify issues and to inform performance improvement measures. There is no indication of any intentional efforts to overwhelm the site." said Donna Frescatore, the executive director.

Despite the computer delays, Frescatore declared that the state saw the highest level of activity of any state.

Since the launch on October 1, the state health department had more than 44,000 people actively shop on the site at nystateofhealth.ny.gov.

Experts predicted that 1.1 million New Yorkers will obtain health insurance through NY State of Health by 2016.
