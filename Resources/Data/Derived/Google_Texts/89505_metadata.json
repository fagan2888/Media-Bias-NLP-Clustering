(ABSW), is looking for residents to get involved.\n\nThe nonprofit organization was founded to seek more effective governance and local representation for South Walton. Along with exploring South Walton\u2019s options, ABSW has created a survey to be distributed throughout the community to determine the issues most important to the citizens and what they value.\n\n\u201cCommunity input is critical to us as we move forward,\u201d A Better South Walton Vice President Dave Rauschkolb, said.\n\nThe survey will provide citizens with the opportunity to weigh in on\n\ninfrastructure, governmental representation, natural resources, public services, the built environment and more.\n\nIn a press release, David Pleat, president of ABSW said, \"After months of searching for experts to author the study and much careful consideration, ABSW has hired Bill Underwood, of Underwood Management Services Group, Inc. and Jon Moyle of the Moyle Law Firm to complete the study document. Underwood\u2019s strong economic and fiscal analysis background was key to our decision, and Moyle\u2019s deep North Florida roots combined with his extensive work throughout Florida\u2019s communities made his firm a good choice. We are currently\n\nfinalizing an agreement with the John Scott Dailey Florida Institute of Government at the University of Central Florida to review the study when it is complete. We look forward to bringing a fully vetted and reliable feasibility study to the citizens of South Walton in the coming months.\"\n\nThe study will also be reviewed by the Florida League of Cities, a non-partisan organization that promotes success in local governance.\n\nTo take the survey, you can find a link attached to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The group, A Better South Walton, is looking for public input on the future of their community.", "language": "english", "author": "Cristina Pfeffer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/A-Better-South-Walton-seeks-public-input-from-residents-373644551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/326*315/a+better+sowal.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The group, A Better South Walton, is looking for public input on the future of their community.", "title": "'A Better South Walton' seeks public input from residents"}, "twitter": {"description": "The group, A Better South Walton, is looking for public input on the future of their community.", "title": "'A Better South Walton' seeks public input from residents", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/A-Better-South-Walton-seeks-public-input-from-residents-373644551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/326*315/a+better+sowal.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "'A Better South Walton' seeks public input from residents", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "A Better South Walton seeks"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCommunity input is critical to us as we move forward,\u201d A Better South Walton Vice President Dave Rauschkolb, said.\nThe group, A Better South Walton, Inc.
