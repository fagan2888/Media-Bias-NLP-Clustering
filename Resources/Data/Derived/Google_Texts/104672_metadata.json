Gerhart took the cooperative over after he determined the nonprofit\u2019s claims would exceed its available cash.\n\nCoOportunity hit a cash flow crunch after a provision adopted by Congress reduced its assets. It insured about 120,000 people in Iowa and Nebraska, according to Associated Press reports.\n\nIn a statement released by his office, Gerhart said: \u201cThe federal government has tried to jump to the head of the creditor line, but is not following Iowa or federal law in withholding over $20 million due to CoOportunity. We are hopeful for a quick resolution in this matter and look forward to continued collaboration with the federal government in other matters during the continued wind down of CoOportunity.\u201d\n\nThe disagreement centers on the federal government\u2019s position that they have \u201csuper-priority\u201d ahead of all others creditors, including those with policyholder level claims, in CoOportunity\u2019s receivership.\n\nThe federal government loaned $147 million to CoOportunity to capitalize the new entry (2014) in the healthcare market in Iowa and Nebraska.\n\nThe lawsuit claims HHS/CMS contractually agreed to make those loans subordinate to policyholder level claims in the case of the $14.7 million start-up loan and to all other creditors under the $132 million insolvency loans.\n\nSeparate from those loans, the federal government owes CoOportunity another $130 million in \u201cRisk Corridor\u201d funds under the Affordable Care Act, a program designed to mitigate risks for insurers in the new ACA insurance market, the suit alleges.\n\nGerhart notes, \u201cThe federal government is unilaterally reducing or holding payments owed to CoOportunity, ignoring the fact thatCoOportunity is owed $130 million in \u2018Risk Corridor\u2019 funds alone.\u201d\n\nAlthough HHS/CMS recently filed a proof of claim in the Iowa state court liquidation proceeding, the federal government also claims it is not subject to the authority of the Iowa court, forcing the Liquidator to seek resolution of the issues in federal court in Iowa.\n\nA status report has been filed with the Polk County District Court overseeing CoOportunity\u2019s liquidation by the Liquidator\u2019s Special Deputy.\n\nThe report notified the Court: 1) that the Liquidator has denied HHS/CMS\u2019 Proof of Claim due to its self-help actions prejudicing policyholder and other creditors and 2) the Liquidator had filed the declaratory judgment action seeking relief in Iowa federal court.\n\nThe suit seeks the application of Iowa law to control the priority of creditor claims in the CoOportunity estate.\n\nIn the event the court concludes that HHS/CMS are authorized to reduce certain payments under federal law, Gerhart asks that the government follow its netting regulation, which does not include the start-up and solvency loans as debts which can be netted, and to recognize the fact that loans are contractually subordinated to policyholder and other claims.\n\n\u201cBecause the issues involved are ones of first impression under the Affordable Care Act which also created the CO-OPs, and there is a lot of money involved, there\u2019s political pressure on the government to recover loan funds. So they are forcing the issue by holding onto money rightfully due CoOportunity,\u201d Gerhart said. \u201cThe fact is, if the government paid CoOportunity what it is owed, the government would get paid back nearly $100 million on the loans.\u201d\n\nSource: Iowa Department of Insurance\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick\u00a0Gerhart says federal health officials are unlawfully withholding millions of dollars owed to a failed health insurance co-", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick\u00a0Gerhart says federal health officials are unlawfully withholding millions of dollars owed to a failed health insurance co-", "title": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Sues Feds Over Failed Health Co-Op", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2016-05-23T12:43:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2016/05/23/409568.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick\u00a0Gerhart says federal health officials are unlawfully withholding millions of dollars owed to a failed health insurance co-", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "title": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Sues Feds Over Failed Health Co-Op", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2016-05-23", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "Midwest News", "tag": "receivership", "published_time": "2016-05-23T12:31:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T12:43:12-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart says federal health officials are unlawfully withholding millions of dollars owed to a failed health insurance co-op in his state.\nSo they are forcing the issue by holding onto money rightfully due CoOportunity,\u201d Gerhart said.\nWest Des Moines-based CoOportunity was a federally funded nonprofit established to provide health care in Iowa and Nebraska.\nGerhart, who is Liquidator for CoOportunity Health, filed suit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in United States District Court in Iowa.\nThe federal government loaned $147 million to CoOportunity to capitalize the new entry (2014) in the healthcare market in Iowa and Nebraska."}
