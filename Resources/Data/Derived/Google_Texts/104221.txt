Shaun McCutcheon, the plaintiff in a case that led to a Supreme Court decision last week ruling a major limit on campaign donations unconstitutional, said Sunday that he does support caps on donations to individual candidates.

Speaking on NBC's "Meet The Press," McCutcheon said that he doesn't believe it's unconstitutional to set limits on donations to individual candidates, but added that he does think current limits are too low.

"I've been saying the whole time that some base limits made some sense, but itâ€™s a low number because you can't buy any ads with $5200," McCutcheon said. The $5200 figure refers to two $2600 caps on the amount anyone can give to an individual candidate for primary and general elections.

The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in McCutcheon v. FEC that limits on the total amounts that individuals can donate to party committees and federal candidates, which had been set at $123,200 total and $48,600 for candidates specifically, are unconstitutional.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said he believed all limits on campaign donations, including limits on donations to individual candidates, are unconstitutional.
