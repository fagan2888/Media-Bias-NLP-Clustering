But often as not, we make jokes about poor-memory moments to hide a nagging fear \u2014 a fear that we might be one of the estimated 500,000 people who will be diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the United States this year.\n\nAn Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is all too real for the Kniesel family of Granite Bay. When 23-year-old Jennifer Kniesel\u2019s grandmother, Kathleen Riolo, developed symptoms of early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s around her 50th birthday, Kniesel and her parents didn\u2019t recognize the signs.\n\n\u201cMy mom started dressing differently, and soon she stopped driving on the freeway, taking long routes on surface streets instead,\u201d said Tracy Kniesel, Jennifer\u2019s mother.\n\nToday Mrs. Riolo doesn\u2019t recognize her daughter, her granddaughters or anyone else.\n\nAnd seeing the ravages of late-stage Alzheimer\u2019s on her now 72-year-old grandmother led Jennifer to a decision \u2013 a decision that has already raised thousands of dollars for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, and will likely raise hundreds of thousands in the years to come.\n\nShe started an event to raise money for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and research into the disease, which is the sixth leading cause of death in this country and, unlike cancer, has no means of prevention. There is also, at present, no possibility of a cure.\n\nThe awareness and fundraising event that Jennifer created will happen on Saturday, Aug. 15, and it\u2019s called Auto\u2019s (sic) for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nYou may have heard the Kniesel name in relation to auto collision centers. The family has a long love affair with cars, which includes Jennifer\u2019s grandfather, who raced, and later built racecar engines.\n\nLittle wonder then that Jennifer, who helps run the family business, Utopia Auto Body, turned to car enthusiasts for help.\n\nThe third-annual Auto\u2019s for Alzheimer\u2019s will more than double in size this year, showcasing hundreds of cars \u2013 many that can be found at the Sacramento Autorama and Hot August Nights in Reno.\n\n\u201cI grew up around cars and my grandma loved cars, too,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cI thought, \u2018What could I do that I know a lot about?\u2019\u201d\n\nLast year Jennifer had to turn car entries away due to the event\u2019s popularity. This year the group will use grassy areas at Rusch Park in Citrus Heights, with room for hundreds of the hottest pre-1975 cars around.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see everything from 1930s Fords to muscle cars,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a wide variety, and anyone can enter a car 1975 or older. My favorites last year were the black Willies and the beautiful 1963 split-window Corvette. Admission is free and it\u2019s a great way to spend a Saturday.\u201d\n\nWork behind the scenes to pull off the event takes a team. Organizing raffle prizes, from hotel stays to high-end televisions, signed sports memorabilia and more requires the whole family, including mom, dad (Rick), and teen sisters Makayla and Rachael.\n\n\u201cMy sisters are my minions,\u201d Jennifer said with a laugh.\n\nOn a more serious subject, both mom and daughter became emotional.\n\n\u201cMy grandma would pick me up from school and I would spend hours at her house,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cI spent a lot of time being angry about the disease. I really shut down for a while. My grandma is the nicest person you could meet and it\u2019s so hard to think of all the memories that she\u2019s missing out on.\u201d\n\nTracy said she was proud of her eldest daughter\u2019s accomplishments in spreading Alzheimer\u2019s awareness.\n\n\u201cJennifer said she wanted to do something to honor grandma,\u201d Tracy recounted, taking a moment to reign in emotion. \u201cThey say you don\u2019t remember days, you remember moments. It\u2019s amazing how one person (Jennifer\u2019s grandma) can touch so many lives. Alzheimer\u2019s has robbed my girls of their grandma.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
