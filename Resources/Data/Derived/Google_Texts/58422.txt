NEWARK — The Port Authority and two advocacy groups have reached a settlement in a seven-year-old lawsuit over disabled access to the Grove Street PATH station.

The two groups, Heightened Independence and Progress, Inc., and the United Spinal Association, claimed the Port Authority's renovation of the station in Jersey City completed in 2005 violated federal law by not including an elevator for disabled individuals.

The Port Authority claimed in court filings that the statute of limitations had run out before the groups filed the lawsuit, but a judge disagreed.

In a document filed Thursday, the Port Authority agreed to construct an elevator at the southwest entrance to the station and a passenger vertical platform lift on the west side of the station. The additions are to be completed within three years.
