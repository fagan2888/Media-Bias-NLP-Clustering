Kathleen Arberg, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, said there were also about 20 seats for people to rotate into the room and watch up to five minutes of the proceedings.\n\nArguments were expected to start shortly after 10 a.m.\n\nGeorge Altshuler, a 26-year-old teacher from Washington, said he joined the line around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday with his girlfriend and her co-workers. They held a spot somewhere between No. 24 and No. 30 \u2014 someone in line had made a list \u2014 braving a March night to witness what Mr. Altshuler called \u201ca quintessential D.C. experience.\u201d He said he hoped the justices would not rule in favor of the challengers to the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have that in the back of my mind, that I don\u2019t have to have health care through my job necessarily,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo\n\nA large crowd of demonstrators gathered on the steps in front of the court as the oral arguments approached, listening to people affected by the health care law talk about their experiences.\n\nStanding near handmade signs that read \u201cThe ACA Saved My Life,\u201d Adam Kelley, of South Berwick, Me., became emotional recounting how being laid off from his job caused his family\u2019s health insurance premiums to skyrocket as he battled Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI feel safe knowing I cannot be discriminated against for having an incurable illness,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m proof that the Affordable Care Act is working.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of a line delineated by a banner declaring \u201cKeep the IRS Out of My Health Care,\u201d a handful of the law\u2019s opponents waved signs and listened to speeches from a few conservative members of Congress.\n\nRepresentative Steve King, an Iowa Republican who has been one of the most active opponents of the health care law, said Congress was willing to find a new way to insure those who would lose their coverage without the law.\n\n\u201cWhere were they before Obamacare was, in such an ugly way, implemented?\u201d he said. \u201cThey got retooled to get into Obamacare. They can get retooled to get into another system along the way.\u201d\n\nJust under three years after the court first weighed in on the health care law, the justices on Wednesday will hear a second major challenge to Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. At issue this time is whether the law bars the federal government from providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance in states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges.\n\nWhen the law was challenged in 2012, the line outside the court formed three days before the start of the three-day series of oral arguments, with those hoping for a seat braving drenching rains under umbrellas and tarps.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a cold rain fell on Capitol Hill as the line formed on the sidewalk in front of the court. The first two people said they had gotten in line around 3 p.m., about 19 hours before oral arguments were set to begin.\n\nThey and several others who lined up behind them declined to be interviewed further. People standing farther back in the line identified many of those near the front \u2014 perhaps around 20 people \u2014 as place-holders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPaid line-standers are one of Washington\u2019s many quirks. For $40 an hour, for instance, a company called Washington Express will pay someone to hold a customer\u2019s place in line, outside a crowded congressional hearing or, say, the Supreme Court.\n\nBut more than a few people were holding spots for themselves. John Osborn, a pediatrician from Fairfax, Va., huddled in line with the hood of his green raincoat pulled up. Dr. Osborn said he had come out to see how the court would handle a question critical to his patients.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, I take care of complicated kids, and a lot of them lose their coverage if this occurs, if it goes down, and so the impact of that is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly problematic for children\u2019s hospitals. It\u2019s particularly problematic for kids with multiple problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150304085819, "twitter": {"description": "About 70 people were in line by 6
