On Monday, the city will pay further homage with its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Marade.\n\nWATCH DPTV: Denver Freedom Riders founder talks about what he saw in Ferguson\n\nThis year, the march, from City Park to Civic Center downtown, is only part of what community activists like Grimes hope will lead to the kind of change envisioned by King. On Saturday, youth from around the city met with Mayor Michael Hancock and other city officials. Following Monday\u2019s Marade, a crowd of more than 1,000 people are expected to attend the \u201cBlack Lives Matter Conference\u201d at the McNichols Civic Center Building, 144 W. Colfax Ave.\n\n\u201cWe just want to take all that energy (from the Marade) and bring it all to one central location,\u201d said Quincy Shannon, one of the conference organizers.\n\n\u201cWe want to take all this emotion and translate it into action.\u201d\n\nAfter the deaths of Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Garner in Staten Island, N.Y., Denver saw a series of protests in late November and early December that included downtown marches and walkouts by students at a number of area schools.\n\nThe actions had an immediate impact, with Hancock scheduling a series of forums to discuss the state of race relations in the city.\n\nSince then, Grimes said his group, the Denver Freedom Riders, and others have reached out to city officials and the office of Gov. John Hickenlooper in an effort to ensure that the momentum built over the last few months remains more than an echo.\n\n\u201cMost (officials) seem open to discussion, but we really won\u2019t know for sure until substantive change happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a raw energy out there. \u2026 Ferguson transformed us all, and we can make Denver a better city because of it.\u201d\n\nAnthony Cotton: 303-954-1292, acotton@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ anthonycottondp\n\nEvents\n\n\u2022 Aurora Motorcade \u2014 7:30 a.m. Participants gather at Aurora Municipal Center and travel to Fletcher Plaza, 9898 E.
