For example:\n\n11 counties offer low-cost medical care to undocumented immigrants, some of which offer such care just to seriously ill patients; and\n\n47 counties do not consider the law to apply to undocumented immigrants.\n\nUndocumented immigrants who do not qualify for no-cost or subsidized coverage can seek treatment at emergency departments, according to the Times. However, such care costs the state billions of dollars.\n\nSome experts say that undocumented residents' dependence on EDs could undermine potential savings under the Affordable Care Act. As such, advocates are urging state and county officials to develop plans to improve access to care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nCounties Weigh Changes to Undocumented Care Policies\n\nSome counties that have not offered medical services to undocumented immigrants now are considering changes to their policies.\n\nFor example, the Sacramento Board of Supervisors is considering a plan to provide primary and specialty care to about 10,000 of the county's 50,000 undocumented immigrants. The care would be provided on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nHowever, others counties -- such as San Bernardino -- have said they do not plan to provide health coverage to undocumented residents, in part because of cost concerns.\n\nGabrielle Lessard, a health policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, said some counties likely would be hesitant to expand health care to undocumented immigrants because of state funding cuts for such services.\n\nAccording to the Times, the state collected a total of $900 million from counties to help finance parts of the ACA.\n\nAlex Briscoe, director of Alameda County's Health Care Services Agency, said those cuts could result in \"one of the unintended consequences\" of the ACA: reducing services for the uninsured. He noted that Alameda County lost 80% of its $51 million annual budget for the program (Karlamangla, Los Angeles Times, 6/11).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Varying interpretations of a California law have led to disparities in access to health care for undocumented residents.
