Time to stop this politically incorrect nonsense worrying about other people\u2019s feelings, pull out all the stops and start fighting for the survival of this country and our way of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince our Commander in Chief won\u2019t even call them what they are, Islamic terrorists, but instead prefers to preach what Islam is and isn\u2019t, and that we shouldn\u2019t denigrate all Muslims on the actions of a few, while he denigrates the rights of gun owners based on the actions of a few,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe concluded, \u201cTalk to your neighbors, create organizations to stay current on questionable behavior, not just in your community but around the country. We\u2019re told to say something when we see something but don\u2019t say anything against people who act suspiciously who happen to be Muslim, because that would be Islamaphobic. Syed Farook\u2019s neighbors were afraid to say something when they saw something because they were afraid of being called Islamaphobic. When our Attorney General says her greatest fear is the rhetoric against Muslims, we\u2019ve got a problem. And I\u2019m here to tell you, it is part of the Islamic terrorist plan. If we are stopped from saying something against Muhammad, the Muslim religion or Muslims in religion, then Sharia law is already here. We are living in dangerous times.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge Jeanine: Neighbors of San Bernardino Attackers Afraid of Being Called 'Islamaphobic' Part of Islamic Terrorist Plan", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Judge Jeanine: Neighbors of San Bernardino Attackers Afraid of Being Called 'Islamaphobic' Part of Islamic Terrorist Plan", "title": "Judge Jeanine: Neighbors of San Bernardino Attackers Afraid of Being Called 'Islamaphobic' Part of Islamic Terrorist Plan - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 680, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/judge.jpg", "height": 510}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/06/judge-jeanine-neighbors-of-san-bernardino-attackers-afraid-of-being-called-islamaphobic-part-of-islamic-terrorist-plan/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judge Jeanine: Neighbors of San Bernardino Attackers Afraid of Being Called 'Islamaphobic' Part of Islamic Terrorist Plan", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/judge.jpg", "title": "Judge Jeanine: Neighbors of San Bernardino Attackers Afraid of Being Called 'Islamaphobic' Part of Islamic Terrorist Plan - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Fox News Channel, Jeanine Pirro, Justice with Judge Jeanine, politically correct, Syed Farook, Tashfeen Malik,Breitbart TV, Jihad,terrorism", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Tashfeen Malik", "published_time": "2015-12-06T08:12:46-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Jihad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Syed Farook\u2019s neighbors were afraid to say something when they saw something because they were afraid of being called Islamaphobic.\nIf we are stopped from saying something against Muhammad, the Muslim religion or Muslims in religion, then Sharia law is already here.\nAnd I\u2019m here to tell you, it is part of the Islamic terrorist plan.\nShe concluded, \u201cTalk to your neighbors, create organizations to stay current on questionable behavior, not just in your community but around the country.\nWhen our Attorney General says her greatest fear is the rhetoric against Muslims, we\u2019ve got a problem."}
