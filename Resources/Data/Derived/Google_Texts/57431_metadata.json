Working off this premise, Greg Sargent at the Washington Post reasons that this tells us Obamacare is \u201cdisappearing\u201d as a major issue. And Paul Krugman followed up with his characteristic level-headed analysis.\n\nHow do we know the end is near-ish? Well, so many Americans are \u201cbenefiting from the law,\u201d theorizes Heidi Przybyla, that political ads are simply not doing the job anymore. This news is somewhat unexpected \u2013 and unpersuasive \u2013 when you consider a Kaiser Family Foundation poll recently found that only 15 percent of Americans believe Obamacare has directly helped them, while 28 percent say it has directly hurt them. (Fifty-six percent say it has had no effect on their lives.)\n\nSomewhat more convincingly, Przybyla offers this bit of evidence: \u201cThose seeking to unseat the U.S. Senate incumbent in North Carolina,\u201d she writes, \u201chave cut in half the portion of their top issue ads citing Obamacare, a sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch.\u201d Then again, that\u2019s quite an extrapolation, as well \u2013 especially when you consider that in her very own story Przybyla tells us that GOP groups have plans to re-focus on ACA as soon as premium increases for 2015 are announced. Like any issue, the political impact of Obamacare is hitched to events surrounding the law. An ebb is not a capitulation. And there will be more Obamacare events.\n\nBut even if there weren\u2019t, consider that a quarter of all political ads running in North Carolina attack Obamacare specifically. This seems to suggest that it\u2019s still a comparatively \u201cmajor issue.\u201d Or, let\u2019s put it this way: Is there any other law in the United States that eats up more political space?\n\nGoogle tells me there isn\u2019t. When I use the search engine to wade through news stories regarding the various contested races mentioned in the Bloomberg piece, I find that Obamacare is ubiquitous among Republican candidates \u2013 in their stump speeches, their interviews, on their websites and in their statements. Not so much the Democrats. In Colorado, for example, Republican Cory Gardner is running an ad right now that focuses exclusively on Obamacare:\n\nWhen our family\u2019s healthcare plan was cancelled because of Obamacare last year, we felt firsthand the painful effects of Senator Udall\u2019s support for Obamacare. Countless families have seen their premiums rise, lost access to their doctors, or lost their health insurances plans altogether \u2014 they have Senator Udall to thank.\n\nAs Gardner points out, 335,000 people had their plans cancelled in the state. A state where Quinnipiac found that 60 percent oppose ACA \u2013 with 68 percent of independents, 53 percent of women, and 61 percent of people under the age of 30.\n\nSo it seems like a major issue.\n\nYou know, perhaps focusing 50 percent of your ad dollars on ACA isn\u2019t necessary, anyway. It\u2019s rather amazing how little the electorate has moved on the issue. According to Kaiser, 53 percent disapprove of Obamacare. And among independents, 57 percent disapprove. Looks a lot like it\u2019s looked for years. Whether voters are interested in repealing the law or not, there is no other issue with higher disapproval rates. In my lifetime, I can\u2019t recall of any domestic law that\u2019s been chewed over, litigated, debated, and used as a political hammer this intensely this long after passage.\n\nAs Chris Cillizza pointed out a few months back:\n\nBuried in new New York Times/Kaiser polling on four Southern Senate races is this question: \u201cIs it possible you would ever vote for a candidate who does not share your views on the 2010 health care law, or is this issue so important that you would not vote for a candidate who disagrees with you?\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas and Kentucky majorities said they would not. Ads or no ads, that seems like a \u201cmajor\u201d issue.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 07:22:15 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "It was inevitable that Republicans would be compelled to expand their attacks beyond Obamacare.", "title": "Have Republicans Given Up On Attacking Obamacare?
