(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nThe good work the Red Wing boys hockey team put in over the first 50 minutes of Saturday\u2019s season-opener came unraveled in the final minute of regulation.\n\nUp 2-1 on Faribault at Prairie Island Arena, the Wingers were caught off-guard when they were called for too many men on the ice with 1:01 left to play.\n\n\u201cThere was a communication error,\u201d said Red Wing head coach Bob Rajanen. \u201cIt was late in the power play and we told the guys on the bench that we wanted to go with a regular five-on-five line because there was only five seconds left. One of the power-play guys jumped out and that was that.\u201d\n\nThe mistake proved costly as the Falcons tied the game up when Austin Lewis fired a shot in traffic for his second goal of the game to tie it at 2-2 with 42.3 seconds remaining.\n\nStill hoping to sneak away with a win, the Wingers needed to get past the mental gaffe and play the same hockey that got them the lead in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe just needed to do what we were doing: getting the puck deep and fore-checking hard and try and outwork \u2018em,\u201d Rajanen said.\n\nLike they had played all game long, Red Wing and Faribault played an even overtime period before Lewis took a pass from Christan Von Ruden and got the puck in the net to complete the hat trick and the 3-2 come-from-behind win at 5:28 in overtime.\n\nWith both teams trying to gain traction in the 2014-15 opener, Lewis put the Falcons on the board first, scoring a power-play goal at the 9:15 mark of the first period. Tyler Becker collected an assist on the play.\n\nThe second period resulted in no scores for either team, but some frustration was mounting for the Wingers\u2019 offense. They were down 1-0 despite staying within one shot on goal with Faribault (24-23 after two periods) and having a total of five power-play opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe saw that every time we shot, the goalie had a good save, so we knew we had to put more shots on net and see what the goalie\u2019s weaknesses were,\u201d said Wingers senior forward Tristan Rehder. \u201cIn the locker room between that first and second period, we told each other that we needed more chances and hopefully one will go in at some time.\u201d\n\nThen early in the third, Rehder finally gave Red Wing the sorely-needed offensive lift with an unassisted goal at 4:35 of the third period.\n\n\u201cTheir (defenseman) decided to pass it up to a weak-side wing, so I came up and intercepted the pass,\u201d Rehder said about the buildup to his goal. \u201cI went down and saw a guy in front of me and pulled a toe drag through his stick, took a rip and it actually went in.\u201d\n\nWith the game tied and the pressure off, the Wingers were able to relax a little and put up more quality opportunities. And thanks to a hustle play by junior Sam Hanson, they were finally able to take a lead.\n\nWith Jamie Nevitt in the box for roughing, Red Wing was set to kill the penalty. But Hanson got a takeaway at center ice and proceeded to put in a short-handed goal just past the kick pad of Falcons goalie Chase Batchelder for the go-ahead goal.\n\n\u201cThat was a hard-work goal,\u201d Rajanen said of Hanson\u2019s score. \u201cHe beat the defenseman clean on that and beat him to the spot. That\u2019s the stuff we need to do to compete.\u201d\n\nUltimately, special teams proved to be Red Wing\u2019s undoing as Faribault converted on two of its five power-play chances while Red Wing was 0-for-5 with the extra man. Despite the loss, Wingers goalie Adam Defore put in a strong outing with 35 saves.\n\nWhile Saturday\u2019s game ended in heartbreak, it did give the Wingers (0-1-0) a better idea of the level of competition in the Big Nine. Red Wing\u2019s next game will be on the road Tuesday against Rochester Century.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of our most competitive games that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Rehder said. \u201cNow we know we can compete with Big Nine Conference teams.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,wingers,boys hockey,Red Wing", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "The good work the Red Wing boys hockey team put in over the first 50 minutes of Saturday\u2019s season-opener came unraveled in the final minute of regulation.\r\n\r\nUp 2-1 on Faribault at Prairie Island Arena, the Wingers were caught off-guard when they were called for too many men on the ice with 1:01 l...", "title": "Boys Hockey: Faribault edges Red Wing in overtime", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/boys-hockey-faribault-edges-red-wing-overtime", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Sam%20Hanson_0.jpg?itok=jquCcA4k", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The good work the Red Wing boys hockey team put in over the first 50 minutes of Saturday\u2019s season-opener came unraveled in the final minute of regulation.\r\n\r\nUp 2-1 on Faribault at Prairie Island Arena, the Wingers were caught off-guard when they were called for too many men on the ice with 1:01 l...", "title": "Boys Hockey: Faribault edges Red Wing in overtime", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/boys-hockey-faribault-edges-red-wing-overtime", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Sam%20Hanson_0.jpg?itok=aBRWshX_", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,wingers,boys hockey,Red Wing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,wingers,boys hockey,Red Wing", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T19:13:34-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Red Wing's Sam Hanson (18) lets loose with a wrist shot at Faribault goaltender Chase Batchelder during Saturday's season opener at Prairie Island Arena.
