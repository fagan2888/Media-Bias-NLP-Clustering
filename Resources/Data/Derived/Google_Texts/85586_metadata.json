Kenneth Shinozuka, 15 years old, is just such a person. Two years ago, his grandfather, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, began wandering from his bed at night. This is not uncommon \u2014 of the 5.2 million Alzheimer\u2019s sufferers in the United States, more than 65 percent wander from their homes. One night, his grandfather wandered as far as the freeway.\n\n\u201cWe were woken up by a police officer knocking on the door,\u201d Shinozuka told NBC News. \u201cIt was, yeah, very real and very scary.\u201d\n\nAfter searching for an appropriate monitor for his grandfather, Shinozuka came up short so he decided to invent his own. The device he created immediately and reliably detects the moment his grandfather steps onto the floor and then sends an audible alert to Shinozuka\u2019s smartphone. How can this be? The sensor is worn on the bottom of his grandfather\u2019s sock.\n\nYoung Kenneth with his grandfather courtesy of YouTube\n\nShinozuka won a Science Action award from Scientific American for his wearable sensor, which is currently being tested by patients in a nursing home. Shinozuka, who loves nature and is a boy scout, says he wants to cure Alzheimer's disease someday.\n\n\u201cHe wants to help people,\u201d Maria Feng, his proud mother, told NBC News. \u201cHe wants to solve problems for people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "15, year, old, inventor, kenneth, shinozuka, creates, wearable, monitor, detect, alzheimers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kenneth Shinozuka, 15, won a Science Action award for his wearable sensor, which detects when an Alzheimer's patient wanders and sends a signal to caregivers.", "title": "15-Year-Old Creates Sensor To Prevent Alzheimer's Patients From Wandering", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/15-year-old-inventor-kenneth-shinozuka-creates-wearable-monitor-detect-alzheimers-315160", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/22/shinozuka.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kenneth Shinozuka, 15, won a Science Action award for his wearable sensor, which detects when an Alzheimer's patient wanders and sends a signal to caregivers.", "title": "15-Year-Old Creates Sensor To Prevent Alzheimer's Patients From Wandering", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/15-year-old-inventor-kenneth-shinozuka-creates-wearable-monitor-detect-alzheimers-315160", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/22/shinozuka.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/22/shinozuka.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2014-12-22T10:23:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-22T10:23:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kenneth Shinozuka, 15, won a Science Action award for his wearable sensor, which detects when an Alzheimer's patient wanders and sends a signal to caregivers."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec91\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe were woken up by a police officer knocking on the door,\u201d Shinozuka told NBC News.\nKenneth Shinozuka, 15 years old, is just such a person.\n\u201cIt was, yeah, very real and very scary.\u201dAfter searching for an appropriate monitor for his grandfather, Shinozuka came up short so he decided to invent his own.\nShinozuka, who loves nature and is a boy scout, says he wants to cure Alzheimer's disease someday.\nTwo years ago, his grandfather, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, began wandering from his bed at night."}
