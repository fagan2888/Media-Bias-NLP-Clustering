What's next for medical marijuana? Hint: it doesn't involve a match, pipe or rolling papers. Some of it doesn't even get you high.

What's next for medical marijuana? Hint: it doesn't involve a match, pipe or rolling papers. Some of it doesn't even get you high.

In Steve Kroft's 60 Minutes story this week, we saw how Colorado has capitalized, literally, on its medical cannabis program. We also saw how the state has become fertile ground for a marketplace of unconventional marijuana products to flourish. And we're not just talking about pot brownies.

Sodas, peanut butter sandwiches, truffles, breath sprays, skin ointments-- almost anything can be infused with marijuana, and in Colorado, entrepreneurs are developing all manner of new pot-infused product lines. These products are a far cry from the dorm-room stash of weed in a plastic baggy, and some of these new products even deliver the medical benefits of the drug without the high.

In the above video, 60 Minutes Overtime sat down with 60 Minutes producer Frank Devine to learn more about the strange new world of non-smokable marijuana.

Update: Since this segment was originally published in October 2012, Tripp Keber, CEO of Dixie Elixirs, was arrested for marijuana possession in Alabama. Tripp told 60 Minutes that he has completed his six months of probation, and he still works at Dixie Elixirs.

COMMENT:

What do you think of these new pot products? Would you drink a pot-infused soda or eat a pot-infused truffle if marijuana were legalized in your state?
