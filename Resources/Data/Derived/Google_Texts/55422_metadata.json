Instead of embracing conservatives, McConnell embraces the repudiated policies, politicians, and media figures of the Left.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office hasn\u2019t responded to a Breitbart News request for comment on why he\u2019d throw Stephanopoulos a lifeline\u2014appearing on his show lends him credibility. Stephanopoulos has had to recuse himself from Republican debates in 2016, and won\u2019t be allowed to moderate them\u2014despite previous plans to do so\u2014but is still moving forward with plans to be involved in ABC News\u2019 2016 and political coverage despite his conflict of interest that he kept from the public until he was later caught. Many, including the Media Research Center\u2019s Brent Bozell, are calling for Stephanopoulos to recuse himself from all 2016 political coverage\u2013noting that ABC is facing a credibility crisis with him at the helm.\n\nMcConnell has come under fire from both sides over the past week for pushing the secretive Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that would fast-track the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2014during her time as Secretary of State\u2014helped negotiate with several Pacific Rim nations. In fact, conservative activist Rick Manning\u2014the president of advocacy group Americans for Limited Government\u2014argues that McConnell is jeopardizing Republican control of the U.S. Senate in the next election by pushing this massively unpopular trade deal through Congress.\n\nIn a statement last week, Manning noted that \u201cwithout enforceable currency provisions in the trade authority itself, these votes [that McConnell has planned for this week] risk Senate Republican seats in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to name just a few, putting the Senate majority in real jeopardy in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than continuing down this politically ruinous course, Republican leaders should promote solutions that unite the Party, instead of those that deepen the divide between the big business wing and the voters Republicans need to win,\u201d Manning said.\n\nBut none of the bipartisan opposition to Obamatrade, which McConnell is going to attempt to force through the U.S. Senate this coming week, made it into Stephanopoulos\u2019 talk show on Sunday. Instead, the only question Stephanopoulos asked McConnell about the matter was whether he and President Obama were planning to get together to drink bourbon whiskey. The news package that set up the interview wasn\u2019t much better\u2014quoting only McConnell\u2019s support for the deal from the Senate floor and the opposition from liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2014leaving out the critical context of the opposition from people such as Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nWhen ABC\u2019s This Week returned from commercial after the package, and McConnell joined the show live, Stephanopoulos opened with the trade issue.\n\nHe played another clip of McConnell from the Senate floor. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the president, too,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not hearing things. President Obama has done his country a service by taking on his base and pushing back on some of the more ridiculous rhetoric we\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the Senate majority leader this Thursday, Mitch McConnell,\u201d Stephanopoulos said coming out of the clip. \u201cMr. Leader, thank you for joining us. This morning, this is the president\u2019s top legislative priority right now, this trade promotion authority. You appear to be his pointman in the Senate. What is it going to take to get it passed and are you confident it will?\u201d\n\nMcConnell predicted that the Senate will pass the trade deal this week.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ll pass it,\u201d McConnell replied to Stephanopoulos.\n\nWe\u2019ll pass it later this week. The president has done an excellent job on this. I point out to my members who are somewhat squeamish, as you can imagine, giving the president the power of any issue, given his expansive view of his powers on so many other issues. But this is a trade promotion authority not just for President Obama, but for the next president as well. This is a six-year trade promotion authority bill that will give the next president an opportunity to enter into additional trade agreements with other countries around the world. We know America is a big winner when we lower barriers to our products abroad. It also has a foreign policy and defense component. A lot of the countries in Asia are a little apprehensive, as you can imagine, about not only Chinese economic domination, but potential Chinese military domination. And so they would like to get closer to us. And this is a great opportunity to do that, as well as to benefit America and to create more jobs here in our country.\n\nStephanopoulos then talked about a \u201cbourbon summit\u201d between McConnell and Obama over trade.\n\n\u201cI saw that little smile when you discussed President Obama,\u201d Stephanopoulos said. \u201cYou described your relationship with the president right now as kind of an out-of-body experience. How do you intend to build on that? Do you want to build on it? And does it mean that that bourbon summit that everyone\u2019s been talking about is no longer necessary?\u201d\n\nMcConnell replied with an answer about what he\u2019s trying to do as Senate Majority Leader.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a new Senate now,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nWe\u2019re actually voting again. We voted more than 100 times in the first quarter of this year. Last year, only 15 roll calls votes on amendment the entire year. We passed a budget. For the last five years, the Senate did not pass a budget, which is required by the law. The Senate is getting back to work, and what I\u2019m doing is focusing on things upon which there\u2019s some bipartisan agreement. We passed an excellent Iran nuclear review bill overwhelmingly, Democrats and Republicans. The president is going to sign it. We have a cyber security bill coming forward that came out of the Intelligence Committee overwhelmingly. Elementary and secondary education came out of that committee overwhelmingly. We\u2019re trying to focus on the things that we can agree on that will make progress for the country, George, even though we know there are many things we do not agree with the president on, and all of those will probably come to the fore on spending bills. We want to spend more on defense; they want to spend more on everything.\n\n\u201cSo no need for bourbon with the president?\u201d Stephanopoulos pressed further, insisting that McConnell answer such an important question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to do that, but we don\u2019t have a personality problem; we just had differences on issues,\u201d McConnell replied. \u201cBut there are some things we agree on, and I try to focus on the things that we do agree on, and where we can make progress for the country.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Stephanopoulos moved on from Obamatrade\u2014again without asking any tough or specific questions. That\u2019s to be expected, since Stephanopoulos\u2014an advocate for liberalism and big government from his perch at ABC News\u2014frequently does advocacy interviews on things like this where he won\u2019t ask real questions but will just let politicians who support what he does, like Clinton, McConnell and Obama do with this trade deal, talk about why they back it.\n\nStephanopoulos saved his tough questions for McConnell\u2014including where he asked McConnell about specific disagreements he has with Rand Paul, his Kentucky colleague and a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, on the National Security Agency bulk data collection program.\n\n\u201cYour own Senate colleague from Kentucky, Rand Paul, wants to end the program,\u201d Stephanopoulos said. \u201cHe put out a tweet this week saying I will fight tooth and nail to stop a blanket reauthorization of this attack on our freedoms. How do you respond to that, that the NSA surveillance program is an attack on our freedoms?\u201d\n\nBut Stephanopoulos asked no such question about the trade deal\u2014and made no mention his entire show of this\u2014and Sen. Paul\u2019s ardent opposition to the deal. In fact, Paul not only came out against the trade deal publicly, he even went to the secret room inside the Capitol to read it, and in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News outside that room called for its public release.\n\n\u201cThe thing is is that I think it actually hurts their cause by making it so secretive\u2014while I can\u2019t discuss the details of what was in there because of them calling it secret, I didn\u2019t see anything that I didn\u2019t think couldn\u2019t be made public with a problem,\u201d Paul said in his Breitbart News interview. \u201cIf so, I\u2019m missing something because we read through 800 pages of it and we didn\u2019t see anything that I couldn\u2019t conclude couldn\u2019t be made public.\u201d\n\nAgain, somehow, this never happened according to Stephnanopoulos\u2019 Sunday show and interview with McConnell. Stephanopoulos even asked yet another question a moment later about Sen. Paul.\n\n\u201cFinally, sir, you mentioned that you and Rand Paul agree on most things,\u201d Stephanopoulos asked. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s one of three senators running. He\u2019s your candidate for president. Make the 30-second case for why he should be president.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, one of the great things that Rand Paul has done is reach out to different constituencies,\u201d McConnell replied.\n\nI\u2019ve been thrilled to how he\u2019s gone to African American audiences. He\u2019s very appealing to young people. Look, we all know that in order to be competitive in presidential elections, we have to carry more voters than we have in recent years, which is not enough to win the White House. So Rand has brought a kind of new brand of Republicanism to the contest. I think it\u2019s exciting to a lot of people, and I wish him well.\n\nABC spokeswoman Heather Riley\u2014who has been frequently defending Stephanopoulos amid his Clinton Cash craze\u2014did not respond to a request for comment on why the ABC host and former Bill Clinton White House senior staffer didn\u2019t ask McConnell about Paul\u2019s opposition to Obamatrade or other Republican opposition from senators like Sessions or presidential candidates like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Dr. Ben Carson, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or more.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is that Stephanopoulos\u2019 work alongside McConnell to help push the Obamatrade deal comes on the heels of a new revelation from liberal media outlet Vox that ties Clinton Cash together with Obamatrade. The Vox article basically walks through how the Obamatrade deal and Clinton Cash narratives are intertwined. Jonathan Allen writes:\n\nAlmost a decade ago, as Hillary Clinton ran for re-election to the Senate on her way to seeking the presidency for the first time, the New York Times reported on her unusually close relationship with Corning, Inc., an upstate glass titan. Clinton advanced the company\u2019s interests, racking up a big assist by getting China to ease a trade barrier. And the firm\u2019s mostly Republican executives opened up their wallets for her campaign. During Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, Corning lobbied the department on a variety of trade issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The company has donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to her family\u2019s foundation. And, last July, when it was clear that Clinton would again seek the presidency in 2016, Corning coughed up a $225,500 honorarium for Clinton to speak.\n\nRight after McConnell was on the show, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)\u2014a liberal from California\u2014shocked the left by coming out in favor of the trade deal.\n\n\u201cI do support the trade bill and I\u2019ll tell you why: I\u2019m a born-and-raised Californian on the rim of the largest trading basin the world,\u201d she said.\n\nNothing is going to decrease the trade between countries along the Pacific Ocean. It surpassed the Atlantic several years ago. Therefore the kind of trade, free trade, the ability to have enforcement mechanisms to prevent anti-dumping, to protect copyright, to prevent forced labor, child labor is very important. And that\u2019s what this will do. The enforcement section and the trade assistance section, which passed the Senate with more than 70 votes, is vital to this.\n\nFeinstein added that she doesn\u2019t believe the deal is for \u201ccorporate America\u201d and that it \u201ccreates jobs\u201d as long as it\u2019s \u201cdone right.\u201d\n\nA congressional aide told Breitbart News that McConnell and Feinstein running to Stephanopoulos while he\u2019s amid his own scandal to push Obamatrade was a \u201cslippery but brilliant move.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerits of the deal aside, they are brilliant politicians,\u201d the aide said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bipartisanship: McConnell, Stephanopoulos Reach Across The Aisle To Help Push Hillary Clinton\u2019s Obamatrade", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Bipartisanship: McConnell, Stephanopoulos Reach Across The Aisle To Help Push Hillary Clinton\u2019s Obamatrade", "title": "Bipartisanship: McConnell, Stephanopoulos Reach Across The Aisle To Help Push Hillary Clinton\u2019s Obamatrade - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/mitch-mcconnell-frown-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/17/bipartisanship-mcconnell-stephanopoulos-reach-across-the-aisle-to-help-push-hillary-clintons-obamatrade/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bipartisanship: McConnell, Stephanopoulos Reach Across The Aisle To Help Push Hillary Clinton\u2019s Obamatrade", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/mitch-mcconnell-frown-AP.jpg", "title": "Bipartisanship: McConnell, Stephanopoulos Reach Across The Aisle To Help Push Hillary Clinton\u2019s Obamatrade - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Clinton Cash, Elizabeth Warren, George Stephanopoulos, Hillary Clinton, Mitch McConnell, Obamatrade, Rand Paul, Trade Promotion Authority, Trans Pacific Partnership,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Trans Pacific Partnership", "published_time": "2015-05-17T10:47:42-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb167\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSo no need for bourbon with the president?\u201d Stephanopoulos pressed further, insisting that McConnell answer such an important question.\n\u201cFinally, sir, you mentioned that you and Rand Paul agree on most things,\u201d Stephanopoulos asked.\nRight after McConnell was on the show, Sen.
