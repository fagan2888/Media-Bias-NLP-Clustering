Alex Democrats heavily courted the Latino vote in the 2012 election, successfully turning out a record 11.2 million Latinos. Latinos \u2014 who accounted for 8.4 percent of the vote \u2014 did not only help President Barack Obama win key battleground states, they also helped to elect many members of Congress. But now that the campaign is over, the same people who asked for our help, won\u2019t offer any in return. They have forgotten about Latinos \u2014 particularly the more than 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.\n\nPuerto Rico is currently facing its biggest fiscal and economic crisis in history. The Garc\u00eda Padilla administration inherited a debt burden of $70 billion and an annual deficit of $2.2 billion, an economy that had been in recession for seven years, and an unemployment rate of 16 percent. The governor has tackled key challenges to strengthen the Commonwealth\u2019s economy and get its fiscal house in order, but Puerto Rico can\u2019t do it alone.\n\nThe Garc\u00eda Padilla administration first tried to pass a local measure that would allow an orderly process to bring debt relief parity for Puerto Rico\u2019s public corporations. The local law was overturned by the U.S. District Court, stating that only Congress has that authority, and is currently pending appeal.\n\nRelated: White House a Maybe on Letting Puerto Rico Declare Bankruptcy\n\nGov. Garc\u00eda Padilla is asking Congress to allow Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities to have access to Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Access to Chapter 9 would safeguard the island\u2019s economic future by ensuring a sustainable resolution to its debt that would provide a legal framework to all parties, while safeguarding essential services to Puerto Ricans. Despite the great urgency of the economic situation in Puerto Rico, Congress hasn\u2019t moved to pass the bill.\n\nIf this didn\u2019t matter, Republican candidates would not be weighing in. During his April visit to the island, Jeb Bush announced his support for granting Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9. I commend Governor Bush for recognizing that this important issue transcends politics and has a real and profound impact in the lives of Puerto Ricans everywhere.\n\nUnfortunately, Chapter 9 isn\u2019t the only issue where the federal government has abandoned Puerto Rico. The island\u2019s current healthcare system crisis has been met with silence and crossed arms in Washington. Meager federal funding is putting the island\u2019s healthcare system in such jeopardy, we could see it begin to collapse as soon as June 1.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico Needs Reform, Not Bankruptcy\n\nWhile Puerto Ricans pay the same Medicare taxes as mainland residents, they get less \u2013 much less \u2013federal healthcare funding. The island\u2019s Medicaid program receives 70 percent lower reimbursement rates and is capped; Medicare Advantage is paid 60 percent of the average rate while having the highest MA enrollment in the U.S.; and Medicare reimbursement rates are 40 percent lower.\n\nThe health care system is further jeopardized by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services\u2019 recent 11 percent cut to Puerto Rico\u2019s MA premiums, which will go into effect next year. While the struggling island faces cuts, the 50 states saw an average three percent increase. On top of that, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid grant to the island will run out in 2017.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico at a Crossroads\n\nSixty percent of the island\u2019s population, more than 2 million Puerto Rican-Americans, receive care through these programs. The healthcare industry represents 20 percent of the island\u2019s GDP. A collapse would not only jeopardize care for millions of U.S. citizens but result in a dramatic blow to an already fragile economy. The government would have to make significant cuts to much-needed services or increase spending to provide access to quality care, an unlikely option in Puerto Rico\u2019s difficult financial state.\n\nThe island\u2019s troubles have driven Puerto Ricans to relocate to the mainland. For the first time in history, more Boricuas live in the continental U.S. than in Puerto Rico. That means politicians should be worried about next year\u2019s election. Latinos will be a deciding factor for who sets up shop at the White House and in Congress. If the quality of life of these Americans doesn\u2019t matter to Washington, then the next elections should.\n\nWashington can\u2019t afford to turn its back on Puerto Rico. Congress needs to act now to give Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 and save its healthcare system. Time is of the essence, the future of 3.5 million Americans \u2014 and their 2016 decisions \u2014 are on the line.\n\nCrist\u00f3bal J. Alex is the President of the Latino Victory Project.
