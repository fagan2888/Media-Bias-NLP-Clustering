Plus, the beer is cheap.\u201d\n\nWilson, 28, retired from the Navy in January 2012 after eight years and is now a University of Maine student. She is also something of a rarity in the ranks of the venerable military clubs, such as the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Marine Corps League and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which are are filled with members in their 60s, 70s and 80s.\n\nAs the years pass, these organizations that fought on Capitol Hill for the creation of the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs and the G.I Bill and continue to fight for veterans services are slowly shrinking.\n\nMembership in three of the four national veteran groups are decreasing both in Maine and nationally, with the Disabled American Veterans seeing small increases in recent years, according to club statistics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take any advice you have on how to grow our club,\u201d Hermon American Legion No. 200 Commander Larry Davis said recently at a monthly bean dinner at the Hermon Fire Station, which attracted a small group of older local regulars.\n\nThe American Legion of Maine started 2014 with 19,201 members. Even though it added 390 new members last year, there was a net loss of 797 members as World War II and Korean War veterans pass away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting old. I\u2019m in my 60s and I need [younger veterans] in here to take over,\u201d said Keith Daggett, commander of American Legion Post No. 75 in Old Town.\n\nThe DAV\u2019s John F. Kennedy Chapter No. 6, which moved nearly three years ago to Bangor, has grown to approximately 1,200 members. Even with that big membership number, only 10 attended the April monthly meeting.\n\n\u201cThe older people are dying and nobody is there to take their place,\u201d said Davis, who at 65 is one of the younger members of the Arnold R. Kelly Post in Hermon. \u201cI\u2019m almost the youngest puppy in the group. This is not just us. This is happening all throughout the American Legion.\u201d\n\nThe numbers\n\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars of Maine has about 9,000 members, down 800 from last year despite recruitment efforts, according to Steve SanPedro, the state membership chairman. Several units have closed or consolidated, such as posts in Lisbon and Long Island.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re slowly closing,\u201d SanPedro said. \u201cLast year, we consolidated three posts and we\u2019re working on our second one already this year.\u201d\n\nNational membership in the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which marked its 100th anniversary in September 2014, has been decreasing ever since it peaked at 2.5 million in 1992. Current membership is around 1.3 million, with the average age of members nearly 70.\n\nOne explanation, according to SanPedro, is that \u201cwe\u2019re one of the hardest groups to enter\u201d because veterans must have served overseas to become a member.\n\nAnother is the perception that the club is only \u201colder people drinking, smoking and telling war stories,\u201d SanPedro said. \u201cWe do a lot more. In my [region] we have 10 posts and only two have cantinas. It\u2019s not like every post has a bar.\u201d\n\nData for the national American Legion in March showed 1.7 million members, a decrease of 38,225 from 2014. At its peak in 1946, Legion membership was 3.3 million. The organization turned 96 on March 15.\n\nLegion membership is open to men and women who served in active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces during specific periods designated as \u201cwar time\u201d by Congress, but the group also has an auxiliary for family.\n\nThe Marine Corps League of Maine has \u201ca steady\u201d 390 members with new members offsetting the eight who died last year, according to Department Commandant Gary Laweryson. There are about 85,000 League members nationwide, he said. The group includes associate members from other branches of the military.\n\n\u201cI just joined the Marine Corps League [in Bangor]. I\u2019m one of the youngest members and I\u2019m 72,\u201d said Brewer resident and Army veteran Charles \u201cDusty\u201d Fisher, a former state representative who joined the League as an associate member.\n\nDisabled American Veterans is one military club that has seen a small amount of growth, but the age of its membership means change is on the horizon.\n\nAn average 640 World War II veterans die each day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Disabled American Veterans is seeing the trickle down effect \u201cwith more than 3,000 Disabled American Veterans members passing monthly,\u201d Anthony Baskerville, national DAV membership director, wrote in his August 2014 annual report.\n\n\u201cTime takes it\u2019s toll,\u201d Baskerville said Thursday.\n\nThe 1.28 million-member Disabled American Veterans, founded in 1920 by disabled veterans returning from World War I, is a nonprofit charity dedicated to helping disabled veterans and their families. The group had 1.22 million members in 2013. Maine currently has 6,879 Disabled American Veterans members, an increase of 96 over the 2013.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have bingo, we don\u2019t have a bar and we don\u2019t have a dance floor,\u201d said Jim Gehring, adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans Smart-Ricker No. 10 in Presque Isle. \u201cAll we do is help veterans and veteran families.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that each veteran\u2019s club offers something different, supporting veterans and communities in their own ways.\n\n\u201cThere is something for everyone,\u201d Gehring said.\n\nNot ready for parades\n\nThe experience of Vietnam veterans, versus those of World War II or Korea, is viewed as contributing to the struggles of veteran organizations.\n\nIn Old Town, VFW post Commander Brian Hanson recalls a dark time in the country\u2019s history when returning Vietnam veterans were shunned by the public.\n\nNow, Vietnam veterans in the Old Town club are making it a point to welcome younger veterans from Desert Storm, Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cThe Iraqi war is probably not the last war we\u2019re going to have,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cWe need to be here for the next generation.\u201d\n\nYet that next generation is not necessarily ready for that club experience. Retired Army Ranger Joseph Miller, 33, has three tours in Iraq under his belt and sees the \u201cvalue\u201d of joining a military club for the camaraderie, but he just hasn\u2019t found one yet that fits his needs.\n\n\u201cIt takes you a few years to realize you need a community,\u201d said Miller, who lives in Old Town. \u201cWhen we get out we\u2019re thinking education, getting a job.\u201d\n\nWhile he understands his family and the public\u2019s desire to thank him for his service, Miller said war is \u201cnot all positive\u201d and leaves scars, some that are not visible. \u201cYou want to move away from that time in our life \u2026 but it\u2019s always going to be with you,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller joined the 82nd Airborne Division as an infantry officer, became an Army Ranger and jumpmaster, and retired in 2008. He now openly admits to having post-traumatic stress disorder and having considered suicide.\n\nIn his case, Miller added, he is just not ready to celebrate his service. \u201cI don\u2019t think our generation is ready for parades. I know I\u2019m not,\u201d Miller said. \u201cMaybe that takes time.\u201d\n\nExperts in veterans affairs and post-traumatic stress disorder know where Miller is coming from, but also stress the value and importance of community connections.\n\nJonathan Shay, a psychiatrist who specializes in treating combat veterans was the keynote speaker at the Maine Military and Community Network\u2019s conference held recently at the University of Maine. He said community plays a huge role in a successful homecoming.\n\nProviding a place for soldiers, airmen, Marines and others to gather and feel safe, \u201cis why there are VFW and Legion halls,\u201d Lt. Col. Darryl Lyon of the Maine National Guard said.\n\nA ready community exists within the walls of veterans\u2019 organizations and it\u2019s never too late to sign up, as evidenced by Orland resident Ron Bemis, 52, who just joined the Marine Corps League, Bangor Detachment 1151.\n\n\u201cI wanted the chance to get together with a bunch of guys \u2014 a bunch of Marines \u2014 that feel the same way I do,\u201d said Bemis, who served between 1966 and 1970. \u201cYou kind of miss that when you\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\n\u2018It got me through\u2019\n\nSafety and community are important issues, but to attract younger veterans, these organizations also may have to consider another factor: modernity.\n\nAfter seven years out of uniform, Miller is looking for a military club that fits his active lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI find the biggest thing keeping me away isn\u2019t the value, it\u2019s the way the American Legion has social events where I wouldn\u2019t find any enjoyment,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey\u2019re old people. I think they could modify it a little bit.\u201d\n\nMiller is now a University of Maine graduate student who is studying to be a history teacher. He was once the ROTC instructor of UMaine\u2019s Black Bear Battalion, and said health and the military go hand-in-hand.\n\n\u201cOne time, one of them asked me why we weren\u2019t joining and I was pretty frank with him. I said, \u2018Stop smoking.\u2019 We\u2019re in our 20s and care about our health,\u201d Miller said. \u201cStop playing bingo and expect people our age to come. Maybe get some microbrew. It\u2019s not anything revolutionary.\u201d\n\nOnce inside an organization, though, younger veterans can find what they need.\n\nSgt. Thomas Hayden, of the Maine Army National Guard 251st Engineer Co., is a former active duty soldier who turned to Wilson, a fellow UMaine student, when grieving the loss of a friend and fellow soldier. She brought him to VFW Post 3381 in Old Town earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I can talk as a soldier,\u201d the Litchfield man said while sitting inside the Main Street pub. \u201cThe middle of January was kind of a hard time for me. I lost a really good friend.\u201d\n\nHis friend, Spc. Jose A. Torre, Jr., 21, of Garden Grove, California, had died Jan. 15, 2011, in Baghdad after insurgents attacked his unit with a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\n\u201cIt got me through so I became a member,\u201d Hayden said, speaking for the first time about why he joined the post. \u201cIt\u2019s supportive in the fact that \u2026 everyone kinda knows something civilians don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nWilson, who brought Hayden to the post, now serves at its quartermaster, or chief financial officer. She admits being a member is \u201cnot for everyone,\u201d but said walking through the door was the right decision for her.\n\n\u201cIt kind of makes me feel like I have a second home,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BANGOR, Maine \u2014 Retired Navy veteran Ashley Wilson, who served two tours in Iraq, said joining the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 3381 in Old Town gave her something every veteran needs \u2014 understanding. \u201cEveryone has the same mindset,\u201d she said over a beer inside the darkened post lounge.
