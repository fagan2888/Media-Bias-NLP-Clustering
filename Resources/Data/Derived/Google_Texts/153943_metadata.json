OK Related Issuers RCHP, Inc. Related Research Credit Opinion: RCHP, Inc. Rating Action: Moody's places RegionalCare's ratings under review for downgrade Announcement: Moody's retires Healthcare Service Providers Industry Rating Methodology Rating Action: Moody's changes RegionalCare's rating outlook to positive; Caa1 CFR affirmed Issuer Comment: Moody's: RegionalCare's ratings unaffected by changes in size of credit facilities Rating Action: Moody's upgrades RCHP's CFR to B3; outlook is stable Global Credit Research - 12 Nov 2015 New York, November 12, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service upgraded RCHP, Inc.'s Corporate Family Rating to B3 from Caa1 and Probability of Default Rating to B3-PD from Caa1-PD. Moody's also upgraded the instrument ratings on the company's first lien senior secured debt to B1 from B2 and second lien senior secured debt to Caa1 from Caa2. The rating outlook is stable. RCHP, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of RegionalCare Hospital Partners Holdings, Inc. The upgrade of RCHP's Corporate Family Rating reflects Moody's expectation that revenue and earnings growth at the company's existing hospitals will result in strengthening credit metrics and mitigate the increase in debt associated with the announced acquisition of the company by funds affiliated with private equity firm Apollo Global Management, LLC from the current sponsor, Warburg Pincus. Moody's anticipates that RCHP's debt to EBITDA will steadily decline to closer to 6.0 times by the end of 2016 from a pro forma level of about 6.8 times following the Apollo acquisition. Moody's understands that the current first and second lien facilities will be amended and remain in place despite the change in control effected by the acquisition of the equity of the company by Apollo. Members of the company's management team are also expected to maintain an equity ownership interest in the company. The only expected change in debt associated with the acquisition is the placement of a PIK note at RCHP's parent holding company, RegionalCare Hospital Partners Holdings, Inc. Moody's took the following rating actions on RCHP, Inc.: Corporate Family Rating to B3 from Caa1 Probability of Default Rating to B3-PD from Caa1-PD First lien senior secured debt to B1 (LGD2) from B2 (LGD3) Second lien senior secured debt to Caa1 (LGD5) from Caa2 (LGD5) The rating outlook is stable RATING RATIONALE RCHP's B3 Corporate Family Rating reflects the company's high financial leverage, small scale relative to other for-profit hospital operators in the U.S., and high reliance on revenue and EBITDA generation from a limited number of facilities and markets. The rating also reflects the risks associated with the expectation that the company will pursue growth through acquisitions in order to gain scale. Further, acquisitions are likely to be debt financed given the modest amount of free cash flow. However, acquisitions of income producing operations are likely to reduce leverage given RCHP's already high leverage. The rating is also supported by Moody's expectations for improving operating results, driven by same facility revenue and earnings growth and lower bad debt expense from the expansion of insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The stable rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that operational improvements at the company's existing and recently acquired facilities will result in strengthening credit metrics but that debt repayment will be limited. Further, Moody's believes that the company's liquidity position will improve over the next 12 to 18 months with modest but growing free cash flow. RCHP's ratings could be upgraded if the company gains scale, improves revenue and earnings diversification and maintains good liquidity. Furthermore, the company will need to reduce and sustain debt to EBITDA below 5.0 times to warrant an upgrade. RCHP's ratings could be downgraded if the company experiences major operating difficulties in any of its regional markets that would hinder the expected improvement in credit metrics. The ratings could also be downgraded if the company increases leverage for a material debt funded acquisition or shareholder distribution, or if liquidity or free cash flow deteriorate. More specifically, if debt to EBITDA is expected to be sustained above 6.5 times, the ratings could be downgraded. RCHP is focused on acquiring and developing general acute care hospitals in non-urban markets and currently operates eight regional medical centers in seven states. The company is being acquired by private equity firm, Apollo, from the current equity sponsor Warburg Pincus in a transaction that is expected to close by the end of 2015. RCHP generated revenues, after the provision for doubtful accounts, of approximately $730 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2015. The principal methodology used in these ratings was Global Healthcare Service Providers published in December 2011. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
