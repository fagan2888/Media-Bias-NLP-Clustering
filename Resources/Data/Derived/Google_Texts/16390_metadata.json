The government-funded RT produced a cartoonish video pushing Kremlin rhetoric that the hundreds of thousands of diverse, multi-partisan Ukrainian opposition\u2013which protested nonviolently for months until their authoritarian leader approved the use of live ammunition against civilians\u2013are overwhelmingly fascists. \u201cFascist\u201d is a go-to accusation Russian politicians and media use when silencing both foreigners and but domestic, pro-democracy critics.\n\nThe government has also censored pro-Ukrainian social media in Russia, while the military makes conspicuous calls for veterans to band together as \u201ctourist units\u201d and vacation in Crimea.\n\nAll of this works, except when it doesn't.\n\nMany Russian citizens and ethnic Russian in Crimea are adamant about developing closer ties between the two and blame the west for destabilizing Ukraine, but according to Radio Free Europe, \u201cindependent opinions polls conducted before the crisis show that an overwhelming majority of Russians opposed Russian meddling in Ukrainian politics as well as a possible military intervention in the country.\u201d\n\nSome have become vocal and active opponents of the invasion, since Ukraine has not provoked violence. The independent Moscow Times critiques that Russia was hoping to provoke a \u201c'Georgian scenario' in Crimea. In that conflict, Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 because that country's troops attacked Russian servicemen, providing the perfect casus belli. But no such attacks took place in Crimea.\u201d\n\nYesterday, nonviolent anti-war protests took place in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Around 350 people were arrested in Moscow, according to The New Republic. Another Ukrainian-sympathetic rally with as many as 1,500 participants similarly shut down last week. Meanwhile, a larger pro-war demonstration went undisturbed.\n\nEven the Consul General of Russia in the Crimea admitted that claims that Russian citizens were killed by Ukrainians\u2013one of the pretexts for the invasion\u2013was unfounded.\n\nRadio Free Europe points out that the \u201ca number of Russian luminaries, including rock musician Yury Shevchuk, have also delivered unusually harsh criticism of the Kremlin,\" and suggests that \" rift in public opinion between educated, city-dwelling Russians and those living in small towns with only limited access online news sites.\"\n\nRead more Reason coverage of Ukraine here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "While the Russian military violates the sovereignty of Ukraine and threatens war by sending in soldiers, occupying the neighboring nation's airspace,", "title": "Russia's Propaganda and Censorship War in Crimea and at Home", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/03/russias-propaganda-and-censorship-war-in", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13938728829229.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13938728829229.jpg", "description": "While the Russian military\nviolates the sovereignty of Ukraine and threatens war by sending in\nsoldiers, occupying the neighboring nation's airspace, and\nsurrounding the Crimean peninsula with warships, the government has\nbeen&nbsp;conducting\na parallel propaganda\nwar.\nThe Daily Beast", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Russia's Propaganda and Censorship War in Crimea and at Home"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2014-03-03T19:19:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/zenon-evans"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca355\"", "article_summary": "While the Russian military violates the sovereignty of Ukraine and threatens war by sending in soldiers, occupying the neighboring nation's airspace, and surrounding the Crimean peninsula with warships, the government has been conducting a parallel propaganda war.\nThe independent Moscow Times critiques that Russia was hoping to provoke a \u201c'Georgian scenario' in Crimea.\nBut no such attacks took place in Crimea.\u201dYesterday, nonviolent anti-war protests took place in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\nEven the Consul General of Russia in the Crimea admitted that claims that Russian citizens were killed by Ukrainians\u2013one of the pretexts for the invasion\u2013was unfounded.\nIn that conflict, Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 because that country's troops attacked Russian servicemen, providing the perfect casus belli."}
