Construction is envisioned to start late next year and be complete by early 2015.\n\nThe county board of supervisors started moving forward with the purchase earlier this year. Mylan announced in mid-2012 that it would shut down the Napa plant this year, a decision five years coming.\n\nBill Kampton of Colliers International is marketing the remaining 200,000 square feet of the campus for lease. Available are 150,000 square feet in two high-clear-height warehouses, of the type in high demand in southern Napa Valley these days, and a 50,000-square-foot manufacturing \"minicampus.\" That building had labs, offices as well as storage and shipping capabilities, such as truck docks.\n\nFunds for the Dey Labs campus purchase came from the county's Accumulated Capital Outlay Fund. Money for the campus has been set aside for about a decade, according to Mr. Lederer.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Agency currently occupies three historic buildings and modular buildings on a four-acre site on Old Solano Road. That property likely will be sold after the move, according to Mr. Lederer.\n\nTwo years ago, the county had explored renovating that campus at a cost of $76 million.\n\n[gallery exclude=\"85099\" link=\"file\" order=\"DESC\" columns=\"1\"]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The North Bay Business Journal", "description": "[caption id=", "title": "County of Napa buys Dey Labs campus", "url": "http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/industry news/4184399-181/county-of-napa-buys-dey", "image": "http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/csp/mediapool/sites/nbbj/assets/img/logo/nbbj_square.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"page_id": 62345329754, "app_id": 175505928793}, "description": "[caption id="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe288d\"", "article_summary": "[caption id=\"attachment_85099\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] The county of Napa plans to transform the former Dey Labs campus, seen here from the east, into a 150,000-square-foot Health and Human Services Agency center, and leasing the rest.\nTLCD Architecture of Santa Rosa is developing plans for the tenant improvements of 150,000 square feet the county agency is set to occupy at the campus, located on Napa Valley Corporate Drive at Napa Valley Corporate Way.\n(image credit: Google Maps)[/caption]NAPA -- The county of Napa said it completed its acquisition of the 25-acre former Dey Laboratories, which will be renovated for a new base of operations for county health services that are expanding because of health care reform and state responsibilities shifting to the county.\nThe Health and Human Services Agency currently occupies three historic buildings and modular buildings on a four-acre site on Old Solano Road.\nBill Kampton of Colliers International is marketing the remaining 200,000 square feet of the campus for lease."}
