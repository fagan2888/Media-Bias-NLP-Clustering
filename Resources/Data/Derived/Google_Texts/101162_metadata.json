(Photo: CPR/John Daley) Many Coloradans, like Helen and William Gallegos of Leadville, in rural Lake County, found health insurance this year on the state\u2019s health care exchange.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t an easy journey. The couple, both in their 60s, needed help from certified health coverage guide Lee Trujillo. He works for the state\u2019s exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, and is responsible for signing up many of the state\u2019s uninsured like the Gallegos family.\n\n\u201cWe just help navigate folks through this whole new world of insurance,\" says Trujillo, who co-owns and runs a tavern on the town\u2019s main street.\n\nTrujillo is part of a team that helped bring down the state\u2019s uninsured rate from 17 percent to 11 percent -- one of the biggest declines in the nation. As the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s second open enrollment to buy private insurance kicks off on Saturday, Trujillo and others are working to drive down the uninsured rate even more.\n\nSupport staff pays off\n\nHelen Gallegos doesn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid anymore because her income rose slightly to nearly $21,000 a year. \u201cI know she\u2019s healthy as a horse, I just wanted some insurance for her because we never know,\u201d says William Gallegos.\n\nBut buying insurance isn\u2019t as easy as shopping for new tires. There are all sorts of variables to consider: premiums, out of pocket costs, deductibles, tax credits. In short, Trujillo says, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nLake County, in Colorado's high country, recently saw a significant decline its uninsured rate. (Photo: CPR/John Daley) Despite that, he\u2019s signed up hundreds of his neighbors for insurance. He sets up shop at partner agencies, clinics, and here at his bar.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s such a small town, they kind of know my routine and they\u2019ll either catch me on the way to the post office or Safeway,\u201d Trujillo says.\n\nAccording to one estimate, Lake County\u2019s uninsured rate dropped from 23 percent to 12 percent since the Affordable Care Act went into effect this year. \"We've had a lot of people sign up for Medicaid,\" says Colleen Nielsen, director of the Lake County Public Health Agency in Leadville.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado employs 450 health coverage guides, like Lee Trujillo, at 54 sites. Also signing folks up, or renewing accounts, are some 1,600 insurance brokers and 220 customer service representatives at the exchange's call centers.\n\nStatewide, Colorado has signed up more than 425,000 people who were uninsured before, according to the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing. Colorado ranks in the top five states seeing the biggest decline in the number of people who are uninsured.\n\nMap: Civis Analytics/Enroll America\n\nNew goal: Finding harder-to-reach uninsured\n\nOne goal for the coming year is to bring the uninsured rate under 10 percent. Sue Birch, the executive director of the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, Colorado's Medicaid agency, says the focus will be on 20-somethings (the \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d) and Latinos.\n\n\u201cWe think we can find the bulk of those folks this next go around,\u201d says Birch.\n\nMany of the uninsured most likely to sign up through the state exchange did so during its first year, says Gary Drews, CEO of Connect for Health Colorado. That\u2019s why educating consumers, often through navigators, is key.\n\n\u201cThe education effort that it takes around helping people understand the value of insurance and how it plays into your life is not something we\u2019re taught in school,\" says Drews.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado also upgraded its website for this coming year. Instead of two applications to fill out to determine if someone qualifies for Medicaid or tax credits for private insurance, there's now just one.\n\nIssues linger\n\nIndustry watchers have their eyes on a number of issues besides coverage as the Affordable Care Act matures. Michelle Lueck, with the non-partisan, non-profit Colorado Health Institute says state officials will need to pivot from establishing the system to improving it and ensuring the workforce exists to meet the demands of thousands of new customers.\n\n\u201cIs it adequate? Is it quality?\u201d Lueck says.\n\nThere are other big questions to answer. Will Colorado\u2019s exchange be self-sustaining financially by next year as required by state law? And for William Gallegos, he questions how affordable federally mandated health insurance will be. He says now that his wife Helen has insurance they want to keep it. \u201cAs long as our premiums doesn\u2019t keep going up, you know,\u201d says Gallegos.\n\nUltimately, during their hour long discussion, the couple\u2019s health coverage guide Lee Trujillo finds Helen a plan she can afford. It's a mid-level, or silver, plan. It will have her paying, with tax credits and cost sharing, at most $500 a year out of pocket. \"I think I like that plan,\" says Helen.\n\nTrujillo says he's confident the state will bring its uninsured rate lower by signing up consumers like Helen one at a time.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "A rural county in Colorado\u2019s high country saw one of the state\u2019s biggest drops in the number of uninsured.
