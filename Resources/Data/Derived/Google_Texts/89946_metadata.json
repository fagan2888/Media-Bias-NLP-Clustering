And much of the legislation enacted this year was to expand the state-federal Medicaid program under the law because it is essential in paying and providing coverage for the estimated 2.7 million uninsured Americans affected by mental illness, the report states.\n\nOregon, for example, increased its 2014-15 budget by roughly 22 percent to comply with the president\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nThe group argues that timing also played a factor in the increases, particularly the White House\u2019s response to the Sandy Hook shootings -- in which 20 students and six adults were fatally shot. And that the mass shooting happened right before state legislative sessions started.\n\nThe White House called for widespread changes including tighter school security and increased background checks on gun buyers. However, the NAMI argued the vast majority of people with mental illness is \u201cno more violent than the general population\u201d and called for providers of mental-health care to do a better job of complying with exist standards when reporting dangerous behavior related to gun ownership.\n\nThe report points out that mental-health advocates warned that the \u201cavalanche\u201d of state legislation could result in Americans not seeking mental-health care and that changes could threaten civil liberties.\n\nAmong the changes cited was the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, one of the first bills enacted in 2013 that increased the responsibilities of providers to turn over mental health records as related to gun sales. Similar SAFE acts were enacted in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut and Tennessee.\n\nThe report also points out Alaska and North Carolina reduced their mental health budgets.\n\nThe Obama administration last month announced the final executive order of 23 that the president signed in January, while Congress has not come through in efforts to keep guns out the hands of people who are mentally ill and dangerous.\n\nOne change is mental health patients can now get immediate emergency room care, like somebody with a broken bone, without having to get pre-approval from their insurance company.\n\n\"Imagine what it would mean if people felt as comfortable saying they were going for counseling as they do saying they're going for a flu shot or physical therapy,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in announcing the change.\n\nVermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said before the president signed the executive orders that he didn\u2019t know whether an assault weapons ban could pass the Senate but thought a bill to improved background checks and related ones could pass.\n\n\"There are some who say nothing will pass,\u201d he said. \u201cI disagree with that. What I'm interested in is what we can get.\"", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Legislation,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND LOCAL/Governors,/FOX
