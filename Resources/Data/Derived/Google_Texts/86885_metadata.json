The vast majority of the candidates running are your Republican establishment candidates who\u2019ve never had to fight in a Republican primary.\u201d\n\nCavuto \u2013 visibly irritated by Levin\u2019s comments \u2013 promptly interrupted his guest.\n\n\u201cAll right, listen I\u2019ll arrange the next dinner party for you and Karl Rove,\u201d Cavuto said. \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ve got to run upstairs and talk to my bosses.\u201d\n\nLevin has repeatedly expressed his dislike of Rove.\n\nOn his show in September 2013, he blasted Rove for rejecting Republicans who advocated defunding Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI say this with all due respect, because Fox is my favorite cable network, Karl Rove and Dana Perino, it\u2019s like they\u2019re endlessly on all the programs there, hawking the establishment Republican position,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are all the Reaganites?!\u201d\n\nLevin added, \u201cYour record sucks, Karl Rove! Why are we going to listen to you?!\u201d\n\nAs WND has reported, Rove joked in 2012 that then-Missouri Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin should be killed for making a controversial comment on rape.\n\n\u201cWe should sink Todd Akin,\u201d Rove is quoted as saying in Bloomberg Businessweek. \u201cIf he\u2019s found mysteriously murdered, don\u2019t look for my whereabouts.\u201d\n\nRove reportedly apologized, but not in public.\n\nWND also reported that Rove saw donations to his three Crossroads groups plummet by 98 percent after \u201cdeclaring war\u201d on the tea party and spending nearly $325 million on the 2012 elections with little to show for it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "On Fox News\u2019 \u201cCavuto\u201d Thursday, talk-radio host Mark Levin ripped into the television network for employing establishment Republican strategist Karl Rove.
