Last month the voters across Louisiana exercised their right to vote and the results could potentially change the direction our state is going. In addition to our new statewide leaders \u2014 Gov.-elect John Bel Edwards, Lt. Gov.-elect Billy Nungesser, and Attorney General-elect Jeff Landry \u2014 Louisianans elected 10 new parish presidents, 10 new police jury presidents, 30 new state representatives, and 11 new state senators. And this doesn\u2019t include numerous parish councilmen, police jurors, and other local officials. Let me take this chance to congratulate them on behalf of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA).\n\nAll these changes begs the question of, \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Over the course of the next few weeks, there will be feverish activities leading up the \u201corganizational session\u201d that convenes Jan. 11. These actions include appointments of key cabinet level secretaries, selection of House and Senate leadership, committee makeup announcements and general policy development for upcoming sessions. The decisions made in this time will chart the course for what is to come over the next year, at least.\n\nThis is why it is imperative that LMOGA monitor, track, and engage in the various moving parts. The oil and gas industry in Louisiana has a $73.8 billion economic impact and is responsible for employing more than 300,000 citizens, according to a 2014 Dr. Loren Scott study. Additionally, our technological breakthroughs and the utilization of hydraulic fracturing has contributed to the so-called \u201cEnergy Renaissance\u201d and the subsequent expansion announcements found in the chemical industry.\n\nGiven the low prices of the commodities we produce and manufacture, times are tough for the oil and gas industry \u2014 and forecasts indicate it will remain so for the immediate future. Therefore, it is critical decision makers understand the impacts of the decisions they make and the votes they cast. LMOGA is dedicated to working with these key players to educate them and extrapolate the impacts of future legislation\n\nThere is little doubt that along the way there will be disagreements. That is why it is incumbent for the citizenry to stay engaged. Feedback to your elected official on the effects of these issues on your livelihood plays a large role in their deliberations. The importance of voter input cannot be overstated.\n\nIt is critical that we all understand that the oil and gas industry needs Louisiana, and Louisiana needs the oil and gas industry. It is only through this collaboration that Louisiana will be able to reach new heights. As you enjoy the Christmas season, remember all choirs are most effective when everyone is singing from the same hymnal.\n\n\u2014 Chris John, former congressman, is president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/2015/12/12/chris-john-oil-industry-voters-must-watch-legislative-session-closely/77142712/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A new era has begun in Louisiana. \u00a0 Last month the voters across Louisiana exercised their right to vote and the results could potentially change the direction our state is going.", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "A new era has begun in Louisiana. \u00a0 Last month the voters across Louisiana exercised their right to vote and the results could potentially change the direction our state is going.", "title": "Chris John: Oil industry, voters must watch legislative session closely", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/2015/12/12/chris-john-oil-industry-voters-must-watch-legislative-session-closely/77142712/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new era has begun in Louisiana. \u00a0 Last month the voters across Louisiana exercised their right to vote and the results could potentially change the direction our state is going.", "title": "Chris John: Oil industry, voters must watch legislative session closely", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/93ed65402678777a3d3549f0ae788e2f864a74bc/c=0-59-498-557&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/12/LafayetteLA/B9317693242Z.1_20150612164429_000_GUEB2HGQU.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "It is critical that we all understand that the oil and gas industry needs Louisiana, and Louisiana needs the oil and gas industry.\n\u2014 Chris John, former congressman, is president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association.\nLet me take this chance to congratulate them on behalf of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA).\nGiven the low prices of the commodities we produce and manufacture, times are tough for the oil and gas industry \u2014 and forecasts indicate it will remain so for the immediate future.\nThe oil and gas industry in Louisiana has a $73.8 billion economic impact and is responsible for employing more than 300,000 citizens, according to a 2014 Dr. Loren Scott study."}
