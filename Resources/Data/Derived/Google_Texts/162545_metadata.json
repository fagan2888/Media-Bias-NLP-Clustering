We look forward to seeing how it plays out in the future.\u201d\n\nIn Hawaii, the average tuition rate is about $2,700 per year.\n\nMeisenzahl says free tuition for the first two years would be an attractive option for Hawaii community college students who choose to move on to UH for a four-year degree.\n\nRoosevelt High School senior Mami Ogiwora is currently filling out college applications for four-year institutions, but says she\u2019d consider community college if Obama\u2019s proposal goes through.\n\n\u201cI did not hear about that, but that sounds quite amazing. I definitely would look into it,\u201d she said.\n\nCurrent college student Moises Perez says he and his friends juggle school with one or two jobs and is in favor of \u201cfree community college.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool is really expensive,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThat would really help out, especially with people who can\u2019t afford education but really want to improve their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course the devil\u2019s in the details. Anything we can do to keep cost of college reasonable for students is a top priority,\u201d said Meisenzahl.\n\nIf \u201cAmerica\u2019s College Promise\u201d goes through and Hawaii participates, it is up to the state to come up with 25 percent of the funding for free community college.\n\nClick here for more information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A spokesman says the University of Hawaii and its affiliated community colleges are on board with a plan to make community college free for \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.khon", "og": {"site_name": "KHON2", "description": "A spokesman says the University of Hawaii and its affiliated community colleges are on board with a plan to make community college free for the first two years.", "title": "UH on board with Obama\u2019s community college plan", "url": "http://khon2.com/2015/01/09/uh-on-board-with-obamas-community-college-plan/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/kapiolani-community-college.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A spokesman says the University of Hawaii and its affiliated community colleges are on board with a plan to make community college free for the first two years.", "creator": "@khonnews", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/kapiolani-community-college.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "UH on board with Obama\u2019s community college plan", "site": "khonnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Working for Hawaii - Hawaii News, Weather, and Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411526747", "fb": {"pages": 66874361378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "KHON2", "google-site-verification": "F8HhCy2NOcu_QvRKzZJGqFMMgASTuCT3_KKw72WqXWw", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/khon2news", "published_time": "2015-01-10T04:11:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-10T04:17:34+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khon2.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b26093ebd87004d2709601aeb29b2013?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAmerica\u2019s College Promise\u201d would be a matching grant program that makes the federal government responsible for 75 percent of the average cost of community college.\nRoosevelt High School senior Mami Ogiwora is currently filling out college applications for four-year institutions, but says she\u2019d consider community college if Obama\u2019s proposal goes through.\nIf \u201cAmerica\u2019s College Promise\u201d goes through and Hawaii participates, it is up to the state to come up with 25 percent of the funding for free community college.\nKapiolani Community CollegePresident Barack Obama says his new proposal to make the first two years of community college free will lead to better jobs, better wages and better benefits.\nMeisenzahl says free tuition for the first two years would be an attractive option for Hawaii community college students who choose to move on to UH for a four-year degree."}
