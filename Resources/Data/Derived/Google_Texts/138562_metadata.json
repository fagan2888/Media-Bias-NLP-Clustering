She uses the wings on her helmet to float, and a large axe to smite her foes with a ranged attack.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s key during many of the levels in each world is to conquer environmental obstacle with the assistance from the green, always smiling, froggy fly named Murfy.\n\nMurfy pops up when needed and a player prompts him to cut ropes, turn handles to open passageways, eat through massive Pop-Tart like obstacles and even tickle enemies to help Rayman on his journey.\n\nWith Murfy in tow, it\u2019s still a daunting game to beat with bosses ready to attack and beasts such as sea monsters, giggling goblins, and luchadores on the prowl.\n\nThose wild levels in each world will deliver some head scratching too as finding all of the secrets of each level and most efficient routes to escape danger will have players revisiting the areas.\n\nFor example, with a wall of fire chasing me in a castle, how do I manage to get Murfy to cut a rope to drop a caged Teensie in my path to break him free from his bondage while still jumping across a chasm?\n\nWhile underwater, how do I avoid the light pattern of laser blasting sentries protecting caverns as I scavenge for lums and seek the last distressed Teensie.\n\nWhen climbing a reasonable facile of Mount Olympus in the clouds, how can I escape the peril of a giant finger from the gods unleashing bolts at me, sizzling swords swooping down to block my path and horned imps floating on shields shooting fireballs?\n\nI\u2019ll mention the absurdly cartoony violence only to note the massive amounts of eye poking, smacking and gassy termination of foes. The incessant cries of \u201chelp me\u2019 from the Teensies may fluster the more mild-mannered youngster.\n\nAlso, when Rayman\u2019s and his pals\u2019 health is depleted, their demise is amusing rather than morose as they blow up like a balloon and pop.\n\nAdditional content at the main hub includes access to daily and weekly mini-games, a peek at a collection of unlocked creatures that generate extra lums every day and access to a goofy but worthy multiplayer mini-game called Kung Foot that will even make the soccer purist smile through it frenetic play\n\nIt\u2019s further worth noting that players collecting enough lums each level also unlock lucky tickets that, once scratched off, can reward them with more lums, creatures and, get this, levels from the 2011 Rayman Origins.\n\nOverall, Rayman Legends is a satisfying, looney work of art, complex enough for the older side-scroller fan to appreciate and absurdly silly and addictive enough for any younger gamer in the family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A disjointed hero and his pals wake up from a 100-year long nap and help restore order to the Glade of Dreams in the fantastic side-scrolling adventure.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A disjointed hero and his pals wake up from a 100-year long nap and help restore order to the Glade of Dreams in the fantastic side-scrolling adventure.", "title": "Zadzooks: Rayman Legends review", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/14/zadzooks-rayman-legends-review/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/14/rayman-barbara-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/14/rayman-barbara-800.jpg", "description": "A disjointed hero and his pals wake up from a 100-year long nap and help restore order to the Glade of Dreams in the fantastic side-scrolling adventure.", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: Rayman Legends review"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Rayman Legends"}, "article_summary": "A disjointed hero and his pals help restore order to the Glade of Dreams in the action adventure Rayman Legends (Ubisoft, reviewed for Xbox 360, rated E10+, $59.99).\nOverall, Rayman Legends is a satisfying, looney work of art, complex enough for the older side-scroller fan to appreciate and absurdly silly and addictive enough for any younger gamer in the family.\nHowever, no disrespect to the mighty Rayman, but I enjoyed taking control of a new character, the Wagnerian Viking princess named Barbara.\nRayman \u2014 still thriving with no arms, legs or neck but working hands, feet and noggin \u2014 is an equal superstar having been around since 1995.\nMurfy pops up when needed and a player prompts him to cut ropes, turn handles to open passageways, eat through massive Pop-Tart like obstacles and even tickle enemies to help Rayman on his journey."}
