Ted Cruz has repeatedly gotten basic facts about the Internal Revenue Service wrong when delivering one of his favorite applause lines, calling for its abolition.\n\nHe did it \u2014 again \u2014 over the weekend in New Hampshire, when he said:\n\nCruz, March 15: There are 110,000 agents at the IRS. We need to put a padlock on that building and take every one of those 110,000 agents and put them on our southern border.\n\nThat line gets applause from conservatives who don\u2019t like either the IRS or don\u2019t like those living in the U.S. illegally. But the fact is that the IRS has nowhere close to 110,000 total employees \u2014 even counting lowly clerks. And it hasn\u2019t for nearly 20 years.\n\nAccording to the IRS\u2019s most recent budget request, which the administration submitted in February, Congress has enacted budget authority for only 82,203 total employees in the current fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30. That\u2019s down from 84,761 total workers last fiscal year (as measured by the usual \u201cfull-time equivalent,\u201d or FTE, standard).\n\nAnd of those 82,000, only about one in four can properly be called \u201cagents,\u201d or even \u201crevenue officers.\u201d\n\nCruz has made this factually challenged line part of his standard stump speech as he explores running for president. We found he has been using it since at least last July. During a star turn at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference gathering on Feb. 26 he got so amped up that he inflated the number to 125,000 agents. The line brought down the house.\n\nBut at the International Association of Fire Fighters on March 10 the line was greeted by silence. (Cruz was by then back to his 110,000 figure \u2014 see video starting at 7:50)\n\nThe fact is, however, the last time the IRS had 110,000 workers was nearly 20 years ago, in the Clinton administration. On Sept. 30, 1995 \u2014 at the end of fiscal year 1995 \u2014 the IRS had just over 114,000 total employees. It dropped to 102,000 a year later, and has been below 100,000 ever since, according to employment figures from the IRS\u2019s annual Data Books and its most recent budget submission.\n\nFurthermore, not all IRS employees can properly be called \u201cagents.\u201d We went over this in 2010 when other Republicans were also peddling false information about the IRS. At the time, they were claiming that 16,500 new \u201cagents\u201d would be needed to enforce the Affordable Care Act. In one extreme instance then-Rep. Ron Paul of Texas claimed all 16,500 \u201cagents\u201d would be \u201carmed.\u201d\n\nAs we said back then, there\u2019s a huge difference between an IRS revenue agent \u2014 who calls on taxpayers and conducts face-to-face audits \u2014 and the workers who make up the bulk of IRS employees.\n\nWhat we said then \u2014 and it still holds true \u2014 is that IRS workers include clerks, accountants, computer programmers, telephone call center workers and other support staff.\n\nAs of the most recent detailed breakdown from the IRS Data Book\u2014 covering fiscal year 2013 \u2014 only 15 percent of all IRS employees carried the title of revenue agent. Another 3 percent were \u201cspecial agents\u201d (who conduct criminal investigations, and who really are sometimes packing firearms), and another 6 percent were \u201crevenue officers\u201d (who seek to collect delinquent tax payments and track down those who haven\u2019t filed a return.)\n\nCruz Response\n\nWhen we asked where Cruz got his 110,000 figure, his deputy press secretary, Phil Novack, told us that it came from a report by the Treasury Department\u2019s Inspector General. That report stated that the IRS \u201cworkforce\u201d was 107,622 at the end of fiscal 2010. However, the IG report also stated that the \u201cworkforce\u201d had already declined to 97,717 by the following year, and of course it has gone down more since then. So even using his own source, Cruz was wrong.\n\nThe IG\u2019s figures also includes many workers who are carried on the IRS payroll but actually work for other agencies, such as in criminal fraud investigations. The figures we have given from the IRS represent \u2014 in the words of the IRS Data Book \u2014 \u201cpositions actually used to conduct IRS operations.\u201d They exclude positions funded by reimbursements from other federal agencies and private entities for services performed for these external parties, according to the IRS.\n\nNovack said, \u201cSen. Cruz was clearly making a joke to convey the point [that all IRS workers] are engaged in one mission: collecting taxes under a tax code that is too complex, too costly, and unfair to the American taxpayer. \u201d\n\nWe think the joke would work just as well if Cruz was more careful about getting his facts straight.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He did it \u2014 again \u2014 over the weekend in New Hampshire, when he said:Cruz, March 15: There are 110,000 agents at the IRS.\nFurthermore, not all IRS employees can properly be called \u201cagents.\u201d We went over this in 2010 when other Republicans were also peddling false information about the IRS.\nBut the fact is that the IRS has nowhere close to 110,000 total employees \u2014 even counting lowly clerks.\nWe need to put a padlock on that building and take every one of those 110,000 agents and put them on our southern border.\nWhat we said then \u2014 and it still holds true \u2014 is that IRS workers include clerks, accountants, computer programmers, telephone call center workers and other support staff."}
