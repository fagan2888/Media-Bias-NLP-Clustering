It\u2019s known as a net-metering credit (to be distinguished from tax incentives, rebates and other benefits for solar owners).\n\nObviously, homeowners should be paid for surplus electricity produced during the day\u2019s sun-baked hours (at other times, remember, they suck electricity from the grid just like everyone else). But surely they should also contribute to the utility\u2019s transmission and distribution system, upon which they remain no less dependent than customers without solar systems.\n\nIf solar customers are not going to be required to pay for basic infrastructure, then at the very least the extent of the subsidy should be transparent.\n\nTo that end, Xcel has asked the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to look into the matter and to fully account for net-metering subsidies. It\u2019s a good moment to do so given the continuing rapid growth of rooftop solar.\n\nCurrently, the 15,000 or so solar owners still represent a small slice of Xcel\u2019s customer base. So it\u2019s not a big deal if they\u2019re freeloading a bit. But as solar\u2019s costs decline and that number grows, say, to hundreds of thousands, the subsidy could become a very big deal indeed.\n\nAs you no doubt have noticed, solar panels tend to sprout upon the homes of those with discretionary income \u2014 often the upper-middle class. And while third-party ownership and other innovations are putting solar within reach of an ever-widening pool of consumers, it\u2019s safe to say the poor and working class will be late to the party. At some point, the net-metering credit will amount to a travesty of income redistribution.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we should take at face value Xcel\u2019s estimate of the net-metering subsidy, which it calculates at 5.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. As Jaffe\u2019s article noted, the solar industry has raised a number of serious objections to Xcel\u2019s analysis. And solar enthusiasts are perhaps correct that \u201cthe utility industry sees rooftop solar as a threat to its business model,\u201d as the president of Namaste Solar declared.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to remember that the solar industry is, well, an industry no more or less virtuous and disinterested than a given utility \u2014 and no less likely to exaggerate its case.\n\nForbes contributor William Pentland, a big proponent of decentralized energy, recently suggested that \u201cthe rooftop solar industry would probably not exist \u2014 or, at least not exist at its present scale \u2014 without favorable net-metering policies.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, he added, \u201cWhy should your neighbors pay you more than the market rate for electricity generated on your roof during the day? They shouldn\u2019t, and that is the pickle for many net-metering policies.\u201d\n\nE-mail Vincent Carroll at vcarroll@denverpost.com.
