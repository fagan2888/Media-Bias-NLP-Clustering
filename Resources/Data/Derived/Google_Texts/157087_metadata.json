Fourteen pairs of hands clapped in excitement.\n\nMahaney said that consumers in the community could \"breathe easy\" knowing that their health care will not suddenly be more expensive than they'd planned.\n\nConsumers like Mark Leicht, who also spoke at the celebration.\n\nHe said for him and his wife, the Affordable Care Act provides him peace of mind and gives him the option to seek insurance independent of his place of employment.\n\nThe subsidies, he said, mean \"we don't have to choose between groceries and health care.\"\n\nPadgett Smith, board president of the church, noted that there were still challenges to consider, even as they basked in the glow of their victory.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with the 300,000 in our state without health care,\" Smith said.\n\nTo see how local lawmakers reacted to Thursday's ruling, read News-Leader reporter Thomas Gounley's article on the topic.\n\nBuy Photo Crystal Brigman Mahaney, deputy director for Missouri Health Care for All, speaks during an event held at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in Springfield, Mo. on June 24, 2015 by Missouri Health Care for All to celebrate today's United States Supreme Court decision to uphold a key provision in the Affordable Care Act.
