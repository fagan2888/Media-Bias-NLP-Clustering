All five candidates, or their biggest supporters, spent the day in Wisconsin to try to win your vote.

Two of the Republican candidates and Sarah Palin spoke at a GOP dinner at Serb Hall in Milwaukee on Friday night.

The Republican presidential candidate who is leading the others in Wisconsin polls said if elected president, he will repeal the Affordable Care Act, promote a flat tax and repeal the IRS. He also mocked rival Donald Trump a few times and talked tough on defeating ISIS terrorists.



"Come January 2017, a day of reckoning is coming. We are not going to weaken, we are not going to degrade, we are going to utterly and completely destroy ISIS," Cruz said.



Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he's running for president because he was called to serve to use his experience in government and business, and said he understands voters who are leaning toward Donald Trump.



"They worry about the fact that they could lose their job, that they're 52 years old and somebody comes in someday and says, 'You're out of work,' or some politician made some deal and somehow they lost out," Kasich said.



Trump was not there, but sent former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to campaign for him.



"Only Trump talks rationally about listening to top brass as president and hiring the best of the best to work alongside our commander-in-chief to work with those who share our interests in stopping the Islamic threat," Palin said.



While Palin spoke for Trump on Friday night, Trump will resume campaigning in Wisconsin on Saturday. He'll speak in Racine at noon.
