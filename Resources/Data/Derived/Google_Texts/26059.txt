PHILADELPHIA — Last year, that puck goes in the net in the final minute. Last year, the Avs would have found a way to get that big tying goal in the third period, with the goalie pulled, and they probably go on to win the game in OT or a shootout. All the kinds of games the Avs won last year, they’re losing this year.

The Avs fell to 4-7-5 (hut hut) by losing 4-3 here. A huge third-period rally fell short, with John Mitchell’s tying bid in the final few seconds blocked by a Flyers D-man, and that was that.

The turning point of the game was the Nathan MacKinnon 5-minute major on Luke Schenn in the first period. The Flyers got two PP goals out of it, and the Avs kind of were in disarray the rest of the second period, allowing two more goals – including a 5-on-3 one by Claude Giroux.

Patrick Roy blew a gasket after the call on MacKinnon, and I expected him to rip the call more after the game. To everyone’s surprise, though, he said he had “no problem with the call.” His reason for yelling so much, he said, was because he thought a linesman made the call on the major, not a referee.

Anyway, looking at the replays more after the game, I think it was the correct call. I mean, MacKinnon barely pushed Schenn, and Schenn losing an edge with his left skate contributed to the play. But MacKinnon did push him, however slight, and it was a dangerous place to push him. Schenn being injured on the play was a factor, I think too. If he pops right back up, that’s probably a two-minute minor call. Fact is, when a player stays down, it puts more pressure on the refs to call something.

MacKinnon said it was a “dumb” play by him.
