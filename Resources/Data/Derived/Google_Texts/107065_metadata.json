And because he\u2019s not a slugger, he\u2019s disinclined to rank himself ahead of Oh.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare,\u201d Suzuki said through a translator. \u201cMr. Oh had 868 runs by himself with homers, so his record is much greater than mine.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Suzuki said, Oh played entirely in Japan, where his seasons were shorter than in the majors.\n\nSuzuki scored on Adeiny Hechavarria\u2019s home run to help the Miami Marlins beat the Washington Nationals 8-0. The run gave Suzuki 1,968 in the major leagues (1,310) and Japan (658), surpassing Oh\u2019s record for a Japanese player.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s Mr. Oh\u2019s record, it\u2019s very special,\u201d Suzuki said.\n\nSuzuki received a big ovation from the crowd and a jubilant greeting from his teammates when he scored the record-breaking run.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m happiest about is you have fans and teammates who acknowledge it, and might even know more than I know about my own records,\u201d Suzuki said.\n\nThe 41-year-old outfielder and 10-time All-Star outfielder had two hits to hike his average to .286. He has played in every game this year.\n\n\u201cThis guy has been fun to have around,\u201d Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. \u201cHe\u2019s special. He has been around a long time and accomplished so much. He\u2019s going to be a big part of our team, and you\u2019ve seen that already.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ichiro Suzuki crossed the plate at a home-run trot Saturday to break a Japanese record for runs set by Sadaharu Oh.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ichiro Suzuki crossed the plate at a home-run trot Saturday to break a Japanese record for runs set by Sadaharu Oh.", "title": "Suzuki breaks Oh\u2019s record for runs by a Japanese player", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/25/koehler-marlins-win-4th-in-a-row-beat-nationals-8-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/25/7513dd99864bb412740f6a7067004708.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/25/7513dd99864bb412740f6a7067004708.jpg", "description": "Ichiro Suzuki crossed the plate at a home-run trot Saturday to break a Japanese record for runs set by Sadaharu Oh.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Suzuki breaks Oh\u2019s record for runs by a Japanese player"}, "Author": "STEVEN WINE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cf8\"", "article_summary": "The run gave Suzuki 1,968 in the major leagues (1,310) and Japan (658), surpassing Oh\u2019s record for a Japanese player.\nMIAMI (AP) - Ichiro Suzuki crossed the plate at a home-run trot Saturday to break a Japanese record for runs set by Sadaharu Oh.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s Mr. Oh\u2019s record, it\u2019s very special,\u201d Suzuki said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s special.\nSuzuki scored on Adeiny Hechavarria\u2019s home run to help the Miami Marlins beat the Washington Nationals 8-0."}
