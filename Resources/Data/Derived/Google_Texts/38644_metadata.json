Who Are They? CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak\n\nWhile the uninsured rate has significantly fallen in the two years after the rollout of Obamacare\u2019s major coverage provisions, a small portion of the American population remains without health care for reasons that not even the advent of targeted outreach strategies has been able to solve, a new study has found.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Robert Johnson Wood Foundation and the Urban Institute, shows that as of March, more than half of uninsured Americans currently live in states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Residents of the non-expansion states who fall in the coverage gap \u2014 with incomes that are too high the Medicaid eligibility mark but too low to qualify for subsidies \u2014 account for nearly 23 percent of Americans without coverage.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Americans without coverage do qualify for Medicaid or subsidies to help them purchase plans through insurance marketplaces. Even so, more than 60 percent of the uninsured designated affordability as their primary reason for not obtaining coverage, a data point that the Urban Institute\u2019s Adele Shartzer describes as indicative of financial hardships burdening people across the country.\n\n\u201cFor some patients, many of whom have less than $100 in savings, health care isn\u2019t a priority,\u201d Shartzer, co-author of the paper, told ThinkProgress. In the research document, titled the Health Reform Monitoring Survey, Shartzer and her colleagues note that improvements to in-person assistance of technology could help uninsured adults find affordable options and better navigate the enrollment process.\n\n\u201cMany people might not know about subsidies available to them so information is a solution,\u201d Shartzer, research associate at the Urban Institute, added. \u201cThe health care law was meant to facilitate appropriate use of health care services and direct people to lower cost care that provides some financial security. A catastrophic health event can wreck your finances.\u201d\n\nThis report comes amid renewed discussion about Obamacare among lawmakers, particularly the more than dozen GOP presidential candidates, most of whom say they\u2019ll do away with the health care law altogether if they get elected. This week, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio released details about how they plan to repeal and replace Obamacare if they win. Plans included the establishment of insurance across state lines, extension of tax credits to Americans of various income levels, and expanding Health Savings Accounts \u2014 ideas that analysts say wouldn\u2019t meaningfully help the poor.\n\nInstead, a better solution to provide covering for the remaining 10 percent of Americans could be accepting Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, which has been implemented unevenly across the country.\n\nHowever, there has been great resistance among governors in the 21 non-expansion states, partially out of a concern that they would shoulder the cost of expansion, even with the Obama administration\u2019s assurances that their expenditures would be reimbursed through 2020. That decision has affected nearly 4 million people \u2014 many of whom hail from African American and Latino communities in the South and fall within the coverage gap.\n\nTo address this dilemma, some GOP lawmakers have developed substitutes for Medicaid expansion, using waivers through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Arkansas, Indiana, and Iowa implemented an expansion alternative by using federal dollars to purchase private insurance for the uninsured, a move that critics say will place state legislatures in financial states since they have to reauthorize financing annually. These ongoing discussions follow decisions by lawmakers\u2019 decisions to expand Medicaid in Alaska and Montana earlier this year, perhaps signs that other changes may happen in other states.\n\n\u201cNon-expansion states have been vocal about their opposition to the Affordable Care Act but situations change and states are incredibly diverse,\u201d Shartzer said. \u201cLawmakers are finding other ways they can expand coverage. It\u2019s certainly better to have expanded through an alternative mechanism than do nothing.\u201d\n\nBut the even with insurance coverage, health issues persist for Americans struggling to make ends meet.\n\nSingle people with incomes more than triple the federal poverty level \u2014 between $30,000 and $40,000 annually \u2014 receive relatively small tax credits. People with higher incomes get nothing. Additionally, high deductible plans \u2014 a coverage option in which health care costs shift to emergencies and large-scale procedures \u2014 can place a stranglehold on individuals and families without much discretionary income. Ron Pollack, executive director of nonprofit Families USA, told the Huffington Post that those high costs often discourage people from getting insurance.\n\nFor first-time insurance holders, navigating the health care system can also be a frustrating experience. An analysis conducted by researchers at D.C.-based advocacy organization Alliance for a Just Society found that people of color contend with a dearth of primary care providers, a lack of internet access, and general confusion about health plans. Additionally, disparities exists between community health clinics in low-income neighborhoods and more affluent areas. Gary Delgado, principal investigator in the study, previously told ThinkProgress that a significant number of people in that population don\u2019t have a \u201cmedical home\u201d so it\u2019s likely that they will use the emergency room instead of seeking preventative services.\n\nAnother hurdle is the high cost of treatment for chronic illnesses, which has sparked criticism of pharmaceutical drug companies. While the ACA forbids insurance companies from refusing coverage to those with preexisting conditions, providers have placed these \u201cspecial medications\u201d in a different category so patients shoulder up to 50 percent of the costs, much more than the individual and family caps on out-of-pocket payments. In recent months, attention has shifted to Hepatitis C medication, now on the market for up to $90,000. Medicare outlays for the payment of that treatment have surpassed $4.5 billion, more than 15 times the amount officials doled out on older version.\n\nShartzer said that that addressing these cost-related issues would make navigating the health care system a more enjoyable experience for Americans, as envisioned by the architects of the ACA.\n\n\u201cAccess to care has been improving, but health care has been lagging behind other industries in making tools available to consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are clear gaps in health insurance care and literacy. We have to acquaint people with health care vocabulary because that can be intimidating.\u201d\n\nEven with these issues, a significant number of Americans do favor the ACA. More than 7 out of 10 Americans who bought new health insurance policies through exchanges last year rated their coverage as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d in a Gallup poll. Amid their calls to \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d even Obamacare\u2019s most ardent opponents favor many specific policies included in the legislation \u2014 including providing subsidies on a sliding scale to aid people who can\u2019t afford insurance and forbidding the cancellation of policies when a person becomes ill.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Despite the gains under Obamacare, some people are still falling through the cracks.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Despite the gains under Obamacare, some people are still falling through the cracks.", "title": "Even After Obamacare, Some Americans Are Uninsured.
