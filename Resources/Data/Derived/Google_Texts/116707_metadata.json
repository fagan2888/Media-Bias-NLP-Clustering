The route is through our vote.\u201d NCLR Vice President Delia de la Vara\n\nReflecting on the past 15 years, why are the ALMA Awards such an important part not only of Latino culture but also of American culture?\n\nSince 1995, the NCLR ALMA Awards has promoted inclusion and diversity in entertainment to reflect our mission to ensure that our fellow Americans know the Latino story and recognize our contributions. The NCLR ALMA Awards highlight the influence Latino artists have on American culture. Our artists are America\u2019s artists. It is also a one-of-a-kind tribute to the spirit of pioneering Latinos in television, film and music. And finally, the NCLR ALMA Awards builds on the work of NCLR by celebrating the contributions our artists are making to their community and to causes important to them.\n\nWhat are you most excited about for Friday\u2019s broadcast?\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a great show, and we are eager what a great year this was for Latinos in entertainment, especially when it comes to music and television. We also will be having a moving tribute to one of the 17 Latinos who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, our nation\u2019s highest military honor, for their valor and service. And finally, this is the ALMA Awards\u2019 \u201cquincea\u00f1era!\u201d We are celebrating the 15th edition of the NCLR ALMA Awards. To honor that special milestone, NCLR is launching \u201cALMA\u2019s 15/Los Quinces,\u201d a group of 15 \u201cambassadors\u201d for the NCLR ALMA Awards. ALMA\u2019s 15 will share memorable moments from the past 15 shows, as well as the value and impact ALMAs are having through recognizing and celebrating diversity and inclusion in American entertainment and media.\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing Latinos today?\n\nCoincidentally, NCLR just released a poll today of Florida\u2019s Latino voters. Our top issues coincide with those of other Americans \u2014 improving the economy and education and expanding health care. But we would note that within those issues, there are specific policies Latino voters overwhelmingly support, including raising the minimum wage and expanding Medicaid and Affordable Care Act enrollment. Even on the issue of immigration \u2014 huge in our community \u2014 is a belief that comprehensive immigration reform will not only resolve a broken immigration system but be of benefit to all Americans.\n\nFriday\u2019s broadcast will not only celebrate Latino contributions to film, music and television, but also contributions to society. Will there be a call to action for Latinos and Latino youth, and how can they get involved to make their voices heard in their communities?\n\nThe focus we have for the show and our talent is the need for our community to have as strong a voice as possible in American society. The route is through our vote. We will be encouraging \u2014 in a nonpartisan, bipartisan way \u2014 everyone watching to vote in this upcoming election and to get everyone they know who is eligible to vote. As we noted above, the stakes are high in this election for the issues our community cares most about \u2014 the economy, health care, education, justice reform and immigration. If we want solutions and change on these issues, we need to vote in numbers as large as our population in this nation.\n\nDelia de la Vara is Vice President of the National Council de la Raza.
