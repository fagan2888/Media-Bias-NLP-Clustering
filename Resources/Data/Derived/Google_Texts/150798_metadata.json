(AP) - An energy cooperative\u2019s attempt to build a solar farm in a southern Indiana county is on hold while county officials try to solve a zoning issue.\n\nHoosier Energy is looking at putting a solar farm west of Ellettsville in Monroe County, about 55 miles southwest of Indianapolis. The Herald-Times reports (http://bit.ly/1hnvlcR) Hoosier Energy\u2019s plans are part of an effort to construct 10 one-megawatt solar arrays throughout southern Indiana and southeast Illinois before the end of 2016.\n\nThe Monroe County Plan Commission is looking at creating a new solar farm zoning definition because of a backlash from neighboring residents who oppose rezoning the farm land for commercial or light industrial uses.\n\nThe county is considering a new zoning classification for renewable energy sites. But not all renewable energy processes are as passive as solar panels - wind turbines, for instance, loom over the landscape, threaten birds and bats and create wind noise, so officials are worried that classification might not work.\n\nCommissioners are considering amending landscaping stipulations, setback distances and other issues that didn\u2019t apply to solar farms.\n\n\u201cOur urban definition of landscape may seem silly,\u201d Monroe County plan director Larry Wilson said. \u201cIf you have an isolated site in the middle of a field, you don\u2019t need the buffering you would in an urban setting.\u201d\n\nHoosier Energy spokeswoman Mary Lynn Beaver says to complete the 10-megawatt project before its 2016 deadline, zoning decisions and construction will have to move quickly.\n\nThe Monroe County Plan Commission meets again on Aug. 18.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An energy cooperative's attempt to build a solar farm in a southern Indiana county is on hold while county officials try to solve a zoning issue.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/proposed-hoosier-energy-solar-farm-facing-zoning-h/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "An energy cooperative\u2019s attempt to build a solar farm in a southern Indiana county is on hold while county officials try to solve a zoning issue.", "title": "Proposed Hoosier Energy solar farm facing zoning hurdles"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "An energy cooperative's attempt to build a solar farm in a southern Indiana county is on hold while county officials try to solve a zoning issue.", "card": "summary", "title": "Proposed Hoosier Energy solar farm facing zoning hurdles"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Hoosier Energy is looking at putting a solar farm west of Ellettsville in Monroe County, about 55 miles southwest of Indianapolis.\n(AP) - An energy cooperative\u2019s attempt to build a solar farm in a southern Indiana county is on hold while county officials try to solve a zoning issue.\nThe Monroe County Plan Commission is looking at creating a new solar farm zoning definition because of a backlash from neighboring residents who oppose rezoning the farm land for commercial or light industrial uses.\nThe Monroe County Plan Commission meets again on Aug. 18.\n\u201cOur urban definition of landscape may seem silly,\u201d Monroe County plan director Larry Wilson said."}
