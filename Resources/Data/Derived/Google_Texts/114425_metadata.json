Below is the transcript from our phone interview which has been edited for length and clarity. All links are ours.\n\nBe sure to check out our review and top quotes from Greg\u2019s book as well, and if you\u2019d like to keep up with similar content, give us a follow on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMake your pitch to Blaze readers for why they should pick up a book that\u2019s called \u201cNot Cool?\u201d\n\nGutfeld: Because I think it\u2019s about them. It\u2019s about me. It\u2019s about anyone who wonders why people do dumb things, because the one reigning principle in acting stupid is a desire to be liked, or a desire to be seen as cool. That\u2019s why people do things that aren\u2019t good. How do you convince somebody to do something that\u2019s bad for them? You tell them that it\u2019s cool. And it sounds like it\u2019s not a new idea, but actually I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really traced it through all different areas from academia to media to government to pop culture, politics, so I try to show how the cool mindset once it permeates society becomes kind of deadly and destructive.\n\nIf there were one or two key takeaways from the book, what would they be?\n\nGutfeld: To resist the idea of subversion, and instead subvert the subverter. The path to cool is always about undermining the normal, undoing tradition, because to the hip and cool whatever comes before is old and stupid. And so you have to resist that urge to be accepted, to be liked, you have to instead subvert the subverter. Be happy in embracing the common sense or the tradition. Be proud that you\u2019re in the military or that you got a good job and that you actually build things. Don\u2019t be embarrassed that you happen to be religious. These are things that are always undermined by the cool.\n\nResist the idea of subversion, and instead subvert the subverter Share:\n\nBy the way this isn\u2019t about fashion. I think a lot of people mistake \u2013 because when you use the word \u201chipster\u201d \u2013 they think of the goatees and the nose rings. But it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about a mindset. I\u2019d say the Brooklyn hipster is probably a sub-segment of this kind of destructive academia-media-government complex. But it\u2019s more about an idea than it is a person. And it\u2019s a destructive one. And it\u2019s always about undermining tradition in all parts of life.\n\nI mean you see it right now I think in foreign policy. You know what happens when a person, an educated person, has spent most of his life being educated that your country, the United States, is the villain. Their exceptionalism is what\u2019s wrong with the world, and if we only retreated and fixed what was inside of us, the world would appreciate it. The world would be a better place. And the world would be a better place primarily because we\u2019re not there.\n\nAnd so, what is the consequence of that? There\u2019s not much of a consequence if that person stays on campus. But when that person leaves campus and enters the White House, does that have an effect? The idea that somehow America is equally to blame, if not more to blame for the world\u2019s problems, that that somehow must infect the way you think about how to deal with things like Russia, or Venezuela, or Iran\u2026it makes you \u201clead from behind.\u201d Which in some ways means you don\u2019t lead at all.\n\nOne of the parts of your book that I thought was really compelling and interesting was your discussion of the virtues of religion in general and Mormonism specifically. Expand a little bit on that.\n\n\n\nGutfeld: Well you know the thing is I am non-religious. I wouldn\u2019t say that I am an atheist. I would say that I just don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t been to church in years. But there is one thing I know, and that is that the church is a positive influence in communities, in terms of encouraging charity, and neighborly concern. It\u2019s an important thing. I mean it\u2019s what I had when I was growing up \u2013 you saw your neighbors, it got you out of the house. If you worked at the Church as an altar boy like I did you got to know everybody. You knew who died and who was sick because you were always at funerals and\u2026it was a community thing.\n\nWe are moving away from that and there have been studies that are out now that are talking about how people are becoming as they get more involved with technology they are moving away from these community-based groups. And I think that this is dangerous and we have nothing to replace what worked before. And religion does work for a lot of people and has helped a lot of people in society, and when we subvert it, what kind of traditions are you going to replace it with?\n\nThat\u2019s why I really like Alain de Botton, a great philosopher-writer who\u2019s an atheist, and he talks about this a lot. He argues, \u201cReligion is a good thing even if you\u2019re an atheist, so what are you gonna do about it? How are you gonna replace it?\u201d You know, you can\u2019t just trash something and then think that life goes on because it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a valuable thing. You need religion for atheists I guess is what he\u2019s getting at.\n\nI talk about Mitt Romney in the book and this is a guy who gives a lot of money to charity (and I kind of wrote about how I knew almost nothing about Mormonism) and I talked to my friend Walter Kirn about it. He\u2019s a great writer, and we went back and forth on e-mail about when he became a Mormon. It\u2019s just stuff I didn\u2019t know. And you don\u2019t know about it because they don\u2019t brag about it. They don\u2019t talk about it. And I think that\u2019s you know \u2013 Mitt Romney never really came out and said yes I do this, I do this and I do this. He didn\u2019t and so maybe that harmed him, I don\u2019t know. But they\u2019re fairly humble about that sort of stuff.\n\nYou define cool in the book as \u201cpopularity without achievement,\u201d which seems like the perfect dig at the president. Juxtapose that sentiment with Barack Obama\u2019s appearances on Ellen DeGeneres, \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d and screening a film on Cesar Chavez in the middle of the day while Russia takes over territory.\n\nGutfeld: Well it has to do with, I suppose, a definition of what is achievement. People who are part of the academic-media complex would say that President Obama has a series of grand achievements before he became president, including being a community organizer would be one of them. However, from my perspective what is achievement is running something \u2013 running a business, starting a business.\n\nWhat we normally define as achievement, which is basically sometimes boring but actual hard work is seen as a waste of time by so many people. The actual stuff that goes on behind the scenes that people have to do to make things work is lame. But going out there and hobnobbing with celebrities and things like that \u2013 that\u2019s cool \u2013 because look at that, celebrities like him, that makes him cool, he must be cool. And that\u2019s kind of an achievement. There\u2019s nothing really happening though, it\u2019s all just a show. He\u2019s [President Obama's] basically showing up to win an award for an exercise that he didn\u2019t perform.\n\n[President Obama's] basically showing up to win an award for an exercise that he didn\u2019t perform. Share:\n\nThe Ellen DeGeneres thing is a good example \u2013 she actually is saying that Obamacare was a success, and we know that it isn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t matter because there he is on Ellen\u2019s show. And that\u2019s all that matters. So it\u2019s all kind of \u2013 it\u2019s an awards show without the movies. It is reward without achievement.\n\nAnd I mean, you go back to the first election: he won the presidency without the achievements that John McCain had, but it didn\u2019t matter because it was almost like winning the Nobel Prize, it was like \u201cWe feel good giving it to you.\u201d The Nobel judges felt good bequeathing that to Obama, the same way people felt who voted for him. It made them feel special.\n\nAnother thing you say about cool in the book is that \u201cCool is an evolutionary tool to unzip women\u2019s jeans and to further men\u2019s genes.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, why are so many things that are deemed \u201ccool\u201d today so counter to values we typically associated with men like chivalry and strength that we used to project?\n\n\n\nGutfeld: I think that it\u2019s part of a greater thing that anything that\u2019s old is bad. It goes back to the subversion of traditional things that work. So if you look I in the book I have a chapter about the military \u2013 I think it was Frank Gehry was making kind of a sculpture of Eisenhower and wanted to stress the feminine aspects \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t the feminine aspects that won wars. There\u2019s a fundamental distaste towards the male attributes that make things happen, and I think that is why you see kind of the rise of the \u201cbeta male,\u201d that these other guys are kind of unnecessary, brutish remnants of a past.\n\nThere\u2019s a fundamental distaste towards the male attributes that make things happen Share:\n\nBut, I\u2019m not so sure women feel that way.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why from an evolutionary perspective it\u2019s a failure because women still ultimately would like a guy who, you know, treats her right in a manly kind of way. I\u2019m sure there have been surveys on this, but there are women who might consider themselves feminists but don\u2019t really care for the guy who wants to split the tab on a date. They still want the traditional male, even though they\u2019re feminists because it just feels good\u2026maybe it\u2019s a cultural flaw that has to be changed. But I think you see that in the Obamacare ads and you look at it and you go, \u201cWow\u2026so that\u2019s why we won those wars.\u201d So you can sit around in your pajamas. As you close in on 30. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about.\n\nBut maybe that is a symbol of victory: That we\u2019ve gotten so\u2026we\u2019ve done so much that we don\u2019t have to do anything.\n\nTalk about the #BanBossy campaign in the context of your focus on leftist bullying and the cool/not cool duopoly on which the book is premised.\n\nGutfeld: How the #BanBossy campaign fits along with the book is that it\u2019s a crusade or a cause that is easy. You\u2019re not taking any risks going after a word that you can perceive as mean to little girls. I mean what kind of monster will come out against that? Well I do, because I think that you know it\u2019s an easy thing to do. That word is not causing problems in the world \u2013 there are a lot of other things in the world that are dangerous that are hurting young girls and families all around. There are far worse words, but it\u2019s just an easy cause that people can jump onto to make themselves feel cool. They don\u2019t lose anything doing it. There\u2019s no risk. The whole point of it is silly. That word is not a negative word.\n\nGirls like being bossy. I had three older sisters. I was bossed around for 15 years, and I enjoyed it.\n\nAnd the idea, I mention in the book, is one of those causes that everyone knows that bullying is bad, but the one thing they\u2019ll never admit is that they\u2019ll bully too. Everybody is on that chain. You bullied somebody, and you were bullied.\n\nGirls like being bossy. I had three older sisters. I was bossed around for 15 years\u2026I enjoyed it. Share:\n\nAnd I on \u201cThe Five\u201d when people get very righteous about the evils of bullying, I go \u201cYou know what, we have selective memory, because everybody\u2019s bullied.\u201d And you can argue that it helped form your character, your backbone. It teaches you to fight back, which I know is true for me because I had a bully, but then I wonder to myself, \u201cWhy did I bully?\u201d And I realize a lot of times people bully because they like that person. And they forget that some people are so shy or nervous to say that they like somebody that they actually bully them. And I firmly believe that\u2019s where a lot of the bullying happens when you\u2019re a kid. It\u2019s just an inability to express affection or something like that, but\u2026the cause itself is the new thing. It\u2019s the new climate change. And it\u2019s easy to do.\n\nThe hypocrisy as well is that a lot of the people that are involved in these bullying campaigns \u2013 these celebrities \u2014 are probably not very nice people. I mean I always envision them doing a bullying campaign and then yelling at their publicist afterwards because they\u2019re late for their mani pedi.\n\nAnd you also know that in order for a lot of these people to become celebrities they had to be jerks. They were probably very self-involved. So the idea that I\u2019m going to be a really mean person for like 10 years, and then when I become really famous I\u2019m going to give back by saying \u201cDon\u2019t be a mean person.\u201d That\u2019s essentially what bullying is. It\u2019s like \u201cOh now that I\u2019ve made it I\u2019m gonna say don\u2019t be like me.\u201d\n\nThe hypocrisy..is that a lot of the people..in these bullying campaigns..are probably not very nice Share:\n\nDo you think that there is a way to change the culture and flip the paradigm of \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cnot cool\u201d back to right side up?\n\nGutfeld: I think that\u2019s an ongoing battle, and as long as there are young people who are gullible enough to be told what is bad is actually cool, it will always be present. It will never change. But you can get a jump on it by buying this book.\n\nJumping away from the book slightly, was there one particular event or moment in your life that made you a libertarian?\n\n\n\nAll I know is that I don\u2019t like the boxes of any ideology. Share:\n\nGutfeld: I think that was gradual. I mean I hate reusing things that I\u2019ve said before, but it\u2019s the only real way I can explain it is that I became a conservative by being around liberals. I would say I was just your knee-jerk left-winger in high school. I worked for the nuclear freeze. I got signatures for that on the ballot when I was in high school and it was to get extra credit for my religion class. So that was an interesting thing that if you did something hardcore left-wing, extra credit at my school.\n\nAnd I think just as a young kid when you\u2019re 15, 16, you\u2019re just naturally liberal because it\u2019s romantic. You know Republicans are like your parents: they\u2019re cold and they ground you for doing bad things, and they control the money, but as a teenager it\u2019s the hit teacher, the guidance counselor who knows what\u2019s what. He\u2019s always liberal.\n\nWhen I went to Berkeley by being around liberals I became a conservative and I think by being around conservatives I became more of a libertarian. And I drift in and out. I resist all ideologies.\n\n[At 15 years old] Republicans are like your parents: they\u2019re cold and they ground you for doing bad things Share:\n\nMany libertarians do not consider me a libertarian specifically because of my stance on the NSA, which I\u2019m okay with. I\u2019m okay if I\u2019m not allowed in your club, and I\u2019ve always said that. My issue politically is always with the political bouncers. I don\u2019t go around calling people \u201cRINOs,\u201d and you can call me a \u201cRINO\u201d if you want, but I\u2019m not interested. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t think I can be in your club. I\u2019ve never wanted to be in anybody\u2019s club anyway. So I think the way I think, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ll get into tussles over the NSA. But part of it is because I believe the NSA should exist independent of political ideologies because you can\u2019t have anything without security and I know that means \u201cWell, how can you trust them to do that and aren\u2019t you sacrificing your freedom for security,\u201d and then people will e-mail me that Benjamin Franklin quote a thousand times. I\u2019ll get that like six hundred times, and it\u2019s like \u201cI get it, I understand, but I will debate you on it.\u201d\n\nI guess, I don\u2019t know what I am. All I know is that I don\u2019t like the boxes of any ideology.\n\nWho is the least cool person that purports to be cool in the country?\n\nGutfeld: Almost any left-wing musician falls into that category. Rage Against the Machine for example. Bruce Springsteen, who I used to enjoy, has become a complete crank.\n\n\n\nIs Glenn Beck cool?\n\n\n\nGutfeld: I think he is. But then\u2013no\u2013you know what, I have to say he isn\u2019t. Because I\u2019m resisting, I have to remind myself that the word should never be used. Instead of\u2026the reason why \u201ccool\u201d is destructive is because it\u2019s being used as a replacement for something that is neither good nor bad, because it\u2019s removing value from your decision making. So you should be asking, \u201cIs Glenn Beck \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d not \u201ccool\u201d or \u2018uncool.\u2019\u201d And I would say he\u2019s good.
