Kailyn Forsberg is back at school, rolling in and out of her house on a custom-made wheelchair ramp and getting back to her life as a teenager.

It’s been almost five months since a catastrophic crash during a national slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain left the 15-year-old athlete paralyzed. She spent three months in rehab at the renowned Craig Hospital.

Now, the Eagle Valley community is rallying behind her, helping her at school and in the neighborhood as she rolls through a new normal. Volunteers have spent hundreds of hours outfitting her home to accommodate a wheelchair. Teachers and classmates have helped her navigate Eagle Valley High School. (Just don’t ask her how it’s going, because, like most every 15-year-old would say, “school is gross.”)

The Forsberg family is hosting its first fundraiser on Friday, Aug. 28, hoping to offset their escalating medical and rehabilitation costs. The Caring for Kailyn event – at Eagle’s Brush Creek Pavilion (909 Capitol St.) – is scheduled from 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Tickets are available at the door or at the Vail Valley Charitable Fund website.

The $25 per-person fundraiser will include a silent auction with more than 70 items, live music and dinner with a cash bar.
