Whether shoveling the sidewalk or skiing in the backcountry, people should be mindful about hypothermia

Our recent encounter with too-early plummeting temperatures has shown how quickly changes in weather can affect us. They also remind us that planning for an outing, especially a winter outing in Colorado, requires some forethought to keep us safe.

Cold weather doesn't have to mean a cessation of activities. But we need to think about how the cold weather can affect our bodies, whether we're heading to the high country or just outside to clean off the sidewalk.

Rocky Mountain National Park is open during the winter and is a favorite spot for those who snowshoe and cross country ski. "It can be a wonderful time to visit and recreate in the park," said Kyle Patterson, public information officer for the park.

"We encourage people to plan and prepare ahead of their outing," said Patterson. "Sometimes people want to travel 'light' so they can move faster. However when and if something bad happens like an injury or getting lost, someone can get in trouble very quickly this time of year, if they haven't prepared."

Patterson recommends visitors to the high country bring along the following essentials to wear and carry.

• Lots of water — drink more than you think you need

• High-energy food — eat as you go

• Layers of warm, insulating, windproof clothing such as synthetic or wool; avoid wearing cotton

• Sturdy, waterproof, warm, insulated footwear with waterproof pants or gaiters; extra socks

• Storm gear

• Hat and gloves or mittens

• Sunglasses with UV protection

• Sunscreen

• First aid kit

• Topographic map & compass/GPS

• Headlamp or flashlight

• Waterproof matches and fire starting materials

• Multipurpose tool

• Whistle

• Emergency shelter — bivy sack and ensolite pad

• Common sense

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) note that, "When exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced. Prolonged exposure to cold will eventually use up your body's stored energy. The result is hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature."

Getting wet while out in the cold markedly increases a person's chance of having hypothermia. "The conductive heat loss that you experience is much faster and occurs at a higher degree, when you're wet," said Dr. Mike Huntington, an emergency room physician at McKee Medical Center.

While hypothermia usually occurs at very cold temperatures, the CDC notes that if a person becomes wet from rain or snow or is submersed in water, it can also occur at cool temperatures (above 40 degrees Fahrenheit).

Huntington mentioned he had treated more patients with hypothermia, when he was working in Florida than he has since he's been in Colorado.

"I think in general, the population along the Front Range is generally well educated," he said. But hypothermia is still a concern for those at high risk."

"Victims of hypothermia are often (1) elderly people with inadequate food, clothing, or heating; (2) babies sleeping in cold bedrooms; (3) people who remain outdoors for long periods — the homeless, hikers, hunters, etc.; and (4) people who drink alcohol or use illicit drugs," noted the CDC.

Some medicines and certain illnesses seem to impact an individual's ability to resist hypothermia, as well.

Low body temperature can affect an individual's brain, making a person less able to think clearly and remove themselves from a dangerous situation. This is one good reason to go with a group. If someone is acting unusually, observers can assist them in getting the care they need.

If you're going to be out in the cold, do not use alcohol before or during. Huntington noted that contrary to the old pictures of St. Bernard dogs rushing to the rescue of individuals in snowstorms, with a flask of alcohol tied to their neck, alcohol can actually lead to problems in cold weather.

"Alcohol gives an initial feeling of warmth, because blood vessels in the skin expand. Heat is then drawn away from the body's vital organs," warned the American Heart Association.

Know what to look for. Shivering is one of the first signs that a person may be getting hypothermia. "As the body becomes much cooler, a person may become confused, lose motor control, decision making ability begins to fall off subtly at first and fairly quickly after that," said Huntington. "Both the heart rate and blood pressure increase."

If a person's temperature is below 95 degrees, seek medical attention immediately. If not available, begin gradually warming the person. To learn more about caring for victims of hypothermia, visit bt.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/staysafe/hypothermia.asp.

By being prepared, individuals can avoid the dangers of hypothermia and enjoy the beauty of Colorado winters safely and confidently.
