At the forefront of these changes is community pharmacy, adapting to meet the complex needs of patients in an overburdened health care system.National pharmacy chains, such as Walgreens, Rite Aid, and CVS Health, are working to shift the focus of pharmacy, with the overall goal of improving the health and wellness of their patients.
