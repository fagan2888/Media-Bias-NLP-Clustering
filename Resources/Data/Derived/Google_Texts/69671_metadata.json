But jabs traded among top candidates this week on Medicare policy may force that issue onto the stage as well.\n\n\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has obtained the lead spot in several polls this week, recently said he no longer supports abolishing the government health programs, but he wants to provide an alternative that he believes people would \u201cflock to.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe plan as described in recent interviews is still sketchy, though. It would repeal the Affordable Care Act and focus on the use of health savings accounts that he says would return purchasing power to families.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump, the other frontrunner, said this week that Medicare was a program that has worked and which some people love. He also voiced support for health savings accounts, calling them a \u201cgood idea\u201d that's \u201cproven.\u201d He has not released a specific plan for changing Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has previously stated he would like to \u201cphase-out\u201d Medicare, instead this week outlined a plan he said would strengthen it.\n\n\n\nBush's plan calls for Medicare premium support, in which a beneficiary buys a private insurance plan and the government reimburses some of the cost. It would also allow individuals to keep health savings accounts after enrolling in Medicare and stabilize the program financially with unspecified \u201ccommon-sense reforms.\u201d\n\n\n\nA 2013 report from the Congressional Budget Office found that premium support methods could lower overall government costs but could also mean highly varied premiums and total payment for beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThe other candidates who will be on the main stage Wednesday have given mostly vague statements and generally favor repealing the ACA and converting Medicaid to block grants. They are Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio.\n\nRelated content", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The third Republican debate at the University of Colorado is set to focus on economic issues.That means the candidates are likely to address the plans they've outlined for revamping Medicare and Medicaid.", "title": "GOP candidates may talk Medicare during next debate", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The third Republican debate at the University of Colorado is set to focus on economic issues.That means the candidates are likely to address the plans they've outlined for revamping Medicare and Medicaid.", "title": "GOP candidates may talk Medicare during next debate", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151027/NEWS/151029897", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151027/NEWS/151029897/AR/0/Donald-Trump-Republican-primary.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The third Republican debate at the University of Colorado is set to focus on economic issues.That means the candidates are likely to address the plans they've outlined for revamping Medicare and Medicaid.", "title": "GOP candidates may talk Medicare during next debate", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151027/NEWS/151029897/AR/0/Donald-Trump-Republican-primary.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151027/NEWS/151029897", "published_at": "2015-10-27", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151027/NEWS/151029897/AR/0/Donald-Trump-Republican-primary.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It would repeal the Affordable Care Act and focus on the use of health savings accounts that he says would return purchasing power to families.\nBut jabs traded among top candidates this week on Medicare policy may force that issue onto the stage as well.\nHe also voiced support for health savings accounts, calling them a \u201cgood idea\u201d that's \u201cproven.\u201d He has not released a specific plan for changing Medicare or Medicaid.\nDonald Trump, the other frontrunner, said this week that Medicare was a program that has worked and which some people love.\nBush's plan calls for Medicare premium support, in which a beneficiary buys a private insurance plan and the government reimburses some of the cost."}
