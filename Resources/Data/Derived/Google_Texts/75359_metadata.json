Some key passages on the WSB Radio and Fox News figure:\n\nErickson dismisses criticism of his vulgar taunts as pearl-clutching by politically correct prigs with no sense of humor. (Offensive as some of his comments may be, he makes them in a tone of mockery, not spit-flying rage.) But he also has grown more reflective in the past year, at times even calling out his own readers and listeners for their excesses. In August, he wrote, \u201cI increasingly find conflict between my faith and some conservative discourse.\u201d He cited the right-wing furor over undocumented minors, Ebola, and the protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Shortly after I visited him in Georgia, he announced that he had been accepted to the Reformed Theological Seminary in Atlanta, to pursue\u2014part-time, between radio broadcasts\u2014a master\u2019s degree in biblical studies\u2026 Erickson\u2019s authority has always come from his status as an outsider to the Washington political class. But these days, he has better access to certain politicians than the K Street lobbyists do, and allies like Cruz often seem to wield more power than the GOP\u2019s nominal leaders. Erickson began charging for speaking gigs through an agency this year. He has been known to ride the Acela. Isn\u2019t he turning into one of them?, I asked.He worries about this\u2014he claims he has turned down \u201cbigger platforms and better jobs\u201d in New York and Washington because he wants to keep his family and his sensibility grounded in Georgia. He has also told the radio station that when Gunnar starts Little League next year, he will need a new time slot\u2026. \u201cA lot of conservatives are now where liberals were after 2004\u2014hysterically angry about things they have no business being angry about,\u201d Erickson told me. \u201cI think if you believe in a heaven, a hell, a savior who died and rose again, and a last day on which you\u2019ll win because he wins, you probably should spend a lot less time getting worked up over the temporary politics of the here and now.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAside from a debate over the state gas tax, if you want to know what\u2019s likely to bedevil the Georgia Legislature come next month, here\u2019s your answer: Medicaid reimbursement cuts. From the New York Times:\n\nJust as millions of people are gaining insurance through Medicaid, the program is poised to make deep cuts in payments to many doctors, prompting some physicians and consumer advocates to warn that the reductions could make it more difficult for Medicaid patients to obtain care. The Affordable Care Act provided a big increase in Medicaid payments for primary care in 2013 and 2014. But the increase expires on Thursday \u2014 just weeks after the Obama administration told the Supreme Court that doctors and other providers had no legal right to challenge the adequacy of payments they received from Medicaid. The impact will vary by state, but a study by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization, estimates that doctors who have been receiving the enhanced payments will see their fees for primary care cut by 43 percent, on average.\n\nThe Urban Institute study estimates that cuts in Georgia will be 34.8 percent. Some states are chipping in their own money to maintain reimbursement rates, but Georgia has not said whether or not it will do so, according to the study.\n\n***\n\nYou know that Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran is catching a lot of heat for authoring a book in which he describes homosexuality as a \u201csexual perversion.\u201d But leaf through the rest of the tome \u2013 called \u201cWho Told You That You Are Naked?\u201d \u2013 and you\u2019ll find a few other head-turning comments.\n\nHere\u2019s what he had to say about Judaism:\n\nJewish leaders had made up their mind that the message of righteousness by faith through grace was a message of heresy. They believed in God but they rejected His Salvation, His Son and His message\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nIn another passage, he makes clear that he views his job as a public servant through a religious prism:\n\n\u201cPersonal Life Application: God gave me my fire service land, field, career. He gave me the job of being a fire service leader, Fire Chief of Atlanta Fire Rescue. He also made me the head- United States Fire Administrator. My job description as a fire chief of Atlanta Fire Rescue Department is: \u2013To cultivate its culture for the glory of God; \u2014 To keep it focused on its mission of saving lives and property; \u2013To sustain its culture, its members and its capabilities both now and for future generations.\u201d\n\nAnd in another section, Cochran muses about how the world would have been better off if Eve had insisted that the serpent bearing forbidden fruit talk to her husband first.\n\n\u2018Adam! Adam! Come over here right now. This snake can talk! He just called God a liar! He\u2019s trying to convince us to eat from the one tree the God told us not to eat from lest we die. He told me \u201cWe shall surely not die!\u201d I believe these words coming from Eve would have empowered and emboldened Adam as the protector of Eve and the Garden. He would have responded with righteous indignation and killed the serpent on the spot \u2014 even cut off his head. The scriptural account could have possibly been \u2018And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Adam and he cut off the serpent\u2019s head and they lived happily ever after.\u2019\n\nCochran has become something of a cause celebre for conservative groups urging members to bombard Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed with messages of support for the chief. Reed suspended Cochran on grounds that he didn\u2019t clear the book with his administration before publishing it.\n\nCochran has also attracted the attention from folks on both sides of the debate over the so-called \u201creligious liberty\u201d proposals, which supporters say is designed to prevent government interference on faith-based activities but critics fear could give businesses a license to discriminate.\n\nBetter Georgia, the left-leaning guerilla group which has scoured his book for incendiary comments, waded into the battle this morning. Says Better Georgia director Bryan Long:\n\n\u201cChief Cochran\u2019s discriminatory beliefs and his clear intent to impose them in the workplace belittle women and illustrate exactly why [the] bill is so dangerous.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAva Duvernay\u2019s history pic \u201cSelma\u201d isn\u2019t slated for general release until late next week, but already the movie is stirring up talk for its story-telling liberties.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s Washington Post, Joseph Califano, who was President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s top assistant for domestic affairs during the period, takes issue with the portrayal of his old boss as an opponent of the 1965 Alabama march, rather than as a co-conspirator. You can catch a glimpse of the movie\u2019s take on LBJ in this trailer:\n\nWrites Califano:\n\n[T]he film falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as being at odds with Martin Luther King Jr. and even using the FBI to discredit him, as only reluctantly behind the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and as opposed to the Selma march itself. In fact, Selma was LBJ\u2019s idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted \u2014 and he didn\u2019t use the FBI to disparage him.\n\nThen there\u2019s the case of Ralph David Abernathy Jr., who has been sidelined as a minor figure in the re-telling.
