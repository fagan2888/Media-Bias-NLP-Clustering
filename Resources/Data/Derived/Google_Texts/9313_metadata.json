Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne says\n\nDiverting dedicated tourism funds hurts budget more than it helps. Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne says\n\nLt. Gov. Jay Dardenne asked Thursday for restoration of $2.1 million in dedicated tourism dollars that the Jindal administration says can be used to fill other budget holes.\n\nState law does not allow the dollars to be spent on anything but tourism-related activities, Dardenne said. And he said stripping the dollars would hurt the overall budget because tourism is a big revenue generator for the state \u2014 bringing in $17 for every $1 spent.\n\nDardenne made his pitch to the House Appropriations Committee, which is going department by department over Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s proposed nearly $25 billion state spending plan for fiscal year starting July 1.\n\n\u201cThe $2 million makes a huge difference to us, getting it in the Office of Tourism budget,\u201d Dardenne said.\n\nThe Jindal administration listed $2.1 million from the Tourism Promotion District Sales Tax proceeds as a revenue-raising option for legislators to consider, Dardenne said. \u201cThat money is statutorily dedicated to tourism. ... If they don\u2019t give it back to tourism, it will be sitting in the treasury,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to give that money back to tourism.\u201d\n\nDivision of Administration communications director Meghan Parrish said the administration has no problem with the money going to tourism as long as the Legislature approves where the reductions are coming from to free up the $2.1 million.\n\nEarlier, Commissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols told the same committee that she did not \u201credirect the revenue to tourism but do support doing that. ... I didn\u2019t redirect it because I thought that it was important that the Legislature review the pass-through reductions and make decisions about those programs.\u201d\n\nTourism gets .003 of every penny in state sales tax collections. The governor\u2019s budget projects $23.1 million for tourism in the coming budget year.\n\nBut Dardenne said the latest Revenue Estimating Conference estimates on which the budget is supposed to be based put the tourism fund at $23.8 million.\n\nHe suggested that the Appropriations Committee may want to find out why $683,000 is not accounted for.\n\nIn past years, the Jindal administration has tapped the tourism funds to help defray costs of putting on national sporting and entertainment events as well as such activities as the Louisiana Special Olympics and Senior Olympics and the Louisiana Book Festival. Dardenne has complained about specific dollar appropriations to the groups \u2014 tourism money his department never sees. He and others have suggested creation of a separate fund from an as-yet-unidentified revenue stream to go toward special events that draw national attention.\n\nThis time around, the Jindal administration\u2019s budget eliminates most of the so-called \u201cpass-throughs\u201d getting tourism dollars, including the Louisiana Book Festival.\n\nThose left, such as the Essence Festival, receive cuts from the prior year\u2019s allocation \u2014 which Dardenne said he supports.\n\n\u201cThey have never taken a cut in any of the years you have struggled with the budget,\u201d Dardenne said.\n\nDardenne advocated that legislators identify other dollars to help put on events they deem worthy.\n\n\u201cState tourism dollars should not be spent on Special Olympics, Senior Olympics, Bayou des Familles Park. We should find a way to help them in the state general fund,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Pro-tem Walt Leger III asked whether an alternative funding source has been identified, especially for major events such as the Super Bowl.\n\nDardenne said one idea that\u2019s being fleshed out is tapping into some of the new revenues generated from hosting the big events.\n\nUnder questioning by state Rep. Bubba Chaney, R-Rayville, Dardenne said he will make sure that the state historic site at Poverty Point \u2014 which recently became a World Heritage Site \u2014 will be protected.\n\n\u201cToo much work has gone into getting that designation. What an embarrassment a year after getting that designation to close it,\u201d said Dardenne, of the West Carroll Parish site.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/: Lt. Gov.
