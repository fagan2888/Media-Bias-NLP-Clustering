That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to Rod Coons and Florence Peace, a married couple in Indianapolis. Rod and Florence like their current plan.\n\n[pullquote]\n\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer to stay with our current plan because it meets our needs,\u201d Rod says.\n\nUnfortunately, their current coverage fails to meet new requirements imposed under ObamaCare by federal bureaucrats. At the end of this year, that plan will no longer be available to Rod and Florence. They\u2019ll have to find another, ObamaCare-sanctioned plan that may restrict their access to certain treatments or force them to buy coverages they neither want nor need.\n\nSecond, many Americans will lose access to physicians they trust. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted the case of John Nowak, who faces a dilemma when he chooses an insurance plan on ObamaCare\u2019s Exchanges this fall. He \u201cwill be able to pick a [revised, ObamaCare-compliant] plan from his current insurer\u2014or go for one that includes his primary-care doctor.\u201d\n\nTo save costs, many plans on ObamaCare\u2019s Exchanges are limiting physician networks. So if John chooses to keep his current insurance carrier, he may not be able to keep his current doctor. At minimum, he will pay a lot more to see that physician out-of-network.\n\nThird, ObamaCare places bureaucrats between doctors and patients. The law imposes new penalties on doctors who do \u201cnot satisfactorily submit data\u201d that meet Washington bureaucrats\u2019 standards.\n\nIt also creates a panel of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats empowered to make rulings that reduce Medicare spending.\n\nLittle wonder that nearly three in five physicians responding to a recent Deloitte survey think the practice of medicine is in jeopardy.\n\nFourth, ObamaCare dumps millions of patients onto Medicaid\u2014a health program so bad that not even Medicaid patients call it \u201creal insurance.\u201d An analyst for the liberal Consumers Union once admitted that a Medicaid card is but a \u201chunting license\u201d\u2014\u201ca chance to go try and find a doctor\u201d that actually accepts Medicaid patients.\n\nMoreover, several studies have shown that people enrolled in Medicaid often have worse medical outcomes than those with no health insurance at all.\n\nExpanding a broken Medicaid program is just giving millions of Americans a cruel and empty promise\u2014an insurance card with limited access to real health care.\n\nFifth, ObamaCare\u2019s reductions in Medicare spending could undermine the health system for millions of seniors.\n\nAccording to the non-partisan Medicare actuary, the law\u2019s arbitrary spending reductions could cause 15% of hospitals to become unprofitable by 2019, and as many as 40% of hospitals to become unprofitable in the long term. These hospitals could face the choice between shutting out seniors or shutting their doors for good.\n\nEither outcome is unacceptable.\n\nObamaCare is not just bad for Americans\u2019 physical health\u2014it\u2019s bad for America\u2019s fiscal health as well. If Congress does not act, on January 1, 2014, Washington will tap a gusher of new federal spending on ObamaCare.\n\nOver the next decade, the cost of the law\u2019s new entitlements will soar more than fivefold, from $48 billion in 2014 to $250 billion in 2023.\n\nThat will create a lot of pain in taxpayers\u2019 wallets.\n\nFor all these reasons and more, Congress must act, and act now, to stop ObamaCare before it takes root.\n\nThis fall, Congress will have an opportunity to use its \u201cpower of the purse\u201d to block ObamaCare from going forward.\n\nI recently traveled across the country on a town hall tour sponsored by our sister organization, Heritage Action for America.\n\nI met many Americans concerned about the impact of ObamaCare on their health care, who want the law stopped immediately.\n\nThere are things we can and should do to improve America\u2019s health care system and reduce costs, but first we must stop ObamaCare before it starts.\n\nThe law is a dangerous prescription for America, and its side effects will damage our collective health.\n\nFormer South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint is president of the Heritage Foundation.", "article_metadata":
