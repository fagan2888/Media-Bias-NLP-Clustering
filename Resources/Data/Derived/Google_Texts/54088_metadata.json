John \u201cThe Tenderheart\u201d Kasich extend it to them, concerned as he is about his postmortem meet-and-greet with St. Peter?\n\nIn the words of Bishop Bullwinkle, Hell No, to the no, no no. Aw, Hell No, to the no, no, no.\n\nFrom a new report by Policy Matters Ohio:\n\n\u201cFederal rules allow states to waive time limits in areas where working-poor adults cannot find enough work hours (without a waiver, recipients are restricted to food aid for three out of 36 months unless they work at least 20 hours per week). A statewide waiver isn\u2019t allowed in 2016, but many cities and counties remain eligible. Ohio has requested a waiver of time limits for 18 rural counties in 2016. Three counties that qualify for a waiver under the federal eligibility standards used by the state to determine this year\u2019s request \u2013 Trumbull, Muskingum and Vinton Counties \u2013 are not part of the request. Although 10 cities qualify, no request is made for any cities. Moreover, the state has the ability under federal rules to broaden the waiver to even more counties \u2013 up to 34 \u2013 in addition to the 10 cities.\u201d\n\nThe report explains further that Ohio has a high rate of food insecurity, meaning that a high number of citizens often deal with uncertain access to meals. The state has qualified for this federal waiver of time limits since the recession of 2008, but The Tenderheart Administration has rejected it for most of the state the past two years, accepting it in 2015 for only 17 rural counties, and in 2014 for 16 rural counties.\n\nAs for urban areas? Long walks off short piers, decrees Tenderheart.\n\nFrom the report:\n\n\u201cThe exclusion of urban counties and cities from the state waiver disproportionally hurts minority populations. In Ohio, 70 percent of those participating in the food-stamp program live in metropolitan areas, where Hispanic, Asian, African-American and other minority groups tend to live. Nationally, about half of food stamp recipients are white and half are minority, but about 80 percent live in urban areas and suburban areas.The exclusions in recent years prompted Columbus Legal Aid to file a civil rights complaint against the state, arguing the state\u2019s rejection of the waiver in cities is unfair to minorities. \u2018The state could have addressed the racial inequity in 2016,\u2019 said Wendy Patton, Policy Matters Ohio senior project director, who authored the report. \u2018The Kasich administration chose not to. The state should broaden its request to encompass all places and regions where jobs are scarce and people are hungry.'\u201d\n\nPolicy Matters seems to have noticed Gov. Tenderheart\u2019s trips to New Hampshire, where he slaps himself good and hearty on the back for not rejecting Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and extols his record of tenderheartedly helping \u201cthe people in the shadows.\u201d\n\nFrom the conclusion of the report:\n\n\u201cThe same logic (for Medicaid expansion) could be applied to federal food aid. Foregoing the waiver for eligible counties and cities leaves people and households exposed to hunger. The policy also means that millions of federal dollars are not being spent in Ohio supermarkets, farmer\u2019s markets and corner stores, dollars that could boost local economies. Too many Ohioans experience hunger. Ohio has one of the highest rates of severe food insecurity in the nation, and it has increased in the past decade. The compassionate response to meeting basic needs of all Ohioans\u2014particularly the most vulnerable\u2014is to maximize federal dollars to help people and boost the Ohio economy.\u201d\n\nI know that we\u2019re all shocked SHOCKED that perhaps John Kasich is playing a bit of the hypocrite as he goes around playing the \u201ccompassionate conservative.\u201d You know what it takes to sell Kasich\u2019s efforts to help the people in the shadows? It takes brass balls to sell Kasich\u2019s efforts to help the people in the shadows.\n\nThe truth is, as much as Tenderheart has jawed about his desire to help the poor, John Kasich has overseen massive regressive tax shifts onto the backs of Ohio\u2019s lowest income families. He\u2019s refused millions of dollars in unemployment funds because expanding benefits \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d\n\nHis \u201cpoverty plan\u201d did nothing to put resources into the hands of poor people, and his budgets have seen funding for county job and family services operations slashed, employees lost, and benefits reduced. With regard to the role transportation plays in exacerbating poverty, Kasich has done nothing. His privatized department of development, JobsOhio, has delivered 34 months of below average job creation.\n\nHis cuts to local government and public schools have led to billions in local tax levies being passed out of necessity, the layoffs of hundreds of teachers, police officers and firefighters, and the undermining of public schools in favor of corrupt, crony-driven charters known as the \u201cjoke\u201d of the nation.\n\nHe\u2019s also openly supported and otherwise winked-at union-busting efforts that would lower the standard of living of all Ohio workers.
