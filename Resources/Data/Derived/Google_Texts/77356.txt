Members of the Christian Church at Panama City spent their Saturday giving back to the community.

They held their second annual Free Backpack Giveaway for the public Saturday morning.

Church organizers purchased 500 back packs, with money from their thrift store, and church members filled each back pack with paper, folders, pencils and other school supplies for kids in Bay County.

Event organizers said they had 350 backpacks already preregistered for families, the other 150 were given out on a first-come, first-serve basis.

"Times are tough economically. I have kids, it is expensive to get school supplies," Christina Church Minister Billy Babbino said. "So we wanted to do something to help out the community, help out these people and say here is one less thing you have to worry about."

Next year, church members say they hope to put together some supply kits to give to teachers in Bay County.
