Veronica Miranda was one of four people, called navigators, filling this role in the Wichita area.\n\nMiranda is also a member of Sunflower Community Action, which organized the invasion of Kobach\u2019s property back in June.\n\nMiranda is shown on the organization\u2019s social media sites taking part in rallies and various other campaigns, mostly in support of immigrant rights. (RELATED: Report: Illegal immigrant hired as Obamacare \u2018navigator\u2019)\n\nIn 2012, Kobach said that Sunflower Community Action had \u201ctaken up ACORN\u2019s mantle here in Kansas.\u201d\n\nLike the now-defunct ACORN, Sunflower Community Action is a non-profit grassroots community organizer. Sunflower Community Action is affiliated with the Chicago-based National People\u2019s Action.\n\nOn June 15, around 200 protesters organized by the Wichita-based group occupied Kobach\u2019s property, which is located near Kansas City.\n\nThe protesters left shoes on Kobach\u2019s doorstep as a symbol of the fathers that, according to the group, his policies were responsible for deporting. Kobach has been a strong opponent of illegal immigration.\n\nA photograph showing Miranda surrounded by fellow Kobach protesters in front of the buses that transported the protesters to the Republican\u2019s home was posted to the navigator\u2019s Instagram account. Another photo shows Miranda among a larger group of protesters lined up in front of four buses.\n\nMiranda was hired as an Obamacare navigator through Hunter Health Clinic, which is located in Wichita.\n\nHunter Health Clinic received a grant to provide the navigator services. Overall three larger organizations won federal grant money totaling nearly $900,000 for those services.\n\nSunflower Community Action helped advertise the navigator services by directing visitors towards Miranda.\n\n\u201cQuestions about your health coverage opportunities under the new Affordable Care Act?\u201d read a post on the organization\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cLike the Hunter Health Clinic page to ask questions and keep up to date about upcoming informative presentations around the city led by health care navigator and SCA member Veronica Miranda.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Kobach called the siege of his property threatening, though he and his family were not home during the protest. Kobach also called for an investigation into the event saying that, at the very least, criminal trespassing had occurred.\n\nKobach said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that navigator funds are being dispersed to \u201cany community organizer with his or her hand out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling, the low level of scrutiny that\u2019s apparently is being given to this navigator program,\u201d Kobach told TheDCNF.\n\nSecurity and privacy have been a major concern of those critical of Obamacare and the navigator program.\n\nMiranda isn\u2019t the first Kansas-based Obamacare navigator with a checkered past.\n\nRosilyn Wells, who is the lone Obamacare guide for Lawrence, Kansas, has a criminal warrant out for her arrest. In 2007 she was charged with passing fraudulent checks. She also filed for bankruptcy in 2003.

Our navigators do not collect or store personal health or financial information,\u201d said Katrina McGivern.\n\nMcGivern said navigators are given extensive training in which it is stressed that they are not allowed to store or transmit private information. Navigators reportedly receive between 20 and 30 hours of training.\n\nFoxNews.com reported that the United Labor Unions Council Local 100 in New Orleans \u2014 whose founder was an ACORN organizer \u2014 was attempting to participate in navigator drives.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, who is head of a committee investigating the navigator program, told FoxNews.com that he was worried about the potential for misused funds.\n\n\u201cWith the administration rushing to hand out billions of dollars for the health law to countless groups, the potential for fraud and abuse is exceptionally high,\u201d said Murphy.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
