As Rick Moran reports this morning, PP\u2019s president absurdly is blaming \u201cmilitants\u201d for the videos.\n\n\"Well gee, I thought ObamaCare was supposed to take care of all that! I am so tired of the canard about women's health. There are plenty of places where women can achieve and have these services. If Planned Parenthood is so concerned about women's health, why don't they accept, for example, federal funding of pregnancy centers, one next door to every single Planned Parenthood clinic, so that women can actually look at an ultrasound before they choose to have an abortion, or so that they can have options presented to them if they choose to bring the life into the world. But no, Planned Parenthood doesn't want that. Look, this isn't about women's health. This is about Planned Parenthood wanting to preserve their political power so they can lobby consistently on behalf of pro-abortion Democrats. Why should they be given federal funding? Why should they get federal funding so they can continue to lobby for certain candidates as Emily's List does every single day?\"\n\nAlong with a clip showing Hillary Clinton talking about the importance of the range of services Planned Parenthood provides for women's health, host Chris Wallace presented statistics on its service volumes beyond abortions. He then queried Fiorina about the importance of maintaining the half billion dollars in federal funding for Planned Parenthood to maintain the substantial women's health services it provides including breast exams, PAP smears and HIV tests. Fiorina replied:\n\nFiorina continued, \u201cOnce again, I\u2019m pro-life as you know but there are plenty of pro-choice women who are horrified by this as they should be. And by the way, after hours honestly. The fact that these officials can sit here swilling their wine, eating their salad, laughing over getting a Lamborghini and talk about specimens of fetal tissue, I find horrifying and the majority of Americans do as well.\u201d\n\nWhen McIntosh brought up the videos were edited Fiorina said, \u201cI find it fascinating that Planned Parenthood, EMILY\u2019s List and the rest of the pro-abortion lobby are now suddenly so concerned about a heavily edited video. I don\u2019t recall them ever being concerned about a heavily edited video of Mitt Romney at a fund-raiser. I don\u2019t remember them being concerned about Edward Snowden. We\u2019ve had a lot of things where information has come out that we needed to see. So instead of going after the people who have put out this video information we clearly need to see, let\u2019s talk about the issue here. Of course they\u2019re trying to change the subject. Of course they\u2019re trying to say this is life saving research. I find it amazing that this group of pro-abortion lobbyists continue to say that they are protecting women\u2019s health. Really? late-term abortion is bad for women\u2019s health. They continue to lobby against parental notification. Really? It\u2019s protecting a teenager\u2019s health that she can go to a tanning salon or a tattoo with her mother\u2019s permission but get an abortion without her mother\u2019s permission? This is not about someone else\u2019s health. This is about a woman\u2019s health. A woman\u2019s opportunity to have all of the choices in front of her and it\u2019s about a life that she is bearing.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood and the abortion-supporting Democrats are taking on water over the stunning videos of PP reps haggling over the price of fetal body parts and discussing how to conduct abortions to preserve the most valuable organs for handing over to third parties in return for money (they refuse to call it \u201cselling\u201d).

Pam Key of Breitbart reports:\n\nWhen McIntosh brought up the videos were edited Fiorina said, \u201cI find it fascinating that Planned Parenthood, EMILY\u2019s List and the rest of the pro-abortion lobby are now suddenly so concerned about a heavily edited video.
