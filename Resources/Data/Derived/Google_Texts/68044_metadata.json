Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is planning to deliver what is being called an \u201cimportant speech\u201d Monday at Liberty University in Virginia, fueling speculation that he may use the address to announce a presidential run. Cruz\u2019s staff has been encouraging media to cover the event, telling the Daily Beast, \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to be there.\u201d\n\nCruz has been mum on exactly what he\u2019ll talk about at Liberty in Lynchburg, Virginia, but Roll Call noted that the timing of the speech \u201cwould be right for getting somewhat ahead of the curve on announcing a White House run, at least among senators.\u201d The Daily Beast also pointed out that Cruz previously indicated he would announce a run for president around this time.\n\nCruz\u2019s Republican colleague Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky reportedly is planning to announce his own presidential campaign on April 7. And U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also is weighing a possible run in 2016.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nCruz won his Senate race in 2012 and has strong support from the tea party element of the Republican Party. He is one of the most ardent critics of the Affordable Care Act, which he called a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d during his speech last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. But his views may be too extreme for a general election audience, political observers previously told International Business Times.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazingly talented fellow. Tons of energy, but he\u2019s at this moment almost more of a message politician in that he has a point of view but not an extraordinary base of support outside the state of Texas, where he is quite popular,\u201d said Bruce Buchanan, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t displayed the ability yet nor had the opportunity to display the willingness to build coalitions toward the center right now, and that\u2019s what he\u2019ll have to do to move to a position of greater credibility. The establishment wants to win in 2016, and now he looks like a fringe candidate that sets up for defeat.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, ted cruz 2016, ted cruz announcement, ted cruz presidential announcement, ted cruz important speech, ted cruz speech, ted cruz president, ted cruz president 2016, ted cruz announcement date, ted cruz 2016 announcement", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "\"You're going to want to be there,\" a Cruz staffer told the Daily Beast about the speech.", "title": "Ted Cruz 2016 Announcement?
