CMS\u2019s new proposal launch, authorized through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), advocates for a revision of various payment policies and amendments to a stream of previously implemented requirements for those home health agencies falling under the Medicare umbrella.\n\nHome health services, which include skilled nursing, home health aide, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medical social services, etc. involve payment via Medicare. A prospective payment system, says CMS, pays more for services administered to those beneficiaries with additional medical needs.\n\nAccording to Andy Slavitt, Acting CMS Administrator, people desire the option to receive care from the comfort of their own homes and also from within their own communities. Says Slavitt, \u201cCMS aims to make sure that care in the home is supported by a value-based care delivery model that is consistent with the rest of the system. The goal is that no matter where the care is delivered, it is supported by a payment system that rewards providers who deliver the highest quality outcomes.\u201d\n\nSays CMS, this proposed model, CMS-1625-P, included in the 2016 Home Health Prospective Payment System proposed rule, considers strengths of formerly implemented value-based purchasing programs. Such programs include the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, the Home Health Pay-for-Performance and Nursing Home Value-Based Purchasing Demonstrations, CMS says.\n\n\u201cThese changes reflect a broader strategy to create a health care system that supports better care, smarter spending, and healthier people,\u201d says a press release from CMS. \u201cProvisions in this and other proposed rules will help move the nation\u2019s [health care] system to one that values quality over quantity and focuses on reforms such as measuring for better health outcomes, attention to disease prevention, helping patients return home, managing and improving chronic diseases, and fostering a [more efficient] and coordinated health care system.\u201d\n\nThe proposed model promotes an annual payment reduction or increase adjustment to current Medicare-certified home health agency payments according to measured levels of quality performance. Payment adjustments, says CMS, start at 5 percent and may eventually reach 8 percent.\n\nFurther summary, implications of the proposed rule\n\nCMS says the proposed rule updates national, standardized 60-day episode payment rates, national per-visit rates, and the non-routine medical supply conversion factor. The propsed rule additionally provides information about CMS\u2019s monitoring efforts about alleged impacts related to the rebasing adjustments. Aside from the aforementioned payment reductions, the proposed rule also updates case-mix weights via up-to-date data and an update on the Report to Congress, confirms CMS.\n\nIndeed, such news from CMS comes in the wake of similar value-based payment initiatives where quality is directly linked to outcomes. The far-reaching effects of tangible financial revisions to home health agencies are tangible. CMS estimates 3.5 million beneficiaries receive home health services among 11,850 home health agencies. This costs Medicare almost $18 billion, CMS confirms.\n\nAs EHRIntelligence.com reported, 3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries accounted for a staggering $18 billion in services provided by 12,000 home health agencies within 2013.\n\nOnce again echoing Slavitt's words, it is hopeful those beneficiaries yearning for high quality, cost-effective, close-to-home care can openly receive this tri-fold advantage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CMS\u2019s new proposal launch, authorized through the Affordable Care Act, advocates for a revision of various payment policies, amendments to value-based models.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/value-based-purchasing-model-revises-home-health-payments", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_10_7425744187.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Value-Based Purchasing Model Revises Home Health Payments"}, "twitter": {"description": "CMS\u2019s new proposal launch, authorized through the Affordable Care Act, advocates for a revision of various payment policies, amendments to value-based models.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_10_7425744187.jpg"}, "title": "Value-Based Purchasing Model Revises Home Health Payments", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe291b\"", "article_summary": "Home health services, which include skilled nursing, home health aide, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, medical social services, etc.\nSuch programs include the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, the Home Health Pay-for-Performance and Nursing Home Value-Based Purchasing Demonstrations, CMS says.\nCMS estimates 3.5 million beneficiaries receive home health services among 11,850 home health agencies.\n\u201cThese changes reflect a broader strategy to create a health care system that supports better care, smarter spending, and healthier people,\u201d says a press release from CMS.\nIndeed, such news from CMS comes in the wake of similar value-based payment initiatives where quality is directly linked to outcomes."}
