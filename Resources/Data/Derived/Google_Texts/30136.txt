Glenn Beck is certainly in the throes of a living nightmare, finding his impassioned speech to Republican Nevada caucus goers Tuesday night suddenly interrupted by the rolling thunderstorm that is Donald Trump.

Trump crashed the Nevada caucus location at which the conservative talk show host was speaking Tuesday night on behalf of his preferred candidate, Texas Tea Party Senator Ted Cruz.

Trump had earlier tweeted that he would be “at various caucus sites” throughout Nevada on Tuesday, but didn’t specify where. It was not clear if Trump knew beforehand that Beck was speaking at the location when he made his entrance.

At the time, MSNBC was broadcasting a live look at the caucus site, Palo Verde High School in Summerlin.

“Donald Trump has just walked into this location,” an MSNBC reporter said on-air, noting Beck was still “speaking on behalf of Ted Cruz.”

How laughably fitting, as Trump overshadows Glenn Beck to show in a nut shell how he has hijacked the nutty party. pic.twitter.com/4f64Twa1Xh — Andrew Jerell Jones (@sluggahjells) February 24, 2016

MSNBC carried Trump’s brief apperance live while Beck was ignored.

“This is an honor,” Trump said as he addressed the raucous crowd that rushed to him. “Thank you for being with me tonight. We are going to have hopefully a historic night. In New Hampshire it was an amazing win. As you know, South Carolina. Unbelievable. Hopefully this will be the same. I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself.”
