(The Washington Post)\n\nWith federal agencies set to close their doors in five days, House Republicans began exploring a potential detour on the path to a shutdown: shifting the fight over President Obama\u2019s health-care law to a separate bill that would raise the nation's debt limit.\n\nIf it works, the strategy could clear the way for the House to approve a simple measure to keep the government open into the new fiscal year, which will begin Tuesday, without hotly contested provisions to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut it would set the stage for an even more nerve-racking deadline on Oct. 17, with conservatives using the threat of the nation\u2019s first default on its debt to force the president to accept a one-year delay of the health-care law\u2019s mandates, taxes and benefits.\n\nPresident Obama warned Thursday that he will not accept delays to the program\u2019s taxes, mandates and benefits. He said Republicans \u201chave just spun themselves up over this issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe closer we\u2019ve gotten to this date, the more irresponsible people opposed to this law have become,\u201d Obama said at Prince George\u2019s Community College in Largo, Md., referring to the Oct. 1 start of enrollment in the program\u2019s new health-insurance plans.\n\nView Graphic Countdown to the (possible) shutdown\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is here to stay,\u201d Obama said, stressing that he would not negotiate delays or other changes to the law as part of budget talks or the debt-ceiling process.\n\nThursday morning, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) refused to outline what Republicans would attach to the spending bill, formally known as a continuing resolution, when it arrives from the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a discussion about the CR \u2014 speculate about the CR \u2014 until the Senate sends us their bill,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nTwo hours after Boehner\u2019s announcement, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said the Senate would not accept another House-passed funding resolution with different legislative strings attached to it.\n\n\u201cThey keep digging, deeper and deeper,\u201d Reid told reporters as a countdown clock ticked away the days, hours, minutes and seconds to Monday night\u2019s shutdown deadline.\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, rejected any proposal to rein in Obamacare in either the government funding bill or the debt ceiling. \u201cYou can huff, you can puff for 21 hours, but you cannot blow the Affordable Care Act away,\u201d she said, referring to a filibuster-like anti-Obamacare speech by conservative Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) that began Tuesday afternoon and ended Wednesday.\n\nAt their weekly closed-door meeting with rank-and-file Republicans, Boehner and his lieutenants outlined the plan to raise the debt limit. If it wins approval, the leaders hope to introduce the debt-limit bill later Thursday and hold a vote as soon as Saturday \u2014 letting GOP lawmakers mount a fresh assault on the health-care law before deciding whether to shut down the government.\n\nThe debt-limit bill will be loaded with dozens of other conservative priorities, including the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\n\nRep. Steve Southerland (Fla.), who attended a Wednesday meeting on the strategy on behalf of the massive class of GOP lawmakers elected in 2010, sidestepped questions about whether conservatives would be willing to trade the leverage of a government shutdown for the leverage of a default.\n\nLeaders are \u201crunning the traps on every conceivable formula,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at every possibility.\u201d\n\nThe strategizing in the House came as Senate Democrats advanced a slow but inevitable campaign to approve a measure to keep the government open without undermining the president\u2019s most significant legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nAfter Cruz staged his 21-hour attack on the law, he joined all 99 of his Senate colleagues Wednesday in voting to end his filibuster and start debating a House-passed bill that would fund the government through Dec. 15.\n\nAs written, that measure also would defund Obamacare. But after a long debate expected to stretch into the weekend, Senate rules permit Majority Leader Reid to strip out the anti-Obamacare provisions, change the expiration date on the funding bill to Nov. 15, and pass the measure with a simple majority achieved entirely with Democratic votes.\n\nWith passage of the funding bill all but certain, Cruz\u2019s talk\u00adathon accomplished little. The Senate is expected to approve the bill Saturday. That would give Boehner barely 48 hours to pass the Senate version or respond with add-ons.\n\nAmong the options: Repeal a tax on medical devices that was adopted to help finance the health initiative but has never been popular in either party; abolish insurance subsidies that members of Congress and their staffs receive from their employer, the federal government; or even delay the health-care law\u2019s requirement that every individual purchase insurance, known as the individual mandate.\n\nBut any move to change the bill in the House, no matter how noncontroversial, would require another vote in the Senate, virtually guaranteeing a shutdown. Both chambers must agree on a funding plan by midnight Monday to keep federal agencies open Tuesday.\n\nThat leaves approval of the Senate bill as Boehner\u2019s best bet for avoiding a shutdown. And the evolving debt-limit bill could help.\n\nThe debt-limit measure, which was still being loaded with new provisions late Wednesday, amounts to a grand conservative wish list. In addition to delaying implementation of the health-care law for one year, the bill would establish a timetable for tax reform, squeeze $120 billion from federal health programs over the next decade \u2014 in part by tightening medical malpractice laws \u2014 and cut federal civil service pensions.\n\nThe measure also would approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and advance other GOP economic goals, including increasing offshore oil drilling, blocking federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and restricting most forms of federal industry regulation.\n\nAbout the only major piece of the Republican agenda missing from the bill is a ban on late-term abortions \u2014 and some lawmakers who oppose abortion were arguing to add that, GOP aides said.\n\nBy stuffing the bill with so many appealing provisions, GOP leaders hoped to persuade at least 217 Republicans to support its sole negative aspect: raising the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit through Dec. 31, 2014 \u2014 an increase worth about $1.1 trillion, by independent estimates.\n\nIf the House passes the measure, GOP leaders could argue that it should become the new weapon for continuing the assault on Obamacare, allowing Republicans to abandon the fight against the government funding bill.\n\nIt was unclear late Wednesday whether that strategy would work. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), a close Boehner ally, told reporters only that the debt legislation would be introduced \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, White House officials scoffed at the strategy, with senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeting that the plan \u201cgoes nowhere\u201d and leaves Republicans \u201cresponsible for massive econ calamity.\u201d\n\nAdded Simas, the White House political strategist: \u201cWhat the American people will hear and see is that you have a minority within a party, and this is a minority within the Republican Party who are not listening to the more reasonable elements in the party, and they are willing to risk the full faith and credit of the United States of America and plunge the country into default because of their obsession with denying health insurance to 11 million Americans.\u201d\n\nAs the standoff continued on Capitol Hill, White House officials were pressing ahead with the rollout of the health-care initiative, even as they played down expectations that huge numbers of Americans would sign up for insurance right away. As happened when Massachusetts implemented its universal coverage plan, Simas predicts that Americans will sign up in spurts mainly just before coverage begins in January, and again right before enrollment ends in March.\n\nBut enrollment will be up and running Tuesday even if the rest of the government shuts down, Simas said. Eighty-five percent of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s funding comes from accounts that would not be affected by a shutdown.\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Strategy would shift fight over health-care law to a bill that would raise nation\u2019s debt limit.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Strategy would shift fight over health-care law to a bill that would raise nation\u2019s debt limit.", "title": "House Republicans explore strategy to avoid federal government shutdown", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-republicans-explore-strategy-to-avoid-federal-government-shutdown/2013/09/25/80c9d576-2618-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/26/National-Economy/Images/114261674-2130.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-republicans-explore-strategy-to-avoid-federal-government-shutdown/2013/09/25/80c9d576-2618-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business, detour on the path to shutdown, debt limit, government shutdown, shutdown might not happen, obamacare, ted cruz, ted cruz filibuster", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "80c9d576-2618-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "business, detour on the path to shutdown, debt limit, government shutdown, shutdown might not happen, obamacare, ted cruz, ted cruz filibuster"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd920a\"", "article_summary": "That leaves approval of the Senate bill as Boehner\u2019s best bet for avoiding a shutdown.\n), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, rejected any proposal to rein in Obamacare in either the government funding bill or the debt ceiling.\nWith passage of the funding bill all but certain, Cruz\u2019s talk\u00adathon accomplished little.\nBut any move to change the bill in the House, no matter how noncontroversial, would require another vote in the Senate, virtually guaranteeing a shutdown.\nEighty-five percent of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s funding comes from accounts that would not be affected by a shutdown."}
