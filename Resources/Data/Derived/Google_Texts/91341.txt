Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson, who resigned from CBS last year amid her claims of liberal bias by the network, is getting her own Sunday morning national news show.Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. announced that the 30-minute program, based in Washington, D.C., will air on the company's ABC, Fox, NBC, and CBS affiliates, according to The Huffington Post Although Attkisson will begin work in June, the show is unlikely to debut before the fall. The program will consist of investigative and political journalism while focusing on "accountability.""We are excited to have Sharyl on board as we launch this group-wide news program," said Scott Livingston, Sinclair's news vice president. "Our goal is to provide the context and perspective on major issues impacting our viewers."Sharyl has a proven track record of exposing the truth behind stories that other news organizations shy away from. I admire Sharyl's determination and passion to seek the truth."Attkisson resigned from CBS News in March of last year after two decades at the network. Some colleagues had suggested her work had become agenda-driven even as she aired her frustration that the network had stymied her reporting by its own liberal bias.Earlier this year, it was revealed that Attkisson is suing the federal government over claims that it hacked her computer.The veteran broadcast journalist says the federal government engaged in illegal surveillance of her work as she reported aggressively on the Obama administration, including the scandals surrounding Benghazi, Fast and Furious and Obamacare.She says the Justice Department hacked into her work computers between 2011 and 2013, a claim the department has publicly denied.
