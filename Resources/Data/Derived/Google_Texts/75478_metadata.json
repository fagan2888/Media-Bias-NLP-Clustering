The eight-episode anthology, which hit a first-run high on Sunday night, is averaging 10.9 million weekly viewers.\n\n\n\nThe gross average, which includes replays, HBO Go streams and On Demand plays, is fairly huge for freshman series on the pay cable network. (HBO's most-watched show, Game of Thrones, averaged just north of 13.6 million weekly viewers in its last season.)\n\n\n\nPHOTOS: 40 Years of HBO\n\n\n\nFirst-run episodes have also improved for the series. The Feb. 23 episode pulled in 2.6 million viewers, eclipsing its 2.3-million premiere.\n\n\n\nComedies are also faring well after the lead-in. Girls, averaging a gross 4.3 million viewers season-to-date, brought in 916,000 on Sunday night. And Looking, which did not have the strongest start in January, has improved significantly. Sunday's episode averaged 519,000 viewers -- a series high.\n\n\n\nSeason-to-date, Looking is grossing 2 million weekly viewers.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michael O'Connell", "description": "Hitting a series high for first-runs on Feb. 23, the drama is proving to be a massive hit with time-shifting and multi-platform plays.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "Hitting a series high for first-runs on Feb. 23, the drama is proving to be a massive hit with time-shifting and multi-platform plays.", "title": "TV Ratings: HBO's 'True Detective' Is Averaging 10.9 Million Viewers", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-hbos-true-detective-683257", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "//cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/2014/01/true_detective_h.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 730}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-25 08:49:03", "sailthru.title": "TV Ratings: HBO's 'True Detective' Is Averaging 10.9 Million Viewers", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, TV Ratings", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.description": "Hitting a series high for first-runs on Feb. 23, the drama is proving to be a massive hit with time-shifting and multi-platform plays.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf65a\"", "article_summary": "(HBO's most-watched show, Game of Thrones, averaged just north of 13.6 million weekly viewers in its last season.)\nThe eight-episode anthology, which hit a first-run high on Sunday night, is averaging 10.9 million weekly viewers.\nSeason-to-date, Looking is grossing 2 million weekly viewers.\nThe Feb. 23 episode pulled in 2.6 million viewers, eclipsing its 2.3-million premiere.\nGirls, averaging a gross 4.3 million viewers season-to-date, brought in 916,000 on Sunday night."}
