However, a defeat by five votes during Town Meeting voting in Manchester, which was being asked for $25,000 of the $75,000 being sought, created a hurdle that chamber officials felt uncomfortable risking a revote on.\n\nThe chamber has been circulating petitions for a revote and had been indicating a willingness to try and reverse that outcome in a second vote which they were hoping to hold in early May.\n\n\u201cThe responsible business decision is to cease operation and not go through with reconsideration for funds we could not in good conscience use for the immediate operational needs of the chamber,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBy making the decision now, it allows the Chamber to take care of current financial obligations and releases our loyal partners from further monetary obligation to us.\u201d\n\nThe Partnership was an attempt to bring together private and public money to support tourism destination marketing and economic development initiatives. It passed in 12 of the 16 communities where it was on the ballot, failing in Arlington, Sunderland, Stratton and Manchester. But it was the defeat by the narrow five vote margin in Manchester out of more than 1,200 votes cast that struck what proved to be a fatal blow to the enterprise.\n\n\u201cWhat we weren\u2019t able to do was communicate it in a timely manner so we didn\u2019t lose by five fatal votes, because we saw having that a nucleus of a good amount to go to the private sector,\u201d said Berta Maginniss, the chamber\u2019s executive director. \u201cWhen we lost, we lost that leverage to that amount of money from the private sector.\u201d\n\nThe chamber\u2019s public statement expanded that point.\n\n\u201c\u2026 public funding for The Partnership was not just about the money,\u201d it stated. \u201cIt was also intended to signal our private investors that everybody was in and this initiative was on its way to making a major contribution to the economic health of the region.\u201d\n\nBefore the chamber reached a point where it would not be able to \u201cmake whole those people who\u2019ve been with you,\u201d Maginniss added, the chamber\u2019s board of directors made a decision at a meeting Wednesday to close the organization.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s Welcome Center on Bonnet Street, which opened in 2012 and grew visitor traffic from 1,000 to 14,000 last year, will also close, although she will be staying on for another week to tie up loose ends, Maginniss said.\n\nThe Chamber has organized and hosted the Manchester Car Show, and planning for this year\u2019s event, scheduled for next June, is already well-advanced. Maginniss said she was going to continue with trying to organize it herself and hold the event.\n\nThe future of other chamber programs and events, such as the popular Concerts on the Green, a series of music performances held on the town green, are for the moment up in the air. Town officials plan to discuss this latest development regarding the chamber at next Tuesday\u2019s regular select board meeting, said John O\u2019Keefe, the town manager.\n\n\u201cSomething will have to fill the void,\u201d he said, adding that one possibility was pulling together a group of local officials and business leaders to take the chamber\u2019s place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manchester and the Mountains Regional Chamber of Commerce saw decline in membership and revenue.", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Manchester and the Mountains Regional Chamber of Commerce saw decline in membership and revenue.", "title": "Manchester Chamber of Commerce folds operations | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ManchesterWelcome.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-23T11:52:40+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2016/03/22/manchester-chamber-of-commerce-closes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Manchester and the Mountains Regional Chamber of Commerce saw decline in membership and revenue.", "title": "Manchester Chamber of Commerce folds operations | VTDigger", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ManchesterWelcome.jpg?fit=640%2C427", "creator": "@vtdigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Manchester, Manchester Chamber", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Business & Economy", "tag": "Manchester", "published_time": "2016-03-22T06:03:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T11:52:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bennington county, manchester, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases"}, "article_summary": "MANCHESTER \u2014 The Manchester and the Mountains Regional Chamber of Commerce is closing its doors.\n\u201cWhen we lost, we lost that leverage to that amount of money from the private sector.\u201dThe chamber\u2019s public statement expanded that point.\nThe decision to fold the chamber\u2019s operations is effective immediately, according to a statement released by the business organization Friday.\nThe Chamber has organized and hosted the Manchester Car Show, and planning for this year\u2019s event, scheduled for next June, is already well-advanced.\nTown officials plan to discuss this latest development regarding the chamber at next Tuesday\u2019s regular select board meeting, said John O\u2019Keefe, the town manager."}
