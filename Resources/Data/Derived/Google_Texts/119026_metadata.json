That helped to drive down the unemployment rate, which dipped to 6.3 percent last month, down from 6.4 percent in August and 6.5 percent in September 2013.\n\nStill, it remained higher than the national average of 5.9 percent.\n\n\"Overall I would say the numbers are anemic,\" said Richard Clinch, an economist for the Battelle Memorial Institute.\n\nSince the start of the year, Maryland has added 8,500 jobs \u2014 essentially flat in a state where some 2.6 million people are on the payroll. The number of people seeking work has increased, even as the population in the labor force has fallen.\n\nThe slowly shrinking labor force could pose a long-term problem, making it more difficult for Maryland to attract businesses, economists said.\n\n\"If people are leaving the labor force, that makes it difficult to attract employers,\" said Gus Faucher, a Pittsburgh-based senior economist for PNC Financial Services Group. \"That's definitely a negative for long-term growth.\"\n\nSome sectors are doing better than others.\n\nProfessional and business services \u2014 a sector that includes government contractors \u2014 added 3,400 jobs in September, with payrolls up about 1 percent since the start of the year. Employers engaged in financial activities added 300 jobs in September, continuing a 3.5 percent expansion so far this year.\n\nBut other sectors posted losses, including education and health care services, which shed about 1,200 jobs in September. Payrolls in that industry \u2014 typically an area of strength for Maryland \u2014 are up about 1 percent for the year.\n\nGary Keith, a regional economist at M&T Bank Corp., said the sector may be figuring out how to adjust to new federal regulations and could remain unsteady for some time.\n\n\"We probably will have to get used to health care being a lot more volatile than it's been, with the Affordable Care Act and ramification for providers around what they do to address on the one hand more people being insured and on the other hand tighter margins,\" he said.\n\nThe public sector has historically fueled Maryland's economy, but slower growth in federal spending has kept hiring in check. Despite last month's gains, about 502,200 people were on government payrolls last month in Maryland, down by about 900 since the start of the year.\n\n\"The crux of the matter here is Maryland is in a long-term economic adjustment as it diversifies its economy,\" Clinch said, adding that the state's universities and other assets make it well positioned to diversify. \"We have these strengths. The question is, how do we deploy them?\"\n\nNationally, 31 states saw their unemployment rates decline, as the number of jobs increased in 39 states and Washington.\n\nThe job estimates are preliminary and subject to revision. The bureau Tuesday revised its estimates of job growth in August, finding Maryland employers created 1,200 new jobs that month, double the initial projection of just 600.\n\n\"While the economy overall is not where everybody wants it to be, just hearing from our guests and seeing the increased number of jumpers kind of gives us an indication that things are slowly but surely getting better,\" said Baltimore-based businessman Braden Holcomb, who opened his first Sky Zone franchise in Kansas City about two years ago and plans to open his fourth in Timonium next month.\n\nHis firm is hosting a job fair Saturday at its new Aylesbury Road facility to fill about 100 part-time positions at the indoor trampoline park.\n\n\"Hopefully we can get a couple hundred people out there,\" he said.\n\nnsherman@baltsun.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Maryland unemployment dips to 6.3 percent", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Maryland added about 2,800 jobs in September, enough to make a slight dent in the unemployment rate , but too few to signal significant growth, economists said Tuesday after the release of a monthly report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "title": "Maryland unemployment dips to 6.3 percent", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-september-jobs-20141021-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54468011/turbine/bs-bz-september-jobs-20141021", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Unemployment rate, jobs", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/81737479", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-21", "Description": "The state added fewer than 3,000 jobs in September, enough to make a slight dent in the unemployment rate, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Unemployment rate, jobs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37f8\"", "article_summary": "That helped to drive down the unemployment rate, which dipped to 6.3 percent last month, down from 6.4 percent in August and 6.5 percent in September 2013.\nNationally, 31 states saw their unemployment rates decline, as the number of jobs increased in 39 states and Washington.\nSince the start of the year, Maryland has added 8,500 jobs \u2014 essentially flat in a state where some 2.6 million people are on the payroll.\nThe slowly shrinking labor force could pose a long-term problem, making it more difficult for Maryland to attract businesses, economists said.\nDespite last month's gains, about 502,200 people were on government payrolls last month in Maryland, down by about 900 since the start of the year."}
