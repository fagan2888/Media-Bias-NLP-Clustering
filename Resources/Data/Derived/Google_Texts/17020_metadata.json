The only way to fight the infection in a patient is to provide supportive treatments, like oral rehydration and pain medication. Scientists are working on developing various vaccines and experimental serums, such as ZMapp, which was administered to two infected Americans, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. Though ZMapp helped save their lives, there are only a limited number of doses and the drug is not FDA-approved, making it more difficult to send to Africa.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria has quickly become the worst outbreak of the disease in recorded history. The virus has claimed over 1,069 lives and possibly more, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nDespite fears that bringing the two infected patients to Atlanta, Ga., for treatment could jump-start an outbreak in the U.S., the FDA\u2019s press release states that \u201c[i]t is important to note that according to the [CDC], Ebola does not pose a significant risk to the U.S. public. Unfortunately, during outbreak situations, fraudulent products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure a disease all too often appear on the market,\u201d most likely to take advantage of worrisome folks hoping to reduce their chances of getting the disease. Despite fear mongering and plenty of news headlines about the severity of the outbreak in West Africa, however, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that people in the U.S. will become infected with the disease. And buying into fake Ebola treatment products will do nothing to protect you from the disease, anyway.\n\nEbola can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or infected needles, the CDC states. It\u2019s not an airborne, water-borne, or food-borne illness. If you\u2019ve come across a fraudulent Ebola product online, the FDA urges you to report it here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola treatment, ebola, fake supplements, fraudulent ebola treatment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA released a warning about fraudulent Ebola treatment products that have been popping up online.", "title": "Fake Ebola Treatments Pop Up Online; FDA Warns Consumers To Steer Away", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fake-ebola-treatments-are-popping-internet-fda-warns-consumers-steer-away-298228", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/supplements.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA released a warning about fraudulent Ebola treatment products that have been popping up online.", "title": "Fake Ebola Treatments Pop Up Online; FDA Warns Consumers To Steer Away", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fake-ebola-treatments-are-popping-internet-fda-warns-consumers-steer-away-298228", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/supplements.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/supplements.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-15T11:39:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T11:39:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA released a warning about fraudulent Ebola treatment products that have been popping up online."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dda\"", "article_summary": "Online scammers who sell dietary supplements that claim to treat Ebola are fake and should be reported to the FDA.\nScammers who sell fraudulent medical treatments or dietary supplements online are nothing new \u2014 but when it comes to Ebola, the fear many people are experiencing might prompt them into buying these scams.\n\u201cThere are no approved vaccines, drugs, or investigational products specifically for Ebola available for purchase on the Internet,\u201d the press release states.\nThe Ebola outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria has quickly become the worst outbreak of the disease in recorded history.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on Thursday that online scammers attempting to sell so-called Ebola treatments need to be reported and stopped immediately."}
