China says it has no hostile intent.\n\nThe runway on the Fiery Cross Reef is 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) long and is one of three China has been building for more than a year in the archipelago.\n\nCivilian flights began test runs there in January but the landing by the military aircraft, on Sunday, was the first time China has publicly reported a flight by a military plane to Fiery Cross Reef.\n\nMore than $5 trillion of world trade is shipped through the South China Sea every year. Besides China's territorial claims in the area, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CNN quoted Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis as saying it was unclear why China ha", "title": "China rejects U.S. query on military flight to disputed island", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/China-rejects-US-query-military-flight-disputed-island", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-china_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/China-rejects-US-query-military-flight-disputed-island", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-china_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CNN quoted Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis as saying it was unclear why China ha", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The United States has repeatedly criticized the construction of the islands and worries that China plans to use them for military purposes.\nCivilian flights began test runs there in January but the landing by the military aircraft, on Sunday, was the first time China has publicly reported a flight by a military plane to Fiery Cross Reef.\nCNN quoted Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis as saying it was unclear why China had used a military aircraft rather than a civilian one in the landing on Fiery Cross Reef.\nChina has indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly Islands and the United States has no right to comment on China's building works and defensive facilities there, the ministry said.\nThe runway on the Fiery Cross Reef is 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) long and is one of three China has been building for more than a year in the archipelago."}
