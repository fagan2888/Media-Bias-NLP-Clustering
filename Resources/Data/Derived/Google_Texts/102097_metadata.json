Clearly, the Obama administration did not deliver the whole truth,\u201d Black said in a release.\n\nMIDAS is not included in the Healthcare.gov privacy policy and it was implemented without a privacy assessment, according to Black. MIDAS is said to hold names, financial accounts, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, and passport numbers.\n\nBlack has more than 40 years experience in the healthcare industry as a nurse and said that privacy is essential to medical care.\n\n\u201cThis should concern every American who desires to see their personal information protected from the prying eyes of Big Brother Obama and it begs the question,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWhat else don\u2019t we know when it comes to Obamacare?\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a 2014 report that without a privacy assessment, \u201cIt will be difficult for (the administration) to demonstrate that it has . . . taken steps to ensure that the privacy of that data is protected.\u201d\n\nMIDAS keeps personal information forever. The Federal information hub is set to be \u201cthe largest personal information database the government has ever attempted\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. Healthcare.gov describes MIDAS as a \u201cperpetual central repository.\u201d\n\nOther critics of Obamacare, including Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, said that the speed with which the Affordable Care Act passed denied the American public the ability to make an informed decision.\n\n\u201cWith the news that our health privacy is gone forever, Obamacare is increasingly like an ill-conceived tattoo. The decision was made in the dead of night without thought or consultation and too soon one learns that it will never-ever go away,\u201d Norquist said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics blasted the White House for perceived privacy gaps in the Affordable Care Act on Monday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Critics blasted the White House for perceived privacy gaps in the Affordable Care Act\u00a0on Monday.
