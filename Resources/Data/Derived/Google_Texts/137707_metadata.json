We\u2019ve alphabetized a few of the most colorful.\n\nA is for AP History\n\nBen Carson thinks that \u201cmost\u201d people, upon completing AP HISTORY, will want to join ISIS.\n\nB is for Book Tour\n\nBen Carson suspended his public campaign for a couple of weeks to promote his book, A More Perfect Union. Conveniently, there isn\u2019t much difference between a BOOK TOUR stop and a campaign stop anymore!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC is for Correctness\n\nPolitical CORRECTNESS, that is. Ben Carson believes that it is admirable that at least ISIS is willing to die for what they believe, as opposed to the pussies living in this country \u201cbusily giv\u00ading away every value and every be\u00adlief for the sake of polit\u00adic\u00adal cor\u00adrect\u00adness.\u201d\n\nD is for D-Day\n\nRunning for President, says Ben Carson, is sort of like being a soldier storming the beach at Normandy on D-DAY. Tens of thousands of Allied soldiers were killed on real D-DAY in the process of fighting the Nazis. Nobody so far has been killed while campaigning for Ben Carson, and most of the Nazis are in Argentina or dead.\n\nSponsored\n\nE is for Evolution\n\nEVOLUTION is not real.\n\nF is for Fundraising\n\nBen Carson is fer it. Very fer it. In fact, 69% of the money he raises on this campaign is going to... raising more money.\n\nG is for Guns\n\nHaving one\u2019s GUNS taken away is just as bad if not worse than being shot with a GUN, says Ben Carson.\n\nH is for Homosexuals\n\nDr. Ben Carson thinks that prison rape can \u201cturn\u201d men into HOMOSEXUALS. Ergo, being gay is a choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI is for Islam\n\nBen Carson thinks adherence to ISLAM is reason enough to disqualify somebody from running for President.\n\nJ is for Jews\n\nBen Carson thinks the JEWS would have maybe done a better job of surviving the Holocaust if they had guns.\n\nK is for Killing a Baby\n\nBen Carson considers all abortion \u201cKILLING A BABY,\u201d so if you\u2019re pregnant, you better stay pregnant, even if it could kill you :) .\n\nL is for Liar\n\nSerious presidential candidate and definitely-not-future-cult-leader Ben Carson called President Obama a \u201cpsychopath\u201d because Ben Carson believes he is a LIAR.\n\nM is for Marriage\n\nDr. Ben Carson believes that same-sex MARRIAGE is part of the \u201cnew world order.\u201d\n\nN is for NAMBLA\n\nBen Carson believes that many gays are members of NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association.\n\nO is for Obamacare\n\nGOP frontrunner Ben Carson believes that is the worst thing to happen to America since slavery, which means Ben Carson believes that the Affordable Care Act is worse than 9/11.\n\nP is for Pyramids\n\nBen Carson believes that the PYRAMIDS were built by Joseph to store grain and not by the Egyptians as a place to bury dead pharaohs. Because not only is the Bible real, it\u2019s a heavenly writing prompt for its devotees to just make shit up about everything.\n\nQ is for Quack\n\nMannatech is a company that makes QUACK medicine based on Christianity and something called \u201cglyconutrients.\u201d Ben Carson loves (or, until extremely recently, loved) it!\n\nR is for the Real Racists\n\nBen Carson has found the REAL RACISTS. It\u2019s the Democrats, the party of affirmative action, sit-down meetings with Black Lives Matter participants, and Barack Obama.\n\nS is for Shooting (and Surviving)\n\nBen Carson would SURVIVE a mass SHOOTING by tackling the guy with the gun. So simple. Cannot believe none of the thousands of victims of mass shootings ever thought of that cool idea.\n\nT is for Taxes (and Tithe)\n\nThe basis for our TAX system should be Biblical TITHING, says presidential frontrunner Ben Carson.\n\nU is for Urine\n\nHere\u2019s a thing Ben Carson said that some terrorist would probably pay a million dollars for a container of ebola URINE.\n\nV is for Veterans Affairs\n\nBen Carson believes that the VA scandal, which resulted in thousands of veterans waiting obscene amounts of time for medical care, was a \u201cgift from God\u201d sent to teach us a lesson about bureaucracy. Imagine how pissed you\u2019d be to find out your dad\u2019s death as he waited for care at a VA hospital was just part of a lesson God wanted to teach America about small government. I\u2019d be pretty pissed!\n\nW is for W. Cleon Skousen\n\nBen Carson is a devotee of W. CLEON SKOUSEN, a dead conspiracy theorist who believes that secret commies are controlling America.\n\nX is for eXpats\n\nIn 2014, Ben Carson and his wife held onto their son\u2019s Australian passport incase they needed to become EXPATS and leave the country if Republicans did not win back the Senate. Phew! Glad they didn\u2019t have to leave the country like Rush Limbaugh did after Obamacare passed.\n\nY is for Yuma County\n\nBen Carson has said that a program in Yuma County, AZ eliminated 97% of illegal immigration. That\u2019s not true!\n\nZ is for Zero\n\nBen Carson has served a total of zero years in public office.
