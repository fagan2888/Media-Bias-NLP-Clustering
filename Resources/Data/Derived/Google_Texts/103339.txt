The glorious days of autumn are upon us, and leaves are ablaze at the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden in North Fayette.

If your trees and shrubs are putting on colors as pretty as these, send us some photos with information about how you did it. Or did you just let Mother Nature dress them? Either way, we all appreciate a little color before our yards descend into the bleak black and white landscapes of winter.

Email your pictures and captions to kkirkland@post-gazette.com and they just might appear in the Post-Gazette or post-gazette.com.
