Excluding charges and other items, earnings were $1.05 a share\u2014more than the $1 a share analysts expected. Revenue rose 1%, to $20.12 billion. For the full year, the company reported revenue up 1%, to $66.4 billion. In 4Q 2013, Pepsi\u2019s snacks division saw 3% growth in volume and generated $7.9 billion in revenue. Beverages increased 1%, adding $12.2 billion to the company\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nThe company has seen pressure to spin off its struggling North American beverages business in favor of its profitable snack unit that comprises the brands Lay\u2019s, Cheetos, and Doritos, especially from activist investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management. Soda sales have been witnessing a decline in North America as more health-conscious consumers opt for low-calorie and non-carbonated beverages such as juices and health drinks. The company is also facing competition from its biggest rival, Coca Cola (KO), and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS). Peltz was also pushing PepsiCo to merge with Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International (MDLZ), but he abandoned that plan after being given a seat on Mondelez\u2019s board last month.\n\nTrian said in a presentation last year:\n\n\u201cWe believe PepsiCo is at a strategic crossroads as secular forces ranging from changing consumer tastes to the increased importance of emerging markets have changed the outlook of PepsiCo\u2019s key businesses. Management\u2019s plans (increased advertising and marketing spend, the hope of \u201cdisruptive\u201d carbonated soft drinks (CSD) innovation, and productivity initiatives that have not hit the bottom-line) are unlikely to be game-changers long-term.\u201d\n\nBut Pepsico rejected the proposal and reiterated that it plans to retain its beverage unit, and expects to introduce naturally sweetened, lower-calorie beverages that might revive sales of soft drinks. The company said on the earnings call that following an \u201cexhaustive analysis and review,\u201d it believes North American beverage unit \u201ccreates value and is optimized within PepsiCo\u2019s structure today.\u201d\n\nThe company initiated a new five-year $5 billion productivity program (2015\u20132019) by accelerating investment in manufacturing automation, further optimizing the company\u2019s global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities, re-engineering go-to-market systems in developed markets, expanding shared services, and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency.\n\nThe Doritos and Tropicana creator also announced a 15% increase in its annualized dividend, to $2.62 per share from $2.27 per share, to take effect with the June 2014 payment. It also anticipates increasing share repurchases in 2014, to approximately $5 billion. Combined, these programs are expected to return a total of $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014\u2014a 35% increase from 2013 levels.", "article_metadata": {"cXenseParse": {"mre-primary-ticker": "pep", "mre-author": "Smita Nair", "mre-value-driver": "13Fs (Top Fund Holdings)", "mre-page-type": "post", "mre-sector": "Hedge Funds", "mre-secondary-ticker": "vlo"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "description": "PepsiCo Inc (PEP) is a global food and beverage company and it's a 0.19% new position in Bridgewater's ~$12 billion long portfolio."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea0f\"", "article_summary": "Bridgewater Associates' new positions in 4Q 2013: Important points PART 2 OF 7Why Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater Associates opened a position in PepsiBridgewater Associates and PepsiCoPepsiCo Inc (PEP) is a global food and beverage company and it\u2019s a 0.19% new position in Bridgewater\u2019s ~$12 billion long portfolio.\nBeverages increased 1%, adding $12.2 billion to the company\u2019s overall revenue.\nIn 4Q 2013, Pepsi\u2019s snacks division saw 3% growth in volume and generated $7.9 billion in revenue.\nThe company\u2019s shares fell 3% recently, after PepsiCo reported earnings that beat estimates but missed on revenue.\nFor the full year, the company reported revenue up 1%, to $66.4 billion."}
