The stated reason: to get European banks, still reeling from the continent\u2019s monetary crisis, to lend more in an effort to jumpstart Europe\u2019s economy.\n\nOn Thursday, ECB chief Mario Draghi announced that the bank would change the deposit rate for the Europe\u2019s commercial banks to -0.1 percent from zero. He also announced that the interest rate the bank would charge on borrowed money for traditional borrowers would drop from 0.25 percent to 0.15 percent.\n\nRelated: As Merkel Goes, So Goes the European Union\n\nThe move serves two purposes. First, it\u2019s aimed at combating low inflation, which are keeping prices down across the euro zone.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s a prompt to get European banks to loan more money in the hopes that this money could kick-start a faster European recovery. Across the euro zone, growth has been, at best, fragile. The EU projects just 1.5 percent growth across the continent in 2014, hardly enough to combat widespread unemployment, especially among Europe\u2019s youth.\n\nDraghi made clear that if these steps failed to produce growth, he was prepared to do more.\n\n\u201cWe think this is a significant package. Are we finished here? The answer is no,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIf required, we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing. The governing council is also unanimous in its commitment to using unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.\"\n\nRelated: US-EU Trade Deal--Obama's Ambitious Gamble\n\nThe next step is quantitative easing, a move that would essentially make the ECB the European Federal Reserve. If Draghi decides to go this route, the ECB would begin to buy government bonds and other securities in order to increase the money supply. This strategy helped to get the United States out of recession and back to growth.\n\nEven without quantitative easing, Draghi\u2019s announcement made him the second most powerful person in Europe, according to Edward Goldberg, professor at Baruch College and the New York University Center for Global Affairs. He also said that Draghi\u2019s actions were a direct response to the right wing surge Europe experienced in recent EU parliamentary elections.\n\n\u201cIn all practical sense Europe has two leaders now: Draghi and Merkel,\u201d he said, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cIt is obvious that the right wing vote \u2026 for the European parliament was partly due to the very unsettling economic conditions in much of Europe and the absolutely huge amount of youth unemployment.\u201d\n\nGoldberg added that the failure of European leaders to acknowledge the need for the kind of action Draghi initiated compounded the EU\u2019s search for economic growth.\n\nRelated: Europe Takes Dangerous Turn to the Far Right\n\n\u201cUnfortunately because of the structure of the Eurozone and because of the charter of the ECB, Draghi could not have initiated these policies sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes one appreciate very much the US's Fed ability early on in the great recession to be able to act based on its dual mandate and political independence.\u201d\n\nTied Up in Regulation\n\nSteve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, offered a different take on Draghi\u2019s actions. He said that the decision to charge European banks to hold money in reserve showed how over-regulation has strangled the EU.\n\nAccording to Hanke, the Basel III requirements, which were born from the 2008 financial crisis, make banks keep cash on hand to make sure they can withstand a market shock. Draghi\u2019s demand that these banks lend could be at odds with the need to have cash in reserve.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve increased the level of bank supervision, they\u2019ve increased all kinds of bank regulations,\u201d Hanke said. \u201cIf you put all of this together you have a schitzo monetary policy and a very distorted one.\u201d\n\nHanke said that the ECB\u2019s new policy highlights one of the problems at the heart of the EU\u2019s fractured response to its sovereign debt crisis. The EU has taken a piecemeal approach, plodding along with policies that work in the moment but not the long-term. Draghi\u2019s decision to charge banks for keeping money in reserve shows that these policies can sometime be contradictory.\n\n\u201cPolicy one is squeeze the devil out of banks and force a credit squeeze,\u201d he said. \u201cThe affect of that is falling credit and a near recession in Europe. Then you have to have some extraordinary \u2018policy two\u2019 to try to neutralize the stupid policy one.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The ECB\u2019s decision to charge banks for holding money elevates the bank\u2019s chief while exposing the hypocrisy of EU policy.", "title": "Europe Is Close to Creating a \u2018Federal Reserve Bank\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/08/Europe-Close-Creating-Federal-Reserve-Bank", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12042011_Eurozone_Deal_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/08/Europe-Close-Creating-Federal-Reserve-Bank", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12042011_Eurozone_Deal_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The ECB\u2019s decision to charge banks for holding money elevates the bank\u2019s chief while exposing the hypocrisy of EU policy.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8ce\"", "article_summary": "The stated reason: to get European banks, still reeling from the continent\u2019s monetary crisis, to lend more in an effort to jumpstart Europe\u2019s economy.\nHe said that the decision to charge European banks to hold money in reserve showed how over-regulation has strangled the EU.\nRelated: US-EU Trade Deal--Obama's Ambitious GambleThe next step is quantitative easing, a move that would essentially make the ECB the European Federal Reserve.\nSecond, it\u2019s a prompt to get European banks to loan more money in the hopes that this money could kick-start a faster European recovery.\nDraghi\u2019s decision to charge banks for keeping money in reserve shows that these policies can sometime be contradictory."}
