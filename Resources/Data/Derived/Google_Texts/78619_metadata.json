She\u2019ll retire to Washington state where she will do volunteer work.\n\nBaskerville, who got her medical license in 1969, wishes she could stay open but in a letter to friends and families, she said she tried without success to attract new pediatricians to take over.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to bring in and retain new physicians because of the high cost of living and especially the high cost of housing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe median single-family home price in Santa Cruz County topped $715,000 in July, August and September, making this the most expensive market in the nation behind San Francisco and the San Jose-Sunnyvale area.\n\nSmall private practices such as Capitola Pediatrics are shrinking.\n\nAccenture, which periodically surveys independent physicians, reports the number declined from 49 percent in 2005 to 37 percent in 2013 due to lower reimbursement rates and overhead costs, and predicts further shrinkage in 2016 to 33 percent.\n\nSome physicians are joining larger medical groups where they can focus on medicine without the challenge of running a business.\n\nFew of those coming out of medical school expect to run their own practice, according to Marvin Labrie of Physicians Medical Group of Santa Cruz County, who hears about the trends from his stepson who is in his fourth year of residency and working as a hospitalist in Seattle.\n\n\u201cThey like the pace. They like the intensity. They like knowing when they\u2019re off duty, they\u2019re off duty,\u201d Labrie said.\n\nMedicare reimbursement rates for doctors in Santa Cruz County have lagged behind those in Santa Clara County by more than 10 percent. A fix is due in 2017, thanks to Dr. Larry de Ghetaldi of Palo Alto Medical Foundation Santa Cruz, who worked on this issue for 14 years.\n\nLarge medical groups are in a better position to have capital for new technology and equipment but for solo and small practices, the cost is daunting.\n\nIn Watsonville, several doctors who owned private practices have joined the nonprofit Salud Para Le Gente, which is growing with federal grants under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are Dr. Jordann Loehr, who practices obstetrics and gynecology, and Dr. Michelle Simon and Dr. Linda Shaw, both pediatricians.\n\nDori Rose Inda, Salud\u2019s executive director, said 45 new staffers were hired in five and a months. In September Salud was awarded a $318,000 federal grant to support a new physician, pediatrician and health coach to serve 1,055 new and existing patients, numbers that are growing as the state-funded Medi-Cal program expands.\n\nSalud\u2019s new addition for providers seeing women and children is expected to open in January.\n\nLoehr practiced with Dr. Dennis Chamberlain until he retired; they were affiliated with Coastal Health Partners, a medical group affiliated with Watsonville Community Hospital.\n\nDr. Jill Parello and Dr. Cory Parello, who were practicing at Capitola Pediatrics, moved to an office in Aptos and affiliated with Coastal Health Partners.\n\nMusical chairs?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Labrie.\n\nAs the sun sets on Baskerville\u2019s career in medicine, Capitola families say she will be missed.\n\nAmong her patients was Tyler Smith, now 33.\n\n\u201cGoing to the doctor was something I never feared or dreaded,\u201d he wrote his mom after hearing of Dr. Baskerville\u2019s retirement. \u201cI actually liked it because I knew she was going to help me and with such a calming aura. She is such an incredible person.\u201d\n\nPhysician groups grow\n\nPalo Alto Medical Foundation Santa Cruz\n\nJuly 2014: 175 physicians 32 part-time physicians, 40 nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nNovember 2015: 200 physicians, 32 part-time physicians, 50 nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nDignity Health Medical Group Dominican\n\nFebruary 2014: 35 doctors, 2 nurse practitioners.\n\nNovember 2015: 70 doctors.\n\nSalud Para La Gente\n\nNovember 2015: 18 physicians, one on call; 14 nurse practitioners and physician assistants, one on call; two lactation consultants, one parent educator, two behavioral health therapists, one optometrist.\n\nComing: One pediatrician, 2 obstetrician/gynecoloists\n\n2016: One family practice physician, one pediatrician, one family nurse practitioner\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story had Tyler Smith\u2019s name and age incorrect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CAPITOLA >> Dr. Elizabeth Baskerville\u2019s office plans a party Friday afternoon from 2 to 5 p.m. to say goodbye to her patients.After 33 years in the same location, she is closing Capitola Pediatrics, her practice specializing in inf", "title": "Dr. Elizabeth Baskerville to close Capitola Pediatrics", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20151118/NEWS/151119667", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20151118/NEWS/151119667/AR/0/AR-151119667.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "930px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Dr. Elizabeth Baskerville to close Capitola Pediatrics"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "CAPITOLA >> Dr. Elizabeth Baskerville\u2019s office plans a party Friday afternoon from 2 to 5 p.m. to say goodbye to her patients.After 33 years in the same location, she is closing Capitola Pediatrics, her practice specializing in inf", "title": "Dr. Elizabeth Baskerville to close Capitola Pediatrics", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20151118/NEWS/151119667", "image": {"src": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20151118/NEWS/151119667/AR/0/AR-151119667.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Capitola,cityeditor,doctors,Elizabeth Baskerville,health care,jondigumz,localnews,Marvin Labrie,PAMF,Salud para la Gente, Business", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Capitola,cityeditor,doctors,Elizabeth Baskerville,health care,jondigumz,localnews,Marvin Labrie,PAMF,Salud para la Gente, Business"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementThey are Dr. Jordann Loehr, who practices obstetrics and gynecology, and Dr. Michelle Simon and Dr. Linda Shaw, both pediatricians.\nDr. Jill Parello and Dr. Cory Parello, who were practicing at Capitola Pediatrics, moved to an office in Aptos and affiliated with Coastal Health Partners.\nDignity Health Medical Group Dominican February 2014: 35 doctors, 2 nurse practitioners.\nPhysician groups grow Palo Alto Medical Foundation Santa Cruz July 2014: 175 physicians 32 part-time physicians, 40 nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\nDignity Health Medical Group DominicanFebruary 2014: 35 doctors, 2 nurse practitioners."}
