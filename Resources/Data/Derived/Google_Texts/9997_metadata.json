The ads warned that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe was a puppet for a leftist \u201cGang of 5\u201d and would do to Virginia what they had already done to Detroit, California, Hollywood, and Washington, DC. Because of a loophole in campaign finance law, the identities of the the people funding the six-figure ad buys did not become public until Friday \u2014 nearly three months after the gubernatorial election and almost five months after the ads ran.\n\nFight for Tomorrow registered with the Federal Election Commission on September 10, 2013 as a super PAC. The same week, it hit the airways with ads calling McAuliffe a \u201cstand-in\u201d for the \u201cextremist liberal leadership of the Democratic Party,\u201d the \u201celitist media,\u201d \u201csmear groups financed by anti-American foreigner [sic] and mega rich environmentalists,\u201d \u201cWall Street liberals,\u201d and \u201cHollywood partisans.\u201d\n\nAt the time, ThinkProgress reached out to Matt L. Mackowiak, a Republican political consultant and the executive director and treasurer of Fight for America, to inquire about the group\u2019s contributions and expenditures. Mackowiak replied: \u201cyou can wait to view the reports like everyone else because its our policy not to provide that information,\u201d and \u201cyou are welcome to review the information disclosed in our campaign finance reports once they become public.\u201d\n\nBecause the group is registered as a federal committee, the group files only a semi-annual disclosure. Its September 2013 expenditures did not get reported to the FEC until its \u201cyear-end\u201d statement, due January 31, 2014. Even though its donors were speaking to Virginia voters two months prior to the election, those citizens had no way of evaluating the credibility or biases of the those speakers until well after they had already cast their votes. While much attention has been paid to \u201cdark money\u201d 501(c)(4) groups like Crossroads GPS, which never disclosure their donors, even super PACs like this can effectively evade any meaningful transparency by waiting until after the election is over to identify major funders.\n\nAnd who were the big donors behind Fight for America? A ThinkProgress review of the disclosures revealed that a \u201cGang of Three\u201d conservative activists combined to provide more than $200,000 of the roughly $375,000 the group raised in 2013 for the \u201cGang of Five\u201d campaign. They included Texas oil and gas company president A. Scott Nobles ($148,900), detective-turned-conservative-megadonor Guy M. Bowers ($50,000), and former Reagan appointee and longtime National Conservative Political Action Committee chair Maiselle D. Shortley ($10,000).\n\nThe Fight for America ads \u2014 now deleted from YouTube due to a Terms of Service violation \u2014 warned that McAuliffe and the \u201cmega rich elitists\u201d he represents wanted \u201ccostly energy,\u201d and would \u201cCalifornia Virginia with regulations that kill jobs.\u201d While it may come as little surprise that a fossil fuels magnate would be behind an anti-regulation message, the fact that Virginians had no way of knowing which \u201cmega rich\u201d donors were paying for the ads indicates that the current disclosure laws allow for an informed electorate only after they have cast their ballots.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Last September, a strange set of television and newspaper ads, by a mysterious new political group called Fight for America, began to appear across Virginia.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Last September, a strange set of television and newspaper ads, by a mysterious new political group called Fight for America, began to appear across Virginia.", "title": "Transparency Laws Reveal Big Money Behind TV Ads \u2013 Three Months After The Election", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/02/03/3238541/fight-tomorrow-disclosure/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GangOF5-e1391439730522.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last September, a strange set of television and newspaper ads, by a mysterious new political group called Fight for America, began to appear across Virginia.", "title": "Transparency Laws Reveal Big Money Behind TV Ads \u2013 Three Months After The Election", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GangOF5-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@jeisrael", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GangOF5-e1391439730522.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GangOF5-e1391439730522.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T10:26:24+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bfa\"", "article_summary": "Justice Transparency Laws Reveal Big Money Behind TV Ads \u2013 Three Months After The Election CREDIT: Fight for Tomorrow ad (2013)Last September, a strange set of television and newspaper ads, by a mysterious new political group called Fight for America, began to appear across Virginia.\nAnd who were the big donors behind Fight for America?\nFight for Tomorrow registered with the Federal Election Commission on September 10, 2013 as a super PAC.\nBecause of a loophole in campaign finance law, the identities of the the people funding the six-figure ad buys did not become public until Friday \u2014 nearly three months after the gubernatorial election and almost five months after the ads ran.\nIts September 2013 expenditures did not get reported to the FEC until its \u201cyear-end\u201d statement, due January 31, 2014."}
