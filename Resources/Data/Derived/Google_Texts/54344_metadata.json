Susan Collins presented a plan that would end the government shutdown and extend the debt limit through January, but would also delay a medical device tax included in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdditional Photos Sen.

Senators said Obama listened politely to the proposals by Collins and others but did not specifically endorse any.\n\nCollins\u2019 plan would continue the automatic sequester cuts but allow more flexibility in how they can be applied.\n\nSenior Republican senators urged House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio to join them in supporting the measure, according to The Washington Post.\n\nBy late Friday, Senate Republicans \u2013 led by Collins, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 sent draft language to their Democratic counterparts, the Post reported.\n\n\u201cThe president obviously wants to get this resolved and certainly isn\u2019t dismissive of it,\u201d Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said of the proposal put forward by Collins. McCain is one of a group of senators working with Collins on the plan. \u201cBut he has his positions, which are well known.\u201d\n\nMcCain added, however, that the sides were still \u201ca long way\u201d from a final agreement.\n\nCollins told reporters the president expressed interest in aspects of her plan but had not endorsed any proposals. She described Friday\u2019s conversation as constructive. But, she said, \u201cI\u2019m concerned we still don\u2019t have an agreement on a specific plan.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney also suggested that the conversation with Senate Republicans had been productive but that the president had not pledged support for any single plan. He also reiterated the president\u2019s position that Republicans cannot \u201cdemand a ransom from the American people in return for not defaulting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say that a number of lawmakers in the Senate as well as the House have expressed views that are constructive, in our estimation,\u201d Carney said during his daily press briefing when asked about Collins\u2019 plan. \u201cSenator Collins is one of them. But I\u2019m not going to evaluate from here a specific proposal beyond what I\u2019ve said thus far.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s negotiations came on the 11th day of a partial shutdown and less than one week before Oct. 17, which federal Treasury officials estimate is the final day they will have enough cash to pay all the government\u2019s bills. Economists, business leaders and financial experts warn that defaulting on the national debt could have catastrophic consequences on the economy in the U.S. and around the globe.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., acknowledged that he went into the White House meeting with somewhat low expectations.\n\n\u201cBut I left there feeling it was very useful and constructive,\u201d Corker said. \u201cAnd it lent to sort of an understanding where the various camps are and, I think, an understanding of where the sweet spot might be to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nAlthough one of several proposals floated by both sides, Collins\u2019 plan appears to be gaining favor among her Republican colleagues in the Senate. Collins said she is fielding increasing calls from Democrats interested in learning more about the plan, but Democrats remained quiet on the proposal Friday.\n\nSen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said she was withholding judgment until she learns more about the plan, which she said has not been distributed broadly.\n\n\u201cI hear different things about it, so I don\u2019t want to comment until I see it,\u201d Boxer said.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting followed a much smaller gathering at the White House on Thursday night between Obama and House Republican leaders. Boehner and others laid out their proposal to extend the debt ceiling \u2013 the country\u2019s $16.7 trillion borrowing limit \u2013 by six weeks, a time frame that Democrats have rejected as too short.\n\nHouse Republicans are now developing plans to also end the partial government shutdown as part of a package that includes cuts in benefit programs. The Associated Press reported that Obama spoke to Boehner on the phone Friday after he met with Senate Republicans about their potentially competing plans to end the shutdown.\n\nThe spate of meetings along with encouraging statements from lawmakers buoyed hopes that the stalemate between Republicans, Democrats and the White House may be softening.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re back here to actually work on trying to get a solution on a bipartisan basis,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said after returning to the Capitol, according to The Associated Press.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers remain on furlough \u2013 and hundreds of thousands more are working without pay \u2013 because of the shutdown prompted by conservative Republicans\u2019 attempt to link funding for government operations to the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have passed numerous piecemeal approaches to fund specific government functions, but Democrats have rejected most of those.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has proposed lifting the debt ceiling by $1 trillion through the end of 2014 and may bring that bill up for an initial vote Saturday. But Republicans have said their caucus is unwilling to go along with such a large increase without concessions on spending.\n\nThe plan developed by Collins and other senators is a mix of previous proposals intended to win bipartisan support but that would require concessions on both sides. Several news reports suggested that Collins is also working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, but a spokesman for Manchin declined to comment.\n\nThe current version would extend the debt ceiling through the end of January and reopen federal offices by funding the government for six months at an annual rate of $986 billion. That is a level that Republicans say is consistent with congressional budget controls and maintains the sequestration budget cuts.\n\nDemocrats, who want to end or replace the sequestration cuts, grudgingly agreed to the figure only recently. Collins\u2019 plan would give federal agencies more flexibility to implement the cuts.\n\nBut the proposal also calls for delaying a 2.3 percent tax on medical equipment and devices included within the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a change from an earlier version that called for repealing the tax.\n\nThe Senate has already voted to eliminate the tax, which businesses strongly oppose and critics predict will cost jobs. The tax does not relate directly to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s primary mission \u2013 to lower the number of uninsured individuals nationwide. But Democrats have since resisted Republican attempts to use budget negotiations to change the health care act.\n\nThe tax also helps finance the health care law, an issue that Boxer raised when asked about Democratic support for eliminating or delaying the tax.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to us is that it is deficit neutral and that it doesn\u2019t bust the budget,\u201d Boxer said.\n\nCollins proposes to offset the $30 billion loss from repealing the tax by allowing companies with fixed pension plans to temporarily lower contributions to pension funds when interest rates are low in anticipation of higher rates later on. The \u201cpension smoothing\u201d would result in higher tax revenues to the federal government by lowering companies\u2019 deductions.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, estimated that Collins\u2019 presentation only took five or 10 minutes during the roughly 90-minute meeting at the White House on Friday. But Hatch said Collins \u201chad done us all a big favor by having the courage to come up with\u201d a proposal.\n\nAsked if he believes the Collins proposal is the most likely path to an agreement, Hatch responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. That\u2019s just one of them.\u201d\n\nMcCain predicted that some change to the medical device tax \u2013 whether a repeal or a delay \u2013 \u201cwill probably be part of any agreement\u201d because both sides have opposed the tax in the past.\n\nThe round of White House meetings comes as Republicans are feeling more heat on the shutdown. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed that 53 percent of respondents blamed Republicans for the government shutdown, compared to 31 percent blaming Obama. Just 24 percent of those polled had a positive view of the Republican Party, compared to 39 percent for Democrats. The poll suggests Obama\u2019s standing with Americans has risen slightly.\n\nMcCain, who has been a vocal critic of House Republican strategy linking government funding to the health care act, called the polls \u201cdevastating\u201d and said of his House counterparts, \u201cI know they are reading the polls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do need to reopen government and we do need to deal with the debt limit,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI believe that the plan that I put forward is increasingly attracting interest from members on both sides of the aisle, based on what I am hearing.\u201d\n\nKevin Miller can be reached at (207) 317-6256 or at: [email protected] Twitter: KevinMillerDC", "article_metadata": {"description": "The plan appears to gain her party\u2019s support, but neither the president nor conservative House Republicans immediately endorse it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The plan appears to gain her party\u2019s support, but neither the president nor conservative House Republicans immediately endorse it.", "title": "Susan Collins pitches plan to end shutdown, raise debt limit - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 782, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/306854-2013susancollins2.1012.jpg", "height": 504}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2013/10/11/collins__colleagues_bring_shutdown_proposal_to_white_house/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The plan appears to gain her party\u2019s support, but neither the president nor conservative House Republicans immediately endorse it.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/306854-2013susancollins2.1012.jpg", "title": "Susan Collins pitches plan to end shutdown, raise debt limit - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2013-10-11T17:36:53-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbde\"", "article_summary": "Collins\u2019 plan would continue the automatic sequester cuts but allow more flexibility in how they can be applied.\nFriday\u2019s meeting followed a much smaller gathering at the White House on Thursday night between Obama and House Republican leaders.\nAdditional Photos Sen.
