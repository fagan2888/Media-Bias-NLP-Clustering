With Crosby laying on the ice, Dubinsky delivered an additional cross-check to Crosby\u2019s back, breaking his stick in the process.\n\nCrosby left the game and went through the NHL\u2019s concussion protocol, but returned at the start of the third period.\n\nIn a video produced by the NHL, department of player safety director Patrick Burke stated:\n\n\u201cWhile Dubinsky\u2019s cross-check is not overly violent or forceful, it is an intentional strike to an opponent\u2019s head using his stick. This is not a case where the head contact was caused by a sudden head movement by Crosby or by a stick riding up a player\u2019s back or shoulders and making subsequent contact with the head. In addition, once Crosby is down and no longer an offensive threat, Dubinsky delivers an additional cross-check to his body.\u201d\n\nThe video noted that Dubinsky has been fined twice in his career for supplemental discipline reasons but he has \u201cno relevant history\u201d for being what the NHL considers a repeat offender. Burke also noted Crosby suffered \u201cno apparent injury on the play.\u201d\n\nDubinsky will forfeit $31,451.61 in salary as a result of the suspension.\n\nCrosby was in the lineup for the Penguins\u2019 home game Saturday against Edmonton. Coach Mike Johnston said Crosby, who has a history of head and neck injuries, cleared all exams from the team\u2019s medical staff.\n\nJohnston was diplomatic when asked if the length of Dubinsky\u2019s suspension was sufficient.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know because most of us never see the different situations the NHL [department of player safety] is presented with on a nightly basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe different checks and the different scenarios that they have to equate to what\u2019s one game, what\u2019s two games, what\u2019s three games.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like the hit. I didn\u2019t like the cross-check in the back of the [neck]. I think anytime you target the head, it should be a suspension. He got suspended, so I presume it was for the right time.\u201d\n\nFleury backs up defense\n\nThe Penguins\u2019 2-1 loss Friday at Columbus ended a run of five consecutive games in which they allowed three or more goals.\n\nGoalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who finished with 41 saves, deserved most of the credit for that, though, as the Penguins\u2019 overall defensive work has slipped a bit from the level it routinely reached in the early weeks of the season.\n\nAt least for the moment, though, the Penguins don\u2019t seem especially worried.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a cause for concern,\u201d defenseman Rob Scuderi said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\nWinger Pascal Dupuis said there is \u201cdefinitely not\u201d a major structural issue that the Penguins must repair, although Scuderi cited a trend that has developed lately.\n\n\u201cA lot of the goals have come on the rush, and that\u2019s usually something you have to fix in the neutral zone, or the offensive zone,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of our issues right now are maybe coming from a puck decision on the offensive side, and they\u2019re scoring on the rush.\u201d\n\nSeth Rorabaugh: srorabaugh@post-gazette.com and Twitter @emptynetters.
