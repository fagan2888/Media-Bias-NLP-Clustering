(AP) - Rural hospitals are facing a financial crisis that threatens many Mississippians\u2019 access to doctors, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the state Board of Health.\n\nWith increased government costs and drastic cuts in Medicare, \u201ca lot of the rural hospitals aren\u2019t going to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cMost have low censuses, with poor, elderly and vulnerable patients and are barely making money.\u201d\n\nWith Mississippi opting out of the Medicaid expansion allowed by the Affordable Care Act, hospitals are getting none of the money that would have come with it. Overall, the state would have brought in an additional $2.1 billion, netting the state $431 million, according to a study by The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nInstead, Lampton said, hospitals are still having to pay the additional costs of the new regulations, which some have estimated as high as billions nationally.\n\nHe said many rural hospitals in Mississippi are hurting, with some slashing operational costs and laying off employees. Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center of McComb recently announced hundreds of layoffs.\n\nAsked to assess his hospital\u2019s future, Emmett C. Hennessey, CEO of Beacham Memorial Hospital in Magnolia, replied with one word: \u201cBleak.\u201d\n\nA decade or so ago, all Mississippi hospitals were \u201cmaking good money,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment reimbursements to make Medicaid payments equal Medicare payments totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars then, he said.\n\nNow, \u201cthe government is giving us federal funds we\u2019re entitled to, but they\u2019re charging us a tax on it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were $30,000 in the hole on that one transaction.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of \u201cunfunded mandates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have three RNs and an LPN that are doing the reporting the federal government requires. They have nothing to do with patient care.\u201d\n\nRural hospitals have also been hurt by cuts in reimbursements, totaling $170 billion in recent years, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nNationally, hospitals have an $8 billion shortfall from Medicaid reimbursements, a $24 billion shortfall from Medicare reimbursements and a $41 billion shortfall from uncompensated care, according to the association.\n\nHennessey said Medicare reimbursement rates are so terrible now \u201cthe Mayo Clinic is not taking Medicare anymore - the Mayo Clinic.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Mayo stopped accepting Medicare patients at one of its primary care clinics in Arizona as part of a two-year pilot program to determine if it should also drop Medicare patients at other facilities in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. It cited an $840 million loss in 2009 from treating Medicare patients because of the program\u2019s low reimbursement rates.\n\nToday, the Mayo Clinic provides medical services to Medicare patients but doesn\u2019t accept the Medicare-approved payment amount as full payment, making the Medicare patient financially responsible for the portion above the Medicare allowable amount, according to its website.\n\nHospitals get 89 cents for every $1 spent on Medicaid and 86 cents for every $1 spent on Medicare, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nTo make it worse, Hennessey said, medical care is being run, not by the doctors, but by the bureaucrats.\n\nThey decide how much, or even if, a patient\u2019s care will be covered, making it almost impossible to get approval for emergency surgery, he said. \u201cIf they say no, I eat it.\u201d\n\nMendal Kemp, program director for the Mississippi Hospital Association\u2019s Center for Rural Health, said some rural hospitals are aligning with bigger hospitals to survive.\n\nThirty-two rural hospitals in Mississippi have signed up as critical access hospitals, which promises them cost, plus 1 percent, payments from the federal government.\n\nBut Kemp said cuts to that funding could come if another government sequestration takes place.\n\nThe hospital association, he said, is pushing lawmakers to \u201cease the burden on hospitals so that the staff can spend more time and money caring for patients.\u201d\n\nDr. Aaron Shirley, chairman of the Jackson Medical Mall, said if he had his wish, \u201cwe would take politics out of it and get it down to need and being a Christian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like to put \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 on signs. It would be nice if we carried that Christian doctrine throughout what we do every day.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rural hospitals are facing a financial crisis that threatens many Mississippians' access to doctors, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the state Board of Health.", "Author": "JERRY MITCHELL", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/6/rural-hospitals-align-with-larger-ones-to-survive/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Rural hospitals are facing a financial crisis that threatens many Mississippians\u2019 access to doctors, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the state Board of Health.", "title": "Rural hospitals align with larger ones to survive"}, "twitter": {"title": "Rural hospitals align with larger ones to survive", "description": "Rural hospitals are facing a financial crisis that threatens many Mississippians' access to doctors, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the state Board of Health.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Medicare, Emmett C Hennessey, Luke Lampton"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddac5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf they say no, I eat it.\u201dMendal Kemp, program director for the Mississippi Hospital Association\u2019s Center for Rural Health, said some rural hospitals are aligning with bigger hospitals to survive.\nWith increased government costs and drastic cuts in Medicare, \u201ca lot of the rural hospitals aren\u2019t going to survive,\u201d he said.\nThirty-two rural hospitals in Mississippi have signed up as critical access hospitals, which promises them cost, plus 1 percent, payments from the federal government.\nHe said many rural hospitals in Mississippi are hurting, with some slashing operational costs and laying off employees.\n(AP) - Rural hospitals are facing a financial crisis that threatens many Mississippians\u2019 access to doctors, said Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the state Board of Health."}
