Burwell two days ago represent a great victory over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. But they\u2019re blowing smoke. In fact, they\u2019ve surrendered on the crucial issue.\n\nThat issue is whether it violates the non-profits\u2019 religious liberty for the government to compel their insurance companies to provide free coverage for contraceptive services mandated by the ACA. If the Supreme Court were to find that it does, then the government would effectively be precluded from ensuring that the non-profits\u2019 female employees receive the coverage.\n\nIn January, the non-profits told the court that such was the case: \u201cPetitioners object to hiring or maintaining a relationship with any insurance company that is authorized, obligated, or incentivized to deliver the objectionable coverage to Petitioners\u2019 own employees or students in connection with Petitioners\u2019 own health plans, regardless of how that authority, obligation, or incentive is \u2018triggered.'\u201d\n\nAt the oral argument in March, this position was reiterated by the non-profits\u2019 lawyers. Ways in which contraceptive coverage could be provided without the objectionable triggering were listed by attorney Paul Clement as \u201cthrough the [ACA] Exchanges, through Title X, through an Aetna uber-policy where everybody gets their contraceptives.\u201d Not, that is, via whichever insurance company the non-profit happens to have engaged.\n\nWhat followed was the court\u2019s request for supplementary briefs to answer two questions:\n\nThe parties are directed to file supplemental briefs that address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners\u2019 employees through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees. Petitioners with insured plans are currently required to submit a form either to their insurer or to the Federal Government (naming petitioners\u2019 insurance company), stating that petitioners object on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage. The parties are directed to address whether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners\u2019 employees, through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners.\n\nAnd what was the response of the non-profits\u2019 in their supplementary brief? Here\u2019s the critical paragraph.\n\nIn sum, there is no need to demand any separate certification or notice from the petitioner in order to effectuate a scheme in which any of the petitioner\u2019s employees who want contraceptive coverage can get it from the same insurance company with which the petitioner contracts. The government can obligate, incentivize, or contract with the insurance company to offer separate contraceptive coverage to employees who do not receive any coverage from their employer without any involvement by the petitioner \u201cbeyond [its] own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to [its] employees.\u201d\n\nIn other words, so far as the non-profits are concerned, it\u2019s now OK to require the insurance companies they contract with to cover the contraceptive services. Their January objection \u201cto hiring or maintaining a relationship with any insurance company that is authorized, obligated or incentivized to deliver the objectionable coverage\u201d is null and void.\n\nStanford law professor Michael McConnell, a former federal appeals judge who has been one of the non-profits\u2019 staunchest supporters, blew the smoke this way: \u201cIn truth, the conflict is over whether the petitioners can be forced to file forms that the government deems to be authorizations to use their health plan as the infrastructure for the provision of contraceptive coverage. Now, the Court has asked a logical question: Why is it necessary for the petitioners to sign such a thing?\u201d\n\nIndeed, the court will have to decide precisely how petitioners (the non-profits) will give their notification. That question, the court\u2019s second, remains to be answered. But on the crucial first question \u2014 whether the insurance companies can be required to provide the contraceptive coverage, the non-profits now concede that they can. That\u2019s the surrender.\n\nUpdate: Don\u2019t believe me?
