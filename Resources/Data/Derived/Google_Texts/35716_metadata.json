But one village in particular may be able to teach us the secret to an especially long life.\n\nAccording to NPR, the town of Acciaroli on the Mediterranean coast south of Naples is home to nearly 300 people who are over 100 years old. Amazingly, that\u2019s one third of the village\u2019s total population.\n\nAlan Maisel, MD, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, is part of a team of researchers launching a study to try to figure out what the people of Acciaroli are doing so right. But Dr. Maisel\u2019s got a hunch: He suspects their longevity is due to a combination of good genes and healthy eating.\n\nOn a recent visit to Acciaroli, Dr. Maisel noted two dietary habits all the residents had in common. \u201cEverybody ate anchovies,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cAlso, every meal, they have the plant rosemary in almost everything they cook with.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to living longer, these foods can\u2019t hurt. Anchovies contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids; while rosemary has long been considered a healing herb, and may help soothe sore muscles, beat bloat, and perhaps even protect you from carcinogenic compounds.\n\nDr. Maisel also observed that Acciaroli\u2019s residents don\u2019t seem overly preoccupied with exercise. \u201cWhat shocked me is that I don\u2019t see people jogging,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not see people in active exercise classes. I don\u2019t see them swimming laps in the ocean.\u201d\n\nBut the slower pace in Acciaroli could have its own perks. Recent studies have found that people who have a positive attitude and live purposeful, happy lives do indeed tend to live longer.\n\n\u201cIn the evenings, in the late afternoon, [the locals are] all sitting around the cantinas, the restaurants. They\u2019re having some wine, some coffee,\u201d Dr. Maisel told NPR. \u201cThey\u2019re relaxed.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Health.com.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Leisurely meals, beautiful scenery, great wine\u2014Italians pretty much have the good life figured out.
