Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Taylon — who is terminally ill with brain cancer — got the chance of a lifetime. The brave young girl danced with singer Beyoncé on her Mrs. Carter Tour stop in Las Vegas, Nev., this month. "They found an inoperable tumor on her brain, and her dying wish was to dance with Beyoncé," said Ivy McGregor, of Philanthropy Program Partnerships in the video posted on Beyoncé’s YouTube.

"I am having so much fun. I can't wait to see Beyoncé,” Taylon said. And some time later, her wish came true. In a tight-fitting, blue sequined jumpsuit, Beyoncé came down from the stage, hugged, and kissed Taylon, who was seated stage-side in a wheelchair. The singer even wiped the girl’s tears as she returned to the stage to perform her next song. Fittingly, she sang the Destiny’s Child hit “Survivor,” and Taylon rose from her seat to sing along. They danced together, and Taylon was visibly moved by the singer’s tribute.

The women from Philanthropy Program partnerships, who accompanied Taylon to the show, were equally moved.

"Here's a little girl literally fighting for her life," McGregor said. "'Tomorrow's not promised, next week's not promised, but right now I'm here,' and her thought that will forever stay with me is 'since I'm here I might as well live.'"
