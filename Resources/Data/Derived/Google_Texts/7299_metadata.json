Plenty of players did, most notably Bernd Wiesberger. The 28-year-old Austrian provided the biggest surprise of the round, shooting a 65 that put him in the final group of a major for the first time.\n\nShoot, this is only the second time he\u2019s ever made a cut at a major.\n\n\u201cThis is a dream come true,\u201d said Wiesberger, a regular on the European Tour. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of myself, the way I played today. This is a completely new situation for me.\u201d\n\nBeyond Wiesberger, there were plenty of players ready to take aim at McIlroy on what figures to be a wild final day on the rolling hills outside of Louisville.\n\nRickie Fowler was right in the mix again at another major, shooting a 67 that left him two shots behind McIlroy\u2019s 13-under 200. Fowler has been the runner-up at the last two majors, and finished fifth at the Masters. Maybe this is the week he finally breaks through.\n\nThen there\u2019s Phil Mickelson, who already has five major titles. Lefty hasn\u2019t won since the 2013 British Open \u2014 his longest drought since 2003 \u2014 but he\u2019s clearly back on his game. He birdied four of the last five holes for a 67 and was three shots off the pace.\n\n\u201cI needed to finish strong to get back in it,\u201d Mickelson said.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Jason Day was also three strokes behind, having lost some ground despite a 69 that included a barefooted shot. After hitting his drive left of a creek at No. 2, he had to take off his socks and shoes and roll up his pants to get across the water. He wound up saving par.\n\nStill, that was a rather pedestrian score in this round, with 37 players getting into the 60s. Hunter Mahan joined Weisberger with a 65, matching the best round of the week, and seven guys shot 66.\n\nAt one point, there was a five-way tie for the lead. When it was done, McIlroy was still on top but a dozen players were separated by only five shots, meaning the leader will have to work a little harder for this major than he did for the three first three championships.\n\nMcIlroy had runaway victories at the 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 PGA Championship, and took a six-shot lead to the final round of the British Open last month, hanging on for a two-stroke win that was never really in doubt.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mind a tougher challenge.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s stressful at times, but you\u2019ve got to enjoy it,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThis is the best position to be in at a golf tournament.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rory McIlroy shoots 67 to maintain 1-shot lead at PGA Championship", "title": "Rory McIlroy shoots 67 to maintain 1-shot lead at PGA Championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/09/rory-mcilroy-shoots-67-to-maintain-1-shot-lead-at-pga-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__glf-mcilroyp1.jpg", "height": 462}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__glf-mcilroyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-09T18:07:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:33:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81d7\"", "article_summary": "McIlroy finished off a 4-under 67 with an 8-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole, getting up-and-down from a bunker to maintain a one-shot advantage after the third round.\nMcIlroy had runaway victories at the 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 PGA Championship, and took a six-shot lead to the final round of the British Open last month, hanging on for a two-stroke win that was never really in doubt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the biggest lead I\u2019ve ever had, but I\u2019m still in control of this golf tournament,\u201d said McIlroy, who birdied three of the last four holes.\nRickie Fowler was right in the mix again at another major, shooting a 67 that left him two shots behind McIlroy\u2019s 13-under 200.\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 As Rory McIlroy watched the ball drop into the cup on his final stroke of the day, he pumped his right fist and managed a slight grin."}
