Is this true?\n\nHere\u2019s what our research about this viral email revealed:\n\nIt\u2019s Canadian: CGI Federal is a subsidiary of the Canadian firm CGI Group, which was founded in Quebec City in 1976 by two 26-year-olds, Serge Godin and Andre Imbeau, according to the company\u2019s website. CGI stands for \u201cConseillers en Gestion et Informatique,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cInformation Systems and Management Consultants.\u201d CGI Group has offices in 40 countries, including 66 branches in the U.S., the website states.\n\nPrinceton influence? Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president of CGI Federal, is a 1985 graduate of Princeton, according to a Princeton alumni magazine. Obama is also a 1985 graduate. There are numerous references to the \u201cpals\u201d in such conservative websites as the Daily Caller, which states that \u201cwhile at Princeton, Michelle Obama and Townes-Whitley were both active in the Organization of Black Unity and the Third World Center. They both now belong to the Association of Black Princeton Alumni.\u201d Not one of those websites say that the two were close friends, or that their \u201cfriendship\u201d impacted the selection of CGI.\n\nTownes-Whitley met with administration officials four times in 2013, according to White House visitor logs, which show she was alone but which do not specify a reason for the meetings. Her and her husband also attended a White House Christmas party in 2010 and had a photo taken with the Obamas. OpenSecrets.org, which tracks political contributions, shows that Townes-Whitley donated a total of $1,500 to Barack Obama in 2011 and 2012.\n\nMichelle Obama and Townes-Whitley obviously have met, but there\u2019s no evidence that they had an extremely close friendship.\n\nThe lone company? An Oct. 17 Reuters piece quoted by TruthOrFiction.com states that the contract originally had 31 bidders. The article said, \u201cThe work on Healthcare.gov grew out of a contract for open-ended technology services first issued in 2007 with a place-holder value of $1,000. There were 31 bidders. An extension, awarded in September 2011 specifically to build Healthcare.gov, drew four bidders, the documents show, including CGI Federal.\u201d\n\nA recent story by Bloomberg News said the race to get the exchange website up by Oct. 1 spurred the Obama administration to use an expedited bidding system that limited its choice of a builder to just four companies, including CGI. The other bidders haven\u2019t been publicly identified. No red flags were raised by any of those bidders, the story stated.\n\nCGI had two years to create the website, which cut as much as nine months from the time usually required to build such a site, said Rod Benson, a former procurement director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the website.\n\n\u201cI am sure there are companies that looked at this specific opportunity and said, \u2018you know, I\u2019ve got other things in the pipeline,\u2019 \u201d said Larry Allen, president of Allen Federal Business Partners, a McLean, Va., consulting firm.\n\nHow CGI was selected has not been divulged, but there are congressional committees looking into it. A total of 13.5 percent of CGI\u2019s work is for the government, so there is history there. CGI had earlier worked for CMS on the medicare.gov website among other projects, the Bloomberg News article pointed out.\n\nObama donor: The viral email claims that CGI Federal donated $47 million to Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. A check of OpenSecrets.org, which tracks political contributions, shows that CGI donated $128,000 to federal candidates; 52 percent of those recipients were Republicans. OpenSecrets.org also shows that CGI President George Schindler donated $1,000 to the Obama re-election campaign on Aug. 13, 2012, as well as $1,000 to Virginia Democratic Rep. Jim Moran on March 29, 2011, and $1,000 to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on July 5, 2011. Schindler also gave $2,300 to Republican John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign on Dec. 18, 2007.
