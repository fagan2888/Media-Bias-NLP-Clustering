( Charlotte Burrous / Daily Record )\n\nThey've been working out of their basement for awhile. Now that the Affordable Healthcare Act has gone into affect, Robin and Patrick Slawson recently opened Ca\u00f1on Health Insurance Associates, LLC at 831 Royal Gorge Blvd., Ste. 429.\n\nHe has his license since 2000 while Robin has had hers since 2004.\n\n\"We decided to venture out on our own in the health insurance field, especially with the new Obamacare,\" Patrick said. \"We specialize in individual coverage through the Affordable Care Act, as well as direct from the carriers. We also do small and large.\"\n\nOriginally scheduled to open Oct. 1, the office opened a month later.\n\n\"We're not just health insurance,\" Patrick said. \"We (offer) full blown benefits for small groups and large groups.\"\n\nCa\u00f1on Health also offers dental to both small and large groups as well as individuals and supplemental insurance with Aflac, such as cancer, accident, disability and life insurance.\n\n\"We work with all the major carriers in Colorado,\" Patrick said. \"I specialize in the supplemental end of things. Robin specializes in major medical health insurance.\"\n\nTo prepare for the new healthcare law, Robin attended 20 classes to become certified with Connect for Health Colorado, which is Colorado's market place for the new healthcare law.\n\n\"Even if they go through the government site, once they go through their state, it automatically directs them to the Connect for Health Colorado website, which has a lot of information,\" Robin said. \"It can be a little overwhelming to navigate when you're not used to it. That's what we're here for. They don't have to pay anymore premium for our services. The carrier takes care of that. If they have a question, that's what we're here for.\"\n\nIf they need help enrolling, the couple also provides that service and will meet with people at their homes, as well.\n\n\"We've got two computers to get on and go through the enrollment with the customers if they want to come in,\" Patrick said.\n\nCa\u00f1on Health Insurance Associates, LLC is open from 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Monday through Friday.
