Many submitters are now sending us preview links prior to the campaign lunch. We love this and it is great! But we get a ton of submissions and sometimes it is a bit tough to keep up. Please be certain to email us once the campaign has launched as a reminder. While we cannot guarantee we will cover all of these crowdfunding campaigns we promise to look at each and everyone.\n\nThis is an all Kickstarter Mailbox this week. First we have the TriClops, a high intensity light that, while having many different uses \u2013 I am currently sizing this up for my mountain bike. Riding at night can be fun but a bit dicey. Especially if you cannot see where you are going. TriClops is perfect for biking as it generates lumens ranging from 40 to 2,500; this means it is really bright. The TriClops uses 10 Watt LEDs to generate the light. It is compact and easy to attach to just about anything. The campaign states it is GoPro compatible too. Crowdfunding on Kickstarter now, three brothers from Texas are looking to raise $40,000. This one is a Kickstarter Staff pick \u2013 watch the pitch video and you will see why.\n\nHarold Holt was Prime Minister of Australia back in 1967. This is way before my cognizant time but Holt only lasted 22 months in office as he mysteriously disappeared, apparently while swimming, never to be seen ever again. If you jump back in time, this was a period of a great global fear as the Soviet Union was on the rise and communism was a dominant political concern. Between the cold war, intrigue and innuendo you have all the makings for a great conspiracy theory. Well crowdfunding on Kickstarter now is an effort to raise funds for a live short film. Sounds fascinating to me. Have you guys considered a feature film? There are lots of big names involved with this project by Scott Mannion as he seeks to find the Holt Truth.\n\nRedHeads. You gotta love \u2019em. Two redhead sisters Adrienne and Stephanie Vendetti have started a unique business for all things redhead. They organized a Rock it Like a RedHead event in NYC and it was a big success.

Since our 1st event, they have received thousands of requests about visiting cities all over the globe. Adrienne and Stephanie want to empower redheads everywhere. And now you can help. The Kickstarter campaign is looking to raise $15,000 now.\n\nTriClops is the smallest and most versatile HID Lighting Technology designed specifically for use with all GoPro accessories.\n\n\u201cPatent Pending\u201d TriClops will go anywhere you need a HID (high intensity display) light source. With 3 powerful 10W LEDs capable of delivering up to 2500 lumens where will you go?\n\nA Cold War thriller that exposes the conspiracy behind Prime Minster Holt\u2019s disappearance in 1967. Starring John Noble (Fringe, LOTR).\n\nThis is not a documentary, it\u2019s a live action espionage short film made in the spirit of John le Carr\u00e9.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n1967, the Cold War.\n\nIn the days preceding the mysterious disappearance of Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, paranoia has engulfed the conservative government.\n\nRock it like a Redhead are live, red carpet beauty/fashion events for redheads.
