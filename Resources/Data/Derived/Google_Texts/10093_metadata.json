The other two, Fleming, 52, and Kelleher, 57, may be too old to be CEO when Gorman retires, management experts and Morgan Stanley insiders said. Fleming has been approached for other CEO spots, and may tire of waiting to head up Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"You just can't anticipate that people who are high potential and seasoned are going to wait, so it is critical to have at least two generations of candidates that are being developed,\" said Jane Stevenson, who runs the CEO succession practice for executive search firm Korn Ferry.\n\nKelleher and Fleming are involved with long-term succession planning within their respective businesses, and aware that neither may be the next CEO of Morgan Stanley, a person familiar with the matter said. They still play important roles because if the unexpected happens - if Gorman becomes ill or gets injured or cannot continue in his role for some reason - either would be qualified to take his place immediately.\n\nOne main player in the organization is Ted Pick, the 46-year-old global head of equities and research, whose business has blossomed and made up for lost revenue from a declining focus on fixed-income trading. Sources inside Morgan Stanley widely expect him to move into bigger roles.\n\nGorman has also made several moves to beef up the ranks of possible successors, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gorman named Porat's replacement: Jonathan Pruzan, 46, an investment banker who co-heads Morgan Stanley's financial institutions group.\n\nThe bank also announced executive changes last week. It added investment banking and trading executive Clare Woodman to the operating committee and marketing executive Mandell Crawley, 39, and investor relations head Kathleen McCabe, 42, to its management committee.\n\nMorgan Stanley also shuffled three executives - Andy Saperstein, 48, Raj Dhanda, 47, and Mohit Assomull, 41 - into new roles across wealth management and institutional securities.\n\nEric Heaton, who runs the private bank and is working to build Morgan Stanley's loan book, and Celeste Brown, 38, the bank's newly appointed treasurer and former head of investor relations, are also viewed as relatively young heavy hitters in the organization. Ages for Woodman and Heaton were not public but bank sources estimated that they are in their 40s.\n\nExecutives named in this story either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGorman himself became CEO in the aftermath of the financial crisis, a time when the bank was making a huge strategic shift to focus less on risky trading activities and more on the wealth management business where Gorman spent much of his Wall Street career.\n\nSome insiders had believed Gorman might formally appoint either Fleming or Kelleher as his No. 2, by naming one as president for example. But sources at the bank now say that is unlikely to happen because such a move would signal to other executives that they do not have a chance at the CEO job any time soon.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Henry; Editing by Grant McCool)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley bid adieu to another senior executive who was thou", "title": "Morgan Stanley nurtures new brood of bankers in CEO succession plan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/03/24/Morgan-Stanley-nurtures-new-brood-bankers-CEO-succession-plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/morgan-stanley-results_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/03/24/Morgan-Stanley-nurtures-new-brood-bankers-CEO-succession-plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/morgan-stanley-results_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley bid adieu to another senior executive who was thou", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Fleming has been approached for other CEO spots, and may tire of waiting to head up Morgan Stanley.\nSources inside Morgan Stanley widely expect him to move into bigger roles.\nThe other two, Fleming, 52, and Kelleher, 57, may be too old to be CEO when Gorman retires, management experts and Morgan Stanley insiders said.\nMorgan Stanley also shuffled three executives - Andy Saperstein, 48, Raj Dhanda, 47, and Mohit Assomull, 41 - into new roles across wealth management and institutional securities.\nKelleher and Fleming are involved with long-term succession planning within their respective businesses, and aware that neither may be the next CEO of Morgan Stanley, a person familiar with the matter said."}
