The "Fast Money" traders give you 5 names to buy in the healthcare sector.

After the Treasury Department unveiled new measures to curb corporate tax inversions Thursday, "Fast Money" traders did not fret over the end of a possible Pfizer and Allergan combination.

Inversions take place when a company completes a transaction, then changes its tax address to an overseas location to potentially reduce tax rates. When Ireland-based Allergan and New York City-based Pfizer confirmed they were in talks in recent weeks, it raised questions about a potential inversion.
