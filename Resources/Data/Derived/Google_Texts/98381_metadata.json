(AP) - Alex Wilcox passively stands, eyes darting around at the scene, her shy nature overwhelmed.\n\nWhy are all these people here for me?\n\nIt\u2019s something that still feels unnatural, a month after it all began with a doctor telling a 16-year-old something anyone would dread: You have cancer.\n\nSince, near-strangers have sent her uplifting messages. T-shirts and bracelets have appeared around town lifting up her name. Hugs and smiles have so consumed her that it\u2019s as if the community is trying to love the cancer away.\n\nIt definitely left her antsy a week ago when more than 50 players showed up in Brantley for a softball clinic. Three NCAA Division I head coaches were there, too.\n\nAll for her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Wilcox said, surveying the scene before her.\n\n\u201cI would have never expected this.\u201d\n\nWilcox is almost embarrassed at the attention generated since a doctor gave her and her family such a big surprise Christmas Day.\n\nAt the moment some 16-year-olds may have found a set of car keys under their tree, Wilcox was a week into a hospital stay at Montgomery\u2019s Baptist East.\n\nA pain in her right side a week earlier persisted long enough - and painfully enough - that she went to a doctor in Luverne.\n\n\u201cThe night before, we were watching a movie and she said it hurt real bad,\u201d said Kassidy Wilcox, Alex\u2019s younger sister by two years. \u201cEvery time she moved, it hurt.\u201d\n\nAlex suspected appendicitis when she slid into a CT scan. Soon after leaving it, she was quickly dispatched by ambulance to Montgomery.\n\nMore tests and waiting followed - appendicitis isn\u2019t this severe, is it? - with one procedure where Wilcox was sure they \u201cdrained like two liters of fluid.\u201d\n\nSqueamish of needles, Wilcox soon was able to quickly offer an arm for twice-daily blood tests.\n\nInstead of wrapping presents, she was stuck in a hospital when Santa Claus made his rounds and Christmas gave way to another C-word.\n\nIt hit like a load of coal.\n\nCancer.\n\nWilcox, five months after getting her driver\u2019s license, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can explain it,\u201d mom LeAnn Wilcox said, describing her initial reaction.\n\nThe shock wore off, as much as it could, and the family found serenity in Alex\u2019s reaction.\n\nIn summary: God wouldn\u2019t give this to me if I couldn\u2019t handle it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, but I know everything will be OK,\u201d Alex said. \u201cSometimes, I may wonder, \u2018Why me?\u2019 but maybe it\u2019s something I can use to be an inspiration to other people.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t emotionally shattered and she shed no tears, though ovarian cancer is something so rarely faced by a teen.\n\nHalf of those diagnosed with ovarian cancer are 63 or older and is rare before 40, according to the American Cancer Society. Wilcox, again, is 16.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been unbelievably strong compared to me,\u201d mom LeAnn Wilcox said. \u201cI know it sounds weird, but I look to her for strength.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, on Dec. 27, Alex checked out of the hospital and lugged herself - her sore self - through the door of her room at home to another surprise.\n\nThis one pleasant.\n\nHer Brantley softball teammates, the ones she helped lead to a state championship each of the last two seasons, had decorated her room to celebrate her return.\n\nWilcox could only smile.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t move a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI told everyone that I felt old because I couldn\u2019t get up and do anything by myself.\u201d\n\nOnce word of her cancer spread, the community marshaled its forces, too, in a way only a small town could.\n\nThere are two T-shirts available. There\u2019s also a bracelet that cajoles readers to \u201cpray for Alex.\u201d\n\nProceeds from sales go to support Alex\u2019s medical expenses.\n\nLast weekend, the benefit softball clinic featured the entire coaching staff from Mississippi State, plus coaches from Troy, South Alabama and Dothan\u2019s Wallace State Community College.\n\n(The family has insurance, LeAnn said, though co-pays and other expenses are currently unknown. Regardless, dad Shaun, mom and daughters are appreciative.)\n\n\u201cEveryone in Brantley and from around the area has been so supportive,\u201d Alex said. \u201cSo many people have sent me letters or messages on Facebook. There have been signs at basketball games.\u201d\n\nAlex verbally committed to Mississippi State when she was a Brantley freshman. Due to her status as a \u201cpotential recruit,\u201d the NCAA had to issue a waiver to allow MSU, Troy and South Alabama coaches to attend the clinic.\n\nBecause Wilcox is a \u201cpotential recruit,\u201d MSU coach Vann Stuedeman - a Huntingdon College Hall of Famer - declined comment, citing NCAA rules.\n\n\u201cWe knew some coaches were coming (to the clinic), but we were overwhelmed when an entire staff shows up,\u201d LeAnn Wilcox said. \u201cWe love Mississippi State.\n\n\u201cEvery time we go over there, it\u2019s a wonderful atmosphere and we love it.\u201d\n\nWilcox starts chemotherapy Feb. 8 and the treatment plan is due to last 9-12 weeks. Doctors have not addressed if the cancer will affect Alex\u2019s ability to have a family, LeAnn said.\n\nBut Alex doesn\u2019t plan for all this to interrupt her junior softball season.\n\nBut Wilcox extracted one promise from her oncologist and, based on the interest she\u2019s already expressed to coach Cindy Hawthorne in this year\u2019s Brantley Bulldogs, it\u2019s something she\u2019ll use.\n\nIf she feels OK, she can play.\n\nThe season opener is Feb. 29. The state tournament is May 18-21 at Lagoon Park.\n\n\u201cI told Coach Hawthorne that they can\u2019t slack up or anything,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t slack up if I was out there, so I wouldn\u2019t expect them to if I\u2019m not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll still be there. I may not play (some days), but I\u2019ll still be there.\u201d\n\nHer name, along with those of the other players on Brantley\u2019s state championship teams, is already on the fence of the school\u2019s softball field.\n\nTwice.\n\nWhile everyone around her is obviously focused on the cancer, Wilcox - at least outwardly - is fixated on a third banner. And maybe a fourth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do what we can to help her get through this,\u201d LeAnn Wilcox said. \u201cShe\u2019ll look back one day years from now and she\u2019ll have a good story to tell.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alex Wilcox passively stands, eyes darting around at the scene, her shy nature overwhelmed.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/6/brantley-teen-overwhelmed-with-support-before-canc/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Alex Wilcox passively stands, eyes darting around at the scene, her shy nature overwhelmed.", "title": "Brantley teen overwhelmed with support before cancer fight"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Alex Wilcox passively stands, eyes darting around at the scene, her shy nature overwhelmed.", "card": "summary", "title": "Brantley teen overwhelmed with support before cancer fight"}, "Author": "A.
