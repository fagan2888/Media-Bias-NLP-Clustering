This means that there is a bit of a debt spiral post 2025 or so. But it\u2019s still nothing like the rhetoric.\n\nNick Bunker notes an important point about the CBO\u2019s new long-term fiscal projections (pdf): The budget office has marked down its estimate of long-term interest rates, reflecting the growing evidence for a secular downshift in the \u201cnatural\u201d rate.\n\nThis markdown has the effect of making the budget outlook \u2014 which was already a lot less dire than conventional wisdom has it \u2014 look even less dire. But there\u2019s a further point worth emphasizing: the CBO has just declared an end to the debt spiral.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard the story: the more debt we have, the more we pay in interest, so the bigger the deficit, and the faster debt grows, until boom, we\u2019ve turned into Greece, Greece I tell you.\n\nNow, if you knew the arithmetic, you knew that this wasn\u2019t as clear as all that. Look at the annual change in the ratio of debt to GDP (which is what matters). It has to take account of growth and inflation as well as interest \u2014 actually, it\u2019s\n\nChange in debt/GDP = (debt/GDP)*(interest rate \u2013 nominal growth rate of GDP) \u2013 primary surplus/GDP\n\nwhere the primary surplus is the difference between revenues and non-interest spending. The effect of a rising debt level, then, depends on how much higher the interest rate is than the combined effect of inflation and real growth.\n\nSo we turn to Table A-1 on page 104 of the CBO report, and we learn that for the next 25 years CBO projects an average interest rate on federal debt of 4.1 percent and an average growth rate of nominal GDP of 4.3 percent. And this means no debt spiral at all.\n\nNow, wait a second, you may say: higher debt will mean higher borrowing rates, because people will fear that we\u2019re about to turn into Greece, Greece I tell you. That was the theme of quite a few analyses \u2014 for example, in the Greenlaw et al paper \u201cCrunch time\u201d (pdf), which estimated an upward-sloping relationship between debt and interest rates, and used it to claim that the US was near a critical point.\n\nAs many of us pointed out, however, such results were driven almost entirely by the euro crisis; high-debt countries that borrow in their own currencies haven\u2019t seemed to face anything like the same costs. And a funny thing has happened to the euro area itself since the ECB started doing its job as lender of last resort: not only have rates come down, but the relationship between debt and borrowing costs has become much flatter. The figure shows gross debt as a percentage of GDP for euro area countries in June 2012 and June 2014; what a different \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d makes!\n\nPhoto\n\nI don\u2019t want to say that debt doesn\u2019t matter at all. But it clearly matters a lot less than the fearmongers tried to tell us.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140716180230, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003004863, "DISPLAYDATE": "July 16, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Debt Shall Have No Dominion ( 20140716 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "The death of the debt spiral.", "title": "Debt Shall Have No Dominion", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/debt-shall-have-no-dominion/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "The death of the debt spiral.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 16, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1405548150, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-07-17T14:29:12-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140717142912, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140716, "pdate": 20140716, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "The death of the debt spiral.", "title": "Debt Shall Have No Dominion", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/debt-shall-have-no-dominion/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/debt-shall-have-no-dominion/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Debt Shall Have No Dominion", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96e6\"", "article_summary": "You\u2019ve heard the story: the more debt we have, the more we pay in interest, so the bigger the deficit, and the faster debt grows, until boom, we\u2019ve turned into Greece, Greece I tell you.\nThe effect of a rising debt level, then, depends on how much higher the interest rate is than the combined effect of inflation and real growth.\nBut there\u2019s a further point worth emphasizing: the CBO has just declared an end to the debt spiral.\nNow, wait a second, you may say: higher debt will mean higher borrowing rates, because people will fear that we\u2019re about to turn into Greece, Greece I tell you.\nLook at the annual change in the ratio of debt to GDP (which is what matters)."}
