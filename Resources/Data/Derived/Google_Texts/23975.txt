The thick, wet mud couldn't stop a huge crowd from attending Run the Jewels' evening set at Firefly 2015 on Friday night (June 19), where El-P and Killer Mike ripped through cuts -- and dropped one eyebrow-raising quote -- from their pair of albums as patrons turned up in the muck.



"Run the Jewels is an art project," said El-P amid renditions of "Oh My Darling Don't Cry" and "Close Your Eyes (And Count to F--k)." "You guys are designing this shit and we thank you."

Expectedly political, the pair took a moment to address the faults in America's governmental system, taking aim with a shot fired at the current state of U.S. affairs without specifically naming the recent Charleston massacre. "We're going to Europe on tour shortly," said El. "We'll always bring with us the ridiculous tragic arrogance that America has provided us, everywhere we go."



Both members of Run The Jewels are outspoken critics of the U.S. political system and are known to share their feelings onstage (to say the least). On Thursday morning following news breaking of the Charleston tragedy, Killer Mike posted to Twitter, "What happened in Charleston is an act of terror committed by a terrorist. Simple & plain. I wish those folks in that church had been armed."



In addition to Run the Jewels and Run the Jewels 2, the duo is currently at work on Meow the Jewels, a re-imagining of their sophomore album using cat sounds, as well as the third installment in what will become an epic rap trilogy.
