As Paul Krugman recently observed in Rolling Stone, the United States did a better job limiting the fallout from its financial crisis than the typical advanced economy has over the years. We also crawled our way out of the hole a little faster.\n\nSo where did I go wrong? My book made four major criticisms: That the initial stimulus was too small (and, more importantly, that the White House could have secured a somewhat bigger one); that the administration pivoted too quickly from trying to boost the economy with tax cuts and spending to worrying about the deficit; that the financial rescue, while effective in itself, paid too little attention to how the public perceived it; and that financial reform was exceedingly weak brew. Secondarily, I argued that health care reform was a diversion from boosting the economy, and that the administration was way too timid in its efforts to help homeowners.\n\nPerhaps a little pig-headedly, I still believe most of those criticisms are right. My mistake was to assume Obama\u2019s errors were strategic ones\u2014errors that would doom the economy to years of slow growth and brutally high unemployment. In fact, most were not.\n\nConsider the stimulus. As I reported in my book, Christina Romer, the first head of Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that it would take a stimulus of about $1.8 trillion to drive the unemployment rate back down to 5 percent by 2011. The actual size of the stimulus Congress passed and Obama signed into law was around $800 billion\u2014or about $1 trillion too little, according to Romer\u2019s calculations.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t fatal in itself. One reason the administration felt comfortable being so far below the ideal number is because some of its top economists, like Larry Summers, put stock in a concept called escape velocity. The idea is that the initial boost from the stimulus reinforces itself over time. As workers and businesses feel more confident, they spend more of their income and hire more employees, which leads to more confidence and more spending and hiring. As long as the stimulus was big enough to provide that initial boost, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily need the full amount Romer worked out.\n\nThe problem with betting too heavily on escape velocity is that, if you don\u2019t achieve it, then you\u2019re really in trouble. You\u2019ve got a too small stimulus and nothing propelling you forward. And, indeed, there were moments in 2011 when it looked like that\u2019s what had happened. The economy shrank by 1.5 percent in the first quarter of that year. Unemployment was above 9 percent into the fall. I worried that we\u2019d doomed ourselves to years of stagnation (or worse) on the back of some hair-brained theory.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: In retrospect, the whole escape velocity thing ended up being a bit beside the point. I don\u2019t think anyone could argue that we achieved escape velocity. We never got a huge acceleration in growth or hiring that reinforced itself over time. And yet the stimulus still worked pretty well: It kept the economy afloat while Americans found new jobs and rebuilt their finances. Gradually, they were able to start spending again. That process would have happened sooner had the stimulus been bigger. But the important thing is it happened.\n\nThe same goes from the administration\u2019s collaboration with Republicans on deficit-reduction beginning in 2011. In theory, those efforts could have stamped out the recovery and triggered a second recession. In practice, Americans were already sufficiently far along in putting the pieces back together that the austerity mania only slowed the recovery, it didn\u2019t derail it. That\u2019s tragic and completely maddening\u2014the sequester Obama agreed to when Republicans threatened a debt default cost millions of jobs\u2014but it wasn\u2019t catastrophic.\n\nThe financial rescue provides its own interesting case study. In my book, I tell the story of a tense meeting in then-chief-of-staff Rahm Emanuel\u2019s office in the fall of 2009. Emanuel was getting a bit frantic about the public\u2019s anger toward the banks. He wanted to know what the administration could do to defuse it. The political hands in the room, like David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, essentially said: \u201cnot much.\u201d The government had given the banks hundreds of billions of dollars at a time when average people were really hurting. How did you expect them to feel about it? In return, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, the chief architect of the various bailouts, protested, \u201cWe didn\u2019t give the banks any money. We forced them to go raise it.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe Axelrod and Gibbs would descend so easily into crude populism.\n\nMy own feeling is that both sides had a point. Geithner and his team of emergency responders deserve real credit for ending the financial crisis\u2014no small achievement. As I wrote in the book, the elaborate \u201cstress test\u201d exercise Geithner hatched \u201ccreated confidence in the banking system at a time when confidence was lacking.\u201d And, just as Geithner insisted in that meeting, the government forced the banks with shaky stress-test grades to go out and raise a lot of money. Better yet, it was money that diluted their shareholders and enforced a measure of justice.\n\nBut Axelrod and Gibbs were right in a broader sense. The government had given the banks trillions of dollars worth of guarantees and insurance policies and cheap loans, for which it never received anything approaching the market level of compensation. (And that\u2019s when it received any compensation at all.) The average taxpayer surely didn\u2019t understand the intricacies of all of this. But they could sense that huge sums of money had been handed over to the banks, whose economic fortunes were improving much more quickly than their own. They weren\u2019t crazy to be pissed about it. Moreover, as I pointed out in the book, many on Wall Street\u2014even some in Geithner\u2019s own Treasury Department\u2014believed there were ways of making banks shoulder more of the burden for their own bailouts. (For starters, the stress tests could have required slacker banks to raise even more money, diluting their shareholders further.) Geithner rejected almost all of them.\n\nThe result was a level of economic injustice that was morally offensive. It also, as Axelrod and Gibbs pointed out, was really pissing off voters. This, in turn, had the unfortunate effect of completely screwing Democrats in 2010, which led to a Republican majority in the House, which stopped much of Obama\u2019s agenda and set the stage for his misbegotten grand-bargaining.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s hard to believe the House could have been saved in 2010 had Geithner et al been somewhat tougher on the banks\u2014they were going to have to do a fair amount of unsavory bailing out any way they sliced it. Moreover, as noted above, even the loss of the House and the misguided focus on deficit reduction didn\u2019t cripple the recovery. It only delayed it. In the end, it\u2019s hard to see how this was a strategic mistake either.\n\nThat brings us to financial reform, which remains the least successful part of the Obama economic record. In his own reappraisal of Obama\u2019s presidency, Krugman writes that the crisis \u201cshould have been followed by a drastic crackdown on Wall Street abuses, and it wasn't,\u201d and that \u201cObama bears a considerable part of the blame for this disappointing response.\u201d Still, he argues, \u201cthe Dodd-Frank financial reform bill is a lot better than nothing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d put it slightly differently\u2014basically, I\u2019d delete the words \u201ca lot.\u201d The best thing to come out of Dodd-Frank was the consumer financial protection agency that Elizabeth Warren championed, a real agency using its very real powers to improve people\u2019s lives. The next best things to come out of the bill were the Volcker Rule, which prohibits federally-backed banks placing speculative bets (great idea, but in practice, it\u2019s been a bit porous), and higher capital requirements, which increase the amount of money the banks must hold to cushion themselves against big losses. After that, there are a few marginally helpful reforms, like tougher regulation of derivatives, the financial instrument that blew up AIG, but they don\u2019t go nearly far enough.\n\nOnce you step away from these marginal improvements, you see two fundamental problems. First, several banks are still way too damn big to manage. My book explains why at some length, but here\u2019s an easy way to tell: During and after the financial crisis, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was widely regarded as the most exacting big-bank CEO of his cohort. But even Dimon had no idea what his traders were up to when they placed a several-billion-dollar losing bet in 2012.\n\nUnfortunately, this fact colors almost every aspect of Dodd-Frank. For example, Krugman touts the government\u2019s new authority to liquidate troubled megabanks the same way the FDIC does for community banks that fall apart. In theory, this should prevent a bailout\u2014Geithner at al argued that they had no choice but to bail out Citigroup and Bank of America because they didn\u2019t have the authority to wind them down, FDIC-style. In practice, however, there\u2019s no way the government is going to put a megabank into receivership during the next financial crisis. It could take months to sort through the sprawling obligations of a bank that size, during which time the financial panic would have long since spread around the world. More likely, the government will deal with future Citigroups the way it dealt with AIG: give it an enormous loan in exchange for a huge ownership stake.\n\nThe second problem is related: The basic theory behind Dodd-Frank, which reflected Geithner\u2019s philosophy, is that you prevent financial crises by giving regulators more powers, not by restructuring Wall Street. But if you don\u2019t restructure\u2014specifically, if you don\u2019t create smaller, less complicated financial institutions\u2014the new powers aren\u2019t going to help the regulators a hell of a lot. The banks will retain their enormous political influence, allowing them to squeeze any congressman and regulator who gets too uppity. And they\u2019ll be way too big and complicated for regulators to monitor, much less police.\n\nThese flaws, in turn, led to two serious consequences. First, the public has simply never believed the banks paid a meaningful price for their misbehavior, which created an enormous political headache for the Obama administration (see previous section). A tougher breed of financial reform might not have saved the House in 2010, but I guarantee it would have made it more competitive.\n\nSecond and more importantly, we\u2019re almost certainly going to have another crisis in the next decade, probably a major one. Krugman says Dodd-Frank will make that crisis \u201cless severe and easier to deal with.\u201d I disagree. Dodd-Frank may make the next crisis somewhat less severe. But it will be far more difficult to deal with, for the simple reason that almost no one believes the banks or politicians learned their lesson from 2008, and so they\u2019ll be far less keen on throwing the banks a lifeline. And they weren\u2019t exactly excited about it the first time.\n\nAll the other mistakes Obama and his economic team made were painful, but essentially second-order and forgivable. In any case, it\u2019s only fair to grade on a curve in a situation as challenging as the one Obama faced. Financial reform is the one exception. It\u2019s the mistake we\u2019ll be ruing for years.\n\nThis piece originally stated that GDP growth remains anemic in the United Kingdom.
