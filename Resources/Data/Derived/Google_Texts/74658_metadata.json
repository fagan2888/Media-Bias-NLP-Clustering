Audience members at the Georgia World Congress Center on Tuesday were banned from recording video or sound of the speech, which included a question and answer session.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Clinton spent 25 minutes recounting the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, specifically highlighting Vice President Joe Biden's opposition to the mission. Clinton, who could face off against Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2016, stressed that she backed the raid.\n\nAmerica Rising PAC, a Republican group tracking Clinton's every move, flagged the comments for reporters yesterday, circulating them in an email titled, \"Shots Fired: Clinton Attacks Biden Over Bin Laden Raid.\"\n\nIn the past year, Clinton has given paid speeches to industry groups including the American Society of Travel Agents, the National Realtors Association, the National Auto Dealers Association, and to executives from two blue-chip private equity firms, the Caryle Group and KKR.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to other unpaid speeches to charities, universities and awards dinners.\n\nShe does not make her full speaking schedule public.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment about her Atlanta appearance.\n\nThe convenience store group Clinton addressed Tuesday has also lobbied against other policy initiatives favored by many Democrats, including regulation of the tobacco industry and union-friendly \u201ccard check\u201d legislation.\n\nJeff Lenard, a spokesman for the trade association, said NACS takes positions for and against a wide variety of federal issues \u2013 energy, health care, credit card swipe fees and others - on behalf of convenience store owners.\n\nFocusing solely on the group\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act would be unfair to Clinton, he said, noting that both Republicans and Democrats have addressed the group.\n\n\u201cAbout half of our population shops at our stores every day, and they are voters,\u201d Lenard told CNN. \u201cYou are just talking to people who are part of the American conversation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) \u2013- Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the putative frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, delivered a paid speech Tuesday to a trade association that strongly opposed President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law, the signature achievement of his time in off...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Clinton addresses trade group that fought Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/15/clinton-addresses-trade-group-that-fought-obamacare/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130611125058-02-hillary-clinton-0611-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "(CNN) \u2013- Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the putative frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, delivered a paid speech Tuesday to a trade association that strongly opposed President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law, the signature achievement of his time in off...", "title": "Clinton addresses trade group that fought Obamacare"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "hillary clinton, cnn national political reporter peter hamby", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3da4\"", "article_summary": "Clinton has long championed universal health care coverage, and she made insurance mandates a central plank of her health care reform agenda during her ill-fated 2008 presidential campaign.\nThe trade group represents the U.S. convenience store industry, a $700 billion annual industry representing both large chains and small \u201cmom and pop\u201d operations, as well as their suppliers around the country.\nThe convenience store group Clinton addressed Tuesday has also lobbied against other policy initiatives favored by many Democrats, including regulation of the tobacco industry and union-friendly \u201ccard check\u201d legislation.\nClinton spoke to roughly 3,000 members of the National Association of Convenience Stores, which is holding its annual conference in Atlanta.\nFocusing solely on the group\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act would be unfair to Clinton, he said, noting that both Republicans and Democrats have addressed the group."}
