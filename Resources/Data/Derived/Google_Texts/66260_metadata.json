On Saturday, in South Carolina, he hosted seven leading GOP presidential candidates for in an in depth discussion of the issue that is most near and dear to his heart.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t reignite the American idea\u2014economic growth, prosperity, security\u2014if we\u2019re letting people to continue to slip through the cracks,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\n\nRyan, a devotee of Jack Kemp, the football player turned congressman, Cabinet Secretary and GOP anti-poverty crusader, said he hopes to use 2016 to help the GOP offer affirmative policy solutions after years of fighting with the Obama White House. And amid a primary season that has stood out for its rancor and rejection of substance, the forum\u2014one of his highest profile events since taking the gavel in October\u2014was one of his most significant attempts at doing just that.\n\n\u201cIt says a lot about Speaker Ryan that one of his first major public events features him using his leverage to convene this discussion,\u201d said John Lettieri, the co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group, a nonpartisan think tank backed by Silicon Valley that co-sponsored the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear sign that he\u2019s trying to lead the GOP in another direction.\u201d\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nThe event featured Chris Christie talking about his parents\u2019 poverty and Ben Carson Recalling his own experience growing up poor. \u201cAs a kid growing up in poverty, I hated poverty,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSome people hate rats, hate roaches, I hated poverty.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush highlighted his efforts on founding charter schools in distressed neighborhoods in Florida, while Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee chimed in on the importance of supporting the less fortunate. \u201cSometimes what people need is the affirmation that they are people of value,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cThat they are people of worth.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, on the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, Ryan released his plan to reform the nation\u2019s welfare system, including replacing most federal programs with block grants to states. Similar proposals have been adopted by several GOP candidates, including Jeb Bush most recently on Friday.\n\nThe candidates at the event were united in calling for states, rather than the federal government, to take the lead in tackling poverty, in line with traditional Republican values.\n\n\u201cIf you leave this to federal government, they swing a meat axe, not a scalpel,\u201d Christie said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said the poverty programs as constructed in the 1960s are ill-positioned for the challenges facing the poor in the 21st century.\n\nOne area of contrast came from Carson, a proponent of a flat tax based on biblical tithing, who broke with his fellow candidates to call for the elimination of the Earned Income Tax Credit, while his rivals called for expanding it.\n\nThe focus on poverty, over traditional Republican tropes like \u201cjob creation\u201d and the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d reflected Ryan\u2019s belief that the GOP must reach out to non-traditional voters in order to win a general election, but it also reflects decades of his own work, which began when he was an aide to Kemp at Empower America. Ryan credited his mentor\u2019s inspiration in his 2012 convention speech. \u201cWhat gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people, in the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe need that same optimism right now.\u201d\n\nArthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, another co-sponsor of the event, credited Ryan with moving the GOP to embrace an often-overlooked issue.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan is the intellectual leader of the Republican Party, at least among politicians,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd certainly until there\u2019s a Republican candidate, he\u2019s effectively the leader of the party. And he\u2019s basically doing the type of things that leaders are supposed to do. He\u2019s setting the agenda, asking about the things he wishes they were talking about, and I think it\u2019s great. It\u2019s the best leadership I\u2019ve seen in a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know it yet but it\u2019s incredibly smart politics, because they need to brand the Republican Party as a party that cares about people like you,\u201d Brooks added of the Republican candidates. \u201cIf you can really shift five or six percent of the population into a position where they say, \u2018this whole thing about Republicans don\u2019t care about poor people, I don\u2019t see that,\u2019 that would be a big, big change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned today is that we\u2019re not just an opposition party, we\u2019re are also a proposition party,\u201d a smiling Ryan told MSNBC host Joe Scarborough on stage, suggesting it was the first step toward a GOP that was more aggressive in reaching out to all voters. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather both parties compete for your vote no matter who you are, where you live, or what zip code you\u2019re in?\u201d\n\nFormer 2016 presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has critiqued the GOP\u2019s rhetoric on poverty in recent years, said the focus on the poor has the potential to open electoral doors for the GOP. \u201cThe fact that Paul Ryan\u2026is talking about this makes me encouraged,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this issue can help us.\u201d\n\nThe policy-heavy forum offered a starkly different tone than the series of Republican presidential debates, which have frequently devolved into personal shouting matches. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he\u2019s been pushing for more such events as opposed to debates, \u201cso people can see who you are.\u201d Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz were among the invited candidates who skipped the Kemp forum.\n\n\u201cToo often what we\u2019ve seen in the debates is the selling of fear,\u201d echoed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only African-American GOP senator. \u201cToday we overcame that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Speaker of the House makes his mark", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The Speaker of the House makes his mark", "title": "Paul Ryan Pushes Republicans to Make Poverty an Issue", "url": "http://time.com/4174091/paul-ryan-republican-poverty-south-carolina/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/paul-ryan.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/paul-ryan.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The Speaker of the House makes his mark", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Paul Ryan Pushes Republicans to Make Poverty an Issue"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "paul ryan, 2016 election, republican, south carolina, jack kemp, 2016 election", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "paul ryan, 2016 election, republican, south carolina, jack kemp, 2016 election"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPaul Ryan is the intellectual leader of the Republican Party, at least among politicians,\u201d Brooks said.\nOn Saturday, in South Carolina, he hosted seven leading GOP presidential candidates for in an in depth discussion of the issue that is most near and dear to his heart.\n\u201cI think this issue can help us.\u201dThe policy-heavy forum offered a starkly different tone than the series of Republican presidential debates, which have frequently devolved into personal shouting matches.\nSimilar proposals have been adopted by several GOP candidates, including Jeb Bush most recently on Friday.\n\u201cThat they are people of worth.\u201dIn 2014, on the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, Ryan released his plan to reform the nation\u2019s welfare system, including replacing most federal programs with block grants to states."}
