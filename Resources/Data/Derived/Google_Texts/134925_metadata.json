No. 2 Ohio State lost to Michigan State 34-24 in the Big Ten title game, which likely pushes the Tigers up to face top-ranked Florida State in Pasadena. The Seminoles routed Duke 45-7 in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship.\n\n\u201cWe won the SEC championship,\u201d Auburn receiver Sammie Coates said. \u201cWhat else do you want us to do?\u201d\n\nAdded Mason: \u201cWe feel like we beat the best teams \u2026. We feel like we deserve to be in the game.\u201d\n\nMissouri (11-2) should be in the mix for a New Year\u2019s Day bowl, with the Capital One, Cotton and Outback games among the possible destinations.\n\nBut Auburn was the big winner on this day. The official announcement won\u2019t come until Sunday night, but there appears to be no other outcome than Auburn-Florida State for No. 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing our best football right now,\u201d said Auburn coach Gus Malzahn, making his pitch for Pasadena about the time Ohio State was kicking off against Michigan State in Indianapolis. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any other team can say that.\u201d\n\nAuburn is certainly playing its best offensively. The Tigers set an SEC championship record with 677 yards, including 545 on the ground.\n\nMason had scoring runs of 7, 3 and 1 yards before bursting up the middle on a 13-yard TD that clinched the victory with 4:22 remaining. He carried the ball a staggering 46 times, an easy choice as the game\u2019s MVP. He celebrated by breaking out the familiar Heisman pose, his longshot candidacy getting a huge boost.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at one of the top running backs in college football,\u201d Malzahn said. \u201cHe was a warrior today. Unbelievable.\u201d\n\nIn a game where neither team played a lick of defense, Auburn finally stopped Missouri on fourth-and-1 deep in its own territory, setting up Mason\u2019s final score. Chris Davis broke up the pass, not quite as thrilling as his 109-yard return of a missed field goal to beat Alabama, but another huge play for the nation\u2019s biggest turnaround team.\n\nAuburn, which was 3-9 a year ago and didn\u2019t win a game in the SEC, claimed the title in its first year under Malzahn. The Tigers didn\u2019t even need a dramatic finish to do it, holding Missouri scoreless in the final quarter while Mason notched two more TDs to break open a game that was close most of the way.\n\nMissouri had its own impressive bounce-back after struggling its first year in the SEC. But coach Gary Pinkel\u2019s team was denied a quick championship in its new league after leaving the Big 12, unable to slow \u2014 must less stop \u2014 Auburn\u2019s dynamic offense.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real frustration that comes over you on defense when they\u2019re coming after you over and over and over again,\u201d Pinkel said. \u201cWe had trouble stopping it, obviously, and couldn\u2019t get it fixed.\u201d\n\nJames Franklin passed for 303 yards and three touchdowns, while Dorial Green-Beckham hauled in six passes for 144 yards and a couple of scores. Missouri piled up 534 yards \u2014 the teams combined for 1,211 yards in a conference supposedly known for defense \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough against Auburn\u2019s hurry-up spread.\n\nComing into the game, Missouri was one of the top teams in the nation against the run and ranked second in the SEC behind Alabama. The most yards they had given up on the ground was 184 the previous week in a victory over 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel and Texas A&M.\n\nMason had more yards than that in the first half, putting up 195 by the time he trotted to the locker room and just 6 yards off the SEC championship game record. He broke the mark set by LSU\u2019s Justin Vincent in 2003 on the second play of the second half \u2014 and kept right on going from there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had holes that big to run through,\u201d Mason said, crediting the guys in the trenches. \u201cNo one expected 300 yards. I didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Nick Marshall shook off two early fumbles, one of which Missouri returned for a touchdown. He ran for 101 yards and a touchdown and passed for 132 yards and another score.\n\nThe lead changed hands seven times. Missouri\u2019s last gasp was Franklin\u2019s 5-yard touchdown run, followed by a two-point conversion, that closed the gap to 45-42 heading to the final period. But Auburn dominated the final 15 minutes behind the play of Mason.\n\nLate in the game, when Auburn had finally wrapped it up, Mason got a hug on the sideline from Auburn\u2019s greatest back, Bo Jackson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the better players ever to wear an Auburn helmet,\u201d Malzahn said, referring to Mason, not Bo.\n\n\u201cThanks, coach,\u201d Mason said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mason rushed for 304 yards and four touchdowns, leading No. 3 Auburn to a wild 59-42 victory over No. 5 Missouri in a Southeastern Conference title showdown Saturday that looked more like a video game.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mason rushed for 304 yards and four touchdowns, leading No. 3 Auburn to a wild 59-42 victory over No. 5 Missouri in a Southeastern Conference title showdown Saturday that looked more like a video game.", "title": "Auburn outguns Missouri for SEC title as Tre Mason runs wild", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/7/auburn-outguns-missouri-sec-title/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/07/aptopix-sec-championship-footballjpeg-01fc8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/07/aptopix-sec-championship-footballjpeg-01fc8.jpg", "description": "Mason rushed for 304 yards and four touchdowns, leading No. 3 Auburn to a wild 59-42 victory over No. 5 Missouri in a Southeastern Conference title showdown Saturday that looked more like a video game", "card": "summary", "title": "Auburn outguns Missouri for SEC title as Tre Mason runs wild"}, "Author": "Paul Newberry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tre Mason, SEC, Gus Malzahn"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe won the SEC championship,\u201d Auburn receiver Sammie Coates said.\nLooks like the Auburn Tigers running back will get a shot at something he wants even more.\nComing into the game, Missouri was one of the top teams in the nation against the run and ranked second in the SEC behind Alabama.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the better players ever to wear an Auburn helmet,\u201d Malzahn said, referring to Mason, not Bo.\nThe Tigers set an SEC championship record with 677 yards, including 545 on the ground."}
