The Company has reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice to resolve its investigation into whether the Company\u2019s three New Mexico hospitals improperly submitted claims for federal funds through the state\u2019s Medicaid programs.

Both financial and statistical results exclude entities in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n(b) The contingent value right (\u201cCVR\u201d) entitles the holder to receive a cash payment up to $1.00 per CVR (subject to downward adjustment but not below zero), subject to the final resolution of certain existing legal matters pertaining to HMA, as defined in the CVR agreement. Since the HMA acquisition date of January 27, 2014, approximately $19 million in costs have been incurred related to certain HMA legal matters, which exceeds the deductible of $18 million under the CVR agreement. An estimated liability of $42 million has been recorded for certain claims which HMA had previously recognized as probable. In addition, CHS previously recorded an estimated fair value of the remaining underlying claims that will be covered by the CVR of $284 million as part of the acquisition accounting for HMA, which was adjusted to its estimated fair value of $291 million at September 30, 2014.\n\nThe following table presents the impact of the recorded amounts as described above as applied to the CVR and the $18 million deductible and 10% co-insurance amounts (in millions):\n\nAs of September 30, 2014 Legal and other related costs incurred to date $ 19 Settlements 3 Estimated liability for probable contingencies 42 Estimated liability for unresolved contingencies at fair value 291 Costs incurred plus estimated liability for CVR-related matters 355 Less: CHS deductible of $18 million (18 ) CHS co-insurance at 10% (34 ) Current estimate of reductions to amounts owed to CVR holders $ 303 CVRs outstanding 265\n\n(c) The effective date of the HMA acquisition was January 27, 2014.\n\n(d) Included in discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, are two hospitals required by the Federal Trade Commission to be divested as part of its approval of the HMA acquisition (as previously announced, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its ownership interest in one of these hospitals, Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, in October 2014). Management is actively marketing several other smaller hospitals included as held for sale. The results of operations on the held for sale hospitals, including an impairment charge on certain long-lived assets held for sale, is approximately $1 million and loss of $26 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.\n\n(e) The following table provides information needed to calculate income per share, which is adjusted for income attributable to noncontrolling interests (in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Income from continuing operations attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. common stockholders: Income from continuing operations, net of taxes $ 93 $ 28 $ 93 $ 180 Less: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests 32 18 75 52 Income from continuing operations attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. common stockholders \u2014 basic and diluted $ 61 $ 10 $ 18 $ 128 Income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. common stockholders: Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 1 $ (6 ) $ (26 ) $ (15 ) Less: Loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests - - - - Income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. common stockholders \u2014 basic and diluted $ 1 $ (6 ) $ (26 ) $ (15 )\n\n(f) EBITDA consists of net income attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted to exclude discontinued operations, loss from early extinguishment of debt, impairment of long-lived assets and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company has from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of its subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions. The Company believes that it is useful to present Adjusted EBITDA because it excludes the portion of EBITDA attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors the Company\u2019s portion of EBITDA generated by continuing operations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of liquidity. The Company has included this measure because it believes it provides investors with additional information about the Company\u2019s ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is the basis for a key component in the determination of the Company\u2019s compliance with some of the covenants under the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facility, as well as to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the senior secured credit facility.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. This calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, to net cash provided by operating activities as derived directly from the condensed consolidated financial statements (in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Adjusted EBITDA $ 663 $ 382 $ 1,826 $ 1,297 Interest expense, net (250 ) (154 ) (728 ) (464 ) Provision for income taxes (40 ) (7 ) (16 ) (78 ) Income (loss) from operations of entities held for sale, net of taxes 1 (6 ) (4 ) (15 ) Other non-cash expenses, net 105 131 148 178 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures (353 ) (214 ) (587 ) (477 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 126 $ 132 $ 639 $ 441\n\n(g) Included in income from operations and income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, is the electronic health records incentive reimbursement, which represents reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid related to certain of the Company\u2019s hospitals and for certain employed physicians. Total costs and expenses related to the implementation of electronic health records for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, were approximately $50 million, including depreciation and amortization of approximately $27 million, and approximately $151 million, including depreciation and amortization of approximately $69 million, respectively. Total costs and expenses related to the implementation of electronic health records for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, were approximately $27 million, including depreciation and amortization of approximately $17 million, and approximately $73 million, including depreciation and amortization of approximately $45 million, respectively.\n\n(h) Included in non-same-store income from operations and income from continuing operations are pre-tax charges related to acquisition costs of $7 million and $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $54 million and $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These acquisition costs include expenses related to the acquisition of HMA of $5 million and $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $44 million and $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\n(i) The following table sets forth components reconciling the basic weighted-average number of shares to the diluted weighted-average number of shares (in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Weighted-average number of shares outstanding - basic 113 93 111 92 Add effect of dilutive securities: Stock awards and options 1 1 1 2 Weighted-average number of shares outstanding - diluted 114 94 112 94\n\n(j) Same-store operating results and statistical data includes comparable information for hospitals acquired in the HMA acquisition for the months of February through September 2014 and 2013.\n\n(k) Included in income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, is an impairment charge of approximately $24 million for internal-use software, and an acceleration of amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, of approximately $75 million, to adjust for its shortened remaining life which ended on July 1, 2014. In connection with the HMA acquisition, the Company further analyzed its intangible assets related to internal-use software used in certain of its hospitals for patient and clinical systems, including software required to meet criteria for meaningful use attestation and ICD-10 compliance. This analysis resulted in management reassessing its usage of certain software products and rationalizing that, with the addition of the HMA hospitals in the first quarter of 2014, those software applications were going to be discontinued and replaced with new applications that better integrate meaningful use and ICD-10 compliance, are more cost effective and can be implemented at a greater efficiency of scale over future implementations.\n\n(l) The following supplemental tables reconcile income from continuing operations and net income attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. common stockholders, as reported, on a per share (diluted) basis, with the adjustments described herein:\n\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (per share - diluted) (per share - diluted) Income from continuing operations, as reported $ 0.53 $ 0.11 $ 0.16 $ 1.37 Adjustments: Loss from early extinguishment of debt - - 0.40 0.01 Amortization of software to be abandoned - - 0.42 - Impairment of long-lived assets - - 0.14 - Expenses related to the acquisition and integration of HMA 0.02 0.03 0.38 0.04 Government settlement and related costs 0.41 0.65 0.42 0.65 Legal expenses related to cases covered by the CVR 0.04 - 0.12 - Income from continuing operations, excluding adjustments $ 1.00 $ 0.79 $ 2.04 $ 2.07 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 (per share - diluted) (per share - diluted) Net income (loss), as reported $ 0.54 $ 0.04 $ (0.07 ) $ 1.21 Adjustments: Loss from early extinguishment of debt - - 0.40 0.01 Amortization of software to be abandoned - - 0.42 - Impairment of long-lived assets - - 0.14 - Expenses related to the acquisition and integration of HMA 0.02 0.03 0.38 0.04 Government settlement and related costs 0.41 0.65 0.42 0.65 Legal expenses related to cases covered by the CVR 0.04 - 0.12 - Net income, excluding adjustments $ 1.01 $ 0.72 $ 1.81 $ 1.91\n\n(m) Cash flows from operations includes HMA integration costs, CVR related payments, HMA investment banking fees and other acquired acquisition related liabilities and the payments of government settlements. Excluding these items, which are not anticipated to be part of ongoing operations, cash flows from operations would have been $833 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.\n\n(n) Total per share amounts may not add due to rounding.\n\n(o) The $0.41 per share and $0.42 per share of \u201cGovernment settlement and related costs\u201d for the three and nine months ended 2014, respectively, reflects the reserve in the amount of $75 million (and legal fees incurred of $2 million) with respect to the qui tam lawsuit that has been pending since 2008 in New Mexico. The lawsuit alleges that three of the Company\u2019s New Mexico hospitals caused the State of New Mexico to improperly apply for and receive funds under the state\u2019s Medicaid program. The case was set for trial and the agreement in principle to resolve the case was reached to avoid the uncertainty of trial. The reserve does not include the legal fees of the relator\u2019s counsel.\n\nRegulation FD Disclosure\n\nThe following tables set forth selected information concerning the Company\u2019s projected consolidated operating results for the year ending December 31, 2014. These projections update selected preliminary guidance provided on July 31, 2014, and are based on the Company\u2019s historical operating performance, current trends and other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable at this time. The 2014 guidance should be considered in conjunction with the assumptions included herein. See pages 17 and 18 for a list of factors that could affect the future results of the Company or the healthcare industry generally.\n\nThe following is provided as guidance to analysts and investors:\n\n2014 Projection Range Net operating revenues less provision for bad debts (in millions) $ 18,700 to $ 19,100 Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) $ 2,825 to $ 2,900 Income from continuing operations per share - diluted $ 3.05 to $ 3.30 Same-store hospital annual adjusted admissions growth (2.5 )% to 0.0 % Weighted-average diluted shares, in millions, for the full year 113 to 114 Weighted-average diluted shares, in millions, for the 4th quarter 114 to 115\n\nThe following assumptions were used in developing the 2014 guidance provided above:\n\nThe Company\u2019s projection excludes the following: Payments related to the CVRs issued in connection with the HMA acquisition; Future losses on the early extinguishment of debt; Impairment of long-lived assets; Resolution of government investigations or other significant legal settlements; Transaction costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of HMA; Gains or losses from conforming accounting adjustments between the Company and HMA; and Other significant gains or losses that neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance.\n\nThe 2014 projections include the results of operations from the HMA acquisition effective January 27, 2014.\n\nExcluded from these projections are two hospitals required to be divested as part of receiving regulatory approval from the Federal Trade Commission for the HMA acquisition. In October, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its ownership interest in one of these hospitals, Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center. Several other small hospitals which the Company has classified as held for sale and moved the operating results to discontinued operations have also been excluded from these projections.\n\nThe 2014 projections include the acquisitions of Sharon Regional Health System in Sharon, Pennsylvania, and Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala, Florida, completed on April 1, 2014, Natchez Regional Medical Center in Natchez, Mississippi, completed on October 1, 2014, and assumes the completion of one additional targeted hospital acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014, a reduction from previous guidance of one to three additional acquisitions. The acquisition of MetroHealth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan is currently targeted to close in 2015.\n\nOther assumptions used in the above guidance:\n\nBenefits to Adjusted EBITDA from Healthcare Reform in 2014 of 0.5% to 0.8% of net operating revenues.\n\nAchievement of acquisition synergies related to the HMA acquisition of approximately $125 million during the first year of operations.\n\nHealth Information Technology (HITECH) electronic health records incentive reimbursement of approximately 1.3% to 1.4% of net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, with operating expenses related to achieving meaningful use of 0.4% to 0.5% of net operating revenues and depreciation and amortization of related assets of 0.4% to 0.5% of net operating revenues.\n\nContinuation and approval of the California hospital provider fee program for 2014, for which the Company expects to recognize $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nThe Company expects to recognize and receive net cash proceeds of $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, as a result of the Budget Neutrality Act settlement approval received on October 29, 2014.\n\nSettlement of certain claims related to the BP oil spill, for which the Company expects to recognize up to approximately $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nSame-store hospital annual adjusted admissions growth, of (2.5)% to 0.0% for the entire year, which does not take into account service closures and weather-related or other unusual events.\n\nExpressed as a percentage of net operating revenues, depreciation and amortization of approximately 6.0% to 6.3% for 2014, an increase over 2013 primarily relating to the investments being made in information systems technology and the acquisition of HMA; however, the adjustment to fair market value of the acquired HMA assets remains subject to finalization, therefore depreciation and amortization may vary accordingly. Additionally, this is a fixed cost and the percentages may vary as revenue varies. Such amounts exclude the possible impact of any future hospital fixed asset impairments and acceleration of amortization of software to be abandoned.\n\nInterest expense, expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues, of approximately 5.1% to 5.3%; however, interest expense is a fixed cost and percentages may vary as revenue varies. Total fixed rate debt, including swaps, is expected to average approximately 60% to 70% of total debt during 2014.\n\nExpressed as a percentage of net operating revenues, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of approximately 0.2% to 0.3% for 2014.\n\nExpressed as a percentage of net operating revenues, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately 0.6% to 0.8% for 2014.\n\nExpressed as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income tax of approximately 30.0% to 32.0% for 2014.\n\nCapital expenditures are projected as follows (in millions):\n\n2014 Guidance Total $975 to $1,050\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities, excluding acquisition and integration related cash flow items, cash flows related to the CVR, and settlement of legal contingencies is projected as follows (in millions):\n\n2014 Guidance Total $1,600 to $1,800\n\nWeighted average shares outstanding are projected to be approximately 113 million to 114 million for the year ended 2014 and approximately 114 million to 115 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and have been adjusted to include the estimated dilutive impact from \u201cin-the-money\u201d stock options and restricted shares.\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risk and uncertainties.

Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and may be beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company cannot give any assurance that its expectations will in fact occur and cautions that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
