He could be forgiven that, because his consulting firm has the best record in GOP state races, bar none. On Hardball, he made a gutsy prediction that the Republican nominee next year will have held elective office. Gutsy because all the people on top are newbies: Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and The Donald Trump.\n\nChris Matthews responded, \u201cPrior public service is like a rap sheet.\u201d\n\nThe nightmarish end of public service by U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens (Chinook) might finally be over thanks to House Majority Leader and formerly Speaker heir apparent Kevin McCarthy, who blurted out the truth about the latest investigation into the riot that took the lives of Stevens and three others. Asked on Fox what the Republicans have accomplished since they gained the majority, he replied that they appointed a select committee on Benghazi and tanked Hillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers.\n\nIn the ensuing uproar, McCarthy withdrew from the race to be third in line for the presidency\u2014a scary thought\u2014and endorsed former vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who does not want the office.\n\nMy Republican Cousin Ray was in full-on sarcasm mode. \u201cThis is the finest moment for my party since that fool in Pennsylvania said the purpose of voter ID laws is to cut Obama\u2019s margins.\u201d\n\nThe Benghazi Select Committee is on track to spend $6 million and if it meets its stated goal of publishing a report in time to ding Clinton in 2016 elections it will be the longest investigation in the history of Congress. Iran-Contra? Watergate? No, Benghazi.\n\nI could not resist piling on, so I asked Ray to remind me how many votes the House had taken to repeal Obamacare and protect 16 and a half million people from having health insurance?\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, still polling in single digits, asked, \u201cHow do we rescue the American Dream so it doesn\u2019t become the European nightmare?\u201d\n\nStrange question. I\u2019ve visited Europe and so have most of my kids and I have no reports of a nightmare. Maybe it\u2019s a nightmare for people who are convinced medical care is just another profit center or freedom is tested by how many guns you own.\n\nJeb Bush opined last week that the Washington football team does not need to change its name, adding \u201cNative American tribes generally don\u2019t find it offensive.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported some contributions to a SuperPAC supporting Bush for president by NFL team owners. I will refer to team names, excepting the one that\u2019s a racial slur. The Houston Texans gave Bush $500,000. The New York Jets are owned by Bush\u2019s national finance chairman, so the Jets have contributed over half a million dollars. The owner of the Washington team dropped a paltry $100,000, so he didn\u2019t pay for Bush\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u201cI think he did,\u201d Cousin Ray growled. \u201cWhen a candidate isn\u2019t polling in double digits, a six figure contribution is persuasive.\u201d\n\nAfter Cousin Ray made that remark, one of the SuperPACs disgorged $1.9 million for ads in three states to buy Bush\u2019s numbers back up.\n\nCousin Ray is tired of my razzing about the Republican mullahs waging jihad against women\u2019s access to reproductive health care. This week, he brought me a report from Amnesty International about what happened when the Taliban took over Kunduz, Afghanistan. The Taliban do not approve of women controlling their own reproductive decisions, and so they target providers of birth control and abortions for gang rape and killing.\n\nPoint taken. Being raped and killed is much worse than having your clinic closed.\n\nDouglas County, Oregon Sheriff John Hanlin shared a link on his personal Facebook page after the Sandy Hook Massacre to a video claiming that Sandy Hook was faked by the federal government for the purpose of confiscating guns.
