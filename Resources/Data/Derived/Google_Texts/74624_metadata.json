The district is broke, school conditions are terrible, teachers are leaving and now principals are being accused of conspiracy.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal officials announced bribery charges against a dozen former and current principals and an assistant superintendent for their illegal involvement with a school supplies vendor.\n\nThe criminal charges allege principals from Detroit Public Schools were awarded a total of over $900,000 in kickbacks and bribes in exchange for business with Allstate Sales.\n\nNorman Shy, the owner of Allstate Sales, is also charged and at the center of this case. Shy allegedly rewarded principals with gift cards, cash and checks when they used his company as a vendor for supplies \u2014 supplies that were often never delivered.\n\nOne of the principals named in the conspiracy is Ronald Alexander. His name might sound familiar because last month TV show host Ellen DeGeneres donated $500,000 dollars to his school, Spain Elementary-Middle School, to help it afford new technology and building repairs.\n\n\"Of all the people in the whole world, I'm the happiest principal on Earth,\" Alexander told DeGeneres.\n\nWell, after a two-year investigation, officials say Alexander accepted $23,000 illegally.\n\n\"If there is a message today that it may seem easy to take a bribe, but I'll tell you what, it's also easy to get caught. We will catch you and hold you accountable,\" U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said.\n\nIn total, officials say Allstate Sales cheated Detroit Public Schools out of $2.7 million. Each of the defendants named Tuesday could face five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Each of the defendants named on Tuesday could face five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Each of the defendants named on Tuesday could face five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.", "title": "Detroit Principals Accused Of Taking Bribes From School Supplier", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/detroit-principals-accused-of-taking-bribes-from-school-supplier/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1459290247.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Each of the defendants named on Tuesday could face five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.", "title": "Detroit Principals Accused Of Taking Bribes From School Supplier", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/detroit-principals-accused-of-taking-bribes-from-school-supplier/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1459290247.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=Zvc2pmMjE6pki1w5vY3VDlJaE2RYE-Y-&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://58490", "iphone": "newsy://58490", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://58490", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "detroit public school system, detroit principals bribes, detroit principals conspiracy, principals accused of taking kickbacks, school conditions, allstate sales, norman shy, bribery charges, criminal charges", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1459290247.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The Detroit Public School system is in trouble.\nIn total, officials say Allstate Sales cheated Detroit Public Schools out of $2.7 million.\nShy allegedly rewarded principals with gift cards, cash and checks when they used his company as a vendor for supplies \u2014 supplies that were often never delivered.\nThe district is broke, school conditions are terrible, teachers are leaving and now principals are being accused of conspiracy.\nThe criminal charges allege principals from Detroit Public Schools were awarded a total of over $900,000 in kickbacks and bribes in exchange for business with Allstate Sales."}
