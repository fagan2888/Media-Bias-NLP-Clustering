It has to stop.'\u201d\n\nThe two programs target different audiences. But in the realm of domestic-violence prevention, where the record of success is spotty, they share a status as two of the nation\u2019s most promising initiatives.\n\nCoaching Boys Into Men is one of the flagship programs developed by Futures Without Violence, a nonprofit working to curb abuse of women and children. Thousands of high school coaches across the country, now joined by some middle school coaches, have received training in how to convey to their players the importance of treating young women with respect and avoiding abusive behavior.\n\nThe program has attracted the notice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency funded a three-year evaluation, involving more than 2,000 high school athletes in Sacramento County, California, which found that participating players were more likely to intervene to stop abuse and less likely to perpetrate it.\n\nHigh Point\u2019s program \u2014 the Offender-Focused Domestic Violence Initiative \u2014 was conceived in 2009 based on an approach developed by David M. Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. While many programs focus on helping victims of domestic violence, High Point\u2019s initiative targets the offender with a strategy of aggressive deterrence.\n\nSince the program was fully implemented in 2012, the recidivism rate for domestic-violence offenders in High Point has been cut to about 9 percent, which the police department says is about one-third the national rate. There\u2019s been one intimate-partner homicide since 2009, compared to 17 between 2004 and 2008.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d get 5,000 domestic-violence calls a year \u2014 every year it\u2019s our No. 1 call,\u201d Chief Sumner said. \u201cIt gets passed on from generation to generation, but this program is a really good shot at breaking that cycle citywide.\u201d\n\nEfforts to raise awareness about domestic violence have been vigorously pursued in the U.S. for more than three decades. After Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, domestic violence committed by intimate partners \u2014 current or former spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends \u2014 declined by more than 60 percent over the next 10 years.\n\nSince then, however, the numbers have stayed relatively flat.\n\nEven as incidents involving National Football League players and other pro athletes refocus attention on domestic violence, leading prevention advocates say more resources and smarter strategies are needed to combat it.\n\n\u201cWe now have a safety net for victims, we have the laws in place, judges who understand the seriousness of the issue,\u201d said Esta Soler, president of Futures Without Violence. \u201cWe need to do more to prevent the problems, not just treat the problems.\u201d\n\nFor decades, so-called batterer intervention programs have been one of the main forms of prevention, with offenders participating in group sessions aimed at promoting non-abusive behavior. A range of local programs have won praise \u2014 such as Wisdom Walk, which focuses on African-American men in Milwaukee, and Caminar Latino, which runs a 24-week program for Latino men in Atlanta.\n\nHowever, research on the effectiveness of group intervention programs has produced mixed findings \u2014 causing some judges and probation officers to mandate that men participate, others saying there\u2019s no evidence of success.\n\nAnd what about the much-discussed programs in High Point and Pittsburgh? Here\u2019s a closer look at each:\n\n___\n\nThe new regimen in High Point, a city of about 107,000, kicks into gear whenever police respond to a domestic disturbance call. Even if there\u2019s no arrest, and no previous record of domestic violence, the alleged aggressors receive another visit from a police officer within 48 hours and are notified that they are henceforth on a \u201cwatch list.\u201d\n\nWith any subsequent domestic violence offense, there\u2019s an escalating series of consequences, including a face-to-face warning from a detective at the time of arrest and \u2014 for some repeat offenders \u2014 a summons to appear in person before a panel of police, prosecutors and members of the community.\n\n\u201cIn an hour, we explain how it\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Sumner said. \u201cWe will use any means to sanction you.\u201d\n\nThe pressure tactics include threatening to classify any further domestic violence offense as a felony and to expedite prosecution of any other criminal case pending against the offender. Sumner\u2019s department has found that many domestic-violence offenders have a record of other violent crimes, and uses those records to help decide which targets of the program might deserve extra scrutiny.\n\nThe community panel makes clear that the police will maintain their aggressive stance regardless of whether the offender\u2019s victim plays an active role in any future case or seeks to stay out of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Better strategies sought to curb domestic violence", "author": "David Crary", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Better strategies sought to curb domestic violence", "title": "Better strategies sought to curb domestic violence", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/16/better_strategies_sought_to_curb_domestic_violence/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/stopping-domestic-violence.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Better strategies sought to curb domestic violence", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/stopping-domestic-violence.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Better strategies sought to curb domestic violence", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Better strategies sought to curb domestic violence", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1a9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re putting these guys on notice that domestic violence is not going to be tolerated here,\u201d said Police Chief Marty Sumner.\nWhile many programs focus on helping victims of domestic violence, High Point\u2019s initiative targets the offender with a strategy of aggressive deterrence.\nEven as incidents involving National Football League players and other pro athletes refocus attention on domestic violence, leading prevention advocates say more resources and smarter strategies are needed to combat it.\nAfter Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, domestic violence committed by intimate partners \u2014 current or former spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends \u2014 declined by more than 60 percent over the next 10 years.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsOn a high school football field near Pittsburgh, an assistant coach tackled a topic unrelated to the upcoming game."}
