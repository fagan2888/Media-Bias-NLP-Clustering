There\u2019s a phrase in the legislation that suggests, if ripped from context, that subsidies are only supposed to support consumers in states with their own exchange marketplaces \u2013 not those who enrolled in insurance plans through healthcare.gov.\n\nAnd yet, conservative justices may not care \u2013 if there\u2019s ambiguity in the phrase, the Supreme Court majority may conclude, then it\u2019s up to Congress to pass a bill to add clarity.\n\nIn an interesting twist, a prominent Republican has suggested his former brethren do exactly that .\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott encouraged his fellow Republicans on Thursday to work on a technical fix to the Affordable Care Act to ensure that those purchasing coverage on federally run exchanges would continue receiving subsidies. The Mississippi Republican said that when he was in office, it was routine to make clarifying changes to laws after they passed. It happened, he said, \u201calmost always.\u201d \u201cThere was always, on a major bill, we\u2019d have technical corrections, right? Almost immediately [we\u2019d correct them]\u201d Lott said, at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nLott was asked specifically whether he would encourage GOP lawmakers to approve a technical fix. \u201cSure, yeah, I would,\u201d he replied.\n\nThis is interesting for all sorts of reasons.\n\nFor example, the issue of technical fixes is itself important. John Harwood had a terrific piece on this shortly before Thanksgiving, which didn\u2019t generate nearly as much attention as it deserved. Harwood noted the example of welfare reform, which passed in 1996, and which Congress made dozens of technical changes to a year later.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about swift passage for the Welfare Reform Technical Corrections Act of 1997. But in retrospect, it underscores the deteriorating conditions in Washington today, as the Supreme Court has accepted a case threatening the Affordable Care Act over the interpretation of a single ambiguous phrase. The 1997 act passed a year after President Bill Clinton and a Republican-led Congress had struck a broader deal on welfare, a racially charged issue that had roiled politics for two decades. The passage of the 1996 law followed fierce fighting \u2013 Mr. Clinton vetoed two welfare bills before signing the third \u2013 as well as a bitter budget fight that had temporarily shut down the government the previous winter. By 1997, however, the political guns had fallen silent. Though Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate had opposed the 1996 law, the fight was over. The top House Republican on the issue, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, quietly consulted Mr. Clinton\u2019s aides about ways the new welfare law needed clarification and adjustment to be implemented more effectively. \u201cWe worked with the administration even though we shut down the government \u2013 twice,\u201d recalled Ron Haskins, then Mr. Shaw\u2019s top welfare adviser. In August, the numerous \u201ctechnical corrections\u201d to the 1996 bill were folded into a budget deal and passed into law.\n\nThis is how Congress, back when it was a functioning governing institution, used to work for generations. The idea that current Republican have spent four years refusing to even consider technical fixes to \u201cObamacare\u201d is a reminder of just how far gone the congressional GOP really is.\n\nIndeed, every major piece of legislation in modern American history \u2013 Social Security, Medicare, et al \u2013 has been subject to multiple technical fixes in the ensuing years. It\u2019s effectively the equivalent of routine governing tune-ups \u2013 minor maintenance and tweaks intended to make laws work effectively for the public.\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans, however, have adopted a posture unseen in modern history: the GOP doesn\u2019t want to tweak the ACA to help it function better; it wants to kill the law regardless of the consequences. Full stop.\n\nIndeed, if the Supreme Court ignores its own precedents and norms, guts the health care system, and tells Congress to clarify the language, the entire mess could be resolved with a one-paragraph bill. The whole controversy could end with just a few minutes of legislating.\n\nFor Lott, it makes sense to simply do the right thing and prevent families from suffering. One gets the distinct impression that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner disagree.\n\nOn Twitter this morning, I noticed my friends Greg Sargent and Benjy Sarlin talking about this, with Sarlin making the case that Trent Lott is no longer a \u201cbellwether of GOP opinion or behavior.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true. However, Lott is a bellwether of the attitudes embraced by corporations that lobby Republicans, and his comments suggest to me that for Big Businesses with skin in this game \u2013 insurers, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, etc. \u2013 Corporate America actually wants the Obama administration to win this court fight.\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t they? The Affordable Care Act is working exceptionally well at this stage, and tearing the law down over a perceived drafting error would not only destroy the health security of millions of families, it would also wreak havoc on the companies invested in the American system.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A former Republican Majority Leader thinks it's time for his party to do the right thing: pass some technical improvements to \"Obamacare.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trent-lott-urges-gop-be-responsible-obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A former Republican Majority Leader thinks it's time for his party to do the right thing: pass some technical improvements to \"Obamacare.\"", "title": "Trent Lott urges GOP to be responsible on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trent-lott-urges-gop-be-responsible-obamacare", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap061107048805.jpg?itok=4u7EdnVp", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trent-lott-urges-gop-be-responsible-obamacare", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap061107048805.jpg?itok=X3QEeUHE", "height": 553}, "title": "Trent Lott urges GOP to be responsible on Obamacare", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A former Republican Majority Leader thinks it's time for his party to do the right thing: pass some technical improvements to \"Obamacare.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-04T13:05:29-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Trent Lott urges GOP to be responsible on Obamacare", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/04/2014 13:05:29 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trent-lott-urges-gop-be-responsible-obamacare"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "A former Republican Majority Leader thinks it's time for his party to do the right thing: pass some technical improvements to \"Obamacare.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "At this point, the only real threat to the Affordable Care Act is one ridiculous Supreme Court case.\nLott was asked specifically whether he would encourage GOP lawmakers to approve a technical fix.\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott encouraged his fellow Republicans on Thursday to work on a technical fix to the Affordable Care Act to ensure that those purchasing coverage on federally run exchanges would continue receiving subsidies.\nIt happened, he said, \u201calmost always.\u201d \u201cThere was always, on a major bill, we\u2019d have technical corrections, right?\nThere was nothing unusual about swift passage for the Welfare Reform Technical Corrections Act of 1997."}
