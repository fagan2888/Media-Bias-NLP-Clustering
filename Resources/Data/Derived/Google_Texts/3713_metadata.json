However, there is no sign-up deadline for low-income individuals who qualify for Medicaid. If you don\u2019t have health coverage during 2015, you may have to pay a penalty. The fee in 2015 is higher than it was for 2014 \u2013 2 percent of your income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child, whichever is more.\n\nEfforts to get people signed up for health insurance are paying off in Spokane County, where the percentage of residents without insurance has dropped to less than 3 percent of the population, according to estimates from the nonprofit Better Health Together.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have signed up for insurance since late 2013, about half of whom relied on trained \u201cassisters\u201d to help them navigate the state\u2019s online benefit exchange. The sign-ups have occurred at libraries, jails, food banks, health fairs and bus stops, as well as clinics and hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to where people are receiving services, rather than expecting them to do a Google search and find the Washington Health Benefit Exchange on their own,\u201d said Alison Carl White, executive director of Better Health Together.\n\nBefore the sign-ups, about 13 percent of Spokane County\u2019s residents were without health insurance, according to state estimates. About 85 percent of the newly insured qualified for Washington\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income adults.\n\nThe push to get people covered by insurance is occurring under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Better Health Together received an $858,000 state grant to recruit and train assisters in 14 counties, who answer questions and help people fill out applications. The 18-month grant covered communities in eastern and central Washington. The Spokane nonprofit spun off from Empire Health Foundation, which also provided financial support for the effort.\n\nAbout 150 people were trained as assisters in Spokane County, including 11 employees of the Spokane County Library District.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, we\u2019re the only library district in Washington state which is doing this,\u201d said Aileen Luppert, a librarian.\n\nShe got the idea from a Midwestern library, and figured it fit the Spokane County Library District\u2019s mission of providing information in a neutral setting. Library employees have helped 641 people sign up for health insurance over the past two years. Some had been without coverage for years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had women that would be crying in my office,\u201d Luppert said. \u201cI had one guy who\u2019d torn his hand open working on a motor. Rather than get stitches in the ER, he\u2019d sewn the gash shut.\u201d\n\nThe multitude of efforts to get people signed up for insurance also targeted individuals getting out of jail.\n\nRobert Martin, who works for the nonprofit Community Minded Enterprises, regularly visits the Spokane County Jail and Geiger Correctional Center to help inmates who are being released sign up for health insurance.\n\nCoverage is particularly important for that population, because they need the insurance to seek treatment for mental health and substance abuse, and to continue to get their prescriptions, Martin said.\n\nThough the drop in Spokane County\u2019s uninsured rate has been impressive, about 11,300 county residents remain without health insurance, said Curt Fackler, Better Health Together\u2019s network manager.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still work to be done,\u201d he said.\n\nSunday is the deadline for individuals to enroll in a qualified health plan through Washington and Idaho\u2019s health benefit exchanges. However, there is no sign up deadline for low-income individuals who qualify for Medicaid.\n\nBetter Health Together\u2019s next outreach effort will focus on helping the newly insured understand their benefits, so they get preventative care and screenings, said White, the executive director. \u201cHaving health insurance isn\u2019t going to make you healthier,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving access to care will.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Efforts to get people signed up for health insurance are paying off in Spokane County, where the percentage of residents without insurance has dropped to less than 3 percent of the population, according to estimates from the nonprofit Better Health Together.
