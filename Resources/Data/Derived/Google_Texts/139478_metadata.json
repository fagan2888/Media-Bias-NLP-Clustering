(Frank Franklin II/AP)\n\nThe effort \u2014 championed by the Daily News' Fight for Fair Pay campaign \u2014 spurred the Port Authority to order raises for all contract workers at area airports.\n\nThe region's roughly 12,000 airport contract workers are now making $10.10 an hour.\n\nBut the Aviation Safeguards workers say their bosses have repeatedly violated their rights and threatened to fire anyone who went on strike.\n\nAviation Safeguards managers have also forced employees to remove pro-union buttons and denied them such basic privileges as the use of lockers, workers say.\n\n\u201cWe have had MetroCards stolen, our food stolen,\u201d said Donna Hampton, 55, a Kennedy Airport security guard from New Jersey.\n\nKennedy Airport terminal workers and members of the 32BJ SEIU Union strike and picket in September. (Bryan Pace/For New York Daily News)\n\n\u201cWe will fight for every service industry until we get what we deserve,\u201d Hampton added.\n\nCraig Coy, CEO of the parent company of Aviation Safeguards, insists that his firm supports unions and has done nothing to dissuade workers from organizing or striking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not anti-union. We\u2019re pro-employee,\u201d said Coy, of the Virginia-based Command Security Corp.\n\nCoy says that the company pays wages mandated by the Port Authority and goes further than most contractors by helping to subsidize the health care offered through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe offer above the minimum compensation,\u201d he said.\n\nIt's not clear if the strike starting Wednesday night will affect operations at Kennedy Airport, pictured, and LaGuardia Airport. (Eric Thayer/Getty Images)\n\nThe Port Authority said it was working to prevent the disruption of regular airport operations.\n\n\u201cThe Port Authority has taken significant steps in recent years to encourage wage and benefit increases for employees of airline contractors at its airports, and will work to avoid disruptions of airline operations at PA airports,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nMark-Viverito said the workers had her full support.\n\n\"If you're here, it's because you believe that if you work hard day in and day out, you should take home enough to provide for yourself and your family,\" she said.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
