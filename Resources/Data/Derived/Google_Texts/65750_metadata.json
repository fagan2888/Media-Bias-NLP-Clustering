Adding to the challenge, the topic of health insurance is a conversation nonstarter for young adults, he added.\n\nWith no one-size-fits-all approach to engaging young aduls, Madrak, joined by expert panelists Linda Wharton Boyd, director of external affairs and stakeholder engagement for DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority, and Enroll America President Anne Filipic, shared their strategies to engage the hard-to-reach consumer population.\n\nThose included going to places where young consumers are, following consumer reactions as a marketing roadmap and using data to understand consumer behavior.\n\nThe District of Columbia's exchange enrolled the largest share of young adults. Wharton Boyd attributed its success to the motto \"Let's reach them where they live, where they work, work they play and where they pray.\"\n\nTo that end, DC Health Link brought marketing efforts to young adults at bars, clubs and restaurants and held events at places of worship. The D.C. exchange also implemented several events that drew on the pop culture appeal of the Sochii Winter Olympic Games, the NCAA's March Madness tournament and even tailgates for DC United soccer games, Wharton Boyd noted.\n\nFor successful exchange outreach, Enroll America--a coalition working on behalf of the Affordable Care Act--kept its attention on the consumer experience through multiple conversations and interactions to support them through the enrollment process, said Filipic.\n\nMoreover, Enroll America switched its marketing focus from considering consumer populations to creating strategies to reach those populations. For example, it zeroed in on community colleges to connect students to coverage and elementary schools to reach young parents.\n\nThe panelists also emphasized the major role data played in developing outreach campaigns for young adults. Marketing teams had to revisit their toolkit to create a strategy that went beyond mass-market ads to include digital and mobile enrollment efforts, according to Madrak. Enroll American dedicated more than $7 million to digital media, recognizing that digital allows marketers to target, track and test messages.\n\nWhile marketers can target ads based on an individual's web-browsing behavior, Filipic recommended zooming out. Stepping back from cookie-based targeting, Enroll American looked at ZIP codes of likely uninsured populations and got better click-through rates and engagement with online campaigns.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHHS: Young adults make up only 24% of exchange enrollees\n\nDC exchange enrolled the most young adults\n\nYoung adults engaged in their health but want convenience\n\nSurprising gender, age mix found in marketplace enrollment", "article_metadata": {"description": "Young adult sign-ups surged during the last few weeks of open enrollment but the coveted population presented the biggest marketing and outreach challenge for health insurance exchanges.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Young adult sign-ups surged during the last few weeks of open enrollment but the coveted population presented the biggest marketing and outreach challenge for health insurance exchanges.", "title": "Reaching young adults: Leaders share marketing best practices", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/outreach-young-adults-leaders-marketing-insurance-exchange/2014-05-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Enroll America,exchange outreach,Fierce Exclusive,health insurance exchange,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,marketing strategy,Young Adults", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "article_summary": "The panelists also emphasized the major role data played in developing outreach campaigns for young adults.\nAdding to the challenge, the topic of health insurance is a conversation nonstarter for young adults, he added.\nTo that end, DC Health Link brought marketing efforts to young adults at bars, clubs and restaurants and held events at places of worship.\nThe District of Columbia's exchange enrolled the largest share of young adults.\nRelated Articles:HHS: Young adults make up only 24% of exchange enrolleesDC exchange enrolled the most young adultsYoung adults engaged in their health but want convenienceSurprising gender, age mix found in marketplace enrollment"}
