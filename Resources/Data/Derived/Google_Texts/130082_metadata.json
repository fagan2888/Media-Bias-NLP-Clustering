Incorporate condoms and the color red, a universal symbol used in HIV prevention ads.\n\nAs the night marched on, men in fluorescent Lycra competed in a series of dance contests, pirouetting, high-kicking and duck-walking. Meanwhile, others went behind a white curtain strung up in the back of the hall, emerging with red bandages in the creases of their forearms. They had been tested for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nWelcome to the biggest \u201cvogue\u201d ball in Baltimore, where the stakes are high both on and off the runway. Performers here hope to walk away with bragging rights, trophies and cash prizes. Baltimore\u2019s health department, which organizes the ball, has a different incentive. It hopes to administer as many HIV tests as possible to curb the troublingly high rate of new infections.\n\nWith a population just over 622,000, the city ranks sixth in the country for highest rate of AIDS infection. According to 2012 estimates, roughly 2 percent of Baltimore\u2019s population, or approximately 13,000 people, is HIV positive. This demographic of dancers and their friends, made up almost entirely of gay black and Hispanic men and transgender women, is at the highest risk.\n\nAnd so, in an effort to reach a community that typically comes alive after midnight in darkened downtown clubs, the health department meets them halfway and hosts dance competitions, called vogue balls.\n\n\u201cPeople said they weren\u2019t comfortable, that they didn\u2019t know about the various resources the health department has,\u201d said Keith Holt, the youth outreach coordinator for the Baltimore City Health Department, and one of the ball\u2019s organizers.\n\nAs both a health department employee and a member of the LGBT community, Holt was able to bridge the gap between two worlds. \u201cWe decided instead of them coming to us, we\u2019d go to them.\u201d\n\nIn other cities, organizations often employ creative techniques to reach populations particularly vulnerable to HIV. In Washington, the nonprofit Metro TeenAIDS sponsors concerts to encourage young people to get tested, and to connect them with health services. In New York, the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis hosts the Latex Ball, one of the largest vogue balls in the country.\n\n\u201cVogueing\u201d is a combination of runway walking and dance that includes spins, dips, high kicks and hand gestures whose rigid placement appear almost mime-inspired. It originated in New York City nightclubs in the 1980s, and was the subject of award-winning 1990 documentary \u201cParis Is Burning.\u201d That same year, Madonna released a music video for her hit single \u201cVogue,\u201d launching the style into the mainstream.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fighting the spread of HIV by posing on the dance floor", "title": "Fighting the spread of HIV by posing on the dance floor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fighting the spread of HIV by posing on the dance floor", "title": "Fighting the spread of HIV by posing on the dance floor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/17/fighting_the_spread_of_hiv_by_posing_on_the_dance_floor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/vogue-ball-hiv.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fighting the spread of HIV by posing on the dance floor", "title": "Fighting the spread of HIV by posing on the dance floor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/vogue-ball-hiv.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Juliet Linderman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople said they weren\u2019t comfortable, that they didn\u2019t know about the various resources the health department has,\u201d said Keith Holt, the youth outreach coordinator for the Baltimore City Health Department, and one of the ball\u2019s organizers.\nAs both a health department employee and a member of the LGBT community, Holt was able to bridge the gap between two worlds.\nWelcome to the biggest \u201cvogue\u201d ball in Baltimore, where the stakes are high both on and off the runway.\nAs the night marched on, men in fluorescent Lycra competed in a series of dance contests, pirouetting, high-kicking and duck-walking.\nBaltimore\u2019s health department, which organizes the ball, has a different incentive."}
