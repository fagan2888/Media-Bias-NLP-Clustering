The Romans had bread and circuses to keep the masses passive and unthinking. We have electronic gadgets, drugs and pornography. Like the Roman Empire, we too may decline and fall. What happened in Paris may be just the beginning.\n\n\u25a0 With the \u201cglobal warming\u201d zealots predicting catastrophic consequences over the next century, I wonder if anyone has studied how accurate five-day weather forecasts turn out to be.\n\n\u25a0 Cheap shots at the police by politicians and the media are in fact very expensive, in terms of the human lives that are lost when the effectiveness of law enforcement is undermined.\n\n\u25a0 The sharp increase in murders in places like Baltimore, New York and other places where the police have been trashed, shows how expensive.\n\n\u25a0 It is bad enough to hear someone boasting about his past achievements.\n\nWhat is truly repulsive is hearing someone boasting about the future achievements he thinks he is going to have, as Donald Trump does repeatedly.\n\n\u25a0 Why have a national debt ceiling if it doesn\u2019t really put a ceiling on the national debt? What the national debt ceiling does is allow Democrats to gain votes by spending the government\u2019s money \u2014 and then force Republicans to share responsibility for raising the national debt ceiling, under threat of being blamed for shutting down the government if they don\u2019t.\n\n\u25a0 Since doctors have the same 24 hours a day as the rest of us, do believers in Obamacare understand that every hour a doctor spends filling out government forms is an hour that is not spent treating patients?\n\n\u25a0 With all the charges of \u201cracism\u201d against conservatives, has anyone noticed that Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s strongest supporters are in the conservative wing of the Republican party?\n\n\u25a0 In what part of the world is the situation better for America than it was when Barack Obama became President and Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State? If you want an easier question, in what part of the world is the situation worse?\n\n\u25a0 How ow can anyone consider it to be either logical or moral to force other people to be defenseless because of a theory without any factual evidence? Yet that is what gun control laws amount to.\n\n\u25a0 Some Americans will never appreciate America, until after they have helped destroy it, and have then begun to suffer the consequences.\n\n\u25a0 People who argue that the hostility to Israel in the Middle East is due to Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians should explain why hostility to Jews in the Middle East was so great back in the 1930s that Middle East leaders were pro-Hitler. This was long before there was a modern state of Israel or a Palestinian problem.\n\n\u25a0 If the 2016 election comes down to Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, my advice to the younger generation would be to try to find some other country to live in. Australia or New Zealand might be a good place to start looking.\n\n\u25a0 Now that President Obama has sent a few dozen American troops into Syria, will they be wearing sneakers, so that he can claim that he has kept his promise not to put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d?\n\n\u25a0 Racism is not dead. But it is on life-support, kept alive mainly by the people who use it for an excuse or to keep minority communities fearful or resentful enough to turn out as a voting bloc on election day.\n\n\u25a0 The way the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice has been used politically to put local police under siege, and to shield the administration\u2019s own law-breakers, suggests that the Department of Justice should be taken out of the control of any future administration, and made an independent agency like the Government Accountability Office.\n\n\u25a0 Have we become a country whose leaders are charlatans, and whose people are sheep?\n\n\u25a0 Our situation today reminds me of what Winston Churchill said to his bodyguard, after the king appointed Churchill prime minister in the darkest days during World War II: \u201cAll I hope is that it is not too late. I am very much afraid it is. We can only do our best.\u201d He had tears in his eyes.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Opinions", "og": {"site_name": "StAugustine.com", "description": "\u25a0 Some financial institutions may be considered \"too big to fail,\" but contemporary Western society may be too frivolous to survive.
