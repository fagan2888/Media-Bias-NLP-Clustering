And we made our budget more transparent and our government more accountable.\n\n\u201cMembers have had the chance to address the issues that are most important to them and their constituents, and I think they can return home proud of what they have achieved,\u201d Straus added.\n\nOther legislators, mostly in the Republican camp, felt the same way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a mixed bag,\u201d said state Rep. John Smithee, R-Amarillo, dean of the Texas Panhandle/South Plains delegation. \u201cIn every session the Legislature never accomplishes everything that\u2019s on its plate.\u201d\n\nAlthough overall the session deserves a good grade, some unfinished business includes a school funding bill, more state oversight of payday lenders and reforming the criminal justice system so 17-year-olds accused of a crime are tried as juveniles rather than as adults, he said.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to have done something with payday lending and I was disappointed that we were not able to do anything with the ability the Obamacare legislation gave Texas not to require employers to have to provide abortion coverage\u201d to insured employees, Smithee said.\n\n\u201cWe could very easily have done it but we didn\u2019t. ... But we got the budget; it passed rather easily.\u201d\n\nThe session was also a mixed bag for some Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhile I believe that this legislative session began and ended with a focus on the wrong priorities \u2014 tax breaks and guns instead of education and health care \u2014 we were able to stop some extremely bad proposals altogether, while working with the majority to improve other measures,\u201d said state Sen. Jose Rodriguez, D-El Paso.\n\nThe \u201cbad proposals\u201d Rodriguez listed included the sanctuary cities bill, which would have outlawed local ordinances aimed at protecting unauthorized immigrants; a proposal to repeal a 14-year law that allows some undocumented students to get in-state tuition at public colleges and universities, and legislation that would have discriminated against gays, lesbians and transgender people.\n\nFor his part, Houston state Rep. Gene Wu said he was disappointed legislation that would have raised the age at which teenagers accused of a crime can be tried as adults \u2014 from 17 to 18 years old \u2014 did not pass.\n\nNonetheless, since the proposal came close to passing, he is hopeful similar legislation can pass in the 2017 session, Wu said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what is best for our youth, counties and the state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nOther perennial proposals that failed again include a texting-while-driving ban, gradually outlawing red,light cameras, school vouchers, Las Vegas-type casino gambling, drug testing for some welfare applicants, overturning municipal plastic bag bans, and constitutional carry.\n\nState Rep. Four Price said he was not surprised those bills failed to pass.\n\n\u201cThere are always things that you like to see accomplished,\u201d said Price, R-Amarillo. \u201cBut it is impossible to satisfy everybody in a 140-day session.\n\n\u201cBut with respect to most pressing needs that we came into the session wanting to achieve, I think we accomplished that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith respect to tax relief and infrastructure demands that have now been dealt with to a large degree and the needs of the state have been met.\u201d\n\nThe $209 billion budget the Legislature approved in the final days of the session included a $3.8 billion tax cut, mostly for business owners.\n\nHowever, there was one issue most lawmakers seemed to agree on: They don\u2019t expect Gov. Greg Abbott to call them back for a special session, unless the Texas Supreme Court rules in favor of the more than 600 school districts suing the state and the ruling requires the Legislature\u2019s immediate attention.\n\nThe ruling is expected next year, more likely in late spring or in the summer, several months before the 85th Legislature convenes.\n\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed 3\u00bd years ago, followed by a state district judge siding with the plaintiffs in two separate trials \u2014 contends the Legislature is in violation of the Texas Constitution because it is not adequately funding the public school system.\n\n\u201cA special session on school finance is always a possibility every time we are sued,\u201d Smithee said.\n\nThe current school funding lawsuit is the sixth since the mid-1980s.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Latest News, Local News, News, ENRIQUE RANGEL, Gene Wu, Joe Straus, John Smithee, Jose Rodriguez", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "AUSTIN - In the Texas Legislature, a successful session is like beauty - in the eye of the beholder. \r\nFor instance, shortly after the 84th Texas Legislature adjourned last Monday, House Speaker Joe Straus called it a success.", "title": "Texas Legislature's session a success, but work remains", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2015-06-13/texas-legislatures-session-success-work-remains", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/CapitalDome1_031715.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "AUSTIN \u2014 In the Texas Legislature, a successful session is like beauty \u2014 in the eye of the beholder.For instance, shortly after the 84th Texas Legislature adjourned last Monday, House Speaker Joe Straus called it a success.\u201cI\u2019m proud of the way we addressed core issues,\u201d Straus, R-San Antonio, said in a statement.\u201cWe improved education and addressed transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cut taxes.
