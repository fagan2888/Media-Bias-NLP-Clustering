Photos of family, of owner Sam Macri and his wife, Tammy \u2014 and displayed prominently in the center of the restaurant \u2014 a photo of Sam making a pizza in his younger days at the Volcano Restaurant when it was located in downtown South Bend.\n\nFor 55 years, Sam says he\u2019s been in the kitchen doing what he loves \u2014 making people happy with good food. Now he is focused on his latest restaurant venture, Sam\u2019s Italian Kitchen, which opened at 910 E. Ireland Road, at the beginning of this month.\n\nSam has owned a number of successful restaurants over the years.\n\n\u201cI was debating between retirement, but I can\u2019t stay home,\u201d he says. \u201cI love what I do, and I love people.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s back cooking his old-fashioned Italian cuisine, recipes he says have barely changed in his lifetime. But nothing is written down, it\u2019s all in his head.\n\nSam\u2019s Italian Kitchen is open Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, it is open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. It is closed Monday.\n\nSam and Tammy are there early every morning preparing the food. The menu includes many of the pasta and meat dishes you would expect at a good Italian restaurant, as well as oven-baked subs, sandwiches, and of course, pizza.\n\nAnd Sam\u2019s pizza is something special. Every pie is a show as he tosses and twirls the dough in the air, a technique that, like his recipes, he says hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nHe grabs pieces of fresh Italian sausage for one pizza he\u2019s making, adding the meat to his homemade sauce and dough. He then grabs two big portobello mushroom caps and chops them right before they get added to the pizza as well.\n\nThen it\u2019s into the restaurant\u2019s brick oven.\n\nSam says the secret behind a great pizza is the dough, and his dough makes a great pizza with a crust that is both light and flaky, but firm enough to hold all the toppings on top without breaking.\n\nThe lunch buffet is a good way to sample many of Sam\u2019s dishes. Cost is $9.95 for a salad bar and a number of hot items,like pasta and some American choices like meatloaf and whatever pizzas Sam decides to put together that day.\n\nSam\u2019s Italian Kitchen also offers catering, and the restaurant has an entrance just for carryout orders.\n\nWinter Restaurant Week\n\nWinter Restaurant Week is back, beginning Monday and running through Feb. 7. Presented by the Downtown Dining Association of South Bend and Downtown South Bend Inc., the week features 16 restaurants in downtown South Bend.\n\nParticipating locations will offer value-priced menu items at $11, $22 or $33, depending on the establishment, with about 10 percent of proceeds going to the Memorial Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nReservations are encouraged for many of the locations, according to a news release, and diners should mention Restaurant Week when reserving a table.
