It\u2019s just an overwhelming crush of IT requirements that are on top of basic system maintenance and upgrades.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the proposed requirement should ensure that the infrastructure for supporting electronic transactions is in place and working correctly, cutting down on manual efforts to reconcile claims.\n\n\u201cThe provider and the plan would have to test that process so there would at least be some burden, but the upside for providers that participate in the testing process is that they know that their systems will be able to communicate with the health plan,\u201d Gottlieb continues. \u201cEven though the electronic transaction standards have been in place for years, over a decade, many of the plans are not sending back fully HIPAA-compliant electronic remittance advice or other transactions. This is hopefully a way for more of the transactions to be truly compliant with requirements.\u201d\n\nSo what exactly is required of health plans under this proposed rule? When put into effect, the provision would require health plans to submit documentation that they are in compliance with three HIPAA electronic transaction standards:\n\n\u2022 eligibility for a health plan\n\n\u2022 healthcare claim status\n\n\u2022 health care electronic funds transfers (EFT) and remittance advice\n\nAs the proposed rule published last week in the Federal Register states, the responsibility for administering this requirement will fall to the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare\u2019s Committee on Operating Rules (CAQH CORE) with health plans having to apply for one of two certification credentials: the CORE Phase III Seal (already in existence) or HIPAA credential (under development). Though both rigorous, the latter should prove less so than the former, claims Gottlieb, and should lead to most health plans opting to pursue that credential.\n\nThe process for certifying compliance, however, does not end there. In fact, there is an added wrinkle concerning penalties for non-compliant health plans, one that may double their concerns \u2014 a penalty scheme on top of those penalties that could be assessed under HIPAA for covered entities. \u201cFor a health plan that is not compliant with the electronic transactions rule, there could be penalties assessed for violating HIPAA and then there could also be penalties assessed for failing to timely certify compliance or for submitting a false certification of compliance under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d reveals Gottlieb.\n\nAlthough the proposed compliance date for these electronic transactions standards will not occur until Dec. 31, 2015, it will force health plans and their partners (i.e., providers) to add another project to their operating plan in order to accommodate its requirements.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A provision of the Accountable Care Act concerning the certification of compliance for health plans will have both a positive and negative impact on healthcare.", "author": "EHRIntelligence", "og": {"url": "https://ehrintelligence.com/news/health-plan-certification-compliance-to-impact-providers", "site_name": "EHRIntelligence", "image": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/EHRintel_daniel-gottlieb.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Health plan certification compliance to impact providers"}, "twitter": {"description": "A provision of the Accountable Care Act concerning the certification of compliance for health plans will have both a positive and negative impact on healthcare.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/EHRintel_daniel-gottlieb.jpg"}, "title": "Health plan certification compliance to impact providers", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda20\"", "article_summary": "On the one hand, it adds to the responsibilities of healthcare providers and health plans in the form of additional testing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty lengthy process because the health plans are required to do testing really for either of the credentials with their trading partners, the healthcare providers that are submitting claims for reimbursement to the health plan,\u201d Gottlieb observes.\nThough both rigorous, the latter should prove less so than the former, claims Gottlieb, and should lead to most health plans opting to pursue that credential.\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s late and they\u2019ve been looking for it, health plans and providers are overwhelmed by all the various IT changes because you have ICD-10 that goes online this year and the unique health plan identifier as well,\u201d explains Gottlieb.\nA provision of the Accountable Care Act concerning the certification of compliance for health plans will have both a positive and negative impact on the healthcare industry, says healthcare lawyer Daniel Gottlieb, Partner at McDermott Will & Emery LLP."}
