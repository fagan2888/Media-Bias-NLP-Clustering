A former accountant who had not sought public office until he was elected in 2010, he had cultivated a reputation as an able administrator who would bring a businessman\u2019s eye to state and local government.\n\nBut two forays into local government blew up in recent weeks as serious questions were raised about decisions made by emergency managers appointed by him in Flint and in Detroit, where the public schools are deteriorating physically and are close to insolvency. Mr. Snyder addressed both in his speech, as well as concerns about the state\u2019s aging infrastructure. In both cases, his administration\u2019s competence and compassion were questioned, and critics noted that both cities were predominantly black.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press demanded full accountability, starting with the governor\u2019s emails, which under state law were protected from public scrutiny. On Monday, protesters marched outside Mr. Snyder\u2019s apartment building in Ann Arbor, demanding his arrest. As he prepared to deliver his address, demonstrators waited outside the Capitol, waving signs calling for justice.\n\n\u201cWhat took the governor so long to do something about this?\u201d asked Dan Reyes, 46, an autoworker and Flint resident who brought bottles full of the city\u2019s tap water to offer to legislators. \u201cThe message is clear to us: Flint is a predominantly minority, poor community. In Flint, you don\u2019t matter to Snyder\u2019s brand of politician.\u201d\n\nOver and over on Tuesday, Mr. Snyder expressed contrition, referring to the matter as a \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d saying \u201cmistakes\u201d had been made and promising to pray for the people of Flint.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he also left residents of the city, whose population has dwindled with the departure of the auto industry to fewer than 100,000, with unanswered questions. Why did state officials switch the source of its water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, known to locals as a dumping ground for trash and pollutants? Why did it take months before complaints about the water\u2019s odor and rusty color were taken seriously? Who knew about the lead problem, and when? Would it have happened at all in a city populated by affluent white people?\n\nIn Michigan, whose state Legislature is controlled by Republicans, members of Mr. Snyder\u2019s party have sprung to his defense. Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of Michigan\u2019s Republican Party, said she was confident in Mr. Snyder\u2019s ability to help fix Flint\u2019s water problems.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s turned our state around,\u201d Ms. McDaniel said. \u201cI think he is the perfect governor to help lead us through this crisis. I know he will be solution-oriented and action-oriented.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats, furious over the slow response to complaints over Flint water, said the blame fell directly on the governor.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201c\u201cFrom the very beginning,\u201d Brandon Dillon, the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said before Mr. Snyder\u2019s address, \u201chis style of governance has been to put the bottom line over what\u2019s in the best interest of health and safety.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Representative Dan Kildee, a Democrat whose district includes Flint, rejected the idea that $28 million was enough to fix the Flint water crisis. Exposure to even small amounts of lead is linked to long-term developmental issues and other problems in children.\n\n\u201cThat is a fraction of the money city residents have paid for poisoned water that they cannot drink,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFlint deserves an immediate response equal to the gravity of this ongoing public health emergency. A state-appointed emergency financial manager created this problem, and the state must step up and do more to help Flint families and children right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Snyder has tried to stay above the political fray. Running under the slogan \u201cOne Tough Nerd,\u201d he was elected in the Republican wave that swept Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Gov. Paul LePage of Maine into office. He has spent his brief political career promoting \u201crelentless positive action,\u201d in his oft-deployed and characteristically cheerful phrase, over partisan politics.\n\nIn 2013, he angered many Republicans in Michigan by allowing a Medicaid expansion in his state as part of the Affordable Care Act. Yet he also dismayed Democrats when he signed a bill in 2012 making Michigan a \u201cright to work\u201d state, a measure that diminishes the power of organized labor.\n\nMichigan\u2019s governors are subject to term limits, so Mr. Snyder will not be running for re-election in 2018.\n\nArthur Woodson, a Flint resident who has helped organize and lead protests drawing attention to the city\u2019s water situation for more than a year, said he had not voted for Mr. Snyder but had initially been somewhat optimistic about his leadership.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to get in and be more moderate and work with the people,\u201d said Mr. Woodson, who was helping protesters board buses traveling to Lansing on Tuesday. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t been that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160119170012, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, and I will fix it,\u201d he said in a State of the State address in which he focused on an issue that has consumed the state and drawn national attention.", "title": "Gov.
