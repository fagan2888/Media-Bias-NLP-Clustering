Bush flies over what was once a beach community in Cameron, LA, 27 September 2005 during an aerial tour of the Lousiana and Texas areas recently affected by Hurricane Rita. It was the president's seventh trip to the battered US Gulf Coast since killer Hurricane Katrina churned ashore 29 August 2005, followed by Hurricane Rita.

No lives were lost. But some who fled had nothing to come home to.\n\nRita brought strong winds, tornadoes and storm surge to places such as Cameron and Vermilion parishes. Homes were swept from their foundations, leaving nothing but steps leading up to empty cement slabs. One Boston man reported a 12-foot storm surge that sent water into the second floor of a two-story house. Houses that survived the flood of Hurricane Audrey in 1957 didn\u2019t fare as well this time around.\n\nShrimp boats in places such as Cameron, which reported a 20-foot storm surge, were tossed onto roadways. Caskets popped up from mausoleums and graves, floating into the marshes. Schools and businesses such as Booth\u2019s Grocery in Grand Chenier were flattened. Nothing was left of camps and homes on Holly Beach except wooden pilings and scattered debris. Cattle were stranded, trapped by the floodwaters. When the water receded, salt from Gulf waters coated fields, damaging crops and hay used for livestock feed.\n\nBack then, Congressman Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, referred to Rita as \u201cthe forgotten storm.\u201d Ten years later, he still does.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Boustany recognized early on the effects of Rita amnesia. All the talk was about Katrina.\n\n\u201cI had to make sure all legislation working through the House and Senate also pertained to the effects of Hurricane Rita,\u201d he said. \u201cThe danger was it was going to be the forgotten storm.\u201d\n\nA lot of people at first said they wouldn\u2019t rebuild, Sherrill Sagrera of Vermilion Parish said. More came back than he thought would do so.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, though. Many who chose to rebuild were forced to elevate buildings. The bureaucracy involved in getting permits and complying with new regulations was a headache.\n\nBut doing so saved some homeowners from a second blow in 2008 when Hurricane Ike sent storm surge sweeping across the Louisiana coast before making landfall in Galveston, Texas.\n\nSagrera was still rebuilding his house, damaged by Rita, when Ike swept through. Luckily, he had elevated his house, which was spared the second round of damage.\n\n\u201cGot beat down by Rita. Got beat down by Ike. I\u2019m still here,\u201d Sagrera said.\n\nTen years later, Sagrera said not much has been done to protect southwest Louisiana from another Rita.\n\nThere\u2019s been some restoration work, such as marsh creation and shoreline stabilization, which will help some, but none of the large protection projects that were in the working drafts of the Boustany Study, now called the Southwest Coastal Study, he said.\n\nWhat started with more than 300 projects was reduced to some 12 to 15 projects, none of them hurricane protection, Sagrera said.\n\n\u201cAs much money and the time we spent on that study and that\u2019s what we come out with. It\u2019s not very good for the old Cajun,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vermilion Parish School System weathered a tremendous amount of damage brought on by Hurricane Rita. Several feet of water rushed into classrooms, forcing campuses to close in the southern portion of the parish and students and teachers to relocate to finish out the school year.\n\n\u201cWe were not prepared,\u201d Vermilion Parish School System Superintendent Jerome Puyau said. \u201cNo one thought we would be inundated with as much water and as much damage.\u201d\n\nStorm damage forced Henry Elementary school to be demolished and replaced by LeBlanc Elementary School in Abbeville. Dozier Elementary School in Erath sustained severe water damage. The school was eventually renovated, this time with a six-foot concrete flood wall with a pump system. \u201cAnd then we have Seventh Ward Elementary School in Abbeville. It has a berm and concrete wall,\u201d Puyau said. \u201cSo those facilities are secure. We are currently awaiting the final approval for the concrete wall around Erath High and Erath Middle. We are just waiting for final approval through the local police jury.\u201d\n\nA decade later, school administrators are required to follow a lengthy, storm preparedness checklist.\n\n\u201cIt takes a little time, but at least we can ensure that our property is protected,\u201d the superintendent said.\n\nThe southwest Louisiana coast is still vulnerable, but much has been done to build stronger and better. Several projects are under way, funded through the Coastal Wetlands Protection and Restoration Act, to restore marsh and they\u2019re working, Boustany said Friday.\n\n\u201cCoastal restoration efforts are ongoing because they\u2019re vital to protection,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limiting factor has been funding.\u201d\n\nBoustany said the people of southwest Louisiana are resilient, especially in Vermilion, Cameron and Calcasieu parishes where the recovery has been remarkable. There\u2019s been unprecedented commercial investment in the area in recent years.\n\nFacts about Hurricane Rita\n\n\u2022Hurricane Rita was the fourth\u2013most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded and the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\u2022It was part of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which included three of the six most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded.\n\n\u2022Nearly 20,000 single-family dwellings sustained major damage or were completely destroyed. Another 26,000 single-family dwellings received some damage.\n\n\u2022Throughout the path of Rita, damage totaled about $12 billion.\n\n\u2022Electric service was disrupted in some areas of both Texas and Louisiana for several weeks.\n\n\u2022Texas reported the most deaths from the hurricane, where 113 deaths were reported.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/09/19/southwest-louisiana-remembers-hurricane-rita/72479246/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ten years ago, Hurricane Rita devastated Southwest Louisiana", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "Ten years ago, Hurricane Rita devastated Southwest Louisiana", "title": "Southwest Louisiana remembers Hurricane Rita", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/09/19/southwest-louisiana-remembers-hurricane-rita/72479246/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ten years ago, Hurricane Rita devastated Southwest Louisiana", "title": "Southwest Louisiana remembers Hurricane Rita", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6bab92e932946cfc8a6fbdfcd8763edd2a2f2c0/c=800-0-2201-1401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/19/Opelousas/B9318919295Z.1_20150919160520_000_GTABVG1TG.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81b7\"", "article_summary": "It was the president's seventh trip to the battered US Gulf Coast since killer Hurricane Katrina churned ashore 29 August 2005, followed by Hurricane Rita.\nTen years later, Sagrera said not much has been done to protect southwest Louisiana from another Rita.\n\u201cI had to make sure all legislation working through the House and Senate also pertained to the effects of Hurricane Rita,\u201d he said.\nThe southwest Louisiana coast is still vulnerable, but much has been done to build stronger and better.\nProbably because Katrina was so devastating and killed so many, most residents of southwest Louisiana \u2014 especially in vulnerable coastal communities \u2014 fled to higher ground before Rita\u2019s arrival."}
