For the rest of those living in the U.S. who do not have schizophrenia, it\u2019s hard to imagine what living with this condition is really like. Thanks to social media, those living with schizophrenia and other mental health disorders are able to share their story and give the world a bit of an idea of what it\u2019s like to walk a day in their shoes.\n\nScottie Long is just one of many schizophrenia patients who has documented his episodes on his YouTube channel. What makes his videos so truly fascinating is the heightened awareness that Long experiences when he distinguishes a hallucination from reality. \u201cObviously, this probably is an episode, but I just want to show you what can happen to you or your kid if you don\u2019t get your s--- done and get it done early, for detection, for any kind of mental illness. This is what life could be like,\u201d Long says in the video. You can witness his hallucinations in real time as he answers a phone, although it doesn\u2019t ring, and as he checks outside his house for \u201cpeople watching him,\u201d although the camera shows there is no one there.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, those with schizophrenia may hear voices other people don\u2019t hear, will believe people are reading their minds or controling their thoughts, and, as shown in Long\u2019s video, even hallucinate. \u201cIn the shower, I seen four or five people looking in the mirror at me when I looked at the shower door. \u2026 It freaked me out,\u201d Long explains, showing just how frightening living with this condition can be.\n\nLong\u2019s video is unsettling, and his warning of treating mental illness before it progress too far is heard loud and clear.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "man, schizophrenia, records, episode, give, glimpse, life, disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A man records his schizophrenia episodes on YouTube to give insight into what it's like to live with this severe mental condition.", "title": "Man Records Schizophrenia Episode To Give Glimpse Into Disorder [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-schizophrenia-records-episode-give-glimpse-life-disorder-306917", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/man-schizophrenia.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man records his schizophrenia episodes on YouTube to give insight into what it's like to live with this severe mental condition.", "title": "Man Records Schizophrenia Episode To Give Glimpse Into Disorder [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-schizophrenia-records-episode-give-glimpse-life-disorder-306917", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/man-schizophrenia.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/man-schizophrenia.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-13T17:10:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T17:10:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man records his schizophrenia episodes on YouTube to give insight into what it's like to live with this severe mental condition."}, "article_summary": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition believed to affect around three million Americans.\nLong\u2019s video is unsettling, and his warning of treating mental illness before it progress too far is heard loud and clear.\nFor the rest of those living in the U.S. who do not have schizophrenia, it\u2019s hard to imagine what living with this condition is really like.\nScottie Long is just one of many schizophrenia patients who has documented his episodes on his YouTube channel.\n\u2026 It freaked me out,\u201d Long explains, showing just how frightening living with this condition can be."}
