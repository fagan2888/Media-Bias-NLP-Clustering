Do you have an issue? Call our volunteers 11 a.m.-1 p.m. weekdays at 602-260-1212 or file a complaint at call12.azcentral.com.\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com Sat Nov 23, 2013 7:18 PM\n\nAs controversy swirls around the Affordable Care Act and the problems for Americans seeking health insurance under it, many covered under Medicare are facing issues of their own.\n\nConsumers shopping for Medicare during open enrollment, which runs through Dec. 7, are suffering from sticker shock over plan prices that take effect in January. That includes doubling of some premiums for prescription drugs.\n\nMesa resident Robert Johnson said he isn\u2019t just shocked by prices. He is scared the increases in premiums will leave him unable to pay for the medicine that is keeping him alive.\n\n\u201cEverybody is worried about Obamacare. But what about people on Medicare?\u201d said Johnson, a 58-year-old former computer programer who receives disability because of an immune-system deficiency disease. \u201cI have insurance. I\u2019m on disability. But if I can\u2019t get the medicine, I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\nMedicare specialists agree that Johnson and others in his situation have a right to be concerned. They say patients who depend on certain drugs under Medicare plans are always vulnerable to price hikes and rising premiums.\n\nRitch Steven, past president of the Arizona AARP, said the type of drugs Johnson seeks are \u201cnotoriously, horrendously expensive\u201d and that his insurer can drop coverage of a drug or increase costs without warning.\n\n\u201cThe costs he is running into have nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Steven said.\n\nJohnson said calls to his insurer and to the drug manufacturer initially went nowhere, with company representatives disregarding his calls and offering no alternatives other than to suggest shopping for other plans. As the open-enrollment deadline looms, Johnson said he has grown desperate.\n\nJohnson said he is required to pay a $50 copay for prescription drugs under his current Medicare Advantage Plan, which he has through Abrazo Health Care.\n\nUnder the 2014 plan, Abrazo will require Johnson to pay 20 percent of the drug\u2019s cost out of pocket. Based on his calculations, that could cost Johnson $1,000-$3,000 per week based on the price of the drug, which he can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe drug, called Hizentra, is self-administered through an infusion pump and is used to treat primary immunodeficiency, genetic disorders that prevent the immune system from functioning properly.\n\nJohnson, who suffers from hypogammaglobulinemia, compared his situation to the boy in a bubble, although he doesn\u2019t have to live in isolation. Johnson said he was diagnosed when he was 6. He, his brother and two nephews were part of a National Institutes of Health study of the disorder in the 1960s.\n\nHe said the disorder manifests itself differently in each afflicted person. The drug helps him stave off infections and prevents him from becoming sick.\n\n\u201cIt is my immune system in a bottle,\u201d he said. \u201cAn average person goes to bed at night and your body replenishes your immune system. My body doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHizentra is manufactured by CSL Behring, a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Australia. Company representatives in the United States said last week that there is little they can do to help Johnson.\n\nSheila Burke, CSL director of communications in Maryland, confirmed that Johnson\u2019s price estimates \u201ccould be\u201d accurate but would not provide the actual cost of the drug. \u201cSome of these (immune-deficiency drugs) are priced at a higher price point,\u201d Burke said.\n\nShe encouraged him to sign up for assistance through PSI, a non-profit government-subsidized program that assists eligible patients with drug costs. She said enrollment through PSI will begin in January.\n\nHowever, Burke acknowledged that she could not guarantee that Johnson would be eligible or that the drug he needs would be covered under the assistance program, saying \u201cthe product and the therapeutic area that is covered\u201d often varies.\n\nAbrazo officials offered more hope. After being contacted last week by Call 12 for Action, officials with the company called Johnson and offered to try to help him find a cheaper, comparable drug and to work with him to reduce his copayments.\n\n\u201cThe health plan makes every possible effort to manage each member\u2019s unique health-care need,\u201d Abrazo spokeswoman Lisa Schmidtke said.\n\n\u201cAlthough I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics of any member\u2019s case, I can tell you that we often will research therapeutic options that might be more affordable for our members. In addition, we explore financial-assistance options for our members through various services that are available if a member qualifies.\u201d\n\nSteven, who volunteers with AARP on Medicare and other health issues, said most people sign up for Medicare Advantage plans because of the low-cost options. But he said that can be a double-edged sword when someone requires a specialized drug.\n\n\u201cAbrazo has the authority under Medicare Part D to change costs. That\u2019s their call,\u201d Steven said. \u201cThey can drop coverage of a drug. They can do that and you are out of luck.\u201d\n\nSteven said individuals in Johnson\u2019s predicament need to fight for help. He encouraged Johnson to contact his doctor and appeal in writing to Abrazo.\n\n\u201cIf the doctor feels this is a lifesaving medication, he can advocate through a letter that (the insurance company) \u2018needs to make this available to him,\u2019 \u201d Steven said. He said most people on Medicare can\u2019t afford to shop the open market for insurance, which is a key component of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMedicare is government health insurance for people age 65 years and older and for those on disability.\n\nAccording to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation website, of 36 million people enrolled in Part D Medicare plans, about 22.7 million are in prescription-drug plans.\n\n\u201cThe average premium (weighted by enrollment) is expected to increase by 5 percent across all (prescription-drug plans) from 2013 to 2014, unless many new or current enrollees select lower-priced plans,\u201d the website states. \u201cEnrollees in two of the most popular (prescription-drug plans) will experience 50 percent premium increases if they stay in the same plans in 2014.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he can\u2019t afford other options and can\u2019t qualify for low-income plans because his Social Security disability income is too high. Johnson said he believes the changes in Medicare are affecting thousands of Americans and he hopes that his story will raise awareness about the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m facing death. It leaves me quite annoyed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for me. I\u2019m 58 and I was supposed to be dead more than 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nRobert Anglen and Veronica Sanchez lead the Call 12 for Action team.
