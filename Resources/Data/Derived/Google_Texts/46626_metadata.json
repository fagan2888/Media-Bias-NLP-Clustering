Of those 42 indicators, 36 are used to uncover trends over the years.\n\nIt found performance continuing to lag in some states on numerous indicators. Overall, the states at the top and bottom stayed the same as those in the previous measure. Those at the top were Minnesota, Vermont, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, while those at the bottom were Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Mississippi.\n\nAmong the report's key findings were four low performing states improved on numerous measures: Louisiana on 16, Oklahoma on 14, and Kentucky and Tennessee on 13. Other notable states were Colorado, Florida, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, Missouri, and South Carolina, which only dropped down on one measure each while they improved on between six and 10 measures.\n\n\u201cThese are the most substantial and widespread state improvements in access to care we\u2019ve seen since we created the state scorecard series in 2007,\u201d stated Commonwealth Fund President Dr. David Blumenthal. \u201cWhile there are still wide differences among states, and performance has worsened in some instances, policy changes like those in the Affordable Care Act, incentives to improve healthcare quality and safety, and provider-led efforts are beginning to bear fruit.\u201d\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund: New Commonwealth Fund State Health System Scorecard Finds More Improvement Than Decline Nationwide\n\nUSA Today : Rankings: More states improve than worsen on most health measures", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/d9/8a/d98a7110c78def967212c8753f397fdc.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "States largely improved health measures, Commonwealth Fund finds", "pub_date": "dec 11, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-11T09:00:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, December 11, 2015, 09:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-11-28T09:00:00", "teaser": "<p>The organization&#39;s annual scorecard&nbsp;attributes improvements in part to the ACA.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-12-11", "sailthru.description": "The organization's annual scorecard\u00a0attributes improvements in part to the ACA.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The organization's annual scorecard\u00a0attributes improvements in part to the ACA.", "title": "States largely improved health measures, Commonwealth Fund finds", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/states-largely-improved-health-measures-commonwealth-fund-finds/410633/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/GDP_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/04/f6/04f600affb238d38de51f0a6934ee3e2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Among the report's key findings were four low performing states improved on numerous measures: Louisiana on 16, Oklahoma on 14, and Kentucky and Tennessee on 13.\nDive Brief:The Commonwealth Fund\u2019s 2015 state healthcare system scorecard finds that overall, systems improved in more ways than they declined since the previous performance measure in 2014.\nThis fourth edition of the Commonwealth state scorecard looks at changes that occurred in 2013 and 2014, making it the first in the series to reflect the impacts of a full year under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s major health insurance expansions.\n\u201cThese are the most substantial and widespread state improvements in access to care we\u2019ve seen since we created the state scorecard series in 2007,\u201d stated Commonwealth Fund President Dr. David Blumenthal.\nCommonwealth The report concludes that overall, access to healthcare was substantially improved and there were gains in quality and safety, but that there continue to be \"stark\" performance differences between states."}
