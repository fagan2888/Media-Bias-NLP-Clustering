I am grateful for what I have learned through the process and will always take it with me.\u201d\n\nIt was back in 2010 that Hudson opened up about being motivated to shed some pounds.\n\nShe recalled a time when she couldn\u2019t even recognize herself .\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was me,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI was like, \u201cWho?\u2026 Oh, my God, this is me.\u2019 And now when I look back, wow, look at the difference from then to now.\u201d\n\nShe also sat down with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres in 2011 and revealed she had already slimmed down from a size 16 to a size 6.\n\nShe also said that her focus was to just get back her body and get back to a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI just wanted my body back,\u201d she told DeGeneres. \u201cWhatever body that was.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hudson is stepping down, the weight loss company will still have another major star boasting about its product.\n\nJessica Simpson is still the face of the company and has dropped 70 pounds since 2012.\n\nSimpson\u2019s weight loss journey has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride as she struggled to lose her pregnancy weight.\n\nAfter teaming up with Weight Watchers, however, Simpson has managed to kiss the extra pounds goodbye.\n\nEarlier this year Simpson posted a picture of herself in a fitted white dress to celebrate her new figure.\n\n\u201cFirst time rocking a white dress this year\u2026but not the last!!\u201d The caption read. \u201cThanks @weightwatchers.\u201d\n\nWeight Watchers also said they believe Hudson will continue using their product even though she has stepped down from the ambassador position.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "Jennifer Hudson is stepping down from her role as a Weight Watchers spokesperson after losing about 80 pounds\u00a0with the program.
