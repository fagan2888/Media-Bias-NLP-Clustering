She did not mention Mr. Obama by name, and alluded to her candidacy only coyly.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be here regardless of whatever else I was doing,\u201d she said to laughter and raucous applause. \u201cEvery one of you proves that, no matter who you are, or where you come from, you too can be a champion for change. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a student, or an artist, a journalist, an ambassador\u2014maybe even a future president.\u201d\n\nMs. Clinton described the economic struggles her own mother, once a housemaid, had endured during her impoverished childhood. Sounding not unlike Mr. Obama or Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2014a Clinton prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who has yet to endorse the former Senator from New York\u2014attacked the inherent unfairness of low-income circumstances.\n\n\u201cNo one deserves to grow up like that. Everyone deserves a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Clinton railed against the continued problems of domestic violence, sexual assault and unequal earnings that women face. She called the movement to greater female participation in societies worldwide \u201cthe great unfinished business of the 21st century,\u201d and attacked conservative strictures and institutions she claimed hold women back.\n\n\u201cDeep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,\u201d she said.\n\nShe turned her ire in particular on the absence of federal legislation requiring employers grant parents paid family leave, which she said marked the United States out from the rest of the Western world.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that America is the only country in the developed world that doesn\u2019t guaranteed paid leave to mothers of newborns,\u201d she said, recalling her daughter Chelsea\u2019s recent childbirth. \u201cThe lack of quality affordable childcare, unequal pay, work schedules that are not only far from predictable or flexible, but are often simply unfair, fall disproportionately heavily on women.\u201d\n\nShe even used the f-word, citing statistics from the World Economic Forum, which she said is \u201chardly a hotbed of feminist thought,\u201d that ranked the U.S. 65th out of 100 nations in pay parity between genders.\n\nA former opponent of gay marriage, Ms. Clinton paid lip service to the problems of discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity. She also lashed out at the enemies of the Obama administration and the current Republican field, citing those who contested the Affordable Care Act, opposed immigration reform and fought the nomination of Loretta Lynch as attorney general.\n\n\u201cThere are those who offer themselves as leaders who take a very different view. Who offer themselves as leaders who see nothing wrong with denying women equal pay. Who offer themselves as leaders who would de-fund the country\u2019s leading provider of family planning, and who want to once again let health insurance companies charge women just because of our gender,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are those who offer themselves as leaders who would deport mothers working to give their children a better life rather than risk the ire of talk radio, there are those who offer themselves as leaders who even play politics with the nomination of our nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are not the way to move America forward, it isn\u2019t leadership, it\u2019s not going to create a single job, raise anyone\u2019s wages or strengthen our families,\u201d she added.\n\nIronically, the event took place in the David Koch Theater, named for the conservative oil mogul and activist who donates heavily to Lincoln Center. Mr. Koch told the Observer on Monday that he believed Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would defeat Ms. Clinton \u201cby a major margin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Will Bredderman", "sailthru.author": "Will Bredderman", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/470550826.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/470550826.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, David Koch, Hillary Clinton, Hobby Lobby, immigration reform, paid family leave, Scott Walker, Women in the World Summit, Women's Rights, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "women in the world summit, hillary clinton, barack obama, 2016, david koch, scott walker, women's rights, paid family leave, hobby lobby, affordable care act, immigration reform", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/470550826.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "Women in the World Summit, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, 2016, David Koch, Scott Walker, women's rights, paid family leave, Hobby Lobby, Affordable Care Act, immigration reform", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Hillary Clinton Hits Progressive Notes at Women\u2019s Forum", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "will-bredderman", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/470550826.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "The historically moderate Hillary Clinton appeared to make her appeal to liberal Democrats at the sixth annual Women in the World Forum.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/also-me-e1411752505895.jpg?quality=80&w=129", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-04-24T00:13:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T21:45:01+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/will-bredderman"}, "sailthru.description": "The historically moderate Hillary Clinton appeared to make her appeal to liberal Democrats at the sixth annual Women in the World Forum.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "The historically moderate Hillary Clinton appeared to make her appeal to liberal Democrats at the sixth annual Women in the World Forum.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Hits Progressive Notes at Women\u2019s Forum", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hits-progressive-notes-at-womens-forum/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/470550826.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 884}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Will Bredderman is a politics reporter at the Observer.
