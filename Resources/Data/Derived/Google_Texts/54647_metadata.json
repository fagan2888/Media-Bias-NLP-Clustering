The Internet startup depended on YouTube to promote \u201cHokey-Pokey,\u201d \u201dThe Umm Nyum Nyum Song\u201d and other language-teaching clips it produces for children, but the video-sharing website has been banned in Pakistan for nearly a year.\n\nThe measure was imposed to block videos that Muslims took as insulting and blasphemous. But the unintended consequence has been frustration for many companies, educators and students. A petition to end Internet censorship is before a Pakistani court, and a debate has been rekindled over how to reconcile the right to a free flow of information with a widespread public sentiment that Islam needs special protections.\n\nToffeeTV has had to save its clips on its own servers and delay the rollout of its apps, says company co-founder Rabia Garib. \u201cIt threw us off our feet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re off schedule by about eight months.\u201d\n\nWhile the tech-savvy have ways to get around the ban, the vast majority of Pakistanis who try to view YouTube get this: \u201cSurf Safely! \u2026 The site you are trying to access contains content that is prohibited for viewership from within Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThe made-in-America trailer for \u201cInnocence of Muslims,\u201d the movie of which has never reached cinemas, provoked uproar throughout the Muslim world, and several U.S. diplomatic missions were targeted. In Pakistan, clashes between police and protesters left 19 people dead.\n\nYouTube as well as Facebook were initially blocked although the government soon exempted Facebook, saying it removed the offensive material. At the time, U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration asked Google, YouTube\u2019s parent, to take down the video. But the company refused, saying the trailer didn\u2019t violate its content standards.\n\nThe only other countries that block YouTube are Tajikistan, China and Iran, according to Google\u2019s transparency report that tracks restrictions of its products. Another 56 countries have localized versions of YouTube that allow for tailoring content to local standards.\n\nPakistan, a nation of roughly 180 million, has a democratically elected government and a legal system inherited from its former British rulers. But that system also contains significant religious strictures, and disputes over religion frequently end in bloodshed. So at the time the YouTube ban was imposed, many saw it as a necessary calming measure.\n\nNow an advocacy group called Bytes for All is petitioning the Lahore High Court to order an end to all Internet censorship.\n\nMuzzling YouTube \u201ccould lead to the opening up of an entire Pandora\u2019s box of moral policing and dictatorial controls despite the democracy being in place,\u201d said Furhan Hussain of Bytes for All.\n\nAt the organization\u2019s Islamabad offices, activists say the YouTube case is just the latest example. Over the years the government has periodically banned Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, but the YouTube ban has lasted the longest.\n\nIt can be circumvented via VPNs, virtual private networks that mask the user\u2019s computer but are prone to viruses and slow the Internet connection.\n\nThese proxies are too cumbersome for his staff to deal with, says Jawwad Ahmed Farid, founder and CEO of Karachi-based Alchemy Technologies, which does risk-management training for financial professionals.\n\nIt posts short videos of its classes on YouTube to attract business, but uploads fewer of them following the ban, and the volume of Pakistani customers referred through YouTube has fallen, Farid said. \u201cMy team finds it very difficult to work with all the proxies in place. It certainly slows it down a bit,\u201d he said.\n\nSidra Qasim is co-CEO of HOMETOWN, a Lahore-based company that helps leather workers to market products such as shoes and belts online. It used YouTube to reach customers and also to teach the workers new techniques. \u201cNow that training part is stopped totally,\u201d she said.\n\nA committee of officials from various ministries is looking for solutions and will make the decision on whether to unblock YouTube. But experts aren\u2019t sure a technical solution even exists, and Bytes for All and others say that even if the government comes up with a filtering mechanism, they will continue to resist it as censorship.\n\nKamran Ali, a spokesman for the Ministry of Internet Technology, acknowledged that the ban can be a hardship but said the government must weigh freedom of information against offending the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Muslim country, and this video clearly violates the religious sentiments of the people of Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Air University in Islamabad, some students supported a government-imposed filter. \u201cIf they are able to control this blasphemous material that would be a good step,\u201d said Waqar ur-Rehman, 21.\n\nBut they recognized the difficulty of actually coming up with a system, and some argued against any restrictions, if only because they could be evaded.\n\n\u201cI think the ban shouldn\u2019t have been there. It (the movie) hurt a lot of religious sentiments, mine as well, but it was not the right way to do it, because there are so many ways to go around it,\u201d said Palwasha Khursheed, who studies electrical engineering.\n\nHafiz Hussain Ahmed, a Muslim cleric, acknowledged the ban was porous, and said Pakistan was missing an opportunity to use technology such as YouTube to educate people about Islam.\n\nHe urged the government to lift the ban, but only after installing filters, saying, \u201cWe must not allow anyone to attack our cultural values.\u201d\n\nOne solution would be a localized version of YouTube for Pakistan. But Google would need immunity from prosecution for any offending content, and Pakistani law so far doesn\u2019t allow for such an arrangement.\n\n\u201cIt is Google\u2019s goal to offer local versions of YouTube to more places worldwide, but it takes time,\u201d said Google in a statement to The Associated Press in request for comment about the court case. \u201cThe localization process can be lengthy as we research laws and build relationships with local content creators.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "YouTube facing Pakistan ban for nearly 1 year", "title": "YouTube facing Pakistan ban for nearly 1 year", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/16/youtube-facing-pakistan-ban-for-nearly-1-year/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__18745acb-8e25-4798-9ccf-4d686e7dcad6p1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__18745acb-8e25-4798-9ccf-4d686e7dcad6p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T14:17:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:09:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc42\"", "article_summary": "Over the years the government has periodically banned Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, but the YouTube ban has lasted the longest.\nSo at the time the YouTube ban was imposed, many saw it as a necessary calming measure.\nHafiz Hussain Ahmed, a Muslim cleric, acknowledged the ban was porous, and said Pakistan was missing an opportunity to use technology such as YouTube to educate people about Islam.\nYouTube as well as Facebook were initially blocked although the government soon exempted Facebook, saying it removed the offensive material.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Muslim country, and this video clearly violates the religious sentiments of the people of Pakistan,\u201d he said."}
