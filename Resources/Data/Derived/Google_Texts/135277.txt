THOMASTON, Maine (AP) — Ken and Judy Carreras got up before sunrise and drove an hour to find their Black Friday treasure — an acorn-shaped birdfeeder crafted by an inmate at Maine State Prison.

“For me, I would much rather spend the money on something that is locally crafted,” Judy Carreras, of Stockton Springs, said as the couple and other patrons huddled in their cars in subfreezing temperatures, waiting for the prison’s craft showroom to open.

Friday’s sale at the Thomaston showroom, located four miles from Maine State Prison in Warren, resembled a traditional Black Friday sale in many ways. The store opened an hour early, at 8 a.m., and reduced prices by 40 percent. A similar sale took place at the Maine Prison Industries outlet store in Windham, which cut prices 30 percent.

The Thomaston showroom attracted dozens of cars full of patrons in its first hour as buyers ogled ornamental wooden ball-and-chain sets and priced out porch furniture. Bookshelves, children’s toys, paintings, cutting boards, rocking horses and even models of the USS Constitution — all made as part of an inmate work program — were also on sale to the public.

Items range from $1.95 pencil holders to a $100,000 sculpture of the Roman god Neptune and a mermaid riding a motorcycle. The USS Constitution models, which retail for $2,150, were sold out by midday Friday.

Maine Prison Industries manager Ken Lindsey said sales from the work program total more than $1 million per year. Prisoners are paid $1 to $3 per hour, which must first go toward court restitution and child support payments, but more importantly, the program teaches inmates job skills and people skills that they can use upon release, Lindsey said.
