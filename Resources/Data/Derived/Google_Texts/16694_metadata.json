Doug Lamborn is going to face a primary challenge from retired Air Force officer Bentley Rayburn, who blistered the congressman in a fiery speech Friday.\n\nThe two Colorado Springs Republicans made their pitch during the 5th Congressional District assembly. Lamborn won 63 percent of the vote to Rayburn\u2019s 37 percent.\n\n\u201cI know this has been a tough conversation, but I think we needed it,\u201d Rayburn said after he questioned Lamborn\u2019s performance in the district and in Washington.\n\n\u201cNot only do we want people with conservative, solid values, but we want people who will lead and who will stir things up. We want action.\u201d\n\nLamborn pointed out that as a state lawmaker he sponsored the largest tax cut in Colorado history, and as a congressman he has fought the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cFolks, I\u2019ve been voting right, I\u2019ve been fighting liberals and I\u2019ve been getting results,\u201d Lamborn said.\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton, R-Cortez, also has a primary fight against David Cox. Tipton received 66 percent to Cox\u2019s 34 percent.\n\nEl Paso County delegate Cheri Ofner wasn\u2019t happy that the two incumbents ended with opponents in the GOP primary June 24. She said Republicans should be saving their money to unseat two Democratic incumbents, Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Mark Udall.\n\nLamborn was first elected to Congress in 2006 when Rep. Joel Hefley retired. He defeated Rayburn and four other challengers in the GOP primary. Two years later, Lamborn again defeated Rayburn and another challenger.\n\nEl Paso County Clerk Wayne Williams nominated Lamborn in 2006 and again Friday.\n\n\u201cEight years ago, I said, \u2018As we prepare to send a new congressman to Washington, it is critical that we send someone we know will zealously advocate our conservative values,\u2019 \u201d Williams said.\n\nLamborn has been that advocate, he said.\n\nRayburn, a retired major general, questioned why Lamborn hasn\u2019t helped raise money for embattled Congressman Mike Coffman and other Republicans, and why Lamborn won\u2019t debate.\n\nBut delegates were clearly upset when Rayburn said he wouldn\u2019t put his wife on the payroll, a swipe at Lamborn\u2019s spouse, Jean, who has helped with fundraising and payroll.\n\nRayburn said with the right leader in Congress, El Paso County and the 5th District can be a \u201creal powerhouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ought to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the safest districts in the country.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because Republicans dominate the 5th District. It is in central Colorado and includes Chaffee, El Paso, Fremont, Park and Teller counties. The district is home to five military installations.\n\nLynn Bartels: 303-954-5327, lbartels@denverpost.com or twitter.com/lynn_bartels", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Congressmen Doug Lamborn, Scott Tipton face primary challengers", "title": "Congressmen Doug Lamborn, Scott Tipton face primary challengers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/11/congressmen-doug-lamborn-scott-tipton-face-primary-challengers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140411__CDXXPELX5THDISTRICT_2JL1527xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140411__CDXXPELX5THDISTRICT_2JL1527xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-11T16:44:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:14:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3bd\"", "article_summary": "In the 3rd Congressional District, U.S. Rep.
