BEIRUT (AP) — The United States has delivered its first emergency shipment of weapons to Lebanon, officials said Friday, to help bolster military forces as part of a broader regional response to combat the growing threat posed by Islamic extremists.

The delivery is in response to a request by the Lebanese government after a sudden cross-border attack by militants from Syria into the Lebanese town of Arsal earlier this month, where soldiers were killed and kidnapped in the most serious spillover of violence into the tiny country from the neighboring civil war.

The new weapons were displayed at the Beirut military air base on Friday after arriving overnight. A sample of the weapons — mortars, M16-A4 assault rifles and anti-tank missiles — were placed on a white satin-covered table with camouflage netting.

“This is just the latest in a series of deliveries that have arrived in the last 36 hours,” said U.S. ambassador David Hale at the air base. Hale said the U.S. had so far delivered 480 anti-tank guided missiles, over 1,500 M16-A4 rifles, and mortars. “More mortars, grenade launchers, machine guns, and anti-tank weapons will be arriving,” he said.
