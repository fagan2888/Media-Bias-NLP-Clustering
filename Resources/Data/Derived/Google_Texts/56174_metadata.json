Vidant Health closed the hospital on July 1, 2014.\n\nO'Neal also asked for a $22,000 building re-use grant, promising to creating 55 jobs with the opening of the hospital.\n\nCommissioner Hood Richardson made a motion to approve the request, but that motion was never seconded and therefore never voted on.\n\nMayor O'Neal says they will continue to look for money to get the hospital back open.\n\n\"Beaufort County Commissioners sometimes forgets that Belhaven is a part of Beaufort County,\" says O'Neal. \"We are Beaufort County taxpayers and citizens in this area, and we have no representation right now on that board.\"\n\nCounty Commissioner Robert Belcher told WITN over the phone that he felt there were too many unanswered questions. Since the hospital doesn't belong to the county, he says taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Belhaven Mayor Adam O'Neal and his supporters asked for a loan from Beaufort County Commissioners, but the request was denied Monday night.", "language": "english", "author": "Lynnette Taylor, Gina DiPietro", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Mayors-loan-request-for-Vidant-Pungo-Hospital-denied-by-commissioners-302687231.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/belhaven+vidant++pungo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Belhaven Mayor Adam O'Neal and his supporters asked for a loan from Beaufort County Commissioners, but the request was denied Monday night.", "title": "Mayor's loan request for Vidant Pungo Hospital denied by commissioners"}, "twitter": {"description": "Belhaven Mayor Adam O'Neal and his supporters asked for a loan from Beaufort County Commissioners, but the request was denied Monday night.", "title": "Mayor's loan request for Vidant Pungo Hospital denied by commissioners", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Mayors-loan-request-for-Vidant-Pungo-Hospital-denied-by-commissioners-302687231.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/belhaven+vidant++pungo.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Mayor's loan request for Vidant Pungo Hospital denied by commissioners", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Mayors loan request for Vidant, Pungo Hospital denied by commissioners"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde80\"", "article_summary": "\"Beaufort County Commissioners sometimes forgets that Belhaven is a part of Beaufort County,\" says O'Neal.\nThe mayor and his supporters asked for a loan from county commissioners, but the request was denied.\nBelhaven Mayor Adam O'Neal says he went before the Beaufort County Board of Commissioners to request a $643,000 loan to gain imminent domain over the former Vidant Pungo Hospital.\n\"We are Beaufort County taxpayers and citizens in this area, and we have no representation right now on that board.\"\nMayor O'Neal says they will continue to look for money to get the hospital back open."}
