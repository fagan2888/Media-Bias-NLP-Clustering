Pat Toomey: A new poll out Wednesday shows the Lehigh Valley Republican and incumbent continues to lead the Democratic field in the 2016 race for his Senate seat.\n\nThe new poll from Public Policy Polling shows Toomey with mediocre approval numbers, but ahead of the two named Democratic challengers to date, former Pennsylvania Congressman Joe Sestak and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski.\n\nThe PPP poll found that 30 percent of voters give Toomey a job approval while 37 percent disapprove with his job performance.\n\nA weak approval rating aside, Toomey holds a comfortable lead over half a dozen announced and hypothetical candidates tested by PPP.\n\nSestak, who lost to Toomey in 2010 by a narrow margin, trails the Republican by 4 points at 42/38. PPP notes that the point margin is similar to the 2 point margin of defeat the first time the two faced off.\n\nA year out before any Democratic primary, Toomey has recently enjoyed a string of favorable assessments. Earlier this month, Harper Polling found Toomey leading Sestak by 21 percent. Another earlier poll by Quinnipiac University found Toomey also with a commanding lead.\n\nLast week, a Larry Sabato's \"Crystal Ball\" ranking, moved the 2016 Pennsylvania Senate race from the \"Toss-Up\" to \"Leans Republican\" list.\n\nSestak, who is fighting a name recognition battle, seems to have lost most of it, with 54 percent of voters noting no opinion either way about him.\n\nToomey leads Pawlowski, 44/34.\n\nPPL also tested four other Democrats, all of whom posted lower numbers to Toomey's and even lower name recognition. They include: Seth Williams, Chris Carney and Vincent Hughes.\n\nMontgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro this past weekend ruled out a bid for the race.\n\nPPP's analysis this go-around: as long as Democrats do well in the Presidential race in Pennsylvania, the Senate race should be close.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@topstories','elections-2016','politics','senate race 2016'", "title": "Pat Toomey posts low approval rate, but leads all Democrats in 2016 Senate race", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Pat Toomey posts low approval rate, but leads all Democrats in 2016 Senate race\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/05/pat_toomey_senate_race_joe_ses_1.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/17931285-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16128544\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-05-27T20:37:05Z\", \"author\": \"Ivey DeJesus | idejesus@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"elections-2016\",\"politics\",\"senate race 2016\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/17931285-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@iveydejesus", "description": "Another poll leans in favor of Pat Toomey in his 2016 re-election bid.
