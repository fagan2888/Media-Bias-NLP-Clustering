He lays out his plans for reforming the tax code and immigration, while reiterating his desire to replace the Affordable Care Act and make it easier to carry concealed weapons in all states. Trump details his wealth, publishing a copy of his net worth statement, and lists the more than 65 properties he owns and the corporate aircraft in his possession: a Boeing 757, a Cessna Citation X and three Sikorsky 76 helicopters.\n\nCourtesy photo BOOK REVIEW \u201cCRIPPLED AMERICA: HOW TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\u201d By Donald Trump. Threshold Editions. November 2015. 208 pages. $25 Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nTrump writes that he picked the heavy title, along with a sneering photo of himself for the cover, because the country is in serious trouble: \u201cSo I wanted a picture where I wasn\u2019t happy, a pictured that reflected the anger and unhappiness that I feel, rather than joy. Because we are not in a joyous situation right now,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nWhile much of the book reads like a script for a rally speech \u2013 not that Trump ever uses a script, let alone notes \u2013 there are details tucked in here and there that Trump doesn\u2019t often mention at his rallies. Here are a few:\n\n1) Trump used to be a Democrat. Trump is the sort of candidate who prides himself on never apologizing, clarifying or correcting himself. But he acknowledges in the book that he used to be a Democrat \u2013 although, so was Ronald Reagan, he writes.\n\n\u201cHe switched, and I switched years ago, when I began to see what liberal Democrats were doing to our country,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNow I\u2019m a conservative Republican with a big heart. I didn\u2019t decide to become a Republican. That\u2019s who I have always been.\u201d\n\nTrump also explains why he no longer supports having a single-payer health-care system, writing: \u201cTo succeed in business, you have to be flexible and you have to change with the realities of the world. The world has changed; I have changed.\u201d\n\n2) Trump blames himself for his first two marriages failing. Trump frequently brags about his five children, especially his oldest three who now help run his company and have avoided making tabloid news. But in the book, Trump adds: \u201cMy children have great mothers.\u201d He adds that \u201ctruthfully, I was a much better father than I was a husband, always working too much to be the husband my wives wanted me to be. I blame myself.\u201d\n\n3) Trump thinks global warming is a scam. \u201cI do agree that so-called global climate change is causing us some problems: It\u2019s causing us to waste billions of dollars to develop technologies we don\u2019t need to fulfill our energy needs,\u201d Trump writes in the book, adding that the planet has long experienced extreme changes in climate. Trump instead suggests decreasing reliance on foreign oil by \u201cstarting to drill everywhere oil is accessible\u201d in the United States, allowing fracking and approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. He writes that sources of \u201cgreen energy\u201d are \u201creally just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.\u201d\n\n4) Trump wants to get rid of the Department of Education. Or at least \u201ccut its power and reach.\u201d The candidate seldom discusses education issues on the campaign trail, but he dedicated the fifth chapter of his book to the education system\u2019s \u201cfailing grade.\u201d Trump suggests fixing these failures by creating more competition for schools by allowing parents more freedom in picking schools for their children. He calls for weakening teachers unions to make it easier to close \u201cweaker schools\u201d and fire \u201cineffective teachers.\u201d Trump praises charter schools for having a system of accountability not found in public schools where \u201cthere is no way to take an honest measurement of how they\u2019re doing.\u201d And he wants to \u201crestore rules about behavior in the classroom\u201d so troublemakers don\u2019t rob their classmates of learning time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the kids growing up in wealthy communities, where high property taxes have allowed them to build great schools, hire the best teachers, and provide all the supplies they need. Those schools are doing fine,\u201d Trump writes. \u201cIn many urban areas, however, schools must fight for every tax dollar and are forced to have teachers and students bring in their own basic supplies such as pencils and paper. That\u2019s a national tragedy.\u201d\n\n5) Trump doesn\u2019t want his Social Security money. Trump writes that the government should give wealthy individuals like himself the opportunity to forgo their Social Security money so that others can benefit. \u201cI would check that box,\u201d Trump writes. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are other wealthy individuals who would do the same thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things in Donald Trump's new book you probably won't hear at a rally.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Things in Donald Trump's new book you probably won't hear at a rally.", "title": "Book Review: \"Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again.\" - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/779978_493633-trump.jpg", "height": 999}, "updated_time": "2016-02-04T15:49:30-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/10/book-review-crippled-america-how-to-make-america-great-again/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Things in Donald Trump's new book you probably won't hear at a rally.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/779978_493633-trump.jpg", "title": "Book Review: \"Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again.\" - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2016-01-10T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T15:49:30-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Courtesy photo BOOK REVIEW \u201cCRIPPLED AMERICA: HOW TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\u201d By Donald Trump.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Reading Donald Trump\u2019s new book, \u201cCrippled America: How to Make America Great Again,\u201d is not much different than listening to him speak at a rally.\nIn the book, which went on sale last week, Trump complains at length about \u201cjournalist cronies\u201d and their \u201cgotcha, gotcha, gotcha\u201d questions.\n\u201cI would check that box,\u201d Trump writes.\nTrump writes that the government should give wealthy individuals like himself the opportunity to forgo their Social Security money so that others can benefit."}
