The Bay County Sheriff's Office has ruled a deadly shooting in the Allanton community over the weekend as self defense.

It happened last Saturday afternoon at a home on Gore Road.

Bay County Sheriff's deputies arrived to find 41-year-old James Ivey dead, and his 21-year-old son Kyle Ivey injured. Both had been shot.

James Ivey was reportedly arguing with his wife when the fight escalated.

According to Mrs. Ivey, Kyle attempted several times to calm his father, before James went to get a firearm, saying he was going to kill his wife.

Kyle apparently got his own firearm, and the two shot each other.

"We have been able to determine from the medical examiners office through the bullet wound and again from the evidence that we believe that Kyle Ivey was acting in self defense protecting himself and his mother. And so at this point, no charges will be filed," Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen stated.

Kyle remains in the hospital. Officials say he's awaiting hip surgery.
