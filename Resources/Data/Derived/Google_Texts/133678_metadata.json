As I wrote before, a decision in favor of Hobby Lobby\u2019s argument could spell disaster for all sorts of civil rights advances. It used to be common for conservative Christians to argue that the Bible placed blacks in a subservient role to whites, and therefore, discrimination was justifiable.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules in Hobby Lobby\u2019s favor, it could open the door to all kinds of discrimination based on the slimmest justification on religious grounds. Best for the Supreme Court not to go there.\n\nWell, perhaps the court is signalling exactly that intent \u2014 not to go there. On Monday, the court refused to hear the case of a New Mexico photography company that turned down two gays who wanted to hire Elane Photography to photograph their commitment ceremony. Elane said it would conflict with the company\u2019s religious beliefs. New Mexico law forbids any form of discrimination based on race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. By turning down the case, the Supreme Court allowed an appeals court ruling against the photographer to stand.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the New Mexico and Hobby Lobby cases are the same. In the New Mexico case, the law is explicit that for-profit businesses may not discriminate. In the Hobby Lobby case, the Obama administration already has upheld some religious exceptions to compliance with parts of the Affordable Care Act. So it\u2019s not an exact apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nBut the claim of a religious exception is similar enough to raise the possibility that the Supreme Court will choose to send a consistent, anti-discrimination message. Or, quite possibly, a majority of justices will shrug their shoulders and embrace hypocrisy.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2RhbGxhc21vcm5pbmd2aWV3c2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNC9zdXByZW1lLWNvdXJ0cy1ob2JieS1sb2JieS1kZWNpc2lvbi1tdWRkbGVkLWJ5LW5ldy1tZXhpY28tY2FzZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tod Robberson / Editorial Writer", "og": {"site_name": "Opinion Blog", "description": "The Supreme Court seemed to be leaning in favor of Hobby Lobby in its argument that the owners' religious considerations allowed them to refuse medical coverage for contraceptives.
