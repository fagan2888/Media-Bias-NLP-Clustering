Parikh, a resident in internal medicine and primary care at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, noted that doctors and nurses often use restraints when the patients are delirious or at risk of falling, but cites studies that restraints can increase anxiety, rates of pressure ulcers, respiratory complications and death by strangulation and aspiration.\n\nThe majority of intensive care unit patients don't need restraints, Parikh noted. \"However, as one of my senior residents confided in me, when caring for the sickest patients in the hospital, restraining a delirious patient might be the only way to devote time to other seriously ill patients,\" he wrote.\n\nInstead, hospitals can use devices such as shields around central line sites to protect the IV without restricting patient movement, or design restraint-free wards by providing mobility aids in all rooms so patients can move around when they want to, as highlighted in recommendations released by the American Geriatrics Society earlier this year.\n\nParikh recalled a night during his residency rotation where instead of restraining a patient, the medical team in the ICU reoriented the patient by reminding him where he was and the time of day, offered him medication to treat his anxiety, and called his wife and put her on the telephone to provide a familiar voice. \"The patient eventually calmed down without the need for restraints or other aggressive interventions, and the next morning his mental status improved,\" he wrote. \"I hope that stories like his can become the standard, not the exception, in the ICU.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\n- check out the Medicare guidelines\n\n- read the American Geriatrics Society recommendations\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n4 unexpected patient safety hazards\n\n5 fierce patient safety videos\n\nLean strategies helped North Carolina hospital reduce hospital falls by 22 percent\n\nSurveillance cameras help prevent patient falls", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals should reconsider whether physical restraints are a good tool to use, especially in the\u00a0intensive care unit\u00a0as they could be ineffective or harmful in some situations, writes author Ravi Parikh in an\u00a0article\u00a0in\u00a0The Atlantic.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals should reconsider whether physical restraints are a good tool to use, especially in the\u00a0intensive care unit\u00a0as they could be ineffective or harmful in some situations, writes author Ravi Parikh in an\u00a0article\u00a0in\u00a0The Atlantic.", "title": "Hospital ICUs should reconsider use of harmful patient restraints", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-icus-should-reconsider-use-harmful-patient-restraints/2014-08-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Intensive Care Unit,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient falls,patient safety,Physical Restraints", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0bc\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the article- check out the Medicare guidelines- read the American Geriatrics Society recommendationsRelated Articles:4 unexpected patient safety hazards5 fierce patient safety videosLean strategies helped North Carolina hospital reduce hospital falls by 22 percentSurveillance cameras help prevent patient falls\nThe majority of intensive care unit patients don't need restraints, Parikh noted.\nMedicare guidelines recommend hospitals use restraints only when patients pose a threat of violence to themselves or others or disrupt life-saving therapies such as breathing tubes.\n\"The patient eventually calmed down without the need for restraints or other aggressive interventions, and the next morning his mental status improved,\" he wrote.\nHospitals should reconsider whether physical restraints are a good tool to use, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU) as they could be ineffective or harmful in some situations, writes author Ravi Parikh in an article in The Atlantic."}
