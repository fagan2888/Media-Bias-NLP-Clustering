Each year since 2009, NSU has selected its alumni, professors, athletes or staff whose leadership has made a significant impact in the community for the Centurion Award.\n\n\u201cI am a proud alum of Northeastern State University and tremendously humbled to be recognized by the school as a centurion,\u201d said Principal Chief Baker. \u201cThe school will always hold a special place in my heart. The education I received at NSU helped prepare me for a life dedicated to public service, and I am deeply appreciative of that. I was lucky to build invaluable relationships, friends and mentors to this day during my NSU tenure, and I have been blessed to stay active and involved with the university over the years.\u201d\n\nChief Baker, who graduated from NSU in 1973 with education degrees in history and political science, earned the award as a community advocate, businessman and elected leader of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n\"Chief Baker\u2019s leadership in the Cherokee Nation and tireless dedication to service are appropriately recognized in his centurion honor,\u201d NSU President Dr. Steve Turner said. \u201cHe often mentions his experience as an NSU student and graduate as pivotal in his personal development, and it is certainly fitting that he is joining his mother, Isabel, as an honoree for their lifelong commitment to the heritage and legacy of NSU.\"\n\nChief Baker was elected as Principal Chief in October 2011. Prior, he spent 12 years on the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council. He has been a small-business owner in Tahlequah for more than 40 years.\n\nWhile in office, Chief Baker has increased and expanded college scholarship funding for more tribal citizens, improved the tribe\u2019s health care system and created new jobs throughout the Cherokee Nation. He also played a major role in reestablishing the tribe\u2019s new home construction program.\n\nPreviously named centurions include country music superstar Carrie Underwood, \u201cTuna\u201d trilogy co-author and co-star Joe Sears, former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, historian Beth Herrington and entrepreneur Jeff Reasor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker was among 10 recipients to receive this year\u2019s Centurion Award by Northeastern State University.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/15/principal-chief-baker-honored-centurion-nsu-154025", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/baker_nsu_centurion_wide.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Principal Chief Baker Honored as \u2018Centurion\u2019 by NSU"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-03-15T14:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Principal Chief Baker Honored as \u2018Centurion\u2019 by NSU"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/15/principal-chief-baker-honored-centurion-nsu-154025", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cherokee Nation, Principal Chief Bill John Baker, Northeastern State University, Centurion Award, Alumni Honoree", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Principal Chief Baker Honored as \u2018Centurion\u2019 by NSU"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc17d\"", "article_summary": "Chief Baker was elected as Principal Chief in October 2011.\nCherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker was among 10 recipients to receive this year\u2019s Centurion Award by Northeastern State University.\n\u201cI am a proud alum of Northeastern State University and tremendously humbled to be recognized by the school as a centurion,\u201d said Principal Chief Baker.\n\"Chief Baker\u2019s leadership in the Cherokee Nation and tireless dedication to service are appropriately recognized in his centurion honor,\u201d NSU President Dr. Steve Turner said.\nPrior, he spent 12 years on the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council."}
