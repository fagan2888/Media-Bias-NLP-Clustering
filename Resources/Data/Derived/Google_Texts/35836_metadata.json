Rodriguez is a member of Youth SHINE who began trying to enroll in December and had trouble signing up. She encountered roadblocks that Florida Legal Services then incorporated into a question-and-answer guide for potential enrollees.\n\nRodriguez, who works two jobs and wants to go to law school, suffers from Bell\u2019s palsy, a facial paralysis that attacks in episodes lasting weeks or months. Before she had health care coverage, she would get treatment at an emergency room \u2014 which would prolong the duration of the attacks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d tell me, \u2018We can\u2019t give you anything until we know it\u2019s Bell\u2019s palsy,\u2019 \u201d she said of the emergency-room personnel.\n\nNow, however, Rodriguez has a neurologist and can get steroids to blunt oncoming attacks. She\u2019s also been able to have her infected wisdom teeth extracted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful every day,\u201d she said.\n\nThis report is by Margie Menzel of The News Service of Florida.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former foster children are eligible for health coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act until they turn 26 years old, but many in Florida don\u2019t know it yet.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/06/09/law-offers-health-care-to-foster-kids-outreach-questioned/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/medical-files.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/medical-files.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Former foster children are eligible for health coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act until they turn 26 years old, but many in Florida don\u2019t know it yet.", "title": "Law Offers Health Care To Foster Kids; Outreach Questioned"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSmiami", "image": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/medical-files.jpg?w=625", "description": "Former foster children are eligible for health coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act until they turn 26 years old, but many in Florida don\u2019t know it yet.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Law Offers Health Care To Foster Kids; Outreach Questioned"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Miami's Best", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Miami", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, health, news, affordable care act, dcf, dcf deputy secretary pete digre, department of children and families, florida, florida's children first, medicaid, michelle glady, news service of florida, robin rosenberg, youth law center", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://miami.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0984ebcee75feff1a6ce7f3d00419048?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, dcf, dcf deputy secretary pete digre, department of children and families, florida, florida's children first, medicaid, michelle glady, news service of florida, robin rosenberg, youth law center"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc09a\"", "article_summary": "Before she had health care coverage, she would get treatment at an emergency room \u2014 which would prolong the duration of the attacks.\nSince by definition, children in foster care have been abused or neglected, they also have higher needs for substance abuse and mental health treatment.\nFormer foster children also tend to have missed out on routine medical and dental care.\nJust as the 2010 health-care law extends coverage to young adults on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until age 26, it also extends Medicaid coverage to those who were in foster care on their 18th birthdays.\n\u201cDental is huge,\u201d said Geori Berman, coordinator for Florida Youth SHINE, an advocacy group for foster youths and an offshoot of Florida\u2019s Children First."}
