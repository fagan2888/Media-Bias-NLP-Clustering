One of the easiest and most effective ways to make sure you are testicular cancer-free is the do-it-yourself method of self-examination. Unfortunately, most men are either too shy or feel they don’t have enough time to see if everything is all right down there. To help boost the outreach of The Check One Two group’s “crotch grab challenge,” which asks men to, well, grab their crotch to raise testicular cancer awareness, Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman, posted a picture on Instagram while performing the challenge complete with #FeelingNuts.

According to the American Cancer Society, around 8,820 new testicular cancer diagnoses are expected for 2014. Health care professionals recommend that any man over the age of 14 conduct his own testicular self-exam at least once a month. The ACS provides detailed instructions for how to perform a self-exam and what to look for. Although the main objective should be to check for any lumps or rounded masses, remember that testicles can enlarge for any number of reasons unrelated to cancer. So don’t panic and schedule an appointment with your doctor.

Check One Two has two goals they hope to accomplish with the crotch grab challenge:

1. Spread awareness far and wide of #feelingnuts in funny, ball-grabbing and pant-dropping ways.

2. Educate men and the women in their lives about how to check their nuts for testicular cancer.

Similar to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the crotch grab challenge requires a nomination after completion. Jackman took this as an opportunity to challenge some of his celebrity pals, including Neil Patrick Harris, Michael Strahan, and Ricky Gervais.

As of Thursday, Gervais was the only one ballsy enough to answer the challenge.
