Lawmakers agreed on a bipartisan budget resolution. They passed a budget that funds the government through the rest of fiscal 2014. And they\u2019ve already agreed on spending levels for 2015.\n\nThen there\u2019s the debt ceiling.\n\nThe debt ceiling is the legal limit Congress places on its own borrowing. Every time the federal debt reaches the debt ceiling, lawmakers have to pass a law to raise the limit in order to prevent the government from defaulting on its loan payments \u2013 or reneging on any number of other obligations, like sending out Social Security checks.\n\nThe debt ceiling doesn\u2019t authorize new spending. It just allows the government to pay the bills on spending that Congress has already authorized. And as President Obama has said, failing to raise the debt ceiling is like going out to fancy restaurant and ordering a nice dinner \u2013 then walking out on the check.\n\nThe Last Debt Ceiling Deal\n\nIn the deal that ended the government shutdown back in October, lawmakers suspended the debt ceiling until Feb. 7.\n\nDebt Ceiling in 2014\n\nAfter Feb. 7 the Treasury will have to use accounting maneuvers to prevent a debt default. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Congress should take immediate action to prevent a crisis by raising the debt ceiling.\n\nRepublicans have signaled that they won\u2019t vote for an increase in the debt limit without demanding concessions as part of the deal. According to news reports, party leaders have discussed demanding certain changes to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in exchange for their vote to raise the debt ceiling. Yet in reference to a debt default, Speaker Boehner said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nFor more on how the debt ceiling works, check out Federal Budget 101.
