The Phoenix Mercury capitalized on an anticipated large audience by hosting Native American Heritage Night and featuring United National Indian Tribal Youth, Inc. (UNITY) as a benefiting charity. The near sell-out crowd roared and held up homemade signs as \u201cShowtime Shoni\u201d entered the game midway through the first quarter.\n\n\u201cIt was a great feeling. It felt like a home game for us, especially being in Indian country,\u201d said Schimmel, a member of the Confederated Tribes of Umatilla Indians.\n\n\u201cI was like I can\u2019t believe this is happening. It was powerful seeing all the Natives. It was so loud, I didn\u2019t even hear her name announced when she was introduced. It was awesome to be there representing my tribe,\u201d said Carrie Hood, 20, Miss Ft. McDowell Yavapai Nation.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would have met Shoni Schimmel, but to have her autograph on my necklace and to be recognized at a game she played at was truly humbling,\u201d said Layha Spoonhunter, 24, Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho, who flew in from Wyoming for the game. Both Hood and Spoonhunter were recognized with other UNITY youth during halftime festivities.\n\nThanks to the Phoenix Mercury\u2019s Community Assist Program, the UNITY organization benefited through ticket sales and the featuring of Native youth at the event. The night began outside the US Airways arena with UNITY youth from the Ak-Chin Youth Council, Yavapai Apache Nation Youth Council and Yellowbird Indian Dancers sharing cultural songs and dances as fans arrived.\n\nInside the arena, UNITY shared information about its youth programs such as \u201cToday\u2019s Native Leaders\u201d at a booth on the concourse. UNITY youth served as \u201chigh five\u201d greeters in the pre-game and halftime fan tunnels where they cheered on both teams. During halftime about a dozen UNITY youth leaders, including tribal royalty and \u201c25 Under 25\u201d Honorees, were recognized after UNITY\u2019s PSA played on big screens in the arena.\n\nSchimmel, who didn\u2019t have a great night making only one of six three point attempts but ending with 13 points for the night, become the first ever rookie last month to be named MVP of the WNBA All-Star game and she broke the record for most points in an all-star game with 29. Fans didn\u2019t seem to mind, with hundreds staying for a post game Question and Answer session.\n\nThe Q & A session had been reserved for special groups like UNITY, however, the Phoenix Mercury opened the session to anyone who wanted to stay resulting in an overflow crowd taking up more than two reserved sections.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t do it,\u201d said Schimmel to young people pursuing their dreams. The WNBA rookie talked about the personal interests, pre-game rituals, the All Star Game, her major in college (communications), and raising the bar while playing in the big leagues. Following a formal post-game interview, fans were given a chance to ask Schimmel questions. At the conclusion of the interview, UNITY youth presented Schimmel with a Pendleton blanket and Apache burden basket.\n\nUNITY and WNBA teams, including the Atlanta Dream, New York Liberty, and the Phoenix Mercury, are partnering nationwide for Native American Night events. Through ticket sale efforts, UNITY has raised more than $5,000 for its youth programs.
