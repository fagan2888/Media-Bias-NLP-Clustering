William M. Stanley Jr. (R-Franklin), will take the reins from Amanda Chase, who once worked for Cantor, the Brat campaign confirmed Tuesday. Like Chase, Rapp has never run a congressional campaign.\n\n\u201cAs a long-time friend, Amanda really stepped up and helped me when I needed her most \u2014 coming in as my transition campaign manager until we could put our full team together. I understand she needs to return to her business and other pursuits, and I will always be grateful for her service,\u201d Brat said in a statement.\n\nBrat has avoided the media spotlight since his unexpected win over Cantor (R), who was in line to be the next speaker of the House.\n\nBrat stumbled in his first major interview the day after the primary when NBC reporter Chuck Todd asked him to clarify his positions on several foreign policy issues. Since then, the candidate has kept a relatively low profile.\n\nChase\u2019s departure is being seen by some as an early misstep for Brat, even though he is favored to win the heavily Republican district, which stretches from suburban Richmond northwest toward the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nSome members of Brat\u2019s party have characterized his campaign as being in \u201cdisarray\u201d and have expressed amazement that his organization took out the majority leader.\n\nBrat, an economics and ethics professor at Randolph-Macon College, announced Chase\u2019s hire last month in one of his first public appearances after the primary.\n\nAt the time, Brat said she would work though the \u201ctransition\u201d to the general election, and he would not say if she would stay on through November.\n\nRapp is a retired executive from Tredegar Corp., a \u00adRichmond-based manufacturing company. As a senior adviser and volunteer coordinator during the primary campaign, he was in charge of the grass-roots field operation that many credit with making the difference in Brat\u2019s defeat of the entrenched incumbent.\n\nZachary Werrell, who served as Brat\u2019s campaign manager during the primary and attracted attention for his young age \u2014 23 \u2014 and for running the campaign with an antiquated flip phone, has since left the campaign. Asked Tuesday if it was his decision to leave, Werrell declined to comment.\n\nChase, who was political director for Susan Stimpson in her failed bid for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in Virginia last year, will return to work at the financial planning firm she runs with her husband, Brat campaign spokesman Brian Gottstein said.\n\n\u201cShe has a heart for the grass roots and a great deal of campaign experience,\u201d Brat said when he hired her. \u201cTo her credit, months ago, when I was the underdog, she stated publicly that I was a credible candidate and contender in this race.\u201d\n\nBrat, who spent six years as special legislative assistant to state Sen. Walter A. Stosch (R-Henrico), has focused on three main issues: repeal of the Affordable Care Act, stopping illegal immigration and reducing the debt and deficit.\n\nThough he has shied away from saying what his stunning win means for the Republican Party on a national scale, Brat\u2019s supporters say Cantor was disconnected from the district and too open to compromise with the Obama administration, despite his fiery rhetoric against the president.\n\nBrat will face Democrat Jack Trammell, also a professor at Randolph-Macon, in the fall.\n\nThe campaign also announced that Brat had hired Tim Edson as a general consultant. Edson ran Rep. Allen B. West\u2019s (R-Fla.) unsuccessful reelection campaign in 2012 and worked for Stimpson alongside Chase.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dave Brat, Eric Cantor, Amanda Chase, mid-term elections, Phil Rapp, virginia, congress", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Brat, the Republican who ousted Cantor, shakes up his campaign team in early weeks of Congressional bid", "title": "Republican who ousted Cantor replaces his campaign manager after three weeks on the job", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/brat-campaign-for-congress-replaces-campaign-manager/2014/07/08/f2b42b52-06b7-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/13/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Images/450461060-334.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jennaportnoy"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dave Brat, Eric Cantor, Amanda Chase, mid-term elections, Phil Rapp, virginia, congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f2b42b52-06b7-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Brat, the Republican who ousted Cantor, shakes up his campaign team in early weeks of Congressional bid"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4b1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs a long-time friend, Amanda really stepped up and helped me when I needed her most \u2014 coming in as my transition campaign manager until we could put our full team together.\nZachary Werrell, who served as Brat\u2019s campaign manager during the primary and attracted attention for his young age \u2014 23 \u2014 and for running the campaign with an antiquated flip phone, has since left the campaign.\nRepublican congressional candidate Dave Brat replaced his campaign manager after just three weeks on the job, adding to the growing pains for the political newcomer who toppled former House majority leader Eric Cantor.\nPhil Rapp, an aide to state Sen.
