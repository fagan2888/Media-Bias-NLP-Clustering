Security Council to impose sanctions banning the country's arms trade.\n\nIn subsequent moves to blacklist Daedong Credit Bank and DCB Finance, the U.S. Treasury Department said DCB Finance was used at least since 2006 to deal with other banks that tried to avoid doing business with the North.\n\nThe two companies were responsible for millions of dollars in transactions that supported illicit activities by North Korea, the U.S. Treasury said in 2013, when it imposed sanctions against the firms.\n\nKim, the North Korean banking official, was named in the 2013 Treasury action targeting the bank and the finance company, over a period starting in 2006, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement at the time.\n\nCowie was not named in the U.S. Treasury sanctions action.\n\nCowie, who had previously worked for HSBC in Hong Kong, left the banking industry in 2011, according to the Guardian.\n\nMossack Fonseca failed to notice DCB Finance was linked to North Korea until 2010, when it resigned as agent, the paper said, adding that Cowie sold his bank stake the following year.\n\nIn January, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, prompting new U.N. sanctions that blacklisted Daedong Credit Bank for facilitating millions of dollars in transactions for North Korean companies involved in the country's arms program.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Tony Munroe and Clarence Fernandez)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nigel Cowie, who lived in the North for more than 20 years and had been the head of it", "title": "British banker behind firm sanctioned over North Korea nuclear program: Guardian", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/British-banker-behind-firm-sanctioned-over-North-Korea-nuclear-program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/soccer-fifa-infantino-colombia_7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/British-banker-behind-firm-sanctioned-over-North-Korea-nuclear-program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/soccer-fifa-infantino-colombia_7.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nigel Cowie, who lived in the North for more than 20 years and had been the head of it", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In January, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, prompting new U.N. sanctions that blacklisted Daedong Credit Bank for facilitating millions of dollars in transactions for North Korean companies involved in the country's arms program.\nLater that year, North Korea held its first nuclear test, under then-leader Kim Jong Il, prompting the U.N.
