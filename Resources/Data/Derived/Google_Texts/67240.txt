Cars, laptops, exercise equipment and even typewriters. There was a lot on the auction block Saturday morning at the annual Panama City Beach Police Auction.

close to 280 items were up for grabs. All of the auction lots were either retired police vehicles, or items from criminal investigations that were never claimed.

More than 300 people came out to the event and some auction-goers were suprised by the varitey of items up for bid.

"Came out to see what the vehicles would sell for. Looking for a bicycle for my wife. They have all kinds of crazy stuff, typewriters, printers computers, wallets, jewelry. All kind of things. Suprised of what they have," said Jeff Woodward.

Police officials say the money raised from the auction goes into the police trust fund or back to the City.
