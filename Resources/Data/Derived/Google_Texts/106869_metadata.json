However, he said, Parkland hasn't entertained adding a student health plan to keep its fees in the affordable range.\n\nTurner said she thinks students need the information they'll be getting from the two organizations about open enrollment, and she hopes the event on campus will spread the word.\n\nDACC marketing director Lara Conklin said the college doesn't inquire about whether its students are insured unless they're athletes, but a majority of the students are employed.\n\nDACC isn't planning any information sessions for its students on marketplace health plan open enrollment, she said.\n\nHealth Care Consumers and Citizen Action/Illinois are targeting Parkland because many students don't know open enrollment begins in less than month and what their options are, Tayabji said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, nearly everyone must have health coverage starting Jan. 1, 2014 or pay a penalty.\n\nCoverage through the state marketplace will offer subsidies to people with lower incomes, and Tayabji said many students will be eligible for subsidized coverage through the marketplace or no-cost premiums through the state's Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I think definitely there are going to be a lot of students who are going to be Medicaid-eligible,\" she said.\n\nPresentation planned at Parkland\n\nParkland College students can hear about their options to sign up for health coverage in the new Illinois marketplace, a key part of health care reform, at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nChampaign County Health Care Consumers and Citizen Action/Illinois will present information on the Parkland campus, 2400 W.
