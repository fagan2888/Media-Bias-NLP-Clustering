One involves the drama\u2014you choose whether to call it comedy or tragedy\u2014of partisan politics. The other is the fact that American manufacturers have never been of one mind and one voice\u2014not from the first days of the republic. Not now.\n\nStart-up enterprises have different priorities from established firms. Multinationals have different priorities from domestic companies. Some manufacturers focus on established markets. Others direct their attention to emerging markets. Many manufacturers are publicly traded companies. Others are privately held.\n\nAmerican manufacturers have never been of one mind and one voice\u2014not from the first days of the republic. Not now.\n\nThe list goes on, and as it lengthens, it can get rather complex. Consider, for example, a domestic American manufacturer whose management pursues both established and emerging markets both at home and abroad from both foreign and domestic production and distribution sites. Its economic, political, and social environments\u2014and financial needs\u2014can and do vary, and wants and priorities may be at odds\u2014all within the company\u2019s boundaries.\n\nAlong the boundaries between business and government, no single broad-based business lobby, however admirable its stated intentions, can effectively advocate all of the interests of all of the corporations, companies, and partnerships that are its members. What\u2019s more, not every company is comfortable being just anywhere under an \u201cumbrella\u201d lobby. Some want to be at the absolute center of action; other prefer to be closer to the edge.\n\nIn efforts to promote their perceived particular needs, thousands of American businesses, from the makers of airplanes and automobiles to the miners and processors of yellowcake, have joined hundreds of trade associations across the country. But even among the members of such seemingly like-minded organizations, the policy voices tend not to be in unison. Sometimes the differences are nuanced; other times, not so nuanced.\n\nCertainly, the managers and employees of American manufacturing companies are not of one mind or one voice when the issue is the Affordable Care Act. For example, some manufacturing executives continue to decry almost any employee healthcare plan as a job-destroying business burden, while other manufacturers pursue progressive healthcare plans to attract and retain skilled employees and still other manufacturers see in the provisions of \u201cObamacare\u201d opportunities for new lines of business.\n\nThe healthcare debate will not end in 2015. Obamacare legislation is still very young. Some regulations are likely to be altered as both employers and employees gain experience with the act\u2019s requirements. And the financial impacts of the legislation on employers and employees have yet to be meaningfully measured.\n\nNevertheless, I believe that the men and women of business, in concord or in conflict, would be well advised to continue think about the conditions of their social, economic and political environments and to advocate public policy positions with clarity and vigor. For the people of American businesses not to take their places at the tables of public-policy conversations\u2014for their voices not to be heard\u2014would make for the unhappiest and unhealthiest of new years for everyone.\n\nThis is another of a series of occasional essay by John S.
