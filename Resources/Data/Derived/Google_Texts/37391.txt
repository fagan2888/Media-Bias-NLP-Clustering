SIOUX CITY, IA (ABC9)- A judge has thrown out several claims made in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against former City Manager Paul Eckert. Eckert and the City of Sioux City were named in a lawsuit filed by former employee Brittany Scott back in 2013. Scott had worked as an Administrative Assistant for the City.



Scott claimed to have been sexually harassed by Eckert between 2000 and 2004, when she filed a complaint. She claimed that the harassment stopped after she filed the complaint, but says that she was discriminated against in the years that followed and was denied a promotion in 2012.



In his ruling on Tuesday, Judge Mark Bennet found that the statute of limitations had passed on many of the allegations brought up in the lawsuit. He also found that the city was not wrong in reducing Scott's hours from 35 to 29 hours in order to comply with health insurance regulations stemming from the Affordable Care Act.



The Judge also partially ruled out the testimony of two expert witnesses Scott had hoped to call during her trial. The lawsuit will still go forward to decide if the City was wrong to deny Scott a promotion in 2012.



Eckert left Sioux City in August of 2013 to take a job as the City Manager of Mt. Shasta, California.



The trial is expected to get underway this spring.
