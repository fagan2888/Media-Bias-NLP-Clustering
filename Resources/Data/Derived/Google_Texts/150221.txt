It's time again for holiday lights to start twinkling all over Boulder County, and we need your help in finding the best displays.

If you know of displays we should consider as we compile our annual tour of holiday lights, please submit their addresses to us online at DailyCamera.com, or email the information to huhnk@dailycamera.com. The deadline is Monday.

The best displays will be featured in the Daily Camera's Friday Magazine on Dec. 11 and also on the Camera's website.
