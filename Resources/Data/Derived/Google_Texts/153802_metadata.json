Boston researchers from Boston Medical Center\u2019s Division of General Pediatrics exposed mothers who have turned their toddlers into little coffee drinkers, and published their findings in the Journal of Human Lactation.\n\n\u201cCoffee consumption is not uncommon among toddlers in Boston, Massachusetts,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote. The team of researchers studied 300 Bostonian mothers and found 48 of them were feeding their 2-year-olds coffee on a daily basis. Pregnant moms are faced with a long list of potentially harmful foods and liquids for their newborns, and also what they have to avoid during breastfeeding so they don\u2019t transfer it to their baby through milk. However, there\u2019s been no known research examining the prevalence of coffee consumption on America\u2019s youngest citizens \u2014 toddlers.\n\nThe mothers in the study don\u2019t represent the average American mom \u2014 80 percent of them were Hispanic. Among coffee consumers, 67 percent of Hispanics drink coffee regularly, which is more than any other ethnic group in the United States, according to the National Coffee Association. It\u2019s not unheard of in their culture, too, for the children to enjoy a cup of coffee with their parents. Despite familial norms, the cardiovascular effects caffeine can have on a little heart may not be worth the risk.\n\n\u201cI think there is no place for caffeine in a child\u2019s diet until they become young adults, at age 18,\u201d Jessica Lieb, a registered dietician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told Today Health. \u201cAnd even in adults, it\u2019s important to be really careful. As in all things, caffeine should be consumed in moderation.\u201d\n\nBeyond the caffeine, coffee also has bad ties to the childhood obesity crisis in America. Babies and toddlers need high density nutrients, such as vitamins A and C, potassium, fiber, protein, and calcium. Coffee doesn\u2019t deliver enough of vitamins or minerals and actually interferes with their iron absorption, causing a risk for early-childhood anemia. Previous research has also found coffee and tea consumption among 2-year-olds triples the risk of a child becoming obese by the time he's enrolled in kindergarten. Coffee is addictive, and it usually pairs with creamers and sugar blends, which children are consuming in one big calorie concoction.\n\nSource: Burnham L, Merewood A, Knapp BP, Braun N, Makrigiorgos G, and Matlak S.
