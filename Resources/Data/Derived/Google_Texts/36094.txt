Police are investigating after human remains were found at a construction site in Woodland Park.

The Colorado Springs Gazette reports that Thursday's discovery marks the second time in two weeks that human remains were uncovered at an area construction site.

In late July, remains of a young Native American girl were found at a construction site in Fountain. Investigators say those were likely several hundred, if not several thousand, years old.

The Woodland Park Police Department, Teller County coroner and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation are looking into the latest discovery.

No other details have been released.
