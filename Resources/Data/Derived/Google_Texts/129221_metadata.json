Each bag included soil to represent Jamestown, river rocks for Lyons, pea seeds for Longmont and wildflower seeds for Boulder.\n\nPhotographer Peggy Dyer was at a BoCo Strong event on Sunday to photograph people for her \"One Million Faces\" project.

Project photographer Peggy Dyer, who previously took pictures of students at Lyons Elementary when the school reopened after the floods, invited people to pose holding a sign with a \"message to the world.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of healing that can come from people telling their truth,\" Dyer said.\n\nOn Sunday, people used whiteboard to write messages that included \"BoCo Beautiful,\" \"Rebuilding better and stronger\" and \"Stay strong, make them wonder how you're still smiling.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary Steffens, a Red Cross disaster recovery specialist, said the Red Cross paid for Dyer to come to the event through its mental health budget.\n\n\"It's really important to show that we're all together,\" she said. \"I really believe that together we're stronger.\"\n\nBill VanMatre, who volunteers with Lefthand Fire and Boulder's emergency radio services, helped coordinate communication and rescue efforts for those affected by flooding in Lefthand Canyon \u2014 and continues to work on recovery efforts.\n\nPhotographer Peggy Dyer was at a BoCo Strong event on Sunday to photograph people for her \"One Million Faces\" project.

For the performance, Playback's improvisational actors dramatized the audience's flood experiences.\n\nSunday's event kicked off a flood commemoration week, with events planned throughout this week in Boulder, Lyons, Jamestown and Longmont. Events include a Boulder night of community stories from first responders and volunteers, a community picnic in Lyons and an open house in Jamestown.\n\nFor a complete schedule and more information, go to BoCoStrong.org, call 303-441-1609, or email bocostrong@gmail.com.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Amy Bounds at 303-473-1341 or boundsa@dailycamera.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26488162/flood-recovery-event-celebrates-boulder-county-resiliency", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26488162:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-07T20:55:35-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Community leaders, volunteers and organizations from across Boulder County came together Sunday to commemorate  the September floods by sharing stories and information.", "title": "Flood recovery event celebrates Boulder County resiliency", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26488162/flood-recovery-event-celebrates-boulder-county-resiliency", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0907/20140907__08DCAFLOw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-09-08T00:10:52-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-07T20:48:49-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Amy Bounds,", "pubDate": "2014-09-07T21:00:37-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-07T20:55:35-0600", "sailthru.title": "Flood recovery event celebrates Boulder County resiliency", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "description": "Community leaders, volunteers and organizations from across Boulder County came together Sunday to commemorate  the September floods by sharing stories and information.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26488162/flood-recovery-event-celebrates-boulder-county-resiliency", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Community leaders, volunteers and organizations from across Boulder County came together Sunday to commemorate  the September floods by sharing stories and information.", "title": "Flood recovery event celebrates Boulder County resiliency"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "BoCo Strong, a sub-committee of the Long-Term Flood Recovery Group, held a flood commemoration event on Sunday at Gateway Park and Fun Center in Boulder.\nBoCo Strong, a subcommittee of the Long-Term Flood Recovery Group, hosted the flood commemoration event at Boulder's at Gateway Park and Fun Center with the goal of highlighting the county's resiliency.\nSunday's event kicked off a flood commemoration week, with events planned throughout this week in Boulder, Lyons, Jamestown and Longmont.\n\"One of the most amazing things was seeing all the cross interactions from different communities,\" said event co-organizer Tiernan Doyle, who works for Boulder Flood Relief.\nPhotographer Peggy Dyer was at a BoCo Strong event on Sunday to photograph people for her \"One Million Faces\" project."}
