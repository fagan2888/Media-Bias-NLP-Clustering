Soon after, the two in critical condition were sent by helicopter to Hartford Hospital, the NY Daily News reported. Two others are in serious condition.\n\nLate Sunday, Middletown Police are investigating the source of the Molly, which is the supposed \u201cpure crystalline powder form of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). \u201cOur first and foremost goal is to obtain information on the batch of Molly that was distributed to the students on campus,\u201d Police Chief William McKenna told The Associated Press. \u201cThis information is critical to ensuring the recovery of those students affected.\u201d\n\nThe symptoms the students exhibited were consistent with a Molly overdose, school officials said. However, McKenna said it could have been a \u201cbad batch\u201d of the drug. Not only can the man-made drug vary in potency, but dealers will sometimes cut the drug with somewhat cheaper substances to turn a higher profit, too. According to NIDA, these substances can include methamphetamine, synthetic cathinones (bath salts), caffeine, cocaine, and ketamine. Overdose symptoms include sharp increases in body temperature, which can cause liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system failure \u2014 death is a worst case scenario.\n\nReports of the overdoses first emerged early Sunday morning in an email from the Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Whaley; he reported three cases. Later, in the afternoon, another email brought that number up to six, and by about 6 p.m., the total was raised to 11. Ambulances were on campus throughout the day to ensure any students needing medical attention got it promptly. However, by 5 p.m., reports to the fire department had slowed down, the university\u2019s newspaper, The Argus, reported.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so shocking; because it feels like that could never happen to anyone that you know,\u201d Emma Soloman, a freshman at the university, told NBC Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s like no one is going to overdose, you know? Because it\u2019s so common, but then when it\u2019s in that grand of a scale, it\u2019s scarier.\u201d\n\nAs a stimulant and hallucinogenic, MDMA induces feelings of energy, euphoria, and emotional warmth. These effects are a result of a speedier heart rate and higher blood pressure, as well as increased activity among the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which then trigger the release of oxytocin and vasopressin \u2014 both play roles in love, trust, and sexual arousal. Regardless of these feel-good effects, it\u2019s practically impossible to determine the purity of the drug without an at-home drug test kit. Of course, your best bet is to just avoid it entirely.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "11, wesleyan, university, students, overdose, molly, police, suggest, bad, batch, blame", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eleven students at Wesleyan University in Connecticut were admitted to a hospital after suffering overdoses of Molly, otherwise known as MDMA.", "title": "'Bad Batch' Of MDMA Causes Overdose In 11 Wesleyan Students", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/11-wesleyan-university-students-overdose-molly-police-suggest-bad-batch-blame-323186", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/molly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eleven students at Wesleyan University in Connecticut were admitted to a hospital after suffering overdoses of Molly, otherwise known as MDMA.", "title": "'Bad Batch' Of MDMA Causes Overdose In 11 Wesleyan Students", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/11-wesleyan-university-students-overdose-molly-police-suggest-bad-batch-blame-323186", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/molly.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/23/molly.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-23T13:25:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-23T13:25:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eleven students at Wesleyan University in Connecticut were admitted to a hospital after suffering overdoses of Molly, otherwise known as MDMA."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00db\"", "article_summary": "After an apparent overdose of the popular synthetic party drug \u201cMolly,\u201d at least 11 students from Wesleyan University were hospitalized, with two critically ill, police said on Sunday.\n\u201cThis information is critical to ensuring the recovery of those students affected.\u201dThe symptoms the students exhibited were consistent with a Molly overdose, school officials said.\nOverdose symptoms include sharp increases in body temperature, which can cause liver, kidney, and cardiovascular system failure \u2014 death is a worst case scenario.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so shocking; because it feels like that could never happen to anyone that you know,\u201d Emma Soloman, a freshman at the university, told NBC Connecticut.\nRegardless of these feel-good effects, it\u2019s practically impossible to determine the purity of the drug without an at-home drug test kit."}
