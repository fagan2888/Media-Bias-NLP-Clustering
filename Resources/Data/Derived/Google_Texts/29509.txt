(Newser) â€“ A North Carolina man tried to surprise his wife with breakfast in bed, but he wound up surprising her so much that she shot him, reports WTVR. Police say that Zia Segule, 28, left their Fayetteville home about 10am yesterday, picked up some breakfast, and then returned. In doing so, he triggered the house alarm. When he got to the couple's bedroom, wife Tiffany, 27, shot him through the closed door, reports the Fayetteville Observer. He was struck in the upper chest, but, luckily, escaped serious injury. No charges are being filed.

"She woke up to the sound of the alarm, she got a handgun, and then she fired through the bedroom door," says a police spokesman. "She reasonably believed there was an intruder."
