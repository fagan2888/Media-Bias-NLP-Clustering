Ted Cruz \u2014 a vocal opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 compared Obama\u2019s exemptions of certain parts of the law to a dictatorship.\n\n\u201cOne of the most disturbing aspects of the Obama presidency is the willingness of this president to disregard the law, to ignore the law,\u201d the Texas Republican said in an interview with Fusion on Wednesday. \u201cYou know, we were talking a few minutes ago about Obamacare. And you mentioned it\u2019s the law of the land. If it\u2019s the law of the land, the president shouldn\u2019t keep ignoring the law.\u201d\n\nCruz gave several examples of the delays and exemptions Obama has established.\n\n\u201cHe unilaterally granted an exemption for big business for one year,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe law says big business doesn\u2019t get an exemption and the president just waved his hand and said, \u2018I am granting them an exemption.\u2019 He unilaterally granted an exemption for members of Congress. The law says that members Congress have to be on the exchange without subsidies just like millions of Americans. The president just waved his hand and said, \u2018Ignore that part of the law, I don\u2019t want to enforce it.'\u201d\n\nCruz was one of several key members of Congress to influence the shutdown of the federal government in October in a fight to defund the healthcare law.\n\n\u201cA president under a constitutional system doesn\u2019t have the ability to pick and choose which laws to follow,\u201d Cruz said during the interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the same pattern you see in dictatorial societies, where a leader says \u2018ignore the law, go with the power of the president instead.\u2019 That\u2019s not the way our constitution is supposed to work.\u201d\n\nCruz also clarified a comparison his father, Rafael Cruz, made previously, in which he compared Obama to Fidel Castro.\n\nRafael is originally from Cuba, was involved in the Cuban revolution and was once a supporter of Castro, but later fled to the United States.\n\n\u201cObviously there are enormous differences,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe United States is not imprisoning or torturing dissidents. But the point my father was making \u2014 he was focusing on a sentence that President Obama used in the last two state of the union addresses where he said, \u2018If Congress doesn\u2019t act, I will.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz also clarified a comparison his father, Rafael Cruz, made previously, in which he compared Obama to Fidel Castro.", "vf": {"unique_id": "wp_chron_blog_chron_com_txpotomac_1944_blogEntryId73497"}, "title": "Ted Cruz says President Obama acted in a 'dictorial' way during health care roll-out", "og": {"site_name": "Texas on the Potomac", "description": "Cruz also clarified a comparison his father, Rafael Cruz, made previously, in which he compared Obama to Fidel Castro.", "title": "Ted Cruz says President Obama acted in a \u2018dictorial\u2019 way during health care roll-out", "url": "http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2013/12/ted-cruz-says-president-obama-acted-in-a-dictorial-way-during-health-care-roll-out/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/files/2013/11/ted_cruz3-620x412.jpg", "height": 412}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/files/2013/11/ted_cruz3-620x412.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-05T19:47:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-05T19:47:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb58\"", "article_summary": "The law says that members Congress have to be on the exchange without subsidies just like millions of Americans.\nBut the point my father was making \u2014 he was focusing on a sentence that President Obama used in the last two state of the union addresses where he said, \u2018If Congress doesn\u2019t act, I will.\nThe president just waved his hand and said, \u2018Ignore that part of the law, I don\u2019t want to enforce it.\nSen.
