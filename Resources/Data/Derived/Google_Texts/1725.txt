PRESCOTT, Ariz. (AP) - A student at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University is dead after a six-car accident in Prescott.

Prescott police identified the victim of Tuesday morning’s crash as 19-year-old Khrystyna Gavryushenko of Oxnard, California.

Embry Riddle officials say she was entering her sophomore year and majoring in aviation business administration.

Investigators say the car driven by Gavryushenko collided with another a vehicle traveling in the same direction in the adjacent lane.
