(AP) \u2014 The Marquette grapevines clinging to a steep, rocky hillside in the southeastern Adirondacks are among a host of new grape varieties that have enabled a boutique wine industry to take root in areas of the Northeast and Midwest that were previously inhospitable.\n\nThere were about 2,000 wineries in the U.S. in 2000; today, there are more than 8,000, according to the industry publication Wines and Vines.\n\n\u201cAcross the country we\u2019ve seen a huge expansion in wine and grape production and wine-related tourism,\u201d said Bruce Reisch, who leads Cornell University\u2019s wine and grape research and development program in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes.\n\nAnd the new influx of tourism dollars can be traced to, among other places, Cornell and the University of Minnesota, which have developed these hybrid grapes that withstand brutal winters and disease \u2014 and provide the quality and consistency needed to produce fine wine in places like Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio.\n\nIn New York, the number of wineries has grown from 35 in 1980 to nearly 500, with the third-highest production in the nation.\n\n\u201cNew York has had a bad reputation for red wines, mainly because of a lack of consistent quality,\u201d said Gary Akrop, owner of Ledge Rock Hill Winery, a small winery and vineyard that was the first to release an award-winning dry red wine within the boundaries of the Adirondack Park. \u201cBut we grow grapes that are suited for cold regions and produce more consistent wine.\u201d\n\nLedge Rock Hill uses Marquette, a hybrid developed by the University of Minnesota and released for commercial production in 2006. \u201cI believe Marquette could become the standard for New York red wines,\u201d Akrop said.\n\nOne of the Cornell program\u2019s biggest successes is the Traminette, a cold-hardy white wine grape producing a floral, fragrant wine reminiscent of Gewurtztraminer. Since its release in 1996, Traminette has produced numerous award-winning wines and has been embraced by winemakers in the Midwest. Indiana winemakers have even dubbed Traminette the state\u2019s \u201csignature wine\u201d and have a website dedicated to it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New hybrid grapes help grow wine industry in cold US regions", "title": "New hybrid grapes help grow wine industry in cold US regions", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New hybrid grapes help grow wine industry in cold US regions", "title": "New hybrid grapes help grow wine industry in cold US regions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/new_hybrid_grapes_help_grow_wine_industry_in_cold_us_regions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/food-and-farm-new-grapes-new-wineries.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New hybrid grapes help grow wine industry in cold US regions", "title": "New hybrid grapes help grow wine industry in cold US regions", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/food-and-farm-new-grapes-new-wineries.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Esch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One of the Cornell program\u2019s biggest successes is the Traminette, a cold-hardy white wine grape producing a floral, fragrant wine reminiscent of Gewurtztraminer.\n\u201cI believe Marquette could become the standard for New York red wines,\u201d Akrop said.\n\u201cAcross the country we\u2019ve seen a huge expansion in wine and grape production and wine-related tourism,\u201d said Bruce Reisch, who leads Cornell University\u2019s wine and grape research and development program in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes.\n\u201cBut we grow grapes that are suited for cold regions and produce more consistent wine.\u201dLedge Rock Hill uses Marquette, a hybrid developed by the University of Minnesota and released for commercial production in 2006.\nIndiana winemakers have even dubbed Traminette the state\u2019s \u201csignature wine\u201d and have a website dedicated to it."}
