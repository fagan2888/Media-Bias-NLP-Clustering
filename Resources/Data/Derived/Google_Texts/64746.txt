Mary Cheney, the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney, isn’t pulling any punches when it comes to weighing in on her Senate-hopeful sister Liz’s objection to gay marriage, calling her view 100 percent wrong in a blunt Facebook posting picked up by various media.

Liz Cheney is running for the Senate in Wyoming, challenging Republican Sen. Mike Enzi. Mary Cheney has two children, Samuel and Sarah, with her long-time partner, Heather Poe, whom she married in 2012 in Washington, D.C.

“For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage,” Mary wrote in her Facebook page, CNN reported. “Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.”

The Facebook post was aimed at countering Liz Cheney’s previous campaign remarks against gay marriage. She said, CNN reported, that she is “not pro-gay marriage” and that the issue would be best left in the hands of states and voters to decide — not judges, or lawmakers.

The senate-hopeful only issued that statement on the heels of a survey that asked voters if they knew the candidate “supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage,” CNN reported.

Liz Cheney said, of the poll: “The people of Wyoming deserve an honest campaign. They should not be subject to the kind of dirty tricks this push poll represents.”
