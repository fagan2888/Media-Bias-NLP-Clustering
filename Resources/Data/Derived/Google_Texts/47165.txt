The Hahns are the owners of a cabinet manufacturing company called Conestoga Wood. They are also practicing Mennonite Christians who seek to “integrate their faith into their daily lives, including into their work.” For them, paying for abortifacient coverage for their employees would be a violation of their deeply held beliefs about the sanctity of life. Tomorrow, the Obama administration will argue in front of the Supreme Court of the United States that they should have to do so anyway.

The government’s position is that the Hahns do not have the right to run their company in accordance with their values and convictions. It says there is a “compelling interest” to ensure all women have access to contraception, and it apparently can think of no less burdensome way of accomplishing that end than by stepping in to dictate the terms of contract between a family of religious business owners and the women they employ.

According to SCOTUSblog’s Lyle Denniston, this creates “a direct conflict between the interests of some employers against those of their female workers of child-bearing age.” Yet it’s in the interests of everyone -- no less women than anybody else -- that people not be forced by the strong arm of the law to take actions that violate their consciences.

The polling bears that out: A December 2013 survey from CBS News and the New York Times found just 37 percent of Americans saying all employers should be required to cover the full cost of birth control for their female employees. A 55-percent majority disagreed, saying employers should be able to opt out based on religious or moral objections.
