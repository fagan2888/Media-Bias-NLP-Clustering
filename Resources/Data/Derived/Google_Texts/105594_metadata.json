A gunman, 26, opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, killing nine and injuring seven others before he himself was killed in a police shootout.\n\nRelated: Trump Explains What Would Get Him Out of the Presidential Race\n\nA visibly upset President Obama delivered a statement soon after the shooting, expressing frustration with the \u201croutine\u201d reactions that take place after such an incident and lamenting the inability to pass any gun reform legislation.\n\nIf voters were hoping to get specifics from his possible successors about what reforms they would like to see implemented, they were sorely disappointed.\n\n\"It is just beyond my comprehension that we are seeing these mass murders happen again and again and again,\u201d Hillary Clinton told reporters after a campaign event in Boston.\n\n\u201cAnd as I have said, we have got to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe. You know, I know there is a way to have sensible gun control measures that help prevent violence, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands and save lives. And I am committed to doing everything I can to achieve that,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Is Raking In the Cash, $25 at a Time\n\nHer chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), likewise called for \u201csensible gun-control legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a comprehensive approach. We need sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe must greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities so individuals and families can get the psychological help then need when they need it.\u201d\n\n\"The shouting at each other must end. The hard work of developing good policy must begin,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Friday, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump chalked up incidents like the one in Oregon to mentally ill people, but noted: \u201cThis is sort of unique to our country \u2014 the school shootings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably find out that like the others, \u2018gee whiz, he was a loner and sick like all the others,\u2019\u201d he said during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Rand Paul the Next Presidential Wannabe to Drop Out?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have problems,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the world works. For the next million years, people will slip through the cracks.\u201d\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson made a similar statement in an interview with conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt.\n\n\"The issue is the mentality of these people. And we need to be looking at the mentality of these individuals and seeing if there are any early warning clues that we can gather that will help us as a society be able to identify these people ahead of time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat I worry about is when we get to the point and we say we have to have every gun registered, we have to know where the people are, and where their guns are,\" according to Carson. \"That is very dangerous that I wouldn\u2019t agree with at all.\u201d\n\nA number of contenders in the crowded GOP took to social media and tweeted out their condolences.\n\nGun control could crop up as an issue in the first Democratic presidential debate on October 13 or the third GOP debate at the end of the month, but it is unlikely that candidates from either party will go beyond their previous, vague statements.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Several presidential candidates have offered their thoughts and prayers to the victims and families impacted by Thursday\u2019s mass shooting at a community college in Oregon.
