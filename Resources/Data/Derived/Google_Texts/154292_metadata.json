United States arises out of a set of facts that seem lifted from a soap opera. Yet, if the Court\u2019s two most conservative members had their way, it would have also cut off America\u2019s ability to conduct international diplomacy at its knees. Justice Antonin Scalia, in an opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, would strictly limit America\u2019s ability to comply with its own treaty obligations \u2014 calling into question whether foreign nations can trust the United States to keep the promises it makes on an international stage.\n\nMuch of the media coverage of Bond focused on its sensational facts \u2014 a microbiologist named Carol Anne Bond discovered that her best friend was pregnant with her husband\u2019s child, so she sought revenge by stealing a toxic chemical from her employer and smearing it on her untrustworthy friend\u2019s car, home and mailbox. Unfortunately for Ms. Bond, these actions lead to her being prosecuted under a federal law implementing the United States\u2019 obligations under an international treaty banning chemical weapons. Fortunately for her, however, they also made her the perfect litigant in a test case attacking America\u2019s ability to live up to these treaty obligations in the first place. She soon found herself represented by Paul Clement, the de facto Solicitor General of the Republican Party.\n\nAs a general rule, the federal government may not criminalize violent crimes such as murder or assault. The Constitution restricts the Congress\u2019 authority to a laundry list of powers such as the power to regulate interstate commerce, to tax and spend money or to set uniform rules for naturalization. Since the power to punish crimes such as assault are not on this list, those matters are typically reserved for the state.\n\nYet, the fact that Congress cannot ordinarily criminalize something like Bond\u2019s attempt to poison her husband\u2019s lover does not mean that they can never do so. The Constitution permits the president to \u201cmake treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur,\u201d and it also permits Congress to \u201cmake all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\u201d For this reason, the Supreme Court has long recognized that Congress may also make laws ensuring that treaties are fully implemented. As the Court explained in 1920, when the United States enters into a valid treaty, \u201cthere can be no dispute about the validity of the statute [implementing the treaty] . . . as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers of the Government.\u201d\n\nIn Bond, a majority of the Court, including the Court\u2019s four Democrats, joined an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that implicitly limits this power to enact laws implementing treaties. Though Roberts does not question that the United States can ban chemical weapons or their use as weapons of war, his opinion warns that this particular prosecution stretches too far. If the law implementing the chemical weapons treaty could be applied to Bond\u2019s case, Roberts writes, \u201cit would mark a dramatic departure from th[e] constitutional structure and a serious reallocation of criminal law enforcement authority between the Federal Government and the States.\u201d So the federal government cannot use a law implementing a treaty to prosecute criminal matters that are normally local in nature.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Roberts will impose additional limits on Congress\u2019 ability to implement treaties in the future.\n\nJustice Scalia, by contrast, would read Congress\u2019 independent power to enact laws implementing treaties out of the Constitution altogether. To accomplish this purpose, he engages in a bit of linguistic jiu-jitsu. Recall that the Constitution gives the president the power to \u201cmake treaties\u201d and it gives Congress the ability to enact laws carrying this power to make treaties into execution. As Scalia reads the Constitution, however, the power to \u201cmake\u201d a treaty is different from the power to \u201cexecute\u201d a treaty. Congress \u201ccould have appropriated money for hiring treaty negotiators, empowered the Department of State to appoint those negotiators, formed a commission to study the benefits and risks of entering into the agreement, or paid for a bevy of spies to monitor the treaty-related deliberations of other potential signatories.\u201d But once the treaty is made, according to Scalia, Congress\u2019 power ceases.\n\nThe implication of this view is that the President of the United States can reach a bargain with a foreign nation, have that bargain ratified by a supermajority of the Senate, and then suddenly find itself unable to comply with its obligations under that bargain. Worse, because Scalia is calling for a massive shift away from nearly a century of established law, the United States is already a party to many existing treaties that could be undermined if Scalia\u2019s views suddenly became law. Indeed, if a majority of the Court had joined Scalia\u2019s opinion, America could lose its ability to comply with numerous international obligations overnight. This is a recipe for turning the United States of America into a pariah nation. When we give our word to a foreign power, that word should mean something.\n\nTo be fair, just how limited America\u2019s ability to comply with its own treaty obligations would become under Scalia\u2019s rule is a little unclear. For one thing, Scalia leaves open the possibility that what are known as \u201cself-executing treaties\u201d \u2014 that is, treaties that do not require additional legislation to be implemented, could still be enforced \u2014 though he labels this possibility \u201carguable.\u201d Additionally, while Scalia rejects the idea that the Constitution specifically gives Congress the right to implement treaties, Congress could still enact laws that comport with our treaty obligations so long as it did so pursuant to a different congressional power \u2014 such as the power to regulate commerce. Justice Scalia has been, to say the least, inconsistent in laying out what he believes to be the limits on congressional action outside of its power to implement treaties. In 2005, for example, Scalia authored an opinion that left little doubt that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional. He then declined to follow this opinion when Obamacare reached his Court.\n\nYet, while Scalia has at times been uncertain about how he would fence in federal power, Justice Thomas \u2014 who joined Scalia\u2019s opinion in Bond \u2014 has not been the least bit uncertain. Unlike Scalia, Thomas endorsed a long-ago-discarded interpretation of the Constitution that would lead to child labor laws, the minimum wage and the ban on whites-only lunch counters being struck down. Indeed, as Thomas reads the Constitution, much of the modern web of commercial and labor regulation that Congress began to weave during the New Deal would simply cease to exist. If this miserly view of congressional power were then layered onto Scalia\u2019s vision for treaties, the United States would lose much of its ability to negotiate with foreign powers altogether.\n\nJustice Scalia\u2019s opinion, in other words, is an object lesson in why the justices should be reluctant to interfere with America\u2019s foreign policy.
