We hoped that such racist, fear-driven policies had been relegated to the past or banished to the darkest corners of the world occupied only by those barbarians.\n\nThe two of us, both Tennesseans, also share the warrior bond of having raised our right hands and sworn to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nJames Mackler (Photo: Submitted)\n\nBy our service in the military, we declared our willingness to lay down our lives in its defense. We have deployed to fight for the values that we hold dear and have seen firsthand what happens to a society that allows itself to be torn apart by sectarian fighting.\n\nOther than our military service, we have little else in common. We grew up in different times and circumstances with different religious traditions.\n\nOur differences are a source of strength and pride, not weakness and shame. This is how it should be for a nation of refugees.\n\nYesterday\u2019s refugees are today\u2019s gatekeepers. The gatekeepers should be manning their post, alert for the enemy but welcoming the innocent stranger, just as they were welcomed in the past. Instead, many are shutting the gate and cowering in fear. Worse still, as they hide behind the barricades, these \u201cleaders\u201d call for others to send their sons and daughters to distant frontiers to fight and die.\n\nJohn Castellaw (Photo: Submitted)\n\nWe understand, perhaps better than most, the need for security and intelligent immigration policies. Those who come to our shore must be screened and vetted. Those that pose a danger to our citizens should be denied entry.\n\nWe cannot be silent, however, when politicians maliciously use security as an excuse for intolerance.\n\nRemembering Oklahoma City among others, history has shown that refugees pose no more of a threat to our national security than native-born Americans. On the contrary, the contribution of refugees and immigrants to our nation\u2019s prosperity is undeniable. Some of the worst times in our history were times that we let our darkest emotions hold sway, whether forcing Irish Catholics into ghettos, denying entry to European Jews during World War II or interning Japanese-Americans because they looked different.\n\nRonald Reagan famously described America as a shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere. As Americans, Tennesseans and military veterans, we urge leaders on every level to keep that light burning and rethink the xenophobic policies they are promoting.\n\nThese policies divide us and make us weaker. They ignore our shared history. They disgrace and embarrass those of us who have fought and bled to preserve American values.\n\nJames Mackler is an Army combat veteran living in Nashville and serving in the Tennessee Air National Guard. He is Jewish and grew up in the Northeast. John Castellaw is a retired lieutenant general who led Marines around the world. He comes from the evangelical Christian tradition and is the third generation on his family farm in West Tennessee.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition holds a candlelight vigil to show support for Syrian refugees.
