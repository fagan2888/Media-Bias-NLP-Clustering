One of the biggest guns among the creditors is that toughest of taskmasters, the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAs of last week Greece and Ukraine look like mirror images. And it\u2019s not a pretty reflection.\n\nIn the Greek case, I.M.F. negotiators abruptly broke off talks Thursday with the Tsipras government in Athens, accusing it of failing to make a meaningful commitment to meeting the fund\u2019s famously austere conditions for debt relief, notably the targets for budget surpluses.\n\nRelated: Stocks Fall on Greece, Rate Concerns; US Dollar Slips\n\nNo succor for the long-suffering Greeks unless Alexis Tsipras, their anti-austerity prime minister, does things our way: This is the fund\u2019s message. With the collapse of last-ditch talks Sunday, Greece now teeters at the edge of a calamitous default and an exit from the European currency union.\n\nThe next day, Christine Lagarde published an open letter to Ukraine\u2019s creditors. In it, the I.M.F.\u2019s managing director castigated investors holding Ukrainian debt for not offering the Poroshenko government in Kiev the kind of debt relief the fund says Athens must not have. Astonishingly enough, Lagarde committed the fund to ladling out its $17.5 billion bailout even if Kiev defaults on its debt, as Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko now threatens.\n\n\u201cThe I.M.F., in general, encourages voluntary pre-emptive agreements in debt restructurings,\u201d Lagarde\u2019s letter said, \u201cbut in the event that a negotiated settlement with private creditors is not reached and the country determines that it cannot service its debt, the fund can lend to Ukraine consistent with its Lending-into-Arrears Policy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Wall Street Falls as Greece Crisis Unresolved\n\nThe schedules pressing on these two crises are now critical. Of Ukraine\u2019s $70 billion in sovereign debt, $23 billion must be either paid or restructured this month. Greece has payments of $23 billion due this year; this month it owes the I.M.F. $1.8 billion and private lenders $1.7 billion.\n\nOne seriously doubts Lagarde and her colleagues celebrate this weird coincidence, given the very unflattering light it casts. In 40 years of I.M.F.-watching, I\u2019ve never seen it behave in so nakedly political a fashion. Take this as a tale of two debtors and there\u2019s no shred of virtue in the fund\u2019s part in it.\n\nSome economists acknowledge that Greece\u2019s task now is to recover not from the financial crisis that took hold in 2009 but from the strict austerity policies imposed as conditions of its 2010 and 2012 bailouts. Nonetheless, the I.M.F. and Greece\u2019s other major lenders\u2014the European Central Bank and the European Commission\u2014insist that Greeks must swallow more of the same medicine to gain access to further assistance.\n\nTsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have proposed alternatives to the most stringent of these conditions, especially those affecting wage earners and pensioners, but these have gone nowhere in Brussels and Frankfurt.\n\nRelated: IMF\u2019s \u2018Never Again\u2019 Experience in Greece May Get Worse\n\nFive-to-twelve talks collapsed in less than an hour on Sunday. Sources well connected in European financial circles tell me the principal sticking point is the set of targets governing Athens\u2019 surpluses in its primary budget, which is the revenue left after all expenditures other than debt service.\n\nGreece\u2019s lenders had previously insisted on surpluses of 3.5 percent this year and 4.5 percent in 2016. Given that these targets are universally acknowledged to be unrealistic, the lending institutions have now come down to one percent and are sticking adamantly to it. \u201cAthens is holding out for less than 0.5 percent,\u201d one of these sources wrote Sunday morning.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly politics now, in my read, but this is starting to cut two ways.\n\nOne, the E.U. doesn\u2019t much want a left social democracy of Greece\u2019s stripe in its midst\u2014especially given the rise of similar parties in Spain and elsewhere. Syriza, the governing party, was elected by a huge margin last January on a platform four-square opposed to Europe\u2019s neoliberal norm.\n\nTwo, the Obama administration, which has always urged a settlement that will keep the eurozone intact, is now weighing in more heavily. But the pull\u2019s in the opposite direction, which complicates matters further.\n\n\u201cDuring the G-7 meeting in Germany last week,\u201d a source wrote over the weekend, \u201cthe U.S. was strident in pushing the E.U. to compromise further with Greece, as Washington is starting to panic that the entire southern flank of NATO could crumble at the very moment Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen are in flames.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Greece. The end is near, but we don\u2019t know it yet. \u201cA credible proposal needs to be tabled by the Greeks in the next 24 hours,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, who heads the European desk at the Eurasia Group, told the Financial Times Sunday afternoon European time. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s looking like \u2018game over\u2019 for Athens.\u201d\n\nRelated: Despite IMF Walkout, Greece Hopes for Deal on June 18\n\nAs to Ukraine, this column predicted a couple of weeks ago that creditors would accept Kiev\u2019s restructuring exercise known as a haircut. They still may, but Lagarde\u2019s surprise move Friday isn\u2019t a good sign: Why would she effectively give Finance Minister Jaresko dispensation to default if talks with lenders were going well?\n\nDefaults are always one degree or another of horrific. What we\u2019ve got in Ukraine is a geopolitical circumstance that apparently overrides the mess in Lagarde\u2019s mind.\n\nYet there are political risks all around. If Tsipras gives too much away in last-minute talks, the potential for instability in Greece is perfectly obvious. If he stands his ground on behalf of his electorate, as he said over the weekend he must, the instability would be the E.U.\u2019s.\n\nIn Ukraine, one reason the I.M.F. is willing to keep lending, apart from the geopolitics, is that the Poroshenko government is implementing the austerity measures the fund requires. But their severity is a miscalculation, and when the effects are felt, last year\u2019s revolution in Kiev may prove not its last.\n\nInflation in Ukraine now hovers at 60 percent\u2014and higher for many foodstuffs. Citing a locally conducted poll last week, Bloomberg News put Poroshenko\u2019s popularity at 13 percent. For Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the prime minister carrying the ball on the austerity program, it is 1.6 percent. This is not a stable situation.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Until a few days ago, the Greek and Ukrainian debt crises looked like twins: Two sover", "title": "Markets Fear the End Game for Greece as IMF Gives Ukraine a Free Pass", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/15/Markets-Fear-End-Game-Greece-IMF-Gives-Ukraine-Free-Pass", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/eurozone-greece-deal_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/15/Markets-Fear-End-Game-Greece-IMF-Gives-Ukraine-Free-Pass", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/eurozone-greece-deal_1.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Until a few days ago, the Greek and Ukrainian debt crises looked like twins: Two sover", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bbe\"", "article_summary": "Of Ukraine\u2019s $70 billion in sovereign debt, $23 billion must be either paid or restructured this month.\nGreece has payments of $23 billion due this year; this month it owes the I.M.F.\nAs of last week Greece and Ukraine look like mirror images.\nWith the collapse of last-ditch talks Sunday, Greece now teeters at the edge of a calamitous default and an exit from the European currency union.\nIf Tsipras gives too much away in last-minute talks, the potential for instability in Greece is perfectly obvious."}
