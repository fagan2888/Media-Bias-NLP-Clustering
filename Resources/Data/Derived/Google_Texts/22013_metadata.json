To deal with the aging population, increased access to care after healthcare reform and the new value-based healthcare model, the ANA recommended actions on federal funding, nurse education and hiring practices to make sure the industry meets demand and focuses on quality.\n\nDespite debate about the validity of a nursing shortage, the number of registered nurses across the country continues to rise, reaching 2.7 million in 2012 and growing even more since then, FierceHealthcare previously reported. The problem isn't just in the U.S.--it's global. India needs 2.4 million more nurses, according to a 2010 report from the World Health Organization, while Canada anticipates a shortage of 600,000 nurses by 2022.\n\n\"We're seeing mixed signals today in the nurse employment market. There have been layoffs by some hospitals at the same time that 'registered nurse' ranks as the most advertised position nationwide,\" ANA President Pamela F. Cipriano, Ph.D., R.N., said in the announcement.\n\nANA recommendations include:\n\nIncrease federal funding for Title VIII by 12 percent for 2015.\n\nBolster nurse education by developing and recruiting more educators, increasing capacity of nursing programs, replacing aging faculty members and boosting incentives to teach.\n\nHighlight the importance of transitioning from education to practice. Encourage new hires to work with experienced RNs.\n\nAs hospitals hire more nurses, leaders should consider recruiting and hiring more male nurses to diversify the hospital workforce and ultimately benefit patients, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the announcement (.pdf)\n\n- check out the ANA statistics\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals must recruit male nurses to diversify workforce\n\nNumber of registered nurses grow as professionals delay retirement\n\nNurses week bring shortage issues to light\n\nThe nursing shortage: Myth or reality?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifty years after the Nurse Training Act of 1964, and as many of those original nurses retire, the United States will need to produce 1.1 million new\u00a0registered nurses\u00a0by 2022 to fill jobs and replace retirees, according to an\u00a0announcement\u00a0from the\u00a0American Nurses Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Fifty years after the Nurse Training Act of 1964, and as many of those original nurses retire, the United States will need to produce 1.1 million new\u00a0registered nurses\u00a0by 2022 to fill jobs and replace retirees, according to an\u00a0announcement\u00a0from the\u00a0American Nurses Association.", "title": "US must produce 1.1 million nurses by 2022 to meet demand", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/us-must-produce-11-million-nurses-2022-meet-demand/2014-09-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Nurses Association,Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Nurses,Nursing shortage,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaba8\"", "article_summary": "The United States will need to produce 1.1 million new registered nurses by 2022 to fill jobs and replace retirees, according to an announcement from the American Nurses Association (ANA).\nIndia needs 2.4 million more nurses, according to a 2010 report from the World Health Organization, while Canada anticipates a shortage of 600,000 nurses by 2022.\nDespite debate about the validity of a nursing shortage, the number of registered nurses across the country continues to rise, reaching 2.7 million in 2012 and growing even more since then, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nAs hospitals hire more nurses, leaders should consider recruiting and hiring more male nurses to diversify the hospital workforce and ultimately benefit patients, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nAbout one in five nurses is set to retire soon, according to statistics from ANA."}
