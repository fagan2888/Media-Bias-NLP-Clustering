Growing faster than income, average premiums amounted to 20 percent or more of the median income in all but 13 states and the District of Columbia in 2013, compared to just two states (New Mexico and West Virginia) in 2003. In seven states \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and West Virginia \u2014 average premiums were 25 percent to 28 percent of the state median income in 2013.\n\nCompanies, to keep their costs low, have shifted more of the funding responsibility to workers. The report said that in 2013, employees contributed an average 21 percent of the total premium for single-person coverage, up from 17 percent in 2003. Add in premium hikes, and employees are paying 93 percent more.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sessions: Crime surge crashes into election, 'people not safe in their homes' FBI Director James B. Comey had an odd plea to Washington reporters when he met them earlier this month.
