But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) won\u2019t hand over documents subpoenaed months ago by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the House oversight committee, thinks HHS officials are purposely keeping potential co-op customers in the dark as long as possible.\n\n\u201cHealth and Human Services has not provided any valid legal reason for withholding information from this committee,\u201d Chaffetz said during a Tuesday hearing on federal agencies\u2019 failures to comply with congressional document requests. \u201cRather, they assert that if certain information was released publicly, it could cause consumers to think twice before enrolling in CO-OP insurance plans.\u201d\n\nThe co-ops have already cost taxpayers billions, leaving many enrollees \u201cscrambling\u201d to find new health insurance, he added. More than 800,000 customers have lost coverage through the failures nationwide, and many more are expected to lose coverage in 2016.\n\nFederal health officials are also denying medical reimbursements to doctors and hospitals that have served patients insured by failed co-ops, a DCNF investigation found.\n\nFederal reports have documented personal information security concerns, website failures and poor eligibility screening processes plaguing Obamacare exchanges and co-ops.\n\nThe committee sent a letter to HHS Acting Administrator Andrew Slavitt in November, demanding the documents about criteria for determining co-op sustainability and viability, co-op and exchange corrective action plans, the financial status of each co-op and exchange, the total federal taxpayer funds expended on each co-op and exchange, and any plans to recoup federal funding provided to failed co-ops and exchanges.\n\nWhen most of the requested documents were withheld, the committee issued the February 2016 subpoena Chaffetz says HHS officials are now defying. \u201cOur efforts to obtain information about these programs have been met with unexplained delays and what seems like bad faith,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginally reported by The Daily Caller.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal health officials refuse to give Congress hundreds of subpoenaed documents on Obamacare\u2019s failed co-ops so that people will continue enrolling", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "Federal health officials refuse to give Congress hundreds of subpoenaed documents on Obamacare\u2019s failed co-ops so that people will continue enrolling", "title": "Feds ignore house subpoena For Obamacare co-op docs", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 350, "identifier": "http://www.trunews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obamacare-300x250.jpg", "height": 250}, "url": "http://www.trunews.com/feds-ignore-house-subpoena-for-obamacare-co-op-docs/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 107546629279454, "app_id": 107546629279454}, "msvalidate.01": "F6797679D7E81DB3F5C960F7552EF745", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/trunews", "section": "Featured", "tag": "ticker", "published_time": "2016-04-20T07:30:35-04:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33f5\"", "article_summary": "Federal health officials are also denying medical reimbursements to doctors and hospitals that have served patients insured by failed co-ops, a DCNF investigation found.\nRepublican Rep.
