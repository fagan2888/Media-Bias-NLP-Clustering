(Portland Tribune/Jonathan House)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (The Tribune) \u2014 We all know that eating more fruits and vegetables leads to better health. But what if your doctor could actually write a prescription for healthier food?\n\nZenger Farm, in partnership with Multnomah County Health Department and the National College of Natural Medicine, is taking the first step toward that dream with a pilot program to offer what they are calling Prescription Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA).\n\n\u201cI would rather see health care in the grocery store than in the pharmacy,\u201d says the Southeast Portland urban farm\u2019s Program Director David Perry.\n\nMany of the details of the program are being worked out, but by next June around 40 patients will begin receiving their share of produce from local farms. The weekly harvest varies with the season and with the farm, but Zenger Farm\u2019s shares aim to feed a family of four, so the patients\u2019 families will see benefits too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new way to hear about a CSA and that it is achievable financially,\u201d Perry says, adding that his boxes, which include recipes and donated grains from Bob\u2019s Red Mill, cost $27 per week, with some scholarships available.\n\nPerry jokingly calls CSA shares the original form of crowdfunding, a business model made popular by Kickstarter. Instead of using bank loans to fund initial annual costs, for the past 25 years some small farmers have invited the community to buy a \u201cshare\u201d of their harvests at the beginning of the year. Then customers pick up boxes of the bounty each week, either at the farm or at farmers markets.\n\nIf Zenger\u2019s program works, people could be picking up their apple a day at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nFarm has seen success\n\nIt feels good to be out on the farm.\n\nThe people trickling out of their cars on a recent October morning at Zenger Farm take deep breaths of the chilly air and lock their eyes on bright red peppers, dark green acorn squash and blushing yellow carrots. They are here to pick up their share of vegetables and fruits.\n\nSisters Ruth Graham and Suzette Brouillard of the Cully neighborhood in northeast Portland make the trek out to this urban farm on Southeast Foster Road each week from June to mid-November to pick up their share of the farm\u2019s weekly harvest. The sisters feel grateful to be part of a 3-year-old program that allows them to spend their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) dollars on the share. Thanks to a scholarship, just $20 buys them several pounds of local, organic produce each week.\n\n\u201cWe are eating a lot more fruits and vegetables,\u201d Graham says, adding that she and her sister have both lost weight during the summer. \u201cMy doctor\u2019s happy with our cholesterol.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of feedback that led Zenger Farm\u2019s Assistant Farm Manager Bryan Allan to wonder if access to their CSA could be expanded into a sort of doctor-prescribed service for people struggling with diabetes, heart disease and other ailments known to be associated with poor diets.\n\n\u201cIn general, people\u2019s comments are about their health,\u201d Allan says of CSA participants.\n\nAs part of a larger grant from the Oregon Department of Agriculture, the farm will begin to sign people up beginning in June 2015. Doctors at each health institution will select a group of 20 patients to \u201cprescribe\u201d a CSA share in the hopes that it will improve their health. Patients will still have to pay for the food themselves and pick it up each week, but organizers are hoping that the official guidance will help turn thoughts to action.\n\n\u201cA prescription is really just an authority giving you a recommendation,\u201d Allan says, noting that a suggestion in a health center feels different than one at a grocery store. \u201cIt\u2019s all of these intangible aspects that hopefully will have the impact we are hoping for.\u201d\n\nCould food prescriptions work?\n\nInternist Dr. Craig McDougall agrees that the place where most Americans learn about food choices from is far from ideal.\n\n\u201cPeople get their information from industries that are trying to sell you their products,\u201d McDougall says.\n\nHe is the lead physician of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Healthy Living Program, a lifestyle medicine clinic, which is not part of the pilot program. But McDougall says it could make a dramatic impact in participants\u2019 health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never made anybody well by giving them more pills,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you never will, because that\u2019s not the underlying problem. The problem is not that they didn\u2019t have a pill in their life. The problem is that they were not having the right lifestyle.\u201d\n\nBut while health insurance companies pay billions for medicine each year, Pacific University Assistant Dean of Pharmacy Michael Millard, RPh, says he would be surprised if they were ever willing to start paying for food.\n\n\u201cYou can see that food is sort of a slippery slope. You start buying everybody food and then that really is going to make health insurance expensive,\u201d Millard says.\n\nProgram Director David Perry says he is a bit more optimistic after Zenger Farm\u2019s success with the program to use SNAP for CSAs. Now, with the Affordable Care Act and coordinated-care organizations giving companies more latitude in their approaches to health care, Perry says they see an opening.\n\n\u201cWhat the health care industry is really excited about is with the Affordable Care Act, the payment model is shifting from paying for treatments to paying for outcomes,\u201d Perry says. \u201cWe have to be able to demonstrate the success of it, which is no easy task, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re diving into.\u201d\n\nMultnomah County Health Department will track the health of its participants from Mid County Health Center on Southeast Division.\n\nThat said, health care is not truly the goal of this particular program. Funded by the Oregon Department of Agriculture, the project\u2019s primary aim is to find new customers for local farms.\n\n\u201cWhat ODA is most interested in is increasing sales for farmers,\u201d Perry says.\n\nBlazing a trail\n\nThe full two-year, $68,392 ODA grant will fund a training program and toolkit for five vegetable farms who want to partner with institutions, such as large businesses, churches, or fitness centers, to offer their CSA programs. Employees, congregants or gym members will be able to pick up their share from a place they already go, instead of having to make a separate trip to the farm or farmers market.\n\nPerry says farming is such a low-margin industry that farmers can\u2019t afford to spend a lot of time figuring out the logistics of a new customer base. Zenger and the other four farms in the pilot project aim to work out a roadmap for other farms to follow.\n\nDr. Courtney Jackson is the co-founder and lead physician of NCNM\u2019s new Food as Medicine Institute and is excited about the possibilities. NCNM has partnered with Zenger before and was quick to sign on to this new project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit of trail-blazing of seeing how the logistics play out and how the patients react when they are offered an opportunity to participate in a CSA,\u201d Jackson says.\n\nSami Jarrah, deputy director for Integrated Clinical Services at Multnomah County Health, says access to healthy foods has always been a goal for their community health clinics.\n\n\u201cThis actually goes to the roots of community health centers,\u201d Jarrah says. \u201cAnd health reforms give us a little more flexibility to do things like this that fall outside of a typical health center visit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "We all know that eating more fruits and vegetables leads to better health.
