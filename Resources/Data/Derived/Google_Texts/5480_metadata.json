Several have been behaving more like Trump campaign spokespeople than the conservative commentators I once knew them to be.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve found particularly disheartening is that for years (decades in some instances), these same people had based their compelling, consistent arguments on conservative and traditional sensibilities that they seemed to genuinely espouse.\n\nIn many ways, they exemplified the success of the Fox News network \u2015 a revolutionary media organization that has built a large audience by granting a platform to credible, conservative voices in an industry otherwise dominated by liberal group-think.\n\nThat\u2019s never meant that those voices have been bound to a specific political agenda. Many critics argue that Fox News is a propaganda arm of the Republican Party, but that simply isn\u2019t true. FNC has featured (and continues to feature) a plethora of viewpoints and critical analysis from both sides of the political spectrum. What Fox has done is offer an alternative perspective and reporting style to that of the traditional, mainstream news media.\n\n\n\nThe appeal to right-leaning thinkers like myself has been hearing the insight of honest, principled people who share my frame of reference. I\u2019m not looking for voices who necessarily agree with me or validate my preconceived notions. I\u2019m looking for solid judgement and integrity.\n\n\n\nWhat I\u2019ve witnessed with the rise of Donald Trump as a serious presidential contender is a number of commentators (not just on Fox, but across the conservative media spectrum) suddenly shelving their long-stated principles, in order to campaign for a candidate who outright rejects those principles. They\u2019ve coddled Trump. They\u2019ve apologized for him. They\u2019ve made unbelievable allowances for him that they have made for no one else, and it has been the height of hypocrisy.\n\n\n\nIn many ways, the exodus mirrors the frustrations felt by the conservative movement as a whole. As more and more Republican voters throw in with Trump, based almost entirely on his persona, conservatives are losing their voice. We\u2019re somehow being lumped in with \u201cthe establishment\u201d, and are being called upon to suck it up and pledge our allegiance to Trump if he wins the Republican nomination\u2026as if it\u2019s somehow our patriotic duty to so.\n\n\n\nBut it isn\u2019t our duty. Conservatives like me, who look at Donald Trump and see an unprincipled charlatan who doesn\u2019t even minimally share our belief system, aren\u2019t part of any \u201cestablishment.\u201d To insist that we are, and that we must somehow now atone for our sins by jumping aboard the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d is ludicrous. It\u2019s insulting.\n\n\n\nUp until yesterday, I felt as though that viewpoint had been almost entirely ignored by the television media, but a couple of Fox News hosts, who haven\u2019t compromised their principles in the era of Trump, explained why we conservatives don\u2019t necessarily owe Trump our allegiance.\n\n\n\nIn a panel discussion on The Five, co-host Eric Bolling brought up the recent comments from Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who pledged not to vote for Donald Trump, should Trump win the nomination. Bolling was perplexed by the stance, and declared that he (himself) would vote for whomever the Republican nominee was. He attributed Sasse\u2019s viewpoint to that of an \u201cestablishment type.\u201d\n\nGreg Gutfeld set him straight.\n\n\u201cIf you feel that as a conservative, it is violating your principles, then you have to follow your principles.\u201d said Gutfeld. \u201cI think the problem is\u2026it\u2019s not about \u2018then\u2019 in the future. It\u2019s about \u2018now.\u2019 It\u2019s like\u2026the whole process of the primary is supposed to allow you to figure out who you like and who you don\u2019t like. What worries me is when people demand or expect you to get behind somebody when you don\u2019t have to yet. We were seeing people talk about Trump being number one before there were primaries. Just \u2018get on board.\u2019 I think the cult of personality is the thing that people find a real problem with. It\u2019s hard to unify behind something that is unknown. I know more about black holes than I do about Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing moods. So I don\u2019t blame conservatives for going like , \u2018Hey, this isn\u2019t something that I believe in.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what he believes, but that could change. It could change in four months.\u201d\n\nDana Perino examined the point further:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t urge disruption of a party, and then not expect some disruption. What some have been asking for is a wholesale destruction of the Republican Party, because they hate it so much. And now, they want the people that they hate so much to just swallow the medicine and cast the vote. And I think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that without some sort of like, \u2018Hold on a second. Let me think for a minute. Is this big tent big enough for all us? Let me think for a second.\u2019 I mean, it\u2019s not that it hasn\u2019t been coming for a while, but I do think Ben Sasse speaks for a lot of people. Don\u2019t forget: Before there would be a #NeverTrump hashtag, there would have been a #NeverJeb hashtag. And a lot of people would have been on that, and they would have said they would have stuck with it\u2026\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s exactly right. The case that Trump supporters have been making for their candidate is that he is \u201canti-establishment.\u201d It has become quite clear that policies don\u2019t really matter to a lot of these people. Even Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2015 immigration \u2015 is registering low in the polls as a topic of concern among his faithful. This makes it hard to understand, then, how conservatives can be expected to remain with \u201cthe establishment\u201d for the sole purpose of supporting a nominee that has no regard for them.\n\nPersonally, I can\u2019t think of anything more \u201cpro-establishment\u201d than rubber-stamping someone\u2019s candidacy simply because they have your party\u2019s initial next to their name.\n\nAt the end of The Five, when asked about Trump\u2019s dominance in the Super Tuesday polls, Gutfeld laid it all out on the table:\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about being proven right. It\u2019s about being right. Polls don\u2019t interest me. If Donald Trump gets the nomination and loses the election, we will have four years to examine how many people on the right abandoned their principles for personality, and why did they do that?\u201d\n\nI agree, and I\u2019m thankful that conservatives still have some strong, principled voices on Fox.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I've been hard on Fox News in some of my columns over the past few months \u2015 not so much on the network itself or its hard-news reporting (which is superb),", "og": {"site_name": "BernardGoldberg.com", "description": "I've been hard on Fox News in some of my columns over the past few months \u2015 not so much on the network itself or its hard-news reporting (which is superb),", "title": "Expecting Conservative Compliance After a Trump Takeover", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/wp-content/uploads/sasse.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-01T11:47:23+00:00", "url": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/does-trump-deserve-conservative-compliance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I've been hard on Fox News in some of my columns over the past few months \u2015 not so much on the network itself or its hard-news reporting (which is superb),", "title": "Expecting Conservative Compliance After a Trump Takeover", "image": "http://bernardgoldberg.com/wp-content/uploads/sasse.jpg", "creator": "@JohnDalyBooks", "site": "@bernardgoldberg", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Contributors", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2016-03-02T14:43:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-01T11:47:23+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDalyAuthor/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Several have been behaving more like Trump campaign spokespeople than the conservative commentators I once knew them to be.\nIn a panel discussion on The Five, co-host Eric Bolling brought up the recent comments from Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who pledged not to vote for Donald Trump, should Trump win the nomination.\nAs more and more Republican voters throw in with Trump, based almost entirely on his persona, conservatives are losing their voice.\n\u201cIf you feel that as a conservative, it is violating your principles, then you have to follow your principles.\u201d said Gutfeld.\nMany critics argue that Fox News is a propaganda arm of the Republican Party, but that simply isn\u2019t true."}
