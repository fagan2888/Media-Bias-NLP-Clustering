The results were worse than she expected.\n\nSeveral expensive medical tests and doctor visits revealed that the pain in Woo Ching's back was a tumor.\n\nWoo Ching had been in remission for eight years. But now, the rare cancer that she thought she beat was back.\n\n\"Earlier that month we were on vacation visiting my son in Maine and I went from a little back pain to having four cancerous tumors,\" Woo Ching said. \"It's like all of the sudden you feel like 'I can't just be walking around with all this cancer,' and everything changes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpensive therapies, treatments and equipment have added additional challenges for the family as they fight the rare soft muscle tissue cancer. Woo Ching estimates that the family has spent close to $20,000 out-of-pocket already, and she hasn't received the bill for her latest hospital stay or started her second round of chemotherapy. But colleagues and friends are hoping to help alleviate some of the financial strain at the fourth annual Happy Smackah Fun Run in May.\n\nBerthoud resident Jill Woo Ching gets help walking down the stairs from her son Ben, 20, on Friday. Woo Ching has a rare form of cancer in her lungs and spine. She was a donor at last year's Happy Smackah and is this year's beneficiary. To view a video, visit www.timescall.com.

The inaugural run was launched to support event organizer Karen Cribby's husband, Dan, in 2010.\n\nThe fundraiser was labeled Happy Smackah -- a term coined by Dan Cribby -- to support those who are staying positive despite impossible challenges.\n\nLast year, the event raised more than $17,000 for Andy Barela, a former janitor at Niwot High School.\n\nKaren Cribby said several nominations came in supporting Woo Ching as the benefactor of this year's event.\n\n\"We think it's a combination of factors, mostly due to how much giving and community involvement she and her family have always been a part of,\" Cribby said. \"People want to give back to her for all she has given. This is the true spirit of the Happy Smackah.\"\n\nJackie Bilan, a Longmont High School teacher and close friend of Woo Ching's, provided one of the nominations.\n\nThe women have been friends for more than 20 years, and, Bilan said, she can't think of a more deserving family.\n\n\"They're the kind of people who give to everyone else, donate to everyone else,\" Bilan said. \"Never have they asked for anything even when times were tough for them.\"\n\nBilan has attended most doctors appointments, including several in Houston where Woo Ching was seeing specialists.\n\nWoo Ching has stayed positive \u2014 another characteristic that the Happy Smackah recipients share, Bilan said.\n\nRegistration is open for this year's event but, Woo Ching said, she can't stop thinking about next year.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm the one who needs this,\" Woo Ching said. \"It's so weird but I just keep thinking about how I'll be able to help whoever they choose next year.\"\n\n\"That's exciting for me,\" she said, \"to know that I can help someone else in the way everyone is helping me.\"\n\nContact Times-Call community reporter Whitney Bryen at 303-684-5274 or wbryen@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_25400837/longmonts-happy-smackah-event-benefits-berthoud-family", "modificationDate": "2014-03-22T18:49:59-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0322/20140322__22TCAHAPw_TEST~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "In the days following the September flood, Berthoud resident Jill Woo Ching and her family were cleaning out their muddied storage unit near Third Avenue and Main Street in Longmont.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:25400837:view"}, "startDate": "2014-03-22T21:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_25400837/longmonts-happy-smackah-event-benefits-berthoud-family", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0322/20140322__22TCAHAPw_TEST~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In the days following the September flood, Berthoud resident Jill Woo Ching and her family were cleaning out their muddied storage unit near Third Avenue and Main Street in Longmont.", "title": "Longmont's Happy Smackah event benefits Berthoud family"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "In the days following the September flood, Berthoud resident Jill Woo Ching and her family were cleaning out their muddied storage unit near Third Avenue and Main Street in Longmont.", "title": "Longmont's Happy Smackah event benefits Berthoud family", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_25400837/longmonts-happy-smackah-event-benefits-berthoud-family", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0322/20140322__22TCAHAPw_TEST~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-22T21:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-03-22T21:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont's Happy Smackah event benefits Berthoud family", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Whitney BryenTimes-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0322/20140322__22TCAHAPw_TEST~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-03-22T17:54:31-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6f2\"", "article_summary": "The fundraiser was labeled Happy Smackah -- a term coined by Dan Cribby -- to support those who are staying positive despite impossible challenges.\nShe was a donor at last year's Happy Smackah and is this year's beneficiary.\nKaren Cribby said several nominations came in supporting Woo Ching as the benefactor of this year's event.\nWoo Ching has stayed positive \u2014 another characteristic that the Happy Smackah recipients share, Bilan said.\nHer back was sore but bearable for weeks before Woo Ching decided to see a doctor."}
