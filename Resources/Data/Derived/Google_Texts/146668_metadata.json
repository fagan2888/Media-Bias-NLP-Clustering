Brown (D) campaigns to become the state\u2019s next governor, he can\u2019t escape being directly associated with his boss of the past eight years, Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is thinking about running for president and has recently seen his approval rating fall to an all-time low.\n\nDuring a forum for gubernatorial candidates hosted by the B\u2019nai Israel Congregation in Rockville on Sunday morning, the moderator asked Brown to explicitly explain how his positions differ from those of O\u2019Malley, if at all. Here\u2019s what Brown said:\n\nI\u2019m asked that question regularly on the campaign, and I always start by saying: First of all, Martin O\u2019Malley and I are different people. We share fundamentally the same values, right? Good schools, safe neighborhoods, a clean environment and access to affordable, quality healthcare.\n\nWe\u2019re different people. I\u2019m a first-generation American. My parents came to this country, my father out of poverty in Kingston, Jamaica. I spent 30 years in both active and reserve Army... [which included] a year in Iraq. And I sort of cut my teeth in public service in Maryland in the General Assembly, where Martin O\u2019Malley started as a council member in Baltimore and then a big-city mayor and now our governor.\n\nThe question that I often get... Marylanders say: \u2018What\u2019s next for Maryland? Right, so you said that we built some of the best schools in the nation, what\u2019s next?\u2019\n\nBut whether you ask a college president or a kindergarten teacher, one of the things we want to do to improve the quality of education \u2014 not just in Maryland but in this country \u2014 both the president and the kindergarten teacher will say: greater investment in quality pre-k. That\u2019s what\u2019s next for Maryland: greater investments in pre-k education.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I support what we did in the General Assembly this year and my plan to extend to all Maryland 4-year-olds by 2018, on a half-day basis, universal, voluntary pre-k.\n\nIn fact, my plan is different from many of the expansion plans that you may have seen over the years as we\u2019ve improved and expanded educational opportunities in Maryland. How\u2019s my plan different? This is the first time when we\u2019re promoting an expansion in education, and we are going to partner with non-profit providers.\n\nWhat does that mean? It means Jewish day schools are going to be able to compete to offer early-childhood education to Maryland 4-year-olds. Never been done before. And already this year when we announced 20 award recipients for the 4.3 million dollars to expand universal pre-k, many of those providers were non-public providers... So that\u2019s what\u2019s next in Maryland.\n\nWhen you look at healthcare, what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve implemented the Affordable Care Act... and we\u2019ve done a number of things. And what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got to address health disparities. So that\u2019s why I led the effort on creating health enterprise zones where we incentivize providers to deliver greater resources, primary care resources, into the community to help address disparities.\n\nI think the greatest challenge that we face as a state, and as a nation, is addressing the disparities and inequities and the gaps that exist, so as we build on the progress that we\u2019ve achieved \u2014 and no one is satisfied with that \u2014 we need to ensure that we\u2019re eliminating the gaps, the disparities and the inequities that exist.\n\nThat\u2019s the question that I get asked: What\u2019s next for Maryland? And I believe that\u2019s some of the answer of what\u2019s next in Maryland in education and healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Brown runs for governor, he can\u2019t escape his association with Gov.
