It dominated through three presidential election cycles, but \u201cin the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign, Crossroads \u2026 has been buffeted by a rapidly changing political landscape that is testing its pre-eminence, and potentially its survival.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nNot only is it facing possible IRS problems, the environment today is also increasingly competitive. Rove isn\u2019t Jeb Bush\u2019s fair haired bald guy, as he was former president George W\u2019s. However, it may also be hard to imagine Crossroads going all in on a non-Bush, given its ties to the former president.\n\nThe nonprofit arm of Crossroads is facing an Internal Revenue Service review that could eviscerate its fund-raising. Data projects nurtured by Mr. Rove are being supplanted in Republican circles by a more successful initiative funded by the Koch political network, which has leapfrogged the Crossroads organizations in size and reach. And the group faces intense competition for donors from a new wave of \u201csuper PACs\u201d that are being set up by backers of the leading Republican candidates for president, who are unwilling to defer to Mr. Rove\u2019s authority or cede strategic and fund-raising dominance to the organizations he helped start.\n\nCaught between a rock and a hard place, Crossroads seems to be playing down expectations, as well as its intended role. How that will jibe with a Rove so enamored with himself he once had a \u201chissy fit\u201d on Fox News when the network correctly called the race for Obama in 2012, remains to be seen.\n\nIf the group\u2019s role seems diminished, Crossroads officials are not complaining publicly. If anything, they are lowering expectations for an organization that raised $300 million in the 2012 cycle. \u201cOur goal is not to make American Crossroads the big dog of 2016,\u201d Mr. Law said in an interview. \u201cOur goal is to win the White House and hold the Senate and the House.\u201d He added that in the large field of Republican groups and campaigns, \u201cwe\u2019re a first baseman who effectively plays our position.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re a critical player,\u201d he said, \u201cbut part of the team.\u201d\n\nSo much for Rove\u2019s war on the Tea Party from 2013. At this rate, the conservative GOP grassroots may not have Karl Rove to kick around much longer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Karl Rove Not The King He Once Was", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Karl Rove Not The King He Once Was", "title": "Karl Rove Not The King He Once Was - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Rove-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/22/karl-rove-not-the-king-he-once-was/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Karl Rove Not The King He Once Was", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Rove-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Karl Rove Not The King He Once Was - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "American Crossroads, Karl Rove,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,karl rove", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Karl Rove", "published_time": "2015-05-22T07:10:12-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbaa1\"", "article_summary": "At this rate, the conservative GOP grassroots may not have Karl Rove to kick around much longer.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs the New York Times reports, Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads long sat at the top of the GOP political food chain.\nRove isn\u2019t Jeb Bush\u2019s fair haired bald guy, as he was former president George W\u2019s.\nData projects nurtured by Mr. Rove are being supplanted in Republican circles by a more successful initiative funded by the Koch political network, which has leapfrogged the Crossroads organizations in size and reach.\nHowever, it may also be hard to imagine Crossroads going all in on a non-Bush, given its ties to the former president."}
