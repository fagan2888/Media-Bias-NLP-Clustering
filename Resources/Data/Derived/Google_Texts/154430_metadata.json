The justices are expected to hand down a decision in June.\n\nThe backup plans being touted by Republicans may reflect concerns that they could be blamed for poor Americans losing their insurance if the Supreme Court blocks the health law's subsidies in most of the states. And now that they've hammered the Obama administration for not having a backup plan, they could look hypocritical for not proposing a Plan B of their own.\n\nBut the only Republican to release a detailed plan so far is freshman Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who wants to adapt \"Cobra\" \u2014 the law providing coverage to workers who have lost or changed jobs \u2014 to allow Obamacare subsidy recipients to keep collecting assistance temporarily.\n\nThe other proposals don't go into much detail about how those subsidies would work or how long they would last.\n\nIn a Fox News interview Tuesday, Ryan called the Obamacare tax credits \"thinly veiled subsidies policed by the Internal Revenue Service,\" but replied simply \"not at all\" when asked how they differ from the credits he's proposing.\n\nAnd the GOP proposals were rapidly dismissed by Democrats on Tuesday, who said they didn't believe Republicans would coalesce around one plan.\n\n\"This Republican Congress can't even keep the Department of Homeland Security operating for a week at a time,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\n\"None of these op-eds make a serious attempt to explain how they would remove the tax hike on middle class families or restore consumer protections that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nThe Republican proposals got criticized by some within the GOP's own ranks. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a potential 2016 presidential contender, blasted Republicans to trying to save the subsidies.\n\n\"Americans would pay billions more in higher taxes to fund the newly-restored subsidies, making Obamacare that much more entrenched,\" Jindal wrote in National Review. \"What self-proclaimed conservative of sound mind would do such a thing?\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have spent the final days before the latest Obamacare challenge insisting they want to maintain health insurance subsides should the Supreme Court strike them down.\nLeading GOP lawmakers \u2014 who support the King v.
