Vonn attempted to come back last season but reinjured the knee training at Copper Mountain that November, preventing her from racing in the Sochi Olympics.\n\nThe victory was Vonn\u2019s 60th on the World Cup, putting her two behind the all-time women\u2019s record held by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria, and was her 15th at Lake Louise, sometimes dubbed \u201cLake Lindsey\u201d because of her dominance there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just finding my rhythm and finding my confidence,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cEvery day has gotten better here, and today I went a little bit more aggressive than I did yesterday and took some more chances. I\u2019m finally feeling confident going fast again. I\u2019m finally back to where I feel confident and I\u2019m pushing the limits. I want more speed, and I haven\u2019t had that yet \u2014 until today.\u201d\n\nVonn was eighth in Friday\u2019s downhill, her first race in nearly a year. She analyzed video and made adjustments.\n\n\u201cI saw that was a little bit high in my tuck, I wasn\u2019t pushing myself as hard as I know I can,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI think that comes from not having trained that much. I made the adjustment, I tried to stay deeper in my tuck, I tried to be more aggressive in some turns and I think it paid off. I was just much faster all the way down.\u201d\n\nVonn said the U.S. women\u2019s speed team has \u201ca good energy\u201d now. Two seasons ago the U.S. women dominated downhill but last season in Vonn\u2019s absence, the others struggled.\n\n\u201cWe have a great team dynamic and everyone is excited for this season,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI think also, having the world championships in Vail has made everyone really excited to try to get some medals in our hometown.\u201d\n\nVonn may break Moser-Proell\u2019s record before those world championships (Feb. 2-15) at Beaver Creek. She will have four World Cup downhills and five super-Gs before then, including Sunday\u2019s super-G at Lake Louise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always something that I kind of think about, but it\u2019s mostly something that helps motivate me in the summer when I\u2019m working hard in the gym,\u201d Vonn said of the record. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just focused on trying to ski well (Sunday) and trying to keep improving. I haven\u2019t had that much training, so I\u2019m not expecting this kind of result all the time just yet, but it definitely gives me a lot of confidence for the season.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn gets 1st World Cup victory since January 2013", "title": "Lindsey Vonn gets 1st World Cup victory since January 2013", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/06/lindsey-vonn-gets-1st-world-cup-victory-since-january-2013/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141206_014253_lindsey-vonn.jpg", "height": 499}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141206_014253_lindsey-vonn.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-06T14:31:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:56:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0c8\"", "article_summary": "Lindsey Vonn claimed her first World Cup victory since January 2013 on Saturday at Lake Louise, Alberta, winning a downhill and sharing the podium with a pair of Californians to lead the first U.S. sweep of the top three places in a World Cup race.\nShe will have four World Cup downhills and five super-Gs before then, including Sunday\u2019s super-G at Lake Louise.\n\u201cWe have a great team dynamic and everyone is excited for this season,\u201d Vonn said.\nThe victory was Vonn\u2019s 60th on the World Cup, putting her two behind the all-time women\u2019s record held by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria, and was her 15th at Lake Louise, sometimes dubbed \u201cLake Lindsey\u201d because of her dominance there.\nTwo seasons ago the U.S. women dominated downhill but last season in Vonn\u2019s absence, the others struggled."}
