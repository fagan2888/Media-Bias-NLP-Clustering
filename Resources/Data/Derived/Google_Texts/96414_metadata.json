The off ramp was closed for much of the day as police investigated.\n\nFarrell and his car, a 1997 Honda Accord, were the only ones involved in the crash, which ended with the Honda wrapped around a light pole. Farrell was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a TPD media release.\n\nInvestigators determined that Farrell had crossed the 'gore' area to exit Tanque Verde when he lost control of the car, hitting the light pole sideways on the driver's side. They said he didn't seem to be wearing a seatbelt, and speed and impairment did not appear to be factors in the crash, according to the release.\n\nNext of kin have been notified.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
