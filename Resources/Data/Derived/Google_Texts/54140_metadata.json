They talked about it with Fox News Channel\u2019s Megyn Kelly in an interview that aired Friday.\n\nJessa Duggar said her brother was \u201ca young boy in puberty\u201d who was \u201ca little too curious about girls.\u201d\n\nAfter the fondling, the sisters said, their parents restricted the children from playing games like hide and seek and placed locks on bedrooms where the girls and boys slept separately. Jill Duggar said she was 12 when the abuse occurred, and Jessa Duggar said she was 9 or 10. Both women are now married.\n\nJessa Duggar said that she wanted to defend her brother against people who call him a child molester, pedophile or rapist. She said people can get angry at her for saying this is overboard, \u201cbut I can say this because I was one of the victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made some bad choices,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really the extent of it was mild, inappropriate touching, on fully clothed victims, most of it while girls were sleeping.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press generally doesn\u2019t identify victims of sexual mistreatment and didn\u2019t in this instance until the Duggar sisters came forward. Josh Duggar apologized for unspecified actions on a Facebook post but has not otherwise spoken publicly about fondling his younger sisters.\n\nThe Duggars\u2019 parents, in an interview with Kelly that aired on Wednesday, acknowledged that Josh Duggar had admitted fondling a baby sitter along with the four Duggar sisters. The parents said they took him for counseling. Police investigated the abuse three or four years later after being tipped by someone who knew the family, but no charges were filed.\n\nThe fondling became public over the past few weeks through news reports about the police records, which have since been destroyed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Duggar parents placed locks on bedroom doors after fondling", "title": "Duggar parents placed locks on bedroom doors after fondling", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Duggar parents placed locks on bedroom doors after fondling", "title": "Duggar parents placed locks on bedroom doors after fondling", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/06/duggar_parents_placed_locks_on_bedroom_doors_after_fondling/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/tv-duggar-interview.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Duggar parents placed locks on bedroom doors after fondling", "title": "Duggar parents placed locks on bedroom doors after fondling", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/tv-duggar-interview.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Bauder", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb99\"", "article_summary": "The Duggars\u2019 parents, in an interview with Kelly that aired on Wednesday, acknowledged that Josh Duggar had admitted fondling a baby sitter along with the four Duggar sisters.\nJosh Duggar apologized for unspecified actions on a Facebook post but has not otherwise spoken publicly about fondling his younger sisters.\nJill and Jessa Duggar, part of the Arkansas family featured in TLC\u2019s \u201c19 Kids and Counting,\u201d were among four sisters Josh Duggar touched inappropriately a dozen years ago, when he was a teenager.\nJill Duggar said she was 12 when the abuse occurred, and Jessa Duggar said she was 9 or 10.\nThe fondling became public over the past few weeks through news reports about the police records, which have since been destroyed."}
