On this afternoon, she\u2019s helping a Hmong woman enroll in Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cShe prefers English, so her kids can read to her, because she doesn\u2019t read and write in Hmong, and sometimes the translation gets lost when it\u2019s sent to her in Hmong,\u201d says Yang, a certified enrollment counselor at Fresno Center for New Americans.\n\nSince enrollment kicked off October 1, Yang and her team have enrolled about 500 people into Medi-Cal. It hasn\u2019t been easy: At Fresno Center for New Americans, there\u2019s a week-long wait to get an appointment with an enrollment counselor. The counselors only see about six people per day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, but it\u2019s also a good feeling knowing that people who don\u2019t have coverage are getting covered,\u201d Yang says.\n\nThroughout Fresno County, those involved in Medi-Cal enrollment say the process has been stressful - but steady. One by one, and in a spectrum of languages, they\u2019ve enrolled people at community group offices, public events, in rural communities, and even parole offices.\n\n\"It's overwhelming, but it's also a good feeling knowing that people who don't have coverage are getting covered\" - Neng Yang\n\nBy the end of last year, they\u2019d enrolled about half of the estimated 56,000 Fresno County residents who are eligible for Medi-Cal. That\u2019s according to the county Department of Social Services.\n\nBut enrollment is just one hurdle in this long process. Looking forward, there are questions about how tens of thousands of people \u2013 many of whom have never had insurance \u2013 will learn how to navigate the complicated healthcare system.\n\nAnd looking back, there are questions about whether this process could\u2019ve been easier, if the Fresno County Board of Supervisors had not turned down millions of federal dollars to establish a program to enroll the poorest people into insurance earlier.\n\n\u201cThere are people who have literally lost limbs, lost their sight, had heart attacks, who would not have had that happen to them if the county had gone for the Low Income Health Program,\u201d says Kevin Hamilton, deputy chief of programs for Clinica Sierra Vista.\n\nThe program, which was considered a \u201cbridge\u201d to Medi-Cal, would\u2019ve allowed the county to get a jump-start at enrolling thousands of the most vulnerable people into insurance. They would have been transitioned into Medi-Cal on January 1st. Instead, county officials and agencies are playing catch-up now, during Medi-Cal enrollment, Hamilton says.\n\n\u201cIt has gone so much more smoothly in other counties, where these patients were transferred by the states in a very smooth fashion,\u201d Hamilton says.\n\n\"It has gone so much more smoothly in other counties, where these patients were transferred by the states in a very smooth fashion\" - Kevin Hamilton\n\nOthers say it\u2019s not worth looking back at the Low Income Health Program, when there are still so many more people to enroll, and applications to process.\n\n\u201cFifty percent (enrollment), three months into it, is a huge accomplishment, given the statewide numbers of how many people need to enroll and where we\u2019re at,\u201d says Sonya Bugay, deputy director of the county Department of Social Services. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would\u2019ve made a huge amount of different. We\u2019re kinda going, \u2018woulda, coulda, shoulda.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhenever people are enrolled into Medi-Cal, the next question is: Does expanded access to health care translate to expanded use of preventative health care services? Not necessarily, says Kevin Hamilton, of Clinica Sierra Vista.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody is sick, is not the best time for them to learn,\u201d Hamilton says.\n\nHe says teaching people to use their new Medi-Cal insurance to seek preventative healthcare \u2013 instead of relying on the emergency room in a pinch \u2013 will require generational shifts. He envisions classes on navigating the health care system incorporated into school curriculums, and workshops offered by local community groups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see \u2013 and I\u2019d love to be referring my patients to \u2013 one of the local community based organizations for their, \u2018so you got health insurance now, what next\u2019 classes, where they\u2019re going to have pizza \u2013 healthy pizza, of course \u2013 and learn all about this, and bring the family,\u201d he says.\n\nAt Centro La Familia in southwest Fresno, enrollment counselors like Cindy Avila are beginning to do that on an individual basis. She will follow up with her newly insured clients, to make sure they visit a doctor before they ever get sick.\n\n\u201cWe keep status, we keep checking on them until they make their first appointment, so we get them to the first appointment, then we\u2019ll check on them within six months,\u201d Avila says.\n\nThat leads us to our next question. If all 56,000 people enroll in Medi-Cal, and learn how to utilize their insurance, will there be enough doctors to see them? The Central Valley already has a chronic shortage of primary care doctors and specialists.\n\nDavid Pomaville, interim director of the county health department, says that\u2019s a concern for down the line.\n\n\u201cRight now, the focus is on getting as many people into the system as we can. I think those will be the challenges going forward,\u201d Pomaville says.\n\n\"Right now, the focus is on getting as many people into the system as we can\" - David Pomaville\n\nBut Hamilton, of Clinica Sierra Vista, says it\u2019s an immediate problem. His network of federally qualified health centers has been swamped with people who are eager to finally see a doctor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s busier than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been busy, but now it\u2019s getting a little ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThose on the ground say the stress of enrolling thousands more into Medi-Cal, and of looming unknowns, becomes worthwhile when they see how relieved people are to finally have health insurance.\n\nBack at the Center for New Americans, Neng Yang lights up as she tells the story of one happy client.\n\n\u201cHe brought in some fruits and vegetables, and said, \u2018I don\u2019t have anything, but this is for you and the staff,\u201d Yang exclaims.\n\nShe becomes more serious as she explains that his reaction is motivation to push forward.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason we work so hard,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much for the money, but it\u2019s so much to help people out. All this time, some of them don\u2019t know the system, don\u2019t know how to access health care. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to enroll in insurance plans through Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance exchange, is March 31. Medi-Cal enrollment continues through the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "In a cramped cubicle in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Fresno County, Neng Yang is playing a small role in the country\u2019s healthcare overhaul.
