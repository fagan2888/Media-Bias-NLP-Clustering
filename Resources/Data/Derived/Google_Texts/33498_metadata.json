He pledged his desire to protect his people, while thanking America for her unrelenting support of his state \u2013 from Presidents Harry Truman to Barack Obama. Nevertheless, congressional Democrats decided it would be appropriate to bash the prime minister\u2019s appearance during a press conference directly following his passionate address.\n\nRep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) decried the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s speech as \u2018condescending\u2019 and was offended that Netanyahu was \u2018telling us how to operate.\u2019 He even invoked the name of Dick Cheney, \u201cThis is right out of the Dick Cheney playbook\u201d and bluntly told the prime minister, \u201cHe can go home.\u201d\n\nCongressman David Price (D-NC) then dared to say that House Speaker John Boehner should \u2018never\u2019 have invited Netanyahu to speak in front of Congress at this time.\n\nThe Fox News \"Outnumbered\" cast was shocked and outraged by the Democrats\u2019 response. Andrea Tantaros called them \u2018arrogant\u2019 for such comments and Harris Faulkner likened their words to \u2018vocal flame throwing.\u2019\n\nIn all, 57 Democrats boycotted Netanyahu\u2019s speech \u2013 with reports that number could have been even higher. Their decision to skip the speech was largely due to claims that Netanyahu\u2019s timing in Washington was too close to Israeli elections. Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged, however, that visiting DC for political purposes was \u2018never his intention.\u2019\n\nAs for President Obama and Vice President Biden, they were no shows as well.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s speech was apolitical, focusing instead on the threat of a nuclear Iran. He urged the White House to ditch an arms deal with Iran, which he warned would only pave the way to a more dangerous country.\n\n\u201cIts rapid appetite for aggression grows more every year\u2026This deal will not change Iran for the better, it will change the Middle East for the worse.\u201d\n\nShame on Democrats for ignoring Netanyahu\u2019s important warnings and for turning their backs on Israel at this fragile time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unbelievable..05/26/2016 4:46:09AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Unbelievable.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - 'He Can Go Home': Dems Decry Netanyahu Speech", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/03/03/he-can-go-home-dems-defiant-against-netanyahu-speech-n1965169", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/193/afb42174-f738-4032-a90c-edf804bed01a.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Unbelievable.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - 'He Can Go Home': Dems Decry Netanyahu Speech", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/03/03/he-can-go-home-dems-defiant-against-netanyahu-speech-n1965169", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/193/afb42174-f738-4032-a90c-edf804bed01a.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'He Can Go Home': Dems Decry Netanyahu Speech, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4c2\"", "article_summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a nonpartisan speech today in Washington, DC, asking for Congress\u2019s support in preventing a nuclear Iran.\nNetanyahu\u2019s speech was apolitical, focusing instead on the threat of a nuclear Iran.\nTheir decision to skip the speech was largely due to claims that Netanyahu\u2019s timing in Washington was too close to Israeli elections.\nAndrea Tantaros called them \u2018arrogant\u2019 for such comments and Harris Faulkner likened their words to \u2018vocal flame throwing.\u2019In all, 57 Democrats boycotted Netanyahu\u2019s speech \u2013 with reports that number could have been even higher.\nNetanyahu has repeatedly pledged, however, that visiting DC for political purposes was \u2018never his intention.\u2019As for President Obama and Vice President Biden, they were no shows as well."}
