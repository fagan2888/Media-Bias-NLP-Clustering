The laws continue to impinge upon school choice, block support for vouchers and tax credits, threaten religious freedom and prevent any funding that could eventually benefit Catholic schools, families and students.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons Ave Maria University raced to court,\u201d Towey continued, \u201cwas because we knew that the Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate was an attack on our religious freedom, and without that you can\u2019t be a Catholic university.\u201d\n\nSupporters of faithful Catholic education will be monitoring the ongoing religious freedom challenges to the HHS Mandate, which the U.S. Supreme Court is set to rule on in the upcoming term. The impending Supreme Court decision will influence not only the Little Sisters of the Poor and religious-based organizations, but also Catholic universities, colleges and schools across the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court could also decide as early as this month whether it will hear a school choice case involving Colorado\u2019s discriminatory Blaine Amendment. It\u2019s possible that Justices could invalidate Blaine Amendments across the country when deciding the case.\n\n\u201cThe government could have exempted faith-based organizations, but they didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d said Towey about the HHS Mandate. \u201cThey only exempted churches, and it was a very narrow and pernicious initiative by the administration to attack people of faith and that\u2019s why it\u2019s now going to have to be settled by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nAnd it is astonishing to see how a history of religious bigotry and anti-Catholic discrimination can be so easily swept under the rug, especially in a culture so alert to claims of discrimination, said Towey.\n\n\u201cYou see at Yale these plans to purge their history by trying to remove statues of former slave owners and so forth, but they\u2019re completely comfortable with these Blaine Amendments staying on the books of states when they are nothing but born of religious bigotry and anti-Catholic fervor,\u201d he said, referencing resurfacing debates at Yale over a dormitory named after prominent 19th century slave owner John C. Calhoun.\n\n\u201cBut where\u2019s the outcry from these individuals so concerned about past history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat just shows the force of the secular orthodoxy and how it\u2019s destroying faith-based institutions.\u201d\n\nBlaine Still Harassing Catholic Education\n\nEven a century later, the impact of the Blaine Amendments has not waned. After former Speaker of the House and U.S. Secretary of State James G. Blaine failed to amend the U.S. Constitution, versions of the amendment were \u201cadded to state constitutions in order to enforce the nativist bigotry of the day\u201d against Catholics, according to The Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\n\u201cThe influence of Blaine is still being felt 150 years later,\u201d Towey told the Newman Society. \u201cUnfortunately, it was the price of admission for some states to even enter the union. They had to have Blaine language in their state constitutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody kind of rolled their eyes and thought \u2018oh, that\u2019s harmless,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not harmless. When I worked in the White House in the faith-based office for President Bush, I saw how many faith-based providers of social services were being harassed by interpretations of the Blaine Amendments or their applications.\u201d\n\nThe applications of the Blaine Amendments have reached even further in recent years, said Towey. In some instances, it affected faith-based hiring and whether a Catholic organization could hire people that supported the Catholic faith rather than attacked it.\n\nWhile religious freedom issues have taken on added weight in light of the HHS Mandate, it is nothing new to Catholics in the United States, Towey told the Newman Society.\n\n\u201cThe bishops when they started the Fortnight of Freedom movement were reminding Catholics of our history,\u201d a history of fighting to protect religious freedom, he said.\n\nThe Blaine Amendments were born of religious bigotry and anti-Catholic discrimination and should be repealed out of the state constitutions, he continued.\n\nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nFor some, the anti-religious freedom sentiments were born out of ignorance. For others, it was the common agenda of the day. \u201cHistorically, when it happened,\u201d Towey said, \u201cyou had a political demagogue who was wanting to be president of the United States \u2014 does that ring a bell?\u201d\n\nCalled to Defend Religious Freedom\n\nIt is also important to remember that the Church has called on all people of good faith to protect religious freedom, Towey told the Newman Society.\n\nDignitatis Humanae, the Church\u2019s declaration on religious freedom issued by Blessed Pope Paul VI in December 1965, \u201cis a reminder of our need to protect our religious freedom or risk losing it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it is written for the universal Church, it has a very particular application in a country like ours that has a First Amendment and a guarantee of the free exercise of religion.\u201d\n\nThe document came out at a time of great concern for Catholic universities and religious freedom and paid special attention to education, said Towey.\n\nDignitatis Humanae states:\n\nThe family, since it is a society in its own original right, has the right freely to live its own domestic religious life under the guidance of parents. Parents, moreover, have the right to determine, in accordance with their own religious beliefs, the kind of religious education that their children are to receive. Government, in consequence, must acknowledge the right of parents to make a genuinely free choice of schools and of other means of education, and the use of this freedom of choice is not to be made a reason for imposing unjust burdens on parents, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this document is in its timeless appeal to all people of good faith to protect religious liberty and to oppose coercion and the indoctrination that the secular orthodoxy imposes on people of faith,\u201d Towey said. \u201cDignitatis Humanae came and spoke about the right of Catholics to be in the public square and the fact that without religious liberty a lot of the other rights that are secured under the Constitution are meaningless \u2014 what good is Freedom of Speech if you can\u2019t practice your faith?\u201d\n\nReprinted with permission from The Cardinal Newman Society.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "And it is astonishing to see how a history of religious bigotry and anti-Catholic discrimination can be so easily swept under the rug, especially in a culture so alert to claims of discrimination, said Towey.", "title": "Catholic education in 150-year battle for religious freedom", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/anti_catholic_ammendments.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/catholic-education-in-150-year-battle-for-religious-freedom", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "And it is astonishing to see how a history of religious bigotry and anti-Catholic discrimination can be so easily swept under the rug, especially in a culture so alert to claims of discrimination, said Towey."}, "description": "And it is astonishing to see how a history of religious bigotry and anti-Catholic discrimination can be so easily swept under the rug, especially in a culture so alert to claims of discrimination, said Towey.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "Dignitatis Humanae, the Church\u2019s declaration on religious freedom issued by Blessed Pope Paul VI in December 1965, \u201cis a reminder of our need to protect our religious freedom or risk losing it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe bishops when they started the Fortnight of Freedom movement were reminding Catholics of our history,\u201d a history of fighting to protect religious freedom, he said.\nIn some instances, it affected faith-based hiring and whether a Catholic organization could hire people that supported the Catholic faith rather than attacked it.\nThe laws continue to impinge upon school choice, block support for vouchers and tax credits, threaten religious freedom and prevent any funding that could eventually benefit Catholic schools, families and students.\nThe anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments \u2014 currently found in 37 state constitutions \u2014 became popular in the 19th century to prohibit Catholic, or \u201csectarian\u201d schools, from receiving government aid."}
