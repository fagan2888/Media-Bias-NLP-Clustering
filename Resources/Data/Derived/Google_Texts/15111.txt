The families of the 227 passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 rushed to file lawsuits in several countries against the airline ahead of a two-year deadline under an international treaty. The plane, which went missing on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, sent no distress signal, and the main wreckage and location of the aircraft havenâ€™t been found, nor have the black boxes or bodies of any victims. Lawyers representing the families have advised their clients to bring claims against the carrier under a 1999 treaty that says families are entitled to claim up to $160,000 from the carrier, regardless of whether the airline has been found to be at fault or not.
