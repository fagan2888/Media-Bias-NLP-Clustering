Or at least, not as bad as you might think.\n\n\u201cGrossology\u201d begins with Rachel\u2019s look at the first stool bank in the nation, launched by an MIT microbiologist. (Did you know that the great bacterial world inside your body is kind of like a rainforest?)\n\nIt also describes research into what we call the \u201cbacterial schmear\u201d \u2014 whether babies born by Cesarean sections might benefit from being wiped with some of the bacteria they would have picked up in their mothers\u2019 birth canals. And it will offer some solace to parents who feel guilty about \u201ccleaning\u201d their babies\u2019 pacifiers by popping the binkies into their own mouths. You know who you are.\n\nAnd in case you missed our recent episodes: \u201cScary Food Stories\u201d includes the tale of a recovering sugar addict and offers sobering news to kale devotees. And \u201cOn The Brain\u201d includes fascinating research on dyslexia, depression and how playing music may affect our minds.\n\nMake sure to tune in next time, when we present: \u201cHigh Anxiety,\u201d an episode on the (arguably) most prevalent of mental health disorders.\n\nEach week, The Checkup features a different topic \u2014 previous episodes focused on college mental health, sex problems, the Insanity workout and vaccine issues.
