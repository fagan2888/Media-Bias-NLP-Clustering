The economy added about 182,000 jobs a month, just enough to keep pace with population growth.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the end of 2006, 63.4 percent of American adults had jobs. By the end of 2009, this employment rate fell to 58.3 percent, and it has recovered only very slightly.\n\n2009: 58.3 percent\n\n2010: 58.3 percent\n\n2011: 58.5 percent\n\n2012: 58.6 percent\n\n2013: 58.6 percent\n\nThis stands in sharp contrast to the more familiar unemployment rate, which continues to fall rapidly. But the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t measure the share of American adults who don\u2019t have jobs. It only counts people who are seeking work. It has been falling primarily because a smaller share of people is seeking work.\n\nThat has some important policy implications. The decline in unemployment may limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability, or at least its willingness, to stimulate the economy. But the employment rate may offer a more accurate picture of the health of that economy and the picture, as you can see, is not very good.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140110095437, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 10, 2014", "keywords": "Labor and Jobs,Unemployment,United States Economy,The Jobs Report", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "GBLC": "The Jobs Report", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/The Employment Rate's New Normal ( 20140110 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "byl": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "twitter": {"description": "Since a big drop after the recession, the share of American with jobs has failed to rebound, and was no higher in 2013 than the previous year.", "title": "The Employment Rate's New Normal", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/the-employment-rates-new-normal/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@BCAppelbaum", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002642831, "description": "Since a big drop after the recession, the share of American with jobs has failed to rebound, and was no higher in 2013 than the previous year.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 10, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "The Jobs Report", "published_time": 1389365677, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-10T15:34:52-05:00"}, "utime": 20140110153452, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140110, "pdate": 20140110, "des": "Labor and Jobs;Unemployment;United States Economy", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Since a big drop after the recession, the share of American with jobs has failed to rebound, and was no higher in 2013 than the previous year.", "title": "The Employment Rate's New Normal", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/the-employment-rates-new-normal/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/the-employment-rates-new-normal/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Employment Rate's New Normal", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb73e\"", "article_summary": "By the end of 2009, this employment rate fell to 58.3 percent, and it has recovered only very slightly.\nBut the employment rate may offer a more accurate picture of the health of that economy and the picture, as you can see, is not very good.\n2009: 58.3 percent2010: 58.3 percent2011: 58.5 percent2012: 58.6 percent2013: 58.6 percentThis stands in sharp contrast to the more familiar unemployment rate, which continues to fall rapidly.\nBut the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t measure the share of American adults who don\u2019t have jobs.\nThe economy added about 182,000 jobs a month, just enough to keep pace with population growth."}
