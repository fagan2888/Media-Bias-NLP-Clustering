According to USA Today, a recent poll showed that 72 percent of Russians approve of the job Putin is doing, while in the United States only 41 percent of Americans approve of Barack Obama.\n\nBrietbart\u2019s John Nolte says the difference between Putin and Obama is stark.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s actions in Ukraine might have been criminal but they were also decisive and successful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, whether it is ObamaCare, Ukraine, the Middle East, or the economy, everything Obama touches turns to chaos.\u201d\n\nMany others have taken note of the low approval rating, including Congressional Democrats. Reports say the group is growing increasingly worried that Obama\u2019s continued unpopularity could hurt their re-election hopes in November.\n\n\u201cIt is the area where presidents worry and they worry about midterm elections and that their popularity will affect the party and ultimately hurt his majority in the Congress,\u201d said analyst John Fortier of the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nLow approval ratings for Obama will mean an emboldened Republican Party, Fortier added.\n\n\u201cI think either way we are facing divided government for the rest of President Obama\u2019s term and that means either a lot of conflict or an occasional issue where they can find some sort of compromise,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the fact that President Obama has an approval rating 30 points below Vladimir Putin, not all polls bring bad news. While Obama has hit record lows in many polls, a new Bloomberg National Poll shows his approval rating at 48 percent \u2014 up from 43 percent in December.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has seen his approval rating dip in the past two years as he pushed through a polarizing Obamacare program amid opposition, and now he has", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "President Obama has seen his approval rating dip in the past two years as he pushed through a polarizing Obamacare program amid opposition, and now he has", "title": "President Obama Approval Rating Is 30 Points Below Vladimir Putin", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1182747/president-obama-approval-rating-is-30-points-below-vladimir-putin/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Approval-Rating.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-22T17:35:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-22T17:35:14+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Approval-Rating.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-03-22T17:35:14+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obama approval rating,president obama approval rating,vladimir putin approval rating,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Obama-Approval-Rating.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama has seen his approval rating dip in the past two years as he pushed through a polarizing Obamacare program amid opposition, and now he has"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf28\"", "article_summary": "Despite the fact that President Obama has an approval rating 30 points below Vladimir Putin, not all polls bring bad news.\nPresident Obama has seen his approval rating dip in the past two years as he pushed through a polarizing Obamacare program amid opposition, and now he has reached a new low \u2014 a rating 30 points lower than Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nWhile Obama has hit record lows in many polls, a new Bloomberg National Poll shows his approval rating at 48 percent \u2014 up from 43 percent in December.\n\u201cOn the other hand, whether it is ObamaCare, Ukraine, the Middle East, or the economy, everything Obama touches turns to chaos.\u201dMany others have taken note of the low approval rating, including Congressional Democrats.\nBrietbart\u2019s John Nolte says the difference between Putin and Obama is stark."}
