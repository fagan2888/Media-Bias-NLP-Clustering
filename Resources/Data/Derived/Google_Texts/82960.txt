Rescuers helped four stranded climbers on the third Flaitron on Saturday night after one of the climber's ropes became stuck on the mountain, stranding him 30 feet in the air.

The stuck rope prevented 46-year-old Eric Westerkamp from descending any further, according to a Boulder County Sheriff's Office press release. This, in turn, left three other climbers -- 29-year-old Daniel Hood, 26-year-old Jarrett Grindlay and 44-year-old Rachel Hess -- stranded above him.

The climbers were stuck after dark with limited clothing and supplies.

Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, AMR Ambulance, Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks Rangers, Boulder Fire Department and the Boulder County Sheriff's Office were dispatched about 7:10 p.m. after receiving a report of climbers calling for help.

Rocky Mountain Rescue Group volunteers were able to locate the climbers and climbed to them before assisting them down the mountain.

None of the climbers was injured.
