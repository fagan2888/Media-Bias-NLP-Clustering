Alissa Jackson, 31, has been described by police as \u201cpure evil\u201d for manipulating the community into believing her dubious diagnosis.\n\nIn addition to the $35,000 that was raised on her behalf, A restaurant donated 20 percent of their day\u2019s profit to her cause, and friends and neighbors routinely dropped food off at her home three times a week. One person donated a minivan to her and another person even paid for a romantic getaway for her and her husband Brandon.\n\n\"The fact that this individual preyed on the good nature of our community and the people of our community for her own personal gain is absolutely disgusting in my opinion and pure evil,\" Belleville Police Sgt. Mark Heffernan told KSDK.com.\n\nJackson started off her scam by creating a Facebook page and organizing a fundraiser in her name called \u201cAlissa\u2019s Army Benefit.\u201d The page explains how, after nine years working as a nurse, she had to stop because of her stage four ovarian cancer diagnosis, which was \u201cvery aggressive and has now spread to her brain, lymph nodes, spine, lungs and liver.\u201d The page also explains how she is on her third round of chemotherapy with non-operable tumors.\n\nJackson was finally caught once she called her friends late one night to say goodbye because she was being rushed to the hospital. They rushed to the hospital too, only to find that Jackson had never been there before. Dana McQuade, who had helped Jackson purchase household cleaning supplies contacted the police, who then carried out a month-long investigation.\n\n\"She chased after a dog and one of the women thought, \"Wait a minute, this isn't right. She's doing something that someone with stage four ovarian cancer wouldn't be doing\"' McQuade said.\n\nWhen McQuade confronted Jackson, she broke down and told her the truth\u2014that there had never been a cancer diagnosis to begin with.\n\n\"She was bawling on the phone,\u201d McQuade said. \u201cShe was saying 'I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I don't want to go to jail. My husband is going to leave me'.\"\n\nJackson is a wife and mother to five children between the ages of five to 18 years old. She brought her game of pretend so far that she even claimed she was too sick to attend her oldest child\u2019s high school graduation. Almost 20,000 women are diagnosed of ovarian cancer every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An estimated 90 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are 40 years or older, with the greatest number of cases occurring in women 60 years or older.\n\n\"Her kids believed her story, which is the unfortunate and tragic part of this case. Her kids are victims of this in my mind,\" Heffernan said.\n\nJackson outraged many people in the community. She was a member of a softball team, \u201cChris\u2019 Angels\u201d to raise money for women with ovarian cancer. Chris Allsup, who actually had ovarian cancer, died in January and her twin sister Pat continued to raise money for Jackson.\n\n\u201cLook at me. Tell me why, Alissa. Why did you do this to me and your kids?\u201d Amanda Tabor asked in the courthouse hall after Jackson\u2019s court appearance. Tabor helped raise $10,000 through a fundraiser.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick to my stomach,\u201d Tabor said. \u201cI\u2019m mad. Basically I\u2019m angry, I\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m disgusted. I don\u2019t see how somebody could do this.\u201d\n\nJackson has been charged with two felony theft counts and her bond is set at $100,000.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mother, fakes, ovarian, cancer, diagnosis, and, steals, thousands, donations", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mother of five has been charged with faking her ovarian cancer diagnosis and raising thousands for her own benefit.", "title": "Mother Who Faked Cancer Diagnosis Raised $35,000 In Donations", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-fakes-ovarian-cancer-diagnosis-and-steals-thousands-donations-286710", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/mother-five-fakes-fatal-cancer-diagnosis-money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mother of five has been charged with faking her ovarian cancer diagnosis and raising thousands for her own benefit.", "title": "Mother Who Faked Cancer Diagnosis Raised $35,000 In Donations", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mother-fakes-ovarian-cancer-diagnosis-and-steals-thousands-donations-286710", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/mother-five-fakes-fatal-cancer-diagnosis-money.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/mother-five-fakes-fatal-cancer-diagnosis-money.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-05T17:08:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T17:08:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mother of five has been charged with faking her ovarian cancer diagnosis and raising thousands for her own benefit."}, "article_summary": "Almost 20,000 women are diagnosed of ovarian cancer every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nShe was a member of a softball team, \u201cChris\u2019 Angels\u201d to raise money for women with ovarian cancer.\nShe's doing something that someone with stage four ovarian cancer wouldn't be doing\"' McQuade said.\nChris Allsup, who actually had ovarian cancer, died in January and her twin sister Pat continued to raise money for Jackson.\nBasically I\u2019m angry, I\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m disgusted."}
