This is not the case.\n\nStep therapy is an established benefit management tool that is used by commercial carriers, self-insured employers, Medicare Advantage/Part D programs, and Medicaid programs in the other 49 states. For some years, step therapy and prior authorization have been the prescription policy of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Kansas and other insurance providers in covering state employees, retirees and non-state employer programs. Qualified medical plans under the Affordable Care Act also contain step therapy and prior authorization provisions.\n\nAs would be the case in KanCare, insurance plans grandfather drugs that are being used successfully by members. Therefore parents of children on an effective drug regimen for any condition need not worry since those drugs are not subject to step therapy.\n\nStep therapy is an approach to prescriptions that is intended to control the risks that are posed by prescription drugs as well as their cost. Step therapy begins with a medication that has proven to work well for the majority of people. If the first drug does not work well, doctors can prescribe a different drug. No one is denied effective medicine. This ensures the use of clinically effective drugs prior to the use of riskier or more costly options for the same medical condition.\n\nKanCare members currently using an effective drug or drug regimen would not be required to change their prescriptions. If there is a clinical reason why the first medication in step therapy would not be appropriate, doctors can prescribe alternative medications. Kansas is moving toward its step therapy policy carefully to ensure that KanCare members get the safest and most effective drugs available.\n\nSusan Mosier, M.D., is Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and the Environment.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Opinion, Columns", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Your April 24 editorial leaves readers with the erroneous impression that Kansas is singling out Medicaid recipients to put restrictions on the way their doctors can prescribe medications.
