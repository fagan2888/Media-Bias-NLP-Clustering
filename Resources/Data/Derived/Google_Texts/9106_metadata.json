Today, more than 91 percent of the state\u2019s population has coverage \u2014 the highest rate in decades, according to state officials.\n\nBut coverage alone isn\u2019t a measure of success. Equally important is whether people can afford their insurance and medical bills and whether they can get access to care that makes them healthier. That includes freebies the ACA mandates, including annual checkups, preventive screenings and birth control.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken a tour of the health-care landscape, talking to patients, doctors and those trying to implement the overhaul of America\u2019s health system, with the aim of better understanding what the new rules have and have not accomplished so far.\n\nThe toe index\n\nA digital accounting of better access to care\n\nFor Sallie Neillie, saved toes are a good indication of care in a post-ACA world.\n\nObamacare\u2019s impact in Washington state\n\nNeillie is the executive director of Project Access Northwest, a Seattle organization that helps uninsured and Medicaid patients see medical specialists. In recent months, her staff has noticed a decline in the number of people calling with untreated diabetes so severe that their circulation-damaged toes require amputation.\n\nPatients have more access to primary care and they\u2019re able to manage their chronic conditions, Neillie said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as sick when they get to us.\u201d\n\nThe system \u201cis working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s not there yet, but we\u2019re starting to see some improvement.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion has been the largest cause of the decline in uninsured residents in Washington. Since 2014, when the no-fee health-care program expanded its definition of who could participate, the state\u2019s Medicaid program has grown more than 40 percent, to close to 2 million enrollees.\n\nAnd for residents earning too much to join Medicaid, there is the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder. An ACA creation, the exchange provides discounted monthly premiums to those with lower incomes.\n\nThis year 170,000 people bought insurance from the exchange, and an equal number purchased individual coverage outside of it.\n\nThanks to the exchange, as well as Washington\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid, the ACA has \u201cachieved its goals of providing access to health insurance,\u201d said Richard Onizuka, chief executive of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which oversees Healthplanfinder.\n\nHe admits affordability is still a challenge. Polls show some 46 percent of Americans with individual plans found it difficult to pay their monthly premiums, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s subsidies \u201cmake insurance much more affordable,\u201d Onizuka said, \u201cbut people still have to pay for it and we\u2019re still trying to help people understand that premiums are only one piece of what you pay for health care.\u201d\n\nPromise of \u201cfree\u201d perks\n\nFree benefits have a cost and aren\u2019t always accessible\n\nFor Fraser Ratzlaff, of Seattle, the ACA actually drove up his health-care costs. Ratzlaff, 33, works at a Christian nonprofit that provides for orphaned and destitute children abroad. He had a catastrophic insurance plan pre-ACA, expecting to use it only in the case of serious illness. It cost him $100 a month.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking forward to switching over to Obamacare,\u201d Ratzlaff said. But his insurance company canceled his \u201cbare-bones\u201d plan, so last year he moved to one that included all the free services the ACA required. His premium doubled and he was paying for benefits he didn\u2019t want.\n\nSo after a few months, Ratzlaff jumped to a cheaper plan with a Christian organization. Then in January, his employer began providing coverage so he moved to its $35-a-month plan.\n\nExcept for the dental insurance, \u201cI still don\u2019t use it,\u201d Ratzlaff said of his coverage.\n\nFor other Americans, the free benefits covered by insurance companies are an essential perk, yet some people are finding it hard to access them.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice Washington and Northwest Health Law Advocates teamed up to make sure women were getting accurate information about free contraceptives. Using \u201csecret shoppers,\u201d they found that wasn\u2019t always the case, that insurance-company representatives routinely provided misinformation on contraceptive benefits.\n\nThe groups also made an online call for stories from women who were denied free contraceptives. \u201cWe got a huge response,\u201d said Rachel Berkson, executive director for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington.\n\nThe state Office of the Insurance Commissioner has logged numerous complaints over companies failing to deliver on this and other free benefits, including colonoscopy tests to check for colorectal cancers.\n\nThe problem is so significant that the Obama administration recently issued additional information that strengthens and helps clarify the coverage of both benefits. In Washington, the insurance companies have agreed to improve communications on birth control.\n\nTreating the newly insured\n\nCoverage means easing discomfort and addressing the basics\n\nBeyond free services, the ACA has brought insurance to Americans who had gone long stretches without coverage.\n\nA recent national survey found that nearly 60 percent of people signing up for insurance through the exchanges or Medicaid were previously uninsured, according to the Commonwealth Fund. More than half the enrollees had gone more than two years without insurance.\n\nSo what sorts of health care do people forgo when uninsured? Knee-replacement surgery, according to a study from the Society of Actuaries, followed by surgeries for lower back pain and upper endoscopy, to address intestinal troubles.\n\nThey\u2019re problems that are unpleasant, but \u201cnot acute enough to interfere with their life,\u201d said Rebecca Owen, a health-research actuary and co-author of the report.\n\nThe study is small and based on insurance claims from patients in Kansas, but it still provides an idea about American\u2019s unmet needs, Owen said. \u201cThis is the way the wind might be blowing,\u201d she said.\n\nTo Dr. Kimberly Painter, Group Health Cooperative\u2019s assistant physician in chief for continuum of care for Seattle, the bigger picture is a little different.\n\n\u201cWhen I see patients, the vast majority of the time it isn\u2019t those expensive specialized needs that they\u2019re coming in for,\u201d Painter said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for basic stuff that people who are insured take for granted.\u201d\n\nThat includes managing diabetes and high blood pressure, and Pap smears and mammograms for women. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that they haven\u2019t been respected as people to have those basic needs met,\u201d she said.\n\nTo fulfill the increasing demand for primary care, Group Health, for one, has changed scheduling practices, lengthening clinic hours, adding a patient to a doctor\u2019s day, and saving appointments for physicals. They\u2019re using alternate paths to deliver care, including walk-in clinics in some Bartell Drugs locations and providing an online tool for diagnosing and treating illnesses.\n\nSo far, access seems to be keeping pace despite the new demand. The Commonwealth Fund survey showed the majority of Americans with coverage from an exchange or Medicaid could find a new primary-care doctor and get an appointment within two weeks.\n\nNavigating coverage\n\nThe system can shunt people among a dizzying range of options\n\nMultiple job changes and a return to school launched Heather Fisher on a health-insurance saga worthy of Odysseus.\n\nFor five years, the 37-year-old Seattleite worked in child care at a unionized business with employer-provided health insurance.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed the job,\u201d Fisher said, \u201cbut the benefits that we got were a big reason for people staying.\u201d\n\nFisher didn\u2019t want to work in child care forever, so she quit in 2012 to take prerequisites for a master\u2019s program in marriage and family therapy at Seattle Pacific University.\n\nShe became a nanny, but the wages were low and she had to drop her insurance. That meant no treatment for her fibromyalgia, a condition that can cause widespread pain and joint stiffness. She left her naturopath and stopped her monthly medication when its cost spiked. When care was urgent, she turned to family.\n\n\u201cI had to borrow money from my dad, which is super awesome when you\u2019re in your 30s,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nShe found relief when the state introduced Healthplanfinder in fall 2013. Like three-quarters of people using the exchange, Fisher qualified for federal tax credits to help pay her premiums. She purchased a $500-a-month plan that cost her $130.\n\nFisher left her exchange plan in September when she quit work, started her master\u2019s program and shifted to Medicaid. She\u2019s taking a full course load, working an unpaid internship, and expects to graduate next June.\n\nShe\u2019s found doctors who will accept Medicaid and is pleased with the care. She no longer feels trapped in a job because it offers benefits. Because of ACA provisions that forbid insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, Fisher doesn\u2019t worry about getting insured despite her fibromyalgia. For her, at least, Obamacare works.\n\n\u201cI feel much more in control of my own health because I\u2019m able to ask for appointments and make appointments and not worry what it\u2019s going to cost me to be healthy,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty freeing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It has been five years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, and new data and numerous real-life stories are beginning to reveal how close or how far the ACA has come toward meeting its objective in Washington state.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "It has been five years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, and new data and numerous real-life stories are beginning to reveal how close or how far the ACA has come toward meeting its objective in Washington state.", "title": "Obamacare in Washington state: Are the goals being met?", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/obamacare-improves-health-care-in-state-but-could-be-better/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0eefa922-1c56-11e5-aa61-1a056ac6f648-1560x2112.jpg", "height": 2112}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obamacare in Washington state: Are the goals being met?", "description": "It has been five years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, and new data and numerous real-life stories are beginning to reveal how close or how far the ACA has come toward meeting its objective in Washington state.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0eefa922-1c56-11e5-aa61-1a056ac6f648-780x1056.jpg", "site": "@seattletimes"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-07-04 20:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-05 12:43:44"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health"}, "article_summary": "And for residents earning too much to join Medicaid, there is the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder.\nAt its core, Obamacare has one main goal: delivering affordable health care to most Americans.\nFor five years, the 37-year-old Seattleite worked in child care at a unionized business with employer-provided health insurance.\nSo what sorts of health care do people forgo when uninsured?\nFor other Americans, the free benefits covered by insurance companies are an essential perk, yet some people are finding it hard to access them."}
