He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nSensing an opening, Christie pounced. \u201cThat\u2019s what Washington, D.C. does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Sanders Closes the Gap on Clinton \u2013 and Cleans Up Against the GOP\n\nWhen Rubio repeated the canned line moments later, prompting boos from the audience, Christie lunged again.\n\n\"There it is. The memorized, 25-second speech,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fallout carried into Sunday morning as newspapers blared headlines that Rubio, who recent polls show surging into second place behind billionaire Donald Trump, choked.\n\nRubio is \u201cso scripted, he's so gifted. He's a great speaker, but he came across as totally scripted and kind of robotic,\" former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said in an interview on Fox News Sunday.\n\nCorrect the Record, an organization run by Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, released a brutal clip showing the \u201cRubio-Bot\u201d malfunctioning.\n\nRubio furiously tried to spin notion that he was not off his game by arguing that he was addressing a general GOP audience.\n\n\u201cI would pay them to keep running that clip because that's what I believe passionately. It's one of the reasons why I'm not running for reelection to the Senate and I'm running for president,\" he said on ABC's This Week. \"Obamacare was not an accident. Dodd-Frank was not an accident. The deal with Iran was not an accident.\u201d\n\nRelated: Will Bernie Sander\u2019s Foreign Policy Stumbles Derail His Campaign?\n\nWith less than 72 hours before voters go to the polls, it\u2019s unclear how Rubio\u2019s poor performance will affect him in New Hampshire, where Christie, Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich are all clawing to stay alive. It\u2019s doubtful it will have as large an effect as when Trump decided to skip the last debate before the caucuses.\n\nHowever, Saturday\u2019s debate exposed Rubio as a candidate who may be too on message for his own good. If his rivals can portray him as someone who can\u2019t think on his feet, and relies on canned lines to combat rhetorical barbs, it would add to the perception that Rubio\u2019s unprepared to serve in the Oval Office.\n\nRubio\u2019s dare to keep replaying the video of him stuck on repeat may come back to haunt him. There are no debates scheduled between Tuesday\u2019s primary and the GOP primary in South Carolina on Feb. 20.\n\nObservers believe that Rubio must win that primary, and not find the silver lining in third and second places finishes, in order to cement the belief that he is the \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate to take on Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\nRelated: The Clinton Scandal That Still Matters Is Not the One You Think\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nIndeed, Cruz and Trump stand to gain the most in the short-term from Rubio\u2019s poor showing, which has largely overshadowed their performances.\n\nOn Sunday, Christie, who last week called Rubio the \u201cboy in the bubble,\u201d sensed he had reshuffled the race.\n\n\u201cI think the whole race changed last night,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cBecause you know there was a march among some of the chattering class to anoint Senator Rubio. I think after last night, that\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need someone who is tested and ready to go against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Christie added. \u201cShe is a skilled debater. She's an experienced Washington insider. And you better have somebody on there who can take her on. Senator Rubio proved last night he can't do that.\n\n\u201cSo now let's go to the next phase and I'm ready to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Marco Rubio\u2019s stumbles in Saturday night\u2019s GOP debate, and the resulting pile-on by his Republican presidential rivals, could mean long-term troubles for his campaign just as the primary season heats up.", "title": "How Rubio\u2019s Debate Stumble Could Derail Him as the \u2018Establishment Candidate\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/07/How-Rubio-s-Debate-Stumble-Could-Derail-Him-Establishment-Candidate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02072016_Marco_Rubio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/07/How-Rubio-s-Debate-Stumble-Could-Derail-Him-Establishment-Candidate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02072016_Marco_Rubio.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Marco Rubio\u2019s stumbles in Saturday night\u2019s GOP debate, and the resulting pile-on by his Republican presidential rivals, could mean long-term troubles for his campaign just as the primary season heats up.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1631\"", "article_summary": "However, Saturday\u2019s debate exposed Rubio as a candidate who may be too on message for his own good.\nI think after last night, that\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cWe need someone who is tested and ready to go against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Christie added.\nIt\u2019s doubtful it will have as large an effect as when Trump decided to skip the last debate before the caucuses.\nRubio\u2019s dare to keep replaying the video of him stuck on repeat may come back to haunt him.\nMarco Rubio\u2019s stumbles in Saturday night\u2019s GOP debate, and the resulting pile-on by his Republican presidential rivals, could mean long-term troubles for his campaign just as the primary season heats up."}
