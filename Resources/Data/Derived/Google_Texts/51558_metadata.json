Unemployment is particularly high among young women, in part because of the constraints placed on them by traditional societies in many parts of the region.\n\nAlghanim said that bringing more women into the workforce dramatically would spur economic growth.\n\nCiting figures by the International Monetary Fund, he said the gender gap in the Middle East is three times bigger than that in most developing economies. If the gap were narrowed by just one-third, the regional GDP would grow by $1 trillion a year, or 6 percent, said Alghanim, a former investment banker who now heads Alghanim Industries, one of the largest privately held companies in the Gulf.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a real economic cost here to the gender gap and finding women to get more engaged in the economy is crucial for us as a region, crucial for our competitiveness as a region,\u201d said Alghanim, who heads the Regional Business Council, a group with 30 member companies trying to help reduce youth unemployment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Interview: Leader says Mideast pays price for gender gap", "title": "AP Interview: Leader says Mideast pays price for gender gap", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Interview: Leader says Mideast pays price for gender gap", "title": "AP Interview: Leader says Mideast pays price for gender gap", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/ap_interview_leader_says_mideast_pays_price_for_gender_gap/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/mideast-jordan-world-economic-forum-solutions.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Interview: Leader says Mideast pays price for gender gap", "title": "AP Interview: Leader says Mideast pays price for gender gap", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/mideast-jordan-world-economic-forum-solutions.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karin Laub", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc126\"", "article_summary": "Unemployment is particularly high among young women, in part because of the constraints placed on them by traditional societies in many parts of the region.\nCiting figures by the International Monetary Fund, he said the gender gap in the Middle East is three times bigger than that in most developing economies.\nAlghanim said that bringing more women into the workforce dramatically would spur economic growth.\nDecision-makers long seemed paralyzed by the sheer size of the troubled region\u2019s economic problems, but attitudes have changed in recent years, said Omar Alghanim, co-chairman of this week\u2019s regional World Economic Forum conference and a leader of private sector efforts to tackle youth unemployment.\n\u201cAs compared to five years ago, I see a lot more attention \u2014 which is great.\u201dThe Middle East and North Africa have the world\u2019s highest rate of youth unemployment, with 29.5 percent, up two percentage point from over a decade ago, according to the International Labor Organization."}
