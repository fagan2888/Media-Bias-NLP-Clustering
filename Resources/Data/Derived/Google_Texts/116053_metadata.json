It\u2019s a perfect location from which to troll a Democratic president. The Chamber readily obliges. For much of the Obama presidency, four banners reading J-O-B-S have been draped across the Chamber\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, as if trying to send the world\u2019s least subliminal message, 24 hours a day.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nFor as long as the banners have been there\u2014longer, actually\u2014the Chamber and the president have actually agreed on something. The federal gas tax (18.4 cents for a gallon of regular, 24.4 cents for a gallon of diesel) has not increased since 1993, which is one reason why Congress keeps passing short-term extensions of the Highway Trust Fund, billions of dollars for ongoing construction projects.\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason why Congress scrambled to pass another extension before a September deadline. The scramble worked\u2014by a 367\u00ad\u201355 majority, a highway bill passed the House. But it didn\u2019t include a gas tax. In 2008, candidate Obama chided both Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton for floating the idea of a gas tax holiday. His Republican secretary of transportation, Ray LaHood, campaigned for a gas tax hike. Every year of Obama\u2019s presidency, Chamber President Tom Donohue has called for a slight increase in the tax.\n\nCongress opted for an epic punt, based on a gimmick that has nothing to do with gas taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThe American business community is saying we don\u2019t see this as a tax,\u201d explained Donohue in 2009. \u201cThis is a user fee.\u201d He\u2019s repeated that and repeated that, making national news each time. \u201cShippers are for it,\u201d he said of the tax hike in May. \u201cTruckers are for it. The construction industry is for it. Labor is for it, and the Chamber is for it. If Congress were serious about ensuring money goes to the most essential projects, many motorists would be for it, too.\u201d\n\nCongress opted instead for an epic punt, based on a gimmick that has nothing to do with gas taxes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is offering to let companies set aside less money for pensions so that they\u2019ll theoretically report more taxable income, theoretically delaying the highway fund apocalypse until May 2015. As Josh Barro pointed out, the gimmick actually costs money in the long run, but it syncs up with Congress\u2019s 10-year budgeting. On Tuesday, as Republicans marked up the bill, they only tried to defend it by saying that it was bipartisan, and hey\u2014they could make the tough call later.\n\n\u201cThis is the only package with a history of big bipartisan votes,\u201d said Rep. Pete Sessions, the Rules Committee\u2019s chairman.\n\n\u201cThese policies that have previously received bipartisan and bicameral support,\u201d said Pennsylvania Rep. Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, and the son of former chairman Bud Shuster, as Sessions kept pointing out by referring to his \u201cyoung\u201d colleague. (Shuster is 53 years old.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cBipartisan,\u201d in this Congress, has been a soothing synonym for \u201ckludge.\u201d Democrats and the Chamber simply want a gas tax, as do at least two Senate Republicans who aren\u2019t facing primary challenges this year.\n\nAt the markup, the might of this coalition was represented by Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents the city of Portland, dons bow ties, and wears a lapel pin shaped like a bike. He had proposed raising the gas tax from 18.4 cents per gallon to 33.4 cents, but that bill wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, so he was left arguing to move the deadline for new action from May 2015 to sometime this year.\n\n\u201cThink about it!\u201d said Blumenauer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an evenly, narrowly divided Senate, and half the Senate will be running for president. To think, in the other body, that they\u2019re going to be able in a couple of months to solve the funding problem? This is not going to get easier next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may or may not be easier to achieve it now or later,\u201d said Sessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe meaning of that gibberish may depend on what \u201ceasier\u201d is supposed to mean. Conservative groups have belatedly entered the debate on the funding package. The Club for Growth and Heritage Action have, predictably, warned Republicans to vote no or have it scored against them.\n\n\u201cThis bill uses budget gimmicks and fee increases to bail out a wasteful and inefficient program that shouldn't even exist,\u201d argued the Club for Growth.\n\n\u201cIn many ways this resembles the sequester,\u201d offered Heritage Action President Michael Needham, \u201cwith the Democrats overplaying their rhetorical hand as 93 percent of total highway and transit spending will continue apace.\u201d\n\nRepublican leadership is openly\u2014well, anonymously\u2014mocking the outside groups. As far as House Speaker John Boehner is concerned, these conservative groups lost their clout after the government shutdown. But among conservatives, the end of the shutdown (i.e., the funding of the Affordable Care Act) was proof that the party establishment has no vision or credibility. In 2013, it was Georgia Rep. Tom Graves who first proposed tying the year\u2019s mandatory spending bill to the defunding of Obamacare. In 2014, it\u2019s Graves who\u2019s come up with the conservative antidote to the highway bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGraves\u2019s bill is HR 3486, the Transportation Empowerment Act. Yes\u2014it\u2019s called the TEA Act. Backed by the Club for Growth and by Heritage Action, and sponsored by 46 of his peers, Graves\u2019 bill would devolve \u201cmost\u201d highway funding responsibilities to the states, ideally enough to cut the gas tax down to 3.4 cents. With Congress flailing and punting, conservatives think they can shift the window of acceptable debate. Come 2015, the mainstream would drift even further from the Chamber/Democratic position.\n\n\u201cEach \u2018no\u2019 vote,\u201d wrote Heritage\u2019s Needham, \u201cbrings those reforms closer to reality because it signals the inevitable end of the bankrupt status quo.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the irony of the whole mess\u2014nobody\u2019s campaigning for \u201cthe status quo.\u201d The Chamber and the White House are asking for the first gas tax hike since 1993. Their impediment is a Congress that prefers to move money around on spreadsheets than to pass any tax. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing the Democrats, who\u2019ll be counted on to back the House\u2019s kludge, could only scoff at how stupid the process had become.\n\n\u201cThis is just a suggestion,\u201d said Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democratic member of the Rules Committee, \u201cbut if you guys are still in the majority after the election\u2014I pray that you\u2019re not, but in case you are\u2014you may want to revisit this issue of earmarking.\u201d\n\nNew York Rep. Louise Slaughter, who ran the committee during Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership, simply ran out of words.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "How the boring Highway Trust Fund became the newest stage for GOP antics.", "fb-share": "How the Boring Highway Trust Fund Became the Newest Stage for GOP Antics", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "The Chamber of Commerce is headquartered in a stately 89-year-old building that faces the White House across LaFayette Square.
