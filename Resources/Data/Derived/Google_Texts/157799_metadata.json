And by the time the period ended three months later, on January 31, more than 1.3 million Texans had enrolled in an Obamacare plan, about 100,000 more than the previous period. According to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, about one of every three signups was a new registrant. The others were renewals.\n\nBut with every passing enrollment period, every new sign up, every renewal, the men and women who are paid to, or volunteer to, help reach the uninsured are becoming more attune to the shifting needs of the population that still lacks coverage. The demand is still high. Last year, Texas\u2019s uninsured rate sank below 20 percent for the first time in more than a decade (18.5 percent), yet still remained the nation\u2019s highest. And so understanding how to get through to these 5 million or so who still lack coverage is realizing that what kept residents away in 2014 may not be the same as what runs them off in 2017.\n\nCase in point: Recent studies show that cost is gradually trumping awareness as one of the largest obstacles. Nearly three-quarters of Texas\u2019 uninsured say that the cost of insurance is too prohibitive for them to purchase, while less than one-tenth say they don\u2019t know how to get coverage. Those findings come from another survey by the Episcopal Health Foundation and Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute, which queried uninsured Texans ages 18 to 64 about their lack of coverage just before the most recent enrollment period began.\n\nOf all, 69.1 percent said the cost of health insurance is too high for them to purchase.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways to look at it,\u201d says Elena Marks, the president and CEO of the Houston-based Episcopal Health Foundation. \u201cOne thing to consider, when you look at the cost issue, is that people who previously were not insured, or were insured through employers, paying anything seems like a big step up to them.\u201d\n\nIn the past, awareness and know-how were the primary obstacles in getting residents to sign up. It didn\u2019t help that Healthcare.gov launched without being fully functional, either. But now, that survey suggests that knowledge of the law is no longer much of a hurdle: Just 6.3 percent of respondents said they didn\u2019t register for insurance because they were unaware of how to find information on what\u2019s available to them.\n\nPrice is becoming the topic du jour, from the proponents and the researchers right on down to the buyers. It\u2019s what HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell beat her drum about during a visit to Dallas: \u201cWe know that eight of 10 folks that were enrolled last year can come back into the marketplace and, with the financial assistance, they can find premiums that are $100 or less,\u201d she announced from Parkland Hospital.\n\nBut it\u2019s not so cut and dry. Marks says the word \u201ccost\u201d has shifting meanings for each respondent. What is affordable for one person is not for another. And that is the landscape that folks Mimi Garcia and her team must traverse. Garcia is the lead for Enroll America\u2019s Texas chapter, a nonprofit that helps connect insurance purchasers with navigators who can help them find a plan that\u2019s best for them.\n\nThey partner with churches and local businesses to reach targeted groups of residents who are likely to be uninsured. And Garcia says, yes, cost is a significant hurdle. However, anyone who makes between 139 percent ($16,242 a year for an individual and $32,252 for a family of four) and 400 percent of the poverty line qualifies for some sort of assistance. When she talks about overcoming the price barrier, Garcia says that the subsidies help assuage much of the concern.\n\n\u201cOnce people look at their subsidies and understand what\u2019s available to them, their feeling about cost really changes,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cSo on the one hand, it sort of reiterates the understanding that we have of cost as a barrier, yes, but understand that financial assistance is available.\u201d\n\nThe survey, meanwhile, points out that as income increases, the assistance decreases. For Americans on a limited budget, devoting a greater chunk of their salary to healthcare that previously went to food or rent or utilities can be prohibitive. According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, non-Medicaid eligible households spent an average of 6 percent on healthcare related expenses in 2014. Families in which all members are insured through private plans spend an average of 8 percent on those same costs.\n\n\u201cOne can use an online calculator to estimate the cost of a health insurance plan for a 30 year old single male living in Houston earning $23,540 (200% of the FPL) in 2016. After federal subsidies, this person can purchase a silver plan for $126 per month and bronze plan for $82. In contrast, a 30 year old single male earning $16,243 (138% of the FPL) can purchase a silver plan for $45 per month and a bronze plan for only $1 per month. As income increases, the federal subsidies for purchasing insurance become less generous, which poses a significant financial challenge to lower middle income persons on a limited budget.\u201d\n\nAnd about the awareness\u2014Garcia says, yeah, sure, most folks know about the Affordable Care Act and know about healthcare.gov. The problem is the health insurance literacy. Enroll America\u2019s army of staffers and volunteers frequently must inform residents about what deductibles and co-pays are, and what it will mean to have, say, a high deductible health plan. The true costs of the plans are still rather opaque, and many of the buyers need help walking them through it.\n\n\u201cWhile we might have a more informed community, I think that we are a ways from everybody being able to navigate this on their own,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve been through a situation where you have encountered a major medical event or an accident, you might not have a great understanding of what the actual costs there are.\u201d\n\nAnd things are surely only going to get more complicated. This enrollment period was the first where there were no preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans. All purchasers were shifted to health maintenance organization plans, or HMOs. It was the result of what insurance companies called unsustainable losses. In HMOs, the plan holder needs a referral by a primary care physician to a specific specialist set forth by the insurance company. Providers outside that are out of network, and the fees will come from the patient\u2019s pocket. And there are still about 1 million Texans that make at or less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line. These folks would qualify for subsidies if the state would agree to expand the Medicaid program under the reform law, or find an alternative that the administration would agree to. Texas is one of the 19 states that have not done so.\n\nBut the findings, largely, came to this: \u201cThere are people for whom there are subsidies available that are not purchasing insurance and it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t have information,\u201d Marks said. \u201cIt\u2019s either they don\u2019t want it or they say it\u2019s unaffordable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "When the Affordable Care Act\u2019s third open enrollment period began in November, the healthcare reform news cycle had zeroed in on record-setting losses among the major insurers, narrowing networks, and increasing premiums.
