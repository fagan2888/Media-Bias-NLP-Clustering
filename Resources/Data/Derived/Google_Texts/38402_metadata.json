He was first elected in 2012.\n\nThough Ring is not originally from South Dakota, he has a long history in Vermillion as an Economics professor.\n\n\u201cI taught at USD for 33 years,\u201d Ring said. \u201cI retired three and a half years ago.\u201d\n\nRing also said his wife taught at USD as well in the Special Education program.\n\nThroughout Ring\u2019s schooling and professional career, he has stayed in the Midwest.\n\n\u201cMy undergraduate was from St. Benedict College which is now Benedictine College in Kansas,\u201d he said. \u201cI got my PhD from the University of Kansas. I worked briefly for the state of Illinois and also for the US Congress before I moved back here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ring, the University of South Dakota gave him reason to stay.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I came here was to work with the legislature and I got really involved with things at the University,\u201d he said. \u201cI was involved in the honors program for awhile and just got involved more and more in research and teaching here.\u201d\n\nAfter retiring from teaching, Ring said he wanted to get more involved in politics.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t too crazy about some of the things they\u2019re doing in Pierre and so I decided I\u2019d run for election and succeeded,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably worked harder for this [election] but I think I knew better what to do and had a better campaign and did better relative to the other candidates.\u201d\n\nIf there are three words that describe a typical workday in the South Dakota legislature, they are meetings, meetings and more meetings.\n\n\u201cWell we start out with some kind of committee hearings depending on what committees we\u2019re on and I think it\u2019s confirmed that i\u2019m going to be on the appropriations committee,\u201d Ring said. \u201cWe have caucus meetings. The Democrats meet separately in order to talk about the bills that are coming up and strategy. At 2:00 we go into the actual session and those usually last a couple of hours. The appropriations committee sometimes meets after the regular session as well to hear proposals for the budget.\u201d\n\nRing said he looks forward to changing things for the better as much as he is able.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to get people interested in changing the way we do the revenue forecasts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve not been very accurate the past few years. There are a lot of states that use independent forecasters. In South Dakota the only forecast we get is from the governor\u2019s budget and from the legislative research council staff. When I came here there were three revenue estimates every year one from the LRC one from the budget office and one from the business research bureau. We don\u2019t get that anymore. I\u2019d like to get even more independent estimates so if I get around to it I\u2019m going to try to propose something like that.\u201d\n\nAlso on his agenda is more funds for education, fitting since Ring recently served on the Education committee in the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still pushing hard for increases in education spending,\u201d Ring said. \u201cWe have to do something about teacher salaries.\u201d\n\nRing also said he is in favor of expanding programs like Medicaid even though he hasn\u2019t felt the governor\u2019s support on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is entitled to some access to healthcare and under the current way that we do things for some people, low income people their only access to healthcare is the emergency room,\u201d Ring said. \u201cThat is very inefficient because the emergency room is the most expensive way to provide health care. It also means people put off getting health care until they can\u2019t put it off anymore.\u201d\n\nThe consequences of this type of behavior can have dire consequences according to Ring.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some studies come out that say that if people have access to health insurance it will reduce the death rate,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople that don\u2019t have insurance get sicker and die sooner. So that\u2019s a pro-life issue just like a lot of other issues.\u201d\n\nExpanding Medicaid is an action that Ring believes makes sense in a moral and practical way.\n\n\u201cUnder the affordable care act we can [make healthcare more available] at very minimal expense to the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never more than the state covering 10% of the cost for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nAs Ring begins a new term he fully accepts the challenges that await such a position.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be on the appropriations committee [the challenge will be] just sorting out all the different needs and there\u2019s always greater need than we have resources and making those decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat and we\u2019re in even smaller number in the house than we were last term. Convincing people that we have the right decision will be very difficult.\u201d\n\nOne thing that will make his job easier, Ring said, is for the members of the community to be in open communication with those whom they have elected.\n\n\u201cThere are times where it would help if people would email their legislators especially, from my perspective, the ones on the other side of the aisle and letting them know what they would like to see the state do,\u201d he said. \u201cI know for me it\u2019s made a difference to hear from people when certain issues come up.\u201d\n\nTo contact the state legislature, visit http://legis.sd.gov/.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Vermillion Plain Talk", "description": "In the recent elections, Ray Ring won a second term in the South Dakota House of Representative representing District 17.
