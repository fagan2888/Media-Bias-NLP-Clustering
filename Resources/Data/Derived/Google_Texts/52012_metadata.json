Lincoln Labs, founded in 2013 by veterans of Jeb Bush\u2019s and Mitt Romney\u2019s tech teams, asked conservatives to compete in a developer\u2019s arms race that progressives thought they\u2019d won already. And here was Cruz, sitting across from the lobbyist for car-share company Lyft, comparing his Senate crusades to the battles of developers.\n\n\u201cAs Lyft knows, I\u2019m sure the taxi commissions don\u2019t welcome them with open arms,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nThe good news was that Washington could not do too much harm if its debate about the Internet was polarized and silly.\n\n\u201cThat would be correct,\u201d said the lobbyist, Chris Massey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the beast,\u201d said Cruz, launching into a story about how he and American citizens killed gun safety legislation in 2013. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that this was unstoppable.\u201d\n\nQuickTake: Net Neutrality\n\nAs Cruz went on, crafting a story of angry voters jamming Senate phones, the cavernous ballroom of the Chamber of Commerce\u2013which resembles the dining hall at Hogwarts far more than it resembles a conference room\u2013stayed quiet. The panel that had just ended, a discussion on \u201chacking the beltway,\u201d had dealt with how ridiculous it was that \u201cmelting down phone lines\u201d was still a barometer of success.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz speaks at the Iowa Freedom Summit, 1/24/2015 Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg\n\nThe modern Democratic Party, which owes plenty to the tech-driven campaigns of Howard Dean and Barack Obama, has little internal disagreement about tech policy. It\u2019s welcomed the news that Obama\u2019s FCC will issue rules to classify the Internet as a public utility, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Those rules will effectively mandate net neutrality, preventing Internet providers from charging divergent prices for different \u201clanes\u201d to content. Obama\u2019s supported the idea since at least 2006, while still a senator from Illinois.\n\nOf course, the surest way to rally Republican opposition to any idea is for Barack Obama or his administration to support it. The news of the looming FCC ruling brought Republicans into the fight with sharpened swords \u2013 a fight that formerly cut across party lines. Cruz, in particular, had rallied conservatives against \u201cnet neutrality\u201d with a succinct kill-phrase: \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d In speeches, he took to pointing to a rotary phone \u2013 \u201cthis is regulated by Title II\u201d \u2013 and holding up an iPhone \u2013 \u201cthis is not!\u201d\n\nSome conservatives worried that Cruz had toxified the debate. After Cruz\u2019s Lincoln Labs speech, TechFreedom president Berin Szoka bemoaned the \u201cObamacare for the Internet\u201d phrase.\n\n\u201cNet neutrality and copyright have been the issues that grew this new Tea Party of the left,\u201d Szoka said. What he clearly should have said is that Title II is Obamacare for the Internet. What Republicans really need to say here is that this debate is not really about net neutrality anymore. This is now about imposing 1934 regulations on the Internet.\u201d\n\nSen.

Other Republicans preferred to call net neutrality an \u201cInternet power grab.\u201d Some had taken on FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler as an unaccountable, czar-like figure. Meanwhile, freshly-gaveled House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, had launched an investigation to see \u201cviews expressed by the White House potentially had an improper influence\u201d on the FCC.\n\nThose approaches perplexed some technologists at the Lincoln Labs forum, the fuller title of which was #Reboot Congress: Get Sh#t Done. Between speeches, and over cups of coffee from a constantly-refilled carafe, they did not sound as ready for war against net neutrality. Derek Khanna, a consultant and former Hill staffer who\u2019d become a thought leader for conservatives and tech policy, pointed out that the Supreme Court long ago allowed the president to make statements in favor of any agency\u2019s decisions. Garrett Johnson, the co-founder of Lincoln Labs, diplomatically urged Republicans to accept reality and pass a new communications bill.\n\n\u201cLincoln Labs\u2019s position is that we want people to be informed,\u201d he said. \u201cMy personal position is that there needs to be a legislative solution, because in the absence of that, the rule\u2019s going to come down on January 26. There\u2019s going to be uncertainty, because AT&T and the telecoms have lawyered up and Congress has failed to act.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the escape pod some Republicans (though not Cruz) have settled on. In his speech to the conference, South Dakota Senator John Thune let forth with the standard condemnations of the White House, then restated the need for Congress to pass \u201cclear and responsible rules\u201d for the Internet. It sounded like resistance. It actually meant admitting that the White House had outmaneuvered conservatives, and that Republicans would meet them halfway, even if their legislation would restrict the rules the FCC could make.\n\n\u201cThey moved over to us aggressively,\u201d said Marvin Ammori, a scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet & Society who was speaking on a Lincoln Labs panel. \u201cThe Thune talking points from last year were: Solution in search of a problem, we don\u2019t need anything. Now it\u2019s: We need to get this right in Congress. I think they lack credibility because they\u2019ve been against net neutrality, then they scrambled after a public outcry.\u201d\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul, who\u2019d eschewed the \u201cObamacare for the Internet language,\u201d used his time at Lincoln Labs to just warn that the government couldn\u2019t be trusted to manage complex things. In an interview with TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, asked if internet service providers\u2013the opponents of net neutrality\u2013had \u201clocal monopolies\u201d that needed to be broken up.\n\n\u201cThe way to fix this, and to correct this, is to open up competitions in those monopolies,\u201d said Paul, \u201cinstead of regulating these businesses as utilities, which will completely stifle innovation.\u201d\n\nPaul went on, describing the competition for ISP service that could grow and thrive if the government backed off. He ended, and applause echoed around the opulent room. Arrington had gotten the answers he wanted from Paul, but wasn\u2019t blown away by the senator\u2019s knowledge of net neutrality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty one-inch deep,\u201d said Arrington on his way out of the Chamber. The good news was that Washington could not do too much harm if its debate about the Internet was polarized and silly. \u201cThe general population doesn\u2019t give two fucks about that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "In order to attack Obama's plans for the Internet, Republicans first have to decide what to call it.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "In order to attack Obama's plans for the Internet, Republicans first have to decide what to call it.", "title": "Is Net Neutrality Obamacare for the Internet?
