The space can be configured to accommodate as many as 4,500 people which makes uses such as gala events and performances possible.\n\nDIA spokeswoman Stacey Stegman said the space will be programmed by Denver Arts & Venues.\n\n\u201cWe envision many uses for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would love to see it connected to events in Denver and the state, to feature things that are going on in the city at the same time.\u201d\n\nName nominations will be accepted through Sept. 30 and can be made at denplaza.flydenver.com.\n\nStegman said the suggestions will be reviewed internally and then a recommendation will be forwarded to the Denver city council.\n\nThe plaza is part of a more than $500 million project that includes the 519-room hotel and conference center, scheduled to open in late 2015, and a new Regional Transportation District transit hub that includes the new East Rail Line set to begin operations in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver airport crowdsources name for plaza linking terminal and hotel", "title": "Denver airport crowdsources name for plaza linking terminal and hotel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/04/denver-airport-crowdsources-name-for-plaza-linking-terminal-and-hotel/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140904__denver-international-airport-plaza-naming-contestp1.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140904__denver-international-airport-plaza-naming-contestp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-04T14:36:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:58:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0a5\"", "article_summary": "An outdoor plaza will connect the New Westin Hotel and Conference Center and the Jeppesen Terminal and Denver International Airport officials are hoping the public will help come up with the perfect name for the space.\nStegman said the suggestions will be reviewed internally and then a recommendation will be forwarded to the Denver city council.\nThe space can be configured to accommodate as many as 4,500 people which makes uses such as gala events and performances possible.\nDIA spokeswoman Stacey Stegman said the space will be programmed by Denver Arts & Venues.\n\u201cWe envision many uses for it,\u201d she said."}
