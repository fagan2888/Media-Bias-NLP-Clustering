Jack Markell (D-Delaware) visited employees of the Henrietta Johnson Health Clinic Wednesday to announce private funding dedicated to Delaware Contraceptive Access Now\u2014an initiative aimed at ensuring all women have same-day access to contraception at low or no cost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met too many women who have had to drop out of the workforce, drop out of school, when they had a baby when they weren\u2019t intending to have a baby and weren\u2019t ready to have a baby,\u201d Markell said.\n\n\u201cJust in terms of opportunity, this represents for these women to develop their life and career more if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\u201d\n\nUpstream USA, an organization dedicated to providing access to contraceptives, will provide training and technical assistance to publicly funded health centers and private providers in the state so they can offer patients a full range of contraceptive methods on a same-day basis.\n\nThe state will also reallocate $1.75 million from existing Division of Public Health funds for the project.\n\nThe announcement follows the governor\u2019s State of the State speech last month, for which he addressed the importance of access to contraceptives and his intention to provide better access to quality women\u2019s health in Delaware.\n\nHenrietta Johnson Health Clinic employees began training Wednesday as part of the $10 million program, which focuses on the implementation of IUDs and implants as contraceptive options\u2014which health experts say are the most effective forms of birth control.\n\n\u201cIt can take a lot of work to transform a health care practice to make it so that a device such as this or any practice change gets implanted to its maximum effectiveness,\u201d said Director of the Delaware Division of Public Health Dr. Karyl Rattay.\n\nDelaware\u2019s unplanned pregnancy rate of 57 percent is among the highest in the nation, according to the state.\n\nHealth experts say unplanned pregnancies and births can be associated with delayed prenatal care, increased poverty, premature birth and reduced physical and mental health.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act made all forms of birth control available with no out-of-pocket costs, there are still more steps that need to be taken to increase accessibility of IUDs and implants.\n\n\u201cThese methods are well tolerated and very safe so some would say in comparison to the pill they are even safer,\u201d Rattay said. \u201cBut we certainly know for many women prefer these methods once they know about them and know the side effects are very limited.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Gov Jack Markell D Delaware visited employees of the Henrietta Johnson Health Clinic Wednesday
