During this time, institutions may need to realign their investment strategy, he said. Some organizations may just be getting to that task after a busy year.\n\n[Also: S&P says nonprofits have weak outlook]\n\n\u201cI was hearing last year, the need to consolidate the retirement plans,\u201d Ancell said. \u201cIt\u2019s like cleaning out the garage. I think there\u2019s a lot of focus on that this year.\u201d\n\nAs healthcare organizations plan for 2015, Mercer advocates the need for investment assets to enhance balance sheet strength, fund capital investment needs, support operating budgets and maintain debt covenants.\n\nAncell offers 10 investment steps for nonprofits, which include using an outside consultant.\n\n1. Set a risk floor for the system.\n\nMost not-for-profit health systems are subject to debt covenants that may restrict the amount of investment risk they can take. Debt covenants limit the risk during a time many hospitals having outstanding debt, Ancell said.\n\nThis is the time to quantify the risk floor, that balance between risk verses the benefit of return.\n\n2. Consider whether an improved operating environment boosts risk tolerance.\n\nIn 2012, reimbursement cuts, the Affordable Care Act and the need to implement electronic medical records forced hospitals to make technological upgrades.\n\n\u201cThat required some huge IT spending,\u201d Ancell said.\n\nThese improved operations, along with stronger economic indicators, may have improved a hospital\u2019s risk tolerance.\n\n3. Assess the governance structure of investment portfolios.\n\nInvestment issues may have taken a back seat as finance staffs have been swamped and hospitals have been trying to stabilize, according to Ancell.\n\n\u201cCFOs and boards didn\u2019t have a lot of time to deal with investment issues,\u201d Ancell said.\n\nDelegating certain functions of the investment function to focus on strategy may be the answer.\n\n4. Consider the investment strategy in relation to strategic actions \u2014 needs may have changed.\n\nMany nonprofit health systems have an eye towards M&A. Some of these actions may alter an organization\u2019s balance sheet, with boards unwilling to tolerate a significant asset decline post-action, Ancell said.\n\n\u201cTheir debt situation may have changed,\u201d Ancell said. \u201cThere may be significant changes in financial metrics. They want to make sure they don\u2019t end up with market decline after that.\u201d\n\nFinance and investment committees should consider how best to integrate investment with other strategies and whether these factors may necessitate a change in the investment risk profile.\n\n5. Conduct a post-merger investment policy survey.\n\nCombining organizations and their corresponding committees warrants revisiting key investment policy questions.\n\n\u201cIf you bring two organizations together, two investment committees, two investment approaches, you have to take a methodical approach to combining that,\u201d Ancell said.\n\nMercer suggests a survey to see if everyone is on the same page.\n\n6. Develop a strategy for getting a defined benefit plan fully funded to ensure you\u2019re ready to act.\n\nThere are quite a few systems with defined benefit pension plans that are a lot are less than 100 percent funded, Ancell said. Even if pension plans are currently frozen, organizations still have numerous employees who will be getting these pension benefits. Organizations need to put together a plan to get fully funded.\n\nAs funded status improves, a new road map to cut down on risk may include allocation adjustments based on plan design changes, fixed income composition changes and risk transfer methods.\n\n7. Recognize the growing importance of your defined contribution plan.\n\nWith pension plans frozen, an organization needs to ensure that the organization\u2019s current benefit plan is optimized to attract and retain talent, Ancell said.\n\nThese plans are complicated when there are mergers.\n\nTo deal with multiple plans, hospitals need to adopt a set of best practices that includes an assessment of investment structure, fees, target date line-up, incentives for participation, communication strategy and options for managing through retirement.\n\n8. Clearly define DC plan governance and consider whether this is an HR function or finance/investment committee responsibility.\n\nIn the past, the defined benefit plan has been the function of human resources. Organizations may wish to rethink this as a responsibility of finance, as recent regulatory attention has focused on DC plan fees and is likely to expand to other areas, Ancell said.\n\n9. Review the fixed income allocation and evaluate whether unconstrained bond funds could be a component of a fixed income program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of questions over the years, aren\u2019t interest rates going up?\u201d Ancell said. \u201cWe could be in a low rate environment for a long time.\u201d\n\nHealthcare operating portfolios are generally conservative, but revenue shortfalls may increase reliance on portfolio returns. Low fixed-income yields present a challenge. Organizations should determine if the size and composition of fixed-income holdings remain appropriate and consider unconstrained bond funds.\n\n10. Set an illiquidity budget as part of managing the overall risk profile.\n\nSome systems are increasing their allocations to private or illiquid assets. Yet rating agencies may count illiquid assets in days-cash-on-hand calculations. The investment committee should set an illiquidity budget as part of the overall risk profile.\n\n\u201cGo in with eyes open,\u201d Ancell said.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/10-crucial-investments-nonprofit-healthcare-providers-consultant", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Revenue-increase-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "While the sector is struggling, one expert offers these financial tips for enhancing investment assets to shore up balance sheets at hospitals and health systems.", "title": "10 crucial investments for nonprofit healthcare providers: Consultant"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Revenue-increase-feature.gif"}, "title": "10 crucial investments for nonprofit healthcare providers: Consultant", "description": "While the sector is struggling, one expert offers these financial tips for enhancing investment assets to shore up balance sheets at hospitals and health systems.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Nonprofit hospitals are facing another challenging year as Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s predicts more credit downgrades than upgrades and pressures to convert to value-based systems continue to gnaw at bottom lines.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1286\"", "article_summary": "[Also: S&P says nonprofits have weak outlook]\u201cI was hearing last year, the need to consolidate the retirement plans,\u201d Ancell said.\nThese improved operations, along with stronger economic indicators, may have improved a hospital\u2019s risk tolerance.\nMost not-for-profit health systems are subject to debt covenants that may restrict the amount of investment risk they can take.\nConsider the investment strategy in relation to strategic actions \u2014 needs may have changed.\nDuring this time, institutions may need to realign their investment strategy, he said."}
