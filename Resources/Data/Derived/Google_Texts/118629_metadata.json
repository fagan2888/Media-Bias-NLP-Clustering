Holding McDonalds liable for the actions of other actors threatens to undo the entire business model, according to Robert Cresanti, vice president of the International Franchising Association.\n\n\u201cPut yourself in the shoes of a small business person who has just invested their life savings in a new franchise,\u201dCresanti said. \u201cNow they no longer own their business as a group of unelected government bureaucrats have just jeopardized whether they control their employees or not.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s plans to challenge Griffin\u2019s charges, saying in a statement to CNN that they \u201cimproperly and dramatically strike at the heart of the franchise system\u2014a system that creates economic opportunity, jobs and income for thousands of business owners and their employees across the country.\u201d\n\nLabor unions have long targeted franchise businesses for unionization and the SEIU has helped organize and stage ongoing protests at McDonalds location across the country. The decision to hold the parent company responsible will help the union overcome several obstacles for unionization.\n\n\u201cThis is the nightmare before Christmas for local franchise businesses. A group of unelected Washington Bureaucrats has ganged up with union bosses, while Congress has left town for the holiday break,\u201d Cresanti said.\n\nHigh turnover in the fast food business, as well as the corporate structure of franchises, makes it very expensive to hold organizing campaigns. Unions have to take a store-by-store approach to win control of franchises under the existing standard. Griffin\u2019s interpretation of the joint employer standard could allow labor groups to unionize franchises en masse.\n\n\u201cThe Board has effectively legislated a change to the definition of who an employer is, which will impact hundreds of thousands of businesses,\u201d Cresanti said. \u201cUnelected government bureaucrats, let alone one prosecutor, should not have such power.\u201d\n\nThe charges came one week after the SEIU staged protests masquerading organizers and professional picketers as actual fast food employees.\n\n\u201cSEIU played a big role in these events. In fact, I would say SEIU was a leader in putting this event together,\u201d an SEIU official with Washington, D.C.-based Local 32-BJ said in a video obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nTying the parent company with the franchises also gives the union an opportunity to collect more money. The average franchisee earns about $50,000 per year, while corporate parents collect billions of dollars. SEIU organizer Kendall Fells said that the union has used that to its advantage in its battle for higher wages in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very reasonable individuals. If that doesn\u2019t work we\u2019ll bring 150 people and shut their store down day after day after day,\u201d Fells said at a May National Employment Law Project (NELP) conference. \u201cTheir profit margin is so small that they\u2019re kind of forced to make an economic decision.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s NLRB has announced a slew of regulations in December that will benefit unions. On December 12, the agency released new election guidelines that will speed up the election process and force employers to turn personnel information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, over to union organizers.\n\nCresanti said that the IFA would contest the McDonald\u2019s ruling in court.\n\n\u201cIFA will vigorously challenge what the NLRB has done today in the interest of preserving the balance of power between our branches of government to reverse this in the name of job preservation, economic expansion, the rule of law and sound public policy,\u201d Cresanti said. \u201cIFA will lead that charge and we are confident in its ultimate outcome to preserve the franchise model.\u201d\n\nThe NLRB hearings on the charges are scheduled to take place on March 30, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The National Labor Relations Board took another step toward eliminating the franchise business model on Friday, opening the doors for unionization at some of America\u2019s largest employers.
