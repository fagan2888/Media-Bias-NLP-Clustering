CARACS, Venezuela (AP) — President Nicolas Maduro was greeted by the Venezuelan equivalent of a ticker tape parade Saturday as he returned to an increasingly stricken economy from a two-week fundraising trip.

Crowds of government supporters danced to live salsa, clutched brightly colored balloons and cheered as the socialist leader and former bus driver arrived at the presidential palace, driving himself at the head of the motorcade.

The administration called the festivities to welcome Maduro back from a tour of China, Russia and five other countries. He had sought to win new loans and to persuade fellow oil-producing countries to work together to stop the dive of crude prices, which has been disastrous for Venezuela’s already struggling economy, which gets 96 percent of its export revenue from oil sales.

Maduro has said he achieved what was needed, touting an infusion of investments from China and a new financial alliance with Qatar. Downtown Caracas was lined Saturday with banners featuring pictures of Maduro shaking hands with world leaders above the tagline “Successful tour.”

But details of any new deals have been sparse, and members of the oil cartel OPEC have so far stood firm in rejecting Venezuela’s plea to cut production.

While Maduro was on the road, extending his trip at least twice, state-run supermarkets implemented a new rationing system to curb out-of-control lines, young protesters began sporadically blockading streets and opposition leaders strengthened their calls for immediate change.
