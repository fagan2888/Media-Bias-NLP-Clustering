Late night got hit with a dose of conservatism Tuesday night as comedian Dennis Miller schooled funny man Seth Meyers on the absurdity of job lock, as he told the “Late Night” host America was “built on busting your a**.”

Miller joined his fellow “Saturday Night Live” alum on Tuesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” to discuss his comedy act, “America 180.” During his appearance, the Emmy-winning comedian seized upon the opportunity to hit Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for praising Obamacare because it frees Americans from “job lock.”

“When I hear her talking about freeing yourself from job lock, that’s America 180 to me,” the comedian said. “This country is always built on busting your a**, and if we’re going to start talking about jobs and unemployment as freeing yourself from job lock, we’re going down the crapper.”

Meyer attempted to play devil’s advocate and argued many Americans are relieved to no longer have to rely on their employer for health insurance. Miller, though, didn’t buy it.

“All I know is this, I don’t care how much healthcare you have if you’re sitting on your a** blowing spliffs, watching cartoons all day. We’re all screwed,” he said.

Miller hilariously poked fun at Pelosi for her outspoken praise of Obamacare and wondered why he would want to “hand over my healthcare to a woman who chose that plastic surgeon?”

“How would you like to go through life looking like you’re perpetually witnessing the docking of the Hindenburg?” he asked as the audience broke into laughter.
