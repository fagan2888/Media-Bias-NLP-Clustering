Some insurers put all or most drugs for HIV and AIDS, cancer and other chronic conditions in high-cost tiers, according to a recent study that examined midrange \u201csilver\u201d plans sold on state and federal insurance exchanges in eight states. The study also found that more drugs were placed in high-cost tiers for 2015 plans than for 2014 plans.\n\nPercentage of silver plans placing drugs in the highest tiers\n\nDrugs made exclusively by one company, by drug class\n\nNote: The eight states in this study represent 60% of U.S. population enrolled in exchanges in 2014.\n\nHIV MEDICATION TIERING ON THE ILLINOIS EXCHANGE\n\nThe eight insurers that sell health plans on the federal exchange in Illinois place drugs into cost tiers differently. A higher tier indicates higher costs.\n\nNote: The insurer Assurant was omitted because it does not use a numbered tier system. Assurant classifies five of the listed drugs as nonpreferred brand-name drugs, which are in other plans\u2019 third and fourth tiers. The rest are preferred brand-name drugs and are cheaper.\n\nMONTHLY COST COMPARISONS\n\nThese examples compare various costs for four silver plans sold on the exchange, including the price of Atripla, a common single-pill treatment for HIV. Costs for Atripla through the Coventry and Humana plans are based on average wholesale prices and do not account for discounts insurers negotiate with drugmakers.\n\nCategory Land of Lincoln Health, Freedom PPO Silver Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Choice Silver PPO 003 Coventry, Silver $10 Co-pay Select Humana, Silver 425/Choice POS Premium $256 $215.00 $330.00 $383.00 Deductible $4,250 $6,000.00 $3,750.00 $4,250.00 Maximum out-of pocket $6,200 $6,000.00 $6,600.00 $6,250.00 Cost of Atripla per month $35 copay after deductible $50.00 copay Est. $1,200 coinsurance payment after deductible Est. $1,200 coinsurance payment after deductible\n\nNOTE: Drug costs based on analysis of plan info performed by AIDS Foundation of Chicago from Nov. 10 to Dec. 1, 2014.
