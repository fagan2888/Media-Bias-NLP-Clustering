In a New York Times feature about how Donald Trump says he would govern if elected, the presumptive Republican nominee emphasizes that his first 100 days would be more focused on consensus building between groups rather than brusque combat.\n\nTrump would first work to ingratiate himself with legislative leaders by rendering them to South Florida and stuffing them with arthropods. \u201cHe would launch a charm offensive to start \u2018building a government based on relationships,\u2019 \u201d the Times writes, \u201cperhaps inviting the Republican leaders Paul D. Ryan and Mitch McConnell to escape the chilly Washington fall and schmooze at Mar-a-Lago over golf and two-pound lobsters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHe tells the Times that \u201cI know people aren\u2019t sure right now what a President Trump will be like \u2026 [b]ut things will be fine,\u201d and adds that he\u2019s \u201cnot running for president to make things unstable for the country.\u201d That quote, however, immediately follows a list of agenda items for the first 100 days that mostly would make things unstable for the country.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, he would go to a \u201cbeautiful\u201d gala ball or two, but focus mostly on rescinding Obama executive orders on immigration and calling up corporate executives to threaten punitive measures if they shift jobs out of the United States.\n\nAnd by the end of his first 100 days as the nation\u2019s 45th leader, the wall with Mexico would be designed, the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place, the audit of the Federal Reserve would be underway and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion.\n\nWhat about foreign policy? Ceding civilian control of the military appears to be a top priority. \u201cHe talked of turning the Oval Office into a high-powered board room, empowering military leaders over foreign affairs specialists in national security debates, and continuing to speak harshly about adversaries.\u201d Calling foreign leaders \"would not necessarily be a priority\" because he doesn't want America getting more \"entangled\" in the world. We're just talking about phone calls, here.\n\nHe might name his son-in-law Jared Kushner, publisher of the New York Observer, to an administration position.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Donald Trump says you don't need to worry about his presidency.
