But much more could be lost if it wasn\u2019t for a team of federal watchdogs tasked with flagging any inefficiencies or wrongdoing within all government programs and projects.\n\nThat\u2019s according to the Special Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)\u2014the group in charge of overseeing the 15 presidentially appointed IG\u2019s. The group consistently reminds lawmakers of out how the auditors\u2019 work saves the federal government billions of dollars each year\u2014despite their annual collective operating budget of over $1 billion.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe $43 billion identified by the IG\u2019s in 2014 is just the tip of the iceberg. The Center for American Progress estimates that annual tax gap\u2014what Americans owe the IRS\u2014is between $400 billion and $500 billion. All in, the government wastes close to $800 billion every year. Enough to fix every road and bridge, invest in jobs and the future, and really help those who need it most.\n\nRelated: 10 Outrageous Examples of Government Waste\n\nEvery time the IG\u2019s conduct an investigation, they issue a report with recommendations for ways the agencies can improve and potentially save money through better management practices.\n\nThis year, CIGIE said that taken together, all of the auditors\u2019 recommendations this year would result in about $32 billion in savings, The Washington Examiner first reported. Recommendations typically include telling agencies to ramp up their oversight or come up with a new policy that will help them run more efficiently.\n\nUnlike publicly traded companies, which are responsible to shareholders, the agencies, which are ultimately responsible to taxpayers, do not have to adhere to the recommendations. In some cases, they are ignored or are only partially implemented. Even in the latter case, the IG\u2019s estimate some pretty significant cost savings.\n\nThe investigations this year have already resulted in $11 billion that was returned to the Treasury.\n\nThe IG\u2019s total operating budget for 2014 was about $1.6 billion, according to CIGIE\u2019s financial audit for 2014.\n\nRelated: Federal Government Blatantly Wastes $30 Billion This Year\n\nBy calculating the potential savings based on IG recommendations--$32 billion\u2014with the recovered $11 billion, the agencies could have saved a total of $43 billion this year if agencies accede to the IG\u2019s recommendations, (which isn\u2019t likely.)\n\nThat represents a $27 return on every dollar invested (or a 2,600 percent increase) using the $43 billion figure divided by the IG\u2019s total operating budget for this year. That\u2019s up from last year\u2019s $21 per dollar invested in the IG\u2019s operating costs.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s difficult to really measure how much the IG\u2019s work could potentially save. CIGIE\u2019s estimates take into account how much the auditors highlight in questionable costs and how their recommended strategies could resolve those issues. However, agencies might decide not to take up the auditors\u2019 recommendations and instead come up with their own cost-saving strategies.\n\nCIGIE\u2019s cost savings estimates (to prove to Congress they\u2019re worth their weight) come at the end of a tough year for the IG community. Earlier this year, the Commerce Department\u2019s IG, Todd Zinser was under a federal investigation for allegedly protecting his top deputies who were accused of intimidating staffers who attempted to report wrongdoing by Zinser.\n\nSimilarly, earlier this year, a Senate oversight panel accused the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s IG, Charles Edwards, of knowingly altering and delaying investigations. He stepped down and is now on paid administrative leave.\n\nThose are just a few bad apples, and overall the IG\u2019s serve a crucial oversight function within the sprawling federal government.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every year, tens of billions of tax dollars are lost to waste, fraud and abuse within", "title": "Auditors Say Feds Needlessly Wasted $43 Billion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/29/Auditors-Say-Feds-Needlessly-Wasted-43-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/29/Auditors-Say-Feds-Needlessly-Wasted-43-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Every year, tens of billions of tax dollars are lost to waste, fraud and abuse within", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3b6\"", "article_summary": "The IG\u2019s total operating budget for 2014 was about $1.6 billion, according to CIGIE\u2019s financial audit for 2014.\nHowever, agencies might decide not to take up the auditors\u2019 recommendations and instead come up with their own cost-saving strategies.\nThat represents a $27 return on every dollar invested (or a 2,600 percent increase) using the $43 billion figure divided by the IG\u2019s total operating budget for this year.\nThe Center for American Progress estimates that annual tax gap\u2014what Americans owe the IRS\u2014is between $400 billion and $500 billion.\nThat\u2019s up from last year\u2019s $21 per dollar invested in the IG\u2019s operating costs."}
