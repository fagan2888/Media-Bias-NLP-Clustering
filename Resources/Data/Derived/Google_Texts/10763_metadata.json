The preview of Helix mentioned a little bit about what was going to happen during the show, but the title was erroneously referring to the January 30th episode.\n\nSan Jose was set in a far different locale than the desolate frozen Arctic wasteland of the first season of Helix. This time, the environment is a lush, forested, green island, but the dangers are just as real. A new cast member, Dr. Kyle Sommer, played by actor Matt Long, will be a regular.\n\nAfter 27 people on a Windjammer cruise ship who ate food from a mysterious island die, the Centers for Disease Control doctors from the cast of Helix investigate and try to learn more about the viral outbreak.\n\nAt the island, Dr.Julia Walker was speaking into her cell phone and she was listening to the Dionne Warwick song Do You Know the Way to San Jose, when a mysterious man dressed in a hazmat-like suit asked her if she \u201cknows the way to San Jose.\u201d He then clubbed her with a stick and knocked her out.\n\nThe CDC doctors check out the ship and Peter says \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d Dr. Sommer said \u201cWhatever killed these people was fast and aggressive.\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s not Narvik.\u201d\n\nA woman sprang from where she was hiding and attacked Dr Sarah Jordan, until she was injected and chilled out. The woman, Leila, told the scientist that it all started happening on the third day. The pathogen primarily attacked the digestive system. The scientists headed to the island of St. Germain, though the captain of the ship they were on said she was going to have to leave them there, and another ship would pick them up in about two weeks.\n\nThe plot of the Helix episode, San Jose, was split between the present and 30 years into the future, where Dr. Julia Walker and the man who abducted her, Caleb, have their separate, but definitely related, plot. Caleb eventually catches onto who Jules is, and uses tweezers to remove her contacts, which reveals her silver-colored eyes, and her connection with Ilaria. He told her \u201cI knew one day you\u2019d come.\u201d He meant, likely, that someone from Ilaria would arrive there.\n\nIn the Present plot line, Leila freaked out when she saw someone in the forest, and Dr. Sommer gave medical aid to Sarah, who had hurt her foot. Peter asked her how she got injured. It was, she said, due to a trap. It was a trap, Peter told her, not used to catch animals, but to catch humans.\n\nDr. Peter Farragut and Dr. Sommer later on in the premiere of the second season of Helix followed Leila\u2019s gaze to the base of a tree, where she said \u201cit\u2019s smiling at me.\u201d They find first a human skull, then notice that there are many more skulls there.\n\nAs Julia, in the future, is yelling \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d to Caleb when he approaches her with the tweezers, Dr. Sommer, Peter and Sarah arrived at the same house in the past.\n\nJulia spills the beans to Caleb, telling him that she has the TXM7 virus, and that is why members of Ilaria care about the disease. It is fatal, even to them. She shows Caleb that she has some of the fungus growing on her, telling him that it all began 30 years ago.\n\nLater in the Helix season two premiere, Caleb made dinner for both of them and she told him she was looking for Dr. Alan Farragut. Caleb revealed that he was on the island, but told Jules she \u201cmay not like what you find.\u201d Caleb and Julia walked in the darkness to where a cemetery was, and the headstone of Dr. Alan Farragut.\n\nIn the Present on Helix, Peter asked \u201cDr. Sommer, are you hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he replied. Blood was dripping on him from someone\u2019s body hanging from the ceiling of the building. It was Leila \u2014 someone on the island had killed her.\n\nOutside, it was now night, and a bunch of people from the cult approached carrying torches. Peter and Kyle realized that Kyle does not have enough bullets to adequately defend themselves, so they decide to play along with the approaching horde.\n\nThe group\u2019s leader, Anne, asked for them to come out. She told him they were \u201ctrespassing on private property.\u201d She said \u201ceverything will be explained at the Compound,\u201d adding \u201cPlease, come with us.\u201d\n\nAnne led the scientists to their expansive Compound, where they met the cult\u2019s leader, Brother Michael.\n\nBrother Michael talked with Peter, Kyle and Sarah. Peter told him that \u201cSomeone killed my friend.\u201d\n\nBrother Michael quibbled with that word usage, doubting that Leila was really Peter\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nBrother Michael tried to convince the scientists that maybe an animal had killed their \u201cfriend.\u201d The CDC doctors told him that Leila was not killed by an animal, but by a human. He told them that they could talk more in the morning.\n\nA hooded man brought a meal to Dr. Sarah Jordan. She told him \u201cThanks.\u201d When he turned around, his face was visible. He was Alan Farragut, gone undercover as a cult member.\n\nHelix ended with a scene of a woman being held down by some of the cult members. She had two of her teeth removed, and then a tube was forced down her throat, and something white was pumped into her body. The watching cult members looked on, in seeming approval.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nSources:\n\nNBC Universal Media Village\n\nSyfy Official Site\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "In the premiere of season two of Helix, called San Jose, fans of the hit Syfy series got introduced to a taste of what the new season will be like.
