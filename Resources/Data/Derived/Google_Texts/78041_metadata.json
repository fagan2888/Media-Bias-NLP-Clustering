Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign rolled out two ads in Utah and Arizona on Thursday, ahead of Utah\u2019s caucus and Arizona\u2019s primary on Tuesday. The ads, geared toward voters in each state, seek to paint Cruz as a principled conservative and fighter for the law.\n\nThe first ad, titled \u201cLee,\u201d features Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who last week became the first U.S. senator to endorse Cruz. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham announced Thursday he would campaign with the Texas senator but stopped short of an official endorsement.\n\nThe ad, which will run in Utah, shows Lee saying Cruz vowed to fight government overreach and the Affordable Care Act, defend gun rights and protect religious liberty.\n\n\u201cTed has kept those promises,\u201d Lee says in the ad. \u201cWe need to unite behind Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nThe second ad, \u201cGrant,\u201d will air in Arizona statewide. It features Steve Ronnebeck of Mesa, Ariz., who tells the viewer that his son Grant was killed by an immigrant who arrived in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cHe should\u2019ve been deported,\u201d Ronnebeck says in the ad, which lingers on pictures of Grant with his father, kneeling with a soccer ball and posing for a school photo. \u201cMy son\u2019s death was completely preventable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI trust Ted Cruz, he believes in our Constitution. He believes in the rule of law,\u201d Ronnebeck continues. \u201cIt\u2019s time we put somebody in office who puts the American people first.\u201d\n\nTogether, Utah\u2019s majority-takes-all caucus and Arizona\u2019s winner-take-all primary put 98 delegates on the table for the three remaining Republican presidential candidates. A candidate needs 1,237 to win the nomination.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMy90ZWQtY3J1ei1jYW1wYWlnbi1sYXVuY2hlcy10d28tYWRzLWluLXV0YWgtYW5kLWFyaXpvbmEuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Elizabeth Koh", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen.
