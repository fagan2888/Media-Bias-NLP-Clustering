Or gazing at the stars while watching a movie on the big screen, double and triple features, and those goofy commercials advertising popcorn and candy? \u2605 People often wax poetic about their favorite drive-in theater, which happened to be the brainchild of Richard Hollingshead, a movie fan and sales manager at his father\u2019s company, Whiz Auto Products in Camden.\n\nSeventy-one years ago, on June 6, 1933, the first drive-in movie theater opened on Crescent Boulevard in Camden. Called the Park-In Theater, Hollingshead\u2019s inspiration reportedly came from his mother\u2019s inability to sit comfortably in traditional movie theater seats.\n\nHe experimented in the driveway of his home and mounted a 1928 Kodak projector on the hood of his car, pinning a screen to trees, and placing a radio behind the screen for sound. In May 1933 he received a patent for the concept and with an initial investment of $30,000, opened the first drive-in, or park-in, a month later.\n\nThe admission fee: 25 cents per car and 25 cents per person, with no group paying more than $1. Drive-ins popped up all over the country when his patent was overturned in 1949.\n\nSources:http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first- drive-in-movie-theater-opens http://www.driveintheater.com/drivlist.htm\n\nthe number of drive-ins throughout the country in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\nthe number of cars that could park at the now-defunct All-Weather Drive-In, Copiague, N.Y., which featured a kid\u2019s playground and full-service restaurant on a 28-acre lot.\n\nthe number of drive-ins that still exist in the country today.\n\nthe number of drive-ins in New Jersey in 1967, the most in the state\u2019s history.\n\nthe number of airplanes that could park in the last row of Ed Brown Jr.\u2019s Fly-in and Drive-in in Wall.
