Why?\n\nThey say that the fee charged to employers to bail out insurance companies participating in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is an unconstitutional tax on government.\n\nUnder ObamaCare, every employer must pay a fee that goes into a reinsurance fund used to bail out insurance companies that lose money on the ACA. The fee is even charged to state and local government employers, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer:\n\n(T)he ACA \u201cTransitional Reinsurance Program\u201d was not funded by the people participating in the ACA\u2019s new insurance marketplace \u2026 (r)ather, the fee had to be paid by \u2026 the people already providing insurance to their workers. That included state and local governments and public universities.\n\nOhio\u2019s Attorney General, Mike DeWine, told the Plain Dealer this fee is a tax by one government entity on another. He told the newspaper that it\u2019s unconstitutional, so they want it stopped and peoples\u2019 money returned to them:\n\nThe lawsuit says that the \u201ctax\u201d violates \u201cimportant federalism protections\u201d in the Constitution, including the Tenth Amendment, which helps define the relationship between the federal and governments, the related anti-commandeering doctrine, and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.\n\nThe so-called \u201ctax\u201d is called a \u201cfee\u201d by the Obama administration. According to Reuters:\n\n\u201cThe reinsurance program helps keep premiums affordable from year to year, according to HHS.\u201d\n\nThe fact remains that state government, universities and counties have had to pay millions of dollars already.\n\nInsurance companies negotiated the reinsurance deal with the administration \u2014 including the President and his top aide Valerie Jarrett \u2014 to ensure they wouldn\u2019t lose money on ObamaCare. They were able to negotiate a more than one trillion dollar bailout over the next decade.\n\nOhio has already joined a different lawsuit against ObamaCare having to do with taxpayer subsidies for people living in states that have no insurance exchanges. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear that case in March.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "'This action simply protects a tradition as old as our republic...'", "published_at": "2015-01-26T17:31:01+00:00", "author": "Victoria Taft", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "'This action simply protects a tradition as old as our republic...'", "title": "White House Pulls Fast One w/ 'Illegal' Obamacare Tax...
