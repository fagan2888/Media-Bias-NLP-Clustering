For decades, these intensely personal and family needs have generally been viewed as private issues and largely overlooked in public policy, although it would cost an estimated $450 billion to replace that care.\n\nBut that may be changing.\n\nThe federal Commission on Long-Term Care has taken an important step to elevate family caregiving as a public issue that can no longer be ignored. Although the Commission could not agree on how to help individuals and their families pay for long-term services and supports (LTSS) comprehensively, their final report to Congress addresses the information and support needs of family caregivers \u2013 an isolated and unpaid workforce that fills big gaps in health care and LTSS.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s report recognizes that millions of family members and friends who serve as unpaid family caregivers provide complex chronic care with little preparation for their roles. One of the Commission\u2019s fundamental principles is that \u201cfamily caregivers should be identified and assessed for their needs, especially when care plans are dependent on them, and they should receive the support they need to continue providing care to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nThe steps endorsed by the Commission to strengthen family caregiving, which Chairman Bruce Chernof characterized as \u201cone of the most fundamental and transformative recommendations in the report,\u201d call for:\n\nIncluding family caregivers and their needs in assessment and care planning processes, in electronic health and LTSS records, and as key members of care teams\n\nEnsuring family caregivers have access to relevant information through technology to facilitate communication and decision making\n\nPromoting research to study caregiver interventions to see what supportive services work best and for whom\n\nThe Commission also recommends that Congress require the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a broad national strategy to support family caregivers. This strategy should identify specific and effective actions that government, communities, and others can take to address the challenges facing families in their caregiving roles. It should also accelerate the development of caregiver support services to help families avoid burnout and improve the experience of care for the individuals receiving supportive services and their family members.\n\nIn the not too distant future, the \u201ccaregiver support ratio\u201d will start to plummet when the first baby boomers begin turning 80, the age at which the need for LTSS increases. By 2030, only 4 potential family caregivers will be available for every person 80 and older, down from a high of more than 7 to 1 in 2010. By 2050, when all the baby boomers have reached old age, the ratio will fall to less than 3 to 1, and more individuals with LTSS needs may need to rely on paid services for all or a part of their care.\n\nIt is time to respect and support family caregivers and get this right. If not, many of us will be on our own when we need help the most.\n\nPhoto courtesy of the Family Caregiver Alliance.\n\nAuthor: Lynn Friss Feinberg, MSW, is a senior strategic policy adviser for the AARP Public Policy Institute.
