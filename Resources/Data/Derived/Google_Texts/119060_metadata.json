She graduated from Harvard Law School in 1986 and served as the school\u2019s dean from 2003 to 2009.\n\nPresident Barack Obama nominated her in 2009 as the solicitor general of the United States and as an associate justice of the Supreme Court on May 10, 2010. She took her seat on Aug. 7, 2010.\n\nThe last time Kagan visited the Princeton campus, she said, was for her 25th reunion eight years ago. Everything she learned about writing was through her Princeton education, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love Princeton. I think all of you folks that go to Princeton are incredibly lucky, at least if it\u2019s anything like what it was then, and I suspect it\u2019s better,\u201d Kagan said.\n\nOnce an opinion has come out, Kagan said, much of the communication within the court is in writing, rather than verbal exchanges. Email hasn\u2019t quite hit; a chamber\u2019s aide walks written memos around the building, Kagan said.\n\n\u201cMaybe part of it is an attachment to tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there have been a lot of emails that I\u2019ve sent \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you \u2014 where I click the send button and then think, \u2018Eh, what did I just do?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn the Constitution\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d clause and issues of equality, Kagan said some part\u2019s of the document are written in such abstract and vague terms that they\u2019re difficult to interpret.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the Constitution says you\u2019re entitled to due process of law and you\u2019re entitled to the equal protection of law, trying to give that content meaning \u2014 it can\u2019t be done by just staring at the words,\u201d she said.\n\nOne option is to decide what the drafters\u2019 intended when they put the Constitution together and come up with a list of practices they thought were prohibited or not, Kagan said. But that\u2019s not the best way to go about it, she said.\n\n\u201cOne way you know that is that it leads to results that are simply untenable,\u201d she said, citing segregation in schools and misogyny issues.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s important for judges to start with the original meaning of the Constitution and observe how it\u2019s developed and applied in different ways over time, she said.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think it\u2019s really important what the history over time has been, so it\u2019s not just the history at the particular moment but it really is the history of our republic, in a sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI myself am a big precedent person. Some people call it a common law constitutionalist.\u201d\n\nEisgruber asked Kagan if judges think about how particular decisions they make might result in political backlash.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super rare that justices do or that they should. For the most part, you have a job to do, and your job is to apply the law as best you can,\u201d Kagan said. But to some degree, justices must think about the consequences of their actions and avoid making hasty decisions, she said.\n\nTo those that say justices typically rule along political party lines, Kagan said the court doesn\u2019t experience such divisions as in politics. Last year, 60 percent of the opinions the nine justices issued were unanimous, she said.\n\nEisgruber called attention to an op-ed piece printed in The New York Times this month written by Paul Krugman, a Princeton faculty member, that he said accuses the conservative wing of the court of being corrupt because of its willingness to attack the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nIs there any reason to worry about corruption in the Supreme Court, Eisgruber asked.\n\n\u201cThere is not a day in my job that I have ever thought that anybody was not doing everything that they do in utter, complete good faith,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cYou can disagree with people, and you will disagree with people, but everybody is trying to get it right.\u201d\n\nNicole Mulvaney may be reached at nmulvaney@njtimes.com.
