Normally, most farmers use piloted planes or satellite imagery to get information about their soil and crops.\n\nBut the cost of hiring a piloted plane is expensive, and the times satellites can view their fields do not always match a farmer\u2019s needs.\n\nPaying a drone operator to survey fields could be a cheaper alternative, but the drones are expensive.\n\nThe drones, built and offered by Sanborn Map Co. of Colorado Springs, cost more than $95,000 each to build, and the multispectral camera in a drone alone costs more than $100,000.\n\nSo how can the drone, which costs more than $200,000 in total, be more cost-effective?\n\nJeff Specht, a Sanborn consultant who publishes the Earth Imaging Journal, said the device itself is not for sale but Sanborn\u2019s services are.\n\n\u201cThe farmer wouldn\u2019t buy this device. It is going to be a kind of subscription service where they pay to have us go out and gather necessary data for them,\u201d Specht said.\n\nThe drone displayed at the farm show is the Leptron Avenger. The device is electric and can reach heights of more than 12,000 feet.\n\nThis is the first year the company has exhibited the drone at the Colorado Farm Show. They are not yet selling their service because the Federal Aviation Administration hasn\u2019t yet cleared the drones to fly.\n\nThe FAA is still testing drone technology at six different sites in the United States and developing research to safely integrate it.\n\nSanborn is at the farm show this year to get opinions of the farmers who would be interested in their services in the future.\n\nJason Caldwell, director of strategic operations for Sanborn,\n\nalso speculated that drone technology could be used for other purposes in the future, such as fighting forest fires.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "High-flying drones may offer a down-to-earth farm option", "title": "High-flying drones may offer a down-to-earth farm option", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/01/high-flying-drones-may-offer-a-down-to-earth-farm-option/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-01T17:30:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-01T17:30:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1733\"", "article_summary": "The FAA is still testing drone technology at six different sites in the United States and developing research to safely integrate it.\nThis is the first year the company has exhibited the drone at the Colorado Farm Show.\nThe drone can be used to take images of farmers\u2019 fields and let them know what parts of their crops need fertilizer or pesticide.\nJason Caldwell, director of strategic operations for Sanborn,also speculated that drone technology could be used for other purposes in the future, such as fighting forest fires.\nPaying a drone operator to survey fields could be a cheaper alternative, but the drones are expensive."}
