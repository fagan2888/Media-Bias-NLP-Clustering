In fiscal year 2015 (which ran from October 1, 2014 through September 30 of last year) Americans shelled out a whopping $1.54 trillion in individual income taxes, $1.065 trillion in payroll taxes and $343 trillion in corporate income taxes.\n\nThe last three fiscal years have seen surging government receipts thanks to the December 2012 tax hike approved U.S. president Barack Obama and \u201cRepublican\u201d leaders in Congress. And thanks to new Obamacare taxes.\n\nHave these tax hikes helped the economy? Um, no.\n\nWho paid this massive freight? The rich, mostly.\n\nAccording to 2014 data compiled by The Pew Center, U.S. taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $250,000 per year paid a whopping 51.6 percent of the individual income taxes collected \u2013 despite representing just 2.7 percent of the returns filed.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, individuals with adjusted gross incomes of less than $50,000 per year represented 62.3 percent of all returns \u2013 but only 5.7 percent of revenue collected.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown \u2026\n\nObviously lower-income earners are hit harder by the payroll tax \u2013 which climbed from 4.2 percent to 6.2 percent beginning in 2013. In fact according to a Treasury Department analysis (.pdf here), eighty percent of families filing returns pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income tax.\n\nIn other words, everybody is taking it where the sun don\u2019t shine \u2026 well, except those who receive billions in government contracts/ subsidies/ handouts.\n\nAlthough they are beginning to struggle, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2016/04/18/taxes-who-pays/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tax-day-540x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Taxes: Who Pays?"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2477\"", "article_summary": "In fiscal year 2015 (which ran from October 1, 2014 through September 30 of last year) Americans shelled out a whopping $1.54 trillion in individual income taxes, $1.065 trillion in payroll taxes and $343 trillion in corporate income taxes.\nIn fact according to a Treasury Department analysis (.pdf here), eighty percent of families filing returns pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income tax.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown \u2026Obviously lower-income earners are hit harder by the payroll tax \u2013 which climbed from 4.2 percent to 6.2 percent beginning in 2013.\nAnd thanks to new Obamacare taxes.\nAccording to 2014 data compiled by The Pew Center, U.S. taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of more than $250,000 per year paid a whopping 51.6 percent of the individual income taxes collected \u2013 despite representing just 2.7 percent of the returns filed."}
