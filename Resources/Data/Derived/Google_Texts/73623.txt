Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is resigning from the board of Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a company that has significantly profited from the enactment of the Affordable Care Act and that has touted the economic benefits of the controversial health law.

Last month, Tenet reported that its third-quarter revenue was up $4.18 billion over the previous year, as the Washington Post notes -- and the company attributed 40 percent of those gains to Obamacare. Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter has repeatedly credited the ACA for his company's growing business. Last year, he said he expects every state to eventually embrace the expansion of Medicaid, a core component of Obamacare that only about half the states have adopted.

According to an SEC filing, "Mr. Bush is not resigning on account of any disagreement with Tenet." However, Bush -- like most Republicans -- has said he is opposed to President Obama's signature law.

"Obamacare, flawed to its core, doesn't work," Bush said in an interview with ABC in October 2013, following the botched debut of the Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov.

Earlier this month, Bush announced he would actively explore a presidential bid. Connections to a company that supports the Affordable Care Act could prove to be a liability in the Republican primaries.
