Eden Foods has sued the Department of Health and Human Services as Potter on the grounds of \u201cunconstitutional government overreach,\u201d and described contraceptives as \u201clifestyle drugs.\u201d\n\nRich says that companies like Eden Foods that continue to ignore the basic healthcare needs of their female employees they are destined to wind up in a risky position.\n\n\u201cI think companies that are not in tune with women\u2019s needs and women\u2019s rights are going to find themselves in trouble as time goes on,\u201d says Rich. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny women health care, you can\u2019t make women second-class citizens, and if companies continue to do that, then I have no problem with dropping them out of a co-op, which is owned by people that shop there.\u201d\n\nWeaver Street General Manager Ruffin Slater declined to comment on the decision, but issued this statement on the co-op\u2019s website:\n\nThanks for taking the time to write to us about Eden Foods. We value your feedback because it gives us an opportunity to align our product offerings more closely with the desires of our owners.\n\nYour feedback has caused us to evaluate how Eden products fit at Weaver Street Market. Our conclusion is that we can better meet owner needs by focusing on similar products from other producers, so we will no longer be offering Eden products.\n\nOur goal is to sell products that meet owners\u2019 tastes and that also meet cooperative values. We are proud when we can offer great tasting products that are also from local and small producers.\n\nAlthough we were able to react to this situation, we recognize that there are other cases where producers still fall short of our ideals. Product selection balances many factors including quality, price, and farming practices in addition to producer business practices. We constantly seek the best available choice for our owners without restricting access to important product categories.\n\nMore than anything, a situation like this causes us to redouble our efforts to improve our buying power, develop alternative suppliers, and to make more food ourselves\u2013so that we can control the ingredients, quality, and business practices.\n\nAgain, thank you for your feedback. The deeper the partnership we have with our owners, the more effective we can be in jointly sourcing the best food options. By attracting more people to food co-ops, we can increase our impact on the community and the world.\n\nWhole Foods, one of Weaver Street Market\u2019s closest competitors, has stated that they have no plans to discontinue selling Eden Foods\u2019 products and will instead allow customers to \u201cvote with their dollars.\u201d\n\nWeaver Street Market has been in business for over 25 years and has 18,000 consumer-owners with three locations in Orange County.\n\nFor more information on the Weaver Street Market co-op, click here.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chapelboro.com", "description": "Weaver Street Market has decided to remove any and all Eden Foods products from their shelves in the wake of the Hobby Lobby ruling that allows employers to exempt certain types of birth control fr\u2026", "title": "Weaver Street Market Removes Eden Foods", "url": "http://chapelboro.com/news/business/weaver-street-market-removes-eden-foods", "image": {"width": 625, "identifier": "http://chapelboro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/weaver-street-market-e1405679326434.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-17T19:36:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T09:35:26+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 164694420385656}, "twitter": {"description": "Weaver Street Market has decided to remove any and all Eden Foods products from their shelves in the wake of the Hobby Lobby ruling that allows employers to exempt certain types of birth control from workers\u2019 insurance plans.", "title": "Weaver Street Market Removes Eden Foods - Chapelboro.com", "image": "http://chapelboro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/weaver-street-market-e1405679326434.jpg?w=640", "creator": "@WCHLChapelboro", "site": "@WCHLChapelboro", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dee\"", "article_summary": "Weaver Street Market Removes Eden FoodsWeaver Street Market has decided to remove any and all Eden Foods products from their shelves in the wake of the Hobby Lobby ruling that allows employers to exempt certain types of birth control from workers\u2019 insurance plans.\nYour feedback has caused us to evaluate how Eden products fit at Weaver Street Market.\nFor more information on the Weaver Street Market co-op, click here.\nEden Foods has sued the Department of Health and Human Services as Potter on the grounds of \u201cunconstitutional government overreach,\u201d and described contraceptives as \u201clifestyle drugs.\u201dRich says that companies like Eden Foods that continue to ignore the basic healthcare needs of their female employees they are destined to wind up in a risky position.\nWhole Foods, one of Weaver Street Market\u2019s closest competitors, has stated that they have no plans to discontinue selling Eden Foods\u2019 products and will instead allow customers to \u201cvote with their dollars.\u201dWeaver Street Market has been in business for over 25 years and has 18,000 consumer-owners with three locations in Orange County."}
