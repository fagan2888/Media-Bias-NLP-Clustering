They found that mortality rates among sepsis patients were 10.4 percent, compared to 1.1 percent among non-sepsis patients. Moreover, of all hospital deaths around the U.S., up to 52 percent were among sepsis patients. Sepsis also accounted for nearly 22 percent of all hospital charges, according to the statement.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that as many as one in two patients dying in U.S. hospitals had sepsis. Teasing apart these findings in a similar regional study of sepsis mortality at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we found that most patients already had sepsis at the time of hospital admission. There was also a large number of patients with less severe sepsis, a group for whom treatment guidelines are less well-defined,\" Liu said. \"The results of our study suggest that improved care for sepsis patients of all severity levels and in all hospital settings could result in many future lives saved.\"\n\nA study last November indicated severe sepsis mortality rates fell over the past 20 years, even though no new pharmacological treatments were developed during that period, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSepsis mortality rates on the decline\n\nHospitals battle ICU complications, sepsis with rehab, physical therapy\n\nFewer blood transfusions reduce hospital infections\n\nStudy: Sepsis costs, mortality rate higher in teaching hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sepsis contributes to as much as 50 percent of all U.S. hospital deaths, despite only being present in one in 10 patients, research presented at the American Thoracic Society's (ATS) annual conference found, according to a statement from the ATS.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Sepsis contributes to as much as 50 percent of all U.S. hospital deaths, despite only being present in one in 10 patients, research presented at the American Thoracic Society's (ATS) annual conference found, according to a statement from the ATS.", "title": "Sepsis contributes to half of hospital deaths", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/sepsis-contributes-half-hospital-deaths/2014-05-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Thoracic Society,hospital deaths,hospital mortality rates,Nationwide Inpatient Sample,Patient Care & Outcomes,Sepsis", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Moreover, of all hospital deaths around the U.S., up to 52 percent were among sepsis patients.\nThey found that mortality rates among sepsis patients were 10.4 percent, compared to 1.1 percent among non-sepsis patients.\nTo learn more:- here's the statementRelated Articles:Sepsis mortality rates on the declineHospitals battle ICU complications, sepsis with rehab, physical therapyFewer blood transfusions reduce hospital infectionsStudy: Sepsis costs, mortality rate higher in teaching hospitals\nTeasing apart these findings in a similar regional study of sepsis mortality at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we found that most patients already had sepsis at the time of hospital admission.\nA study last November indicated severe sepsis mortality rates fell over the past 20 years, even though no new pharmacological treatments were developed during that period, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
