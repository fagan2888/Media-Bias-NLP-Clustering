In the 21st century, you're really considering naming your new grandstand the - wait for it, tree people, because you're never going to believe the cleverness of this - the ''Queen Elizabeth Stand?'' Yes, yes, I know that was the name of the one it has replaced, but still. In your long and storied history is there really no one else you'd like to honour? What, pray tell, has the Queen of England actually done for you? You did but see her passing by, and yet you love her till you die, right? That might cut it in 1963, but it is embarrassing in 2013. And if it is just to honour her, do you think having her image on our coins and $5 notes, not to mention so many other buildings and streets throughout the country, might already have that covered? And I gather you've also invited some royals to attend your carnival in April. Just imagine the excitement! One of the ROYAL FAMILY at Randwick! So exciting for us wee colonials. I wonder who will be the first to lie at their feet in the hope of having their tummies tickled? Be better, and more Australian, than that!\n\nHANDY CLICHE\n\nHere at the TFF Institute of Sports Speak, we study the frequency of phrases used by sportspeople. As keen readers will be aware, Australian sport seems to have just emerged from two very heavy years of \"tick-boxing\", whereby any champion who is about to achieve something major cites all the boxes that have been ticked, giving them hope that they can go on to tick the big one - win the tournament! But that is now soooo last Tuesday. For the new vogue phrase is, officially, putting your hand up. Take Lucas Neill who told the Today show - thank you, I know - on Wednesday morning that he still wanted the captaincy of the Socceroos. ''I'm always going to hold my hand up, and offer myself up for that honour \u2026'' Before that, Shaun Marsh also made his case. ''It's going to be nice to see who puts their hand up and forces selection for the first Test match.'' (Shaun didn't, as it turned out.) Nevertheless, Wallaby winger Nick Cummins, aka ''The Honey Badger'' was in a similar mood, despite his injury: ''After this broken hand it's about trying to play the rest of these games. It could be tough; there's a lot of blokes here who are hungry and training well but I'll definitely put my hand up.'' (The Honey Badger did, and then won hands down to score two big meat pies against Italy.) But no newly popular turn of phrase can be truly anointed until the likes of Shane Warne has uttered it, too, and how funny I should say that, for here he was, just a few days ago: ''I put my hand up to say I was wrong about George Bailey, and it's fantastic to see the form he's in.'' It's official. The new black in sporting cliches is putting your hand up.\n\nBRAVO, DAVO\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs if you didn't know, the 60th anniversary of cricket great Alan Davidson's Test debut against England will be celebrated with a Twenty20 celebrity game at Davo's spiritual home, Pratten Park, Ashfield, on Sunday, starting at noon, with a gold coin price of admission. Davo, now 84, will bowl the ceremonial first ball, and the celebrity cricketers will include Danny Green, Phil Jaques, Daryl Tuffey, Steve Mortimer, Hazem El Masri, Michael Potter and Todd Payten. Proceeds to the Salvation Army's Bush Fire Appeal. (By the by, I played in a game like that once, at North Sydney Oval, and my most compelling memory is how brilliant the Manly leaguie, Steve Menzies was with bat, ball, fielding and tactical nous.) In the meantime, though, bravo, Davo.\n\nTHE WHEEL DEAL\n\nLove this. My colleague Chris Barrett did a story recently on the former chairman of the Parramatta Eels Roy Spagnolo, who was shown the door ''after being accused of more than 30 instances of financial impropriety, from procuring free memberships and travel for family and friends, improperly paying large bonuses to executives and even allegedly using the back of a beer coaster to bill the club $30,000 for a Christmas party held at his house''. It was also alleged that he had authorised two payments to Eels prop Fuifui Moimoi, one of which was 15 grand for Moimoi's 2004 Ford Falcon, which in fact was likely worth only a little more than $5000. Not true, said Spagnolo. ''We did a valuation online,'' he told Barrett. ''It was $14,200 and we agreed to give him $15,000. It had mag wheels, it had woofers \u2026''\n\nMIGHTY ROSE\n\nNot long before the great Murray Rose died of leukaemia in April last year, he finished writing his autobiography, Life is Worth Swimming, which has just been released. Rose was, of course, the six-time Olympic medallist swimmer - of which four were gold. And then \u2026 ? Well, it was just like the song said:\n\nFolks said California's the place you ought to be,\n\nSo he loaded up the truck and he moved to Beverley \u2026\n\nHills, that is \u2026\n\nSwimming pools, movie stars.\n\nAfter starring in a couple of movies, Rose settled down in America, embarking on a marketing career, before returning to Australia in the early '90s. The book details how, in 1961, Rose was interviewed by the sportswriter Arlie Schardt for a Sports Illustrated cover story. The two became friends, staying in touch when Schardt moved to Time magazine to cover the civil rights movement. Schardt took Rose with him to Montgomery, Alabama, where they attended a protest meeting and Rose was introduced to Martin Luther King, jnr. In his book, Rose describes Dr King's speech that night as ''some of the most compelling oration I have ever heard''. Of their meeting, he writes, ''He appeared to be drained by recent incidents, but still projected a calm determination''. After Dr King was assassinated in Memphis in 1968, Murray and Arlie joined a small group of pressmen who marched in Montgomery with ''a river of black people'' in a peaceful demonstration. ''I will never forget the sight of otherwise loving mothers standing on shabby, paint-peeling porches with small children hanging onto their skirts,'' Rose recalled. ''A torrent of gestures and insults were hurled in our direction.''\n\nTEAM OF THE WEEK\n\nSachin Tendulkar. Is playing his 200th and final Test as we speak, after making his debut in 1989.\n\nGeorge Bailey. Makes his Test debut for Australia at the age of 31. If he scores some runs we can instantly nickname him - with thanks to Karl S. - \"The Old Bailey\".\n\nWallabies. Take on the Irish, after an encouraging win against Italy.\n\nAdam Scott. Won the Australian PGA.\n\nMark Schwarzer. Retires from national team with 109 caps. Well done, oh good and faithful servant of the game.\n\nRobert de Castella's Indigenous Marathon Project. All 11 runners crossed the line of the New York Marathon, with the fastest, Townsville's Jack Wilson, doing it in three hours, 14 minutes. Bravo to the lot of them.\n\nViswanathan Anand v Magnus Carlsen. The Indian and the Norwegian are locking horns in the World Chess Championship in Chennai.\n\nSydney FC. Had a big win against Melbourne Victory to kick-start their season.\n\nRIP Desiree Gill. 1968-2013. The Queensland jockey died after a fall during a race. She is survived by her trainer husband Barry and two sons.\n\nRIP Rick Buckley. 1947-2013. The much loved teacher of St Pats Goulburn and long-time driving force of that town's fine rugby club, died a fortnight ago. It was a testament to his stature that 750 people turned up at his funeral. Vale.\n\nWHAT THEY SAID\n\n2UE's John Stanley on ABC's Offsiders when the panel was discussing the Rugby League World Cup: \"At least 10 members of that American squad have visited the United States \u2026\"\n\nSky Sports commentator Richard Freedman on Adam Scott: \"He's a charming young man. But I'd rather spend half an hour with my accountant talking about fringe benefit tax than go to his press conference.\"\n\nIsrael Folau on turning from the Parramatta Eels negotiations to rugby: \"I felt as though God shut that door and opened this one, and I'm really happy now. God oversees everything and guides you through steps in life if you trust in Him.\" A pity the 10,000 Filipinos didn't place their trust in him, Izzy?\n\nLance Armstrong in an interview with Cycling News: \"I don't want to just talk about doping. It's obviously an element but 99 per cent of my career isn't about doping.\" Tragi-larious. (I just made that word up, but I think it fits.)\n\nBlake Ferguson on why he turned to Islam: \"Alcohol is completely forbidden in Islam, and that's been my problem for the last five years \u2026\" Is it me, or is it weird to sign on to a whole belief system because it helps you get off the grog?\n\nPaul Roos on having a number of his former charges with him again at the Demons: \"We've got a big group from the Swans - we might have a swear jar, where we put a buck in the jar if we mention the Swans too often - but they're a benchmark team and a benchmark club. It's almost about forgetting where we've come from and trying to come in here with no preconceived ideas.\"\n\nCourageous Wallaby David Pocock in a letter from Getup!: \"Instead of rising to the challenge and tackling climate change head-on, our government has turned this critical issue into a political football. That's why this Sunday I'll be joining tens of thousands of Australians in demanding we step up and do better.\"\n\nMark Schwarzer, who retired from the Socceroos: \"Without a doubt there's been a great over-reaction to [Brazil and France] and the performances. Yes, the performances were not great. I put my hand up for Brazil, but that was not the Socceroos we all know.\" (There's a lot of this going about. See item.)\n\nShane Warne takes a rare shot at his long-time protege and friend: \"Michael Clarke has [Alastair] Cook covered on tactics but where he must improve is in creating a happier team environment \u2026 If we look back over the years to when England lost eight Ashes series in a row there were a lot of people in their side playing for themselves and their own positions. It was a selfish environment. This is what Clarke has to avoid at all costs.\"\n\nMerv Hughes in the WACA Ground dressing room to Allan Border, after getting his first close look at Sachin Tendulkar in 1991: \"This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB.\" Merv was right. The final tally: Tendulkar, just under 16,000 runs; AB, 11,174 runs.\n\nTwitter - @Peter_Fitz", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "The Fitz Files", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Really, Royal Randwick Racecourse?
