He frequently huddles with movement leaders, he\u2019s a reliable vote on the Ways and Means committee, and in 2010 he published Restoring the Republic, a conservative manifesto, where he argues for a flat tax and deep reforms to entitlement programs. In the book, he also harshly criticizes environmental lobbyists, calling them \u201cneo-Marxist\u201d and \u201cMaoist.\u201d\n\nBut in recent weeks, Nunes has become one of the most vocal critics of his conservative colleagues \u2014 the same colleagues he usually relaxes with in the Republican cloakroom and sits with at conference meetings. He\u2019s furious with their willingness to shut down the government without much of a strategy, and with their inclination to follow the lead of Senator Ted Cruz, rather than Speaker John Boehner. In news story after news story, he has tartly called them \u201clemmings with suicide vests,\u201d among other things. His comments have drawn notice; some of his supporters back home are wondering if he\u2019s a \u201csellout.\u201d\n\nNunes, though, says such talk is inane. In an interview, he tells me his loyalty to Boehner and his new role as conservative provocateur are products of the growing unrest in the Republican conference, and he feels he needs to speak out for the dozens of Republicans who prefer to stay mum, even though they, like Nunes, are unhappy with how the fiscal impasse is unfolding.\n\n\n\nNATIONAL REVIEW: Why have you suddenly become such a candid figure? You have become very frank about what you see as a lack of strategy.\n\nDEVIN NUNES: It\u2019s important to be honest and truthful with your constituents. At the end of the day, we represent them. And from Day One several months ago, when constituents were asking me if there was a way that we could implement a strategy that get rid of Obamacare using an appropriations bill, I said \u2018No, that\u2019s not a winning strategy.\u2019\n\nAnd the simple reason is you just have to be able to count the votes. And this whole notion, that you only somehow need 51 votes in the Senate? That\u2019s not even true. And it\u2019s not even true that you need 60 votes in the Senate, because really, no one honestly believes that a guy named Obama is not going to veto a bill that gets rid of Obamacare. So, then you technically need 67 votes in the Senate and you would need 290 votes in the House, where we only have 233 votes. So this is just a simple issue of math, basic math. And I\u2019m willing to go along with the leadership because I think the way these other guys who have been opposing leadership every step of the way is just unacceptable.\n\n\n\nNR: When did your frustrations with Cruz\u2019s effort crystallize?\n\nNUNES: I don\u2019t have anything personal against the guy, but when all of this started, when they started airing ads on television telling my constituents and people everywhere that this was plausible, I couldn\u2019t stand there and go along with something I knew wasn\u2019t plausible. It never was; never has been.\n\n\n\nNR: Is there frustration in the House GOP about Cruz interfering with the lower chamber\u2019s affairs? We\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\n\nNUNES: Again, I don\u2019t really have anything against Cruz. I think he\u2019s a really good politician; he\u2019s an excellent politician. He\u2019s one of the best politicians I\u2019ve seen come around in a long, long time. But my issue is, we have a small group in the House who, for three years straight, have said that no matter what the leadership comes up with, they\u2019ll oppose it. That\u2019s been happening for three straight years now, and Cruz is playing into that. Now, I\u2019ve opposed the leadership several times, whether it was TARP or the fiscal cliff at the beginning of this year. I was very outspoken against those issues. But the leadership can\u2019t be wrong every time. And if they were wrong every time, then somebody would step back and pick up that leadership vacuum.\n\nWe\u2019ve essentially been at 200 to 205 votes for the whole year since you have this secret cadre of members that has been continually meeting, not to plot about how to get rid of Obamacare, not to plot about how to save this country from the leftists, but they\u2019ve been plotting on how they themselves can get power. But they simply don\u2019t have the votes.\n\n\n\nNR: So this problem for Boehner goes back, perhaps, to the coup attempt?\n\nNUNES: Even before.\n\n\n\nNR: It seems like you\u2019re frustrated with this constantly brewing civil war within the ranks. You\u2019re sick of it.\n\nNUNES: Yeah, I\u2019m sick of it. And I\u2019m sick of us not being able to get 218 votes, because every time we don\u2019t get 218 votes \u2014 every time on anything major \u2014 we lose what little leverage we have with only one half of one-third of government. So that again is just math, that\u2019s just counting votes. You can\u2019t go to the table to play a serious game of poker when you\u2019re showing all your cards to the other side. In fact, you\u2019re not even playing with cards; that\u2019s how bad it is.\n\n\n\nNR: You\u2019re a well-known conservative in the House, but the rare outspoken critic. Is there\u2019s a lot of fear on the right to speak out? That is, if you speak out, do you immediately create primary problems? Why are you a lonely voice?\n\nNUNES: Well, it\u2019s because I make this trip back and forth. I\u2019ve got three little kids at home and I\u2019m trying to save this country from itself. I\u2019m not here to play political power games and I\u2019ve had enough of people playing political power games and this has just gone on too long. Look, I wanted to have this fight, this conversation about the party\u2019s problems in the House, in January. I really thought that we needed to peel off this scab and have this fight in January when we were about ready to go off the fiscal cliff. And we ended up with higher tax rates and more spending because we couldn\u2019t hold 218 votes.\n\nAnd now, instead of talking about Obamacare, we\u2019re playing power games with each other. Think about how dumb that is: You shut down the government the same day that Obamacare is being implemented. And everybody knows this is going to be a car crash. Nobody knows if it\u2019s going to be a 100-car pileup or a 50-car pileup, but the Democrats own all the cars in the pileup. And we decided, with our small little part of government, to take our little bicycle into the path of the cars. And look what\u2019s happening to us. That\u2019s essentially what I am trying to stop.\n\nWhat we need to do is strategically strike at areas where we can build the most leverage we can with whatever cards we can take to the poker table and try to fight for this country, for the conservative movement. We need to talk about the broader debate, looking at Medicare and how to solve the debt crisis, instead of becoming obsessed with tactics for a legislative goal that, at the moment, can never happen due to math. And these guys who are blocking that kind of thoughtful policy process that gets beyond tactics, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re conservatives; they\u2019re anything but that.\n\n\n\nNR: Okay, so what are they? Who are these 30 to 50 members who seem to be dictating the House GOP\u2019s playbook?\n\nNUNES: Well, I\u2019ve already referred to them as the lemming caucus.\n\n\n\nNR: What do you mean by that?\n\nNUNES: They don\u2019t want to follow the leadership, so they just kind of follow each other and go off the cliff. And that\u2019s not even good enough for them, so when Cruz pops up, they follow him. Rand Paul pops up, they follow him. I don\u2019t want to name names here, but the day that Senator Coburn, who I\u2019ve worked with on a lot of policy issues, when you\u2019re calling Senator Coburn a RINO, somebody\u2019s on another planet. That\u2019s not believable because it\u2019s not true.\n\nNR: As this shutdown continues, what\u2019s your message to the leadership? Can they ignore the lemmings or not?\n\nNUNES: Uh, no. I think we have to continue; I think until these guys that put this strategy into effect see it play out, we won\u2019t learn our lesson. We have to let it all play out until they decide that they want to be part of a functioning majority that gives us the most leverage that we can get to fight for less government and to fix or change Obamacare, to get rid of it.

His comments have drawn notice;\u00a0some of his supporters back home are wondering\u00a0if he\u2019s a \u201csellout.\u201d\n\nNunes, though, says such talk is inane. In an interview, he tells me\u00a0his loyalty to\u00a0Boehner\u00a0and his new role as conservative provocateur are products of the growing unrest in the Republican conference, and he feels he needs to speak out for the dozens of Republicans who prefer to stay mum, even though they, like Nunes, are unhappy with how the fiscal impasse is unfolding.\n\nNATIONAL REVIEW: Why have you suddenly become such a candid figure?\u00a0You have become\u00a0very frank about what you see as a lack of strategy.\n\nDEVIN NUNES: It\u2019s important to be honest and truthful with your constituents. At the end of the day, we represent them. And from Day One several months ago, when constituents were asking me if there was a way that we could implement a strategy that get rid of Obamacare using an appropriations bill, I said \u2018No, that\u2019s not a winning strategy.\u2019\n\nAnd the simple reason is you just have to be able to count the votes. And this whole notion, that you only somehow need 51 votes in the Senate? That\u2019s not even true. And it\u2019s not even true that you need 60 votes in the Senate, because really, no one honestly believes that a guy named Obama is not going to veto a bill that gets rid of Obamacare. So, then you technically need 67 votes in the Senate and you would need 290 votes in the House, where we only have 233 votes. So this is just a simple issue of math, basic math. And I\u2019m willing to go along with the leadership because I think the way these other guys who have been opposing leadership every step of the way is just unacceptable.\n\n\nNR: When did your frustrations with Cruz\u2019s effort crystallize?\n\nNUNES: I don\u2019t have anything personal against the guy, but when all of this started, when they started airing ads on television telling my constituents and people everywhere that this was plausible, I couldn\u2019t stand there and go along with something I knew wasn\u2019t plausible. It never was;\u00a0never has been.\n\nNR: Is there frustration in the House GOP about Cruz interfering with the lower chamber\u2019s affairs? We\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\n\nNUNES: Again, I don\u2019t really have anything against Cruz. I think he\u2019s a really good politician; he\u2019s an excellent politician. He\u2019s one of the best politicians I\u2019ve seen come around in a long, long time. But my issue is, we have a small group in the House who, for three years straight, have said that no matter what the leadership comes up with, they\u2019ll oppose it. That\u2019s been happening for three straight years now, and Cruz is playing into that. Now, I\u2019ve opposed the leadership several times, whether it was TARP or the fiscal cliff at the beginning of this year. I was very outspoken against those issues. But the leadership can\u2019t be wrong every time. And if they were wrong every time, then somebody would step back and pick up that leadership vacuum.\n\nWe\u2019ve essentially been at 200 to 205 votes for the whole year since you have this secret cadre of members that has been continually meeting, not to plot about how to get rid of Obamacare, not to plot about how to save this country from the leftists, but they\u2019ve been plotting on how they themselves can get power. But they simply don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nNR: So this problem for Boehner goes back, perhaps, to the coup attempt?\n\nNUNES: Even before.\n\nNR: It seems like you\u2019re frustrated with this constantly brewing civil war within the ranks. You\u2019re sick of it.\n\nNUNES: Yeah, I\u2019m sick of it. And I\u2019m sick of us not being able to get 218 votes, because every time we don\u2019t get 218 votes \u2014 every time on anything major \u2014 we lose what little leverage we have with only one half of one-third of government. So that again is just math, that\u2019s just counting votes. You can\u2019t go to the table to play a serious game of poker when you\u2019re showing all your cards to the other side. In fact, you\u2019re not even playing with cards; that\u2019s how bad it is.\n\nNR: You\u2019re a well-known conservative in the House, but the rare outspoken critic. Is there\u2019s a lot of fear on the right to speak out? That is, if you speak out, do you immediately create primary problems? Why are you a lonely voice?\n\nNUNES: Well, it\u2019s because I make this trip back and forth. I\u2019ve got three little kids at home and I\u2019m trying to save this country from itself. I\u2019m not here to play political power games and I\u2019ve had enough of people playing political power games and this has just gone on too long. Look, I wanted to have this fight, this conversation about the party\u2019s problems in the House, in January. I really thought that we needed to\u00a0peel off this scab and have this fight in January when we were about ready to go off the fiscal cliff. And we ended up with higher tax rates and more spending because we couldn\u2019t hold 218 votes.\n\nAnd now, instead of talking about Obamacare, we\u2019re playing power games with each other. Think about how dumb that is: You shut down the government the same day that Obamacare is being implemented. And everybody knows this is going to be a car crash. Nobody knows if it\u2019s going to be a 100-car pileup or a 50-car pileup, but the Democrats own all the cars in the pileup. And we decided, with our small little part of government, to take our little bicycle into the path of the cars. And look what\u2019s happening to us. That\u2019s essentially what I am trying to stop.\n\nWhat we need to do is strategically strike at areas where we can build the most leverage we can with whatever cards we can take to the poker table and try to fight for this country, for the conservative movement. We need to talk about the broader debate, looking at Medicare and how to solve the debt crisis, instead of becoming obsessed with tactics for a legislative goal that, at the moment, can never happen due to math. And these guys who are blocking that kind of thoughtful policy process that gets beyond tactics, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re conservatives; they\u2019re anything but that.\n\nNR: Okay, so what are they? Who are these 30 to 50 members who seem to be dictating the House GOP\u2019s playbook?\n\nNUNES: Well, I\u2019ve already referred to them as the lemming caucus.\n\nNR: \u00a0What do you mean by that?\n\nNUNES: They don\u2019t want to follow the leadership, so they just kind of follow each other and go off the cliff. And that\u2019s not even good enough for them, so when Cruz pops up, they follow him. Rand Paul pops up, they follow him. I don\u2019t want to name names here, but the day that Senator Coburn, who I\u2019ve worked with on a lot of policy issues, when you\u2019re calling Senator Coburn a RINO, somebody\u2019s on another planet. That\u2019s not believable because it\u2019s not true.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNR: \u00a0As this shutdown continues, what\u2019s your message to the leadership? Can they ignore the lemmings or not?\n\nNUNES: Uh, no. I think we have to continue; I think until these guys that put this strategy into effect see it play out, we won\u2019t learn our lesson. We have to let it all play out until they decide that they want to be part of a functioning majority that gives us the most leverage that we can get to fight for less government and to fix or change Obamacare, to get rid of it. But you can\u2019t do any of it with the way we\u2019re doing it now.", "card": "summary", "title": "Devin Nunes, Provocateur, by Robert Costa, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Mon, 2013-10-07 14:28", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Devin Nunes, Provocateur", "keywords": "Robert Costa", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Devin Nunes, Provocateur, Robert Costa, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Robert Costa, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd21\"", "article_summary": "NATIONAL REVIEW: Why have you suddenly become such a candid figure?\nAnd these guys who are blocking that kind of thoughtful policy process that gets beyond tactics, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re conservatives; they\u2019re anything but that.\nSo, then you technically need 67 votes in the Senate and you would need 290 votes in the House, where we only have 233 votes.\nAnd this whole notion, that you only somehow need 51 votes in the Senate?\nNow, I\u2019ve opposed the leadership several times, whether it was TARP or the fiscal cliff at the beginning of this year."}
