L.A. Animal Services cares for approximately 64,000 lost and abandoned animals throughout the year at six shelter facilities located throughout Los Angeles. Along with trying to re-unite lost pets with their owners, L.A. Animal Services holds adoption events and responds to all types of emergency calls related to animals, including reports of animal cruelty and dangerous animals. We also enforce animal laws and codes and responds to other animal related complaints, issues dog licenses and provides micro chipping services, plus vouchers for low cost spay and neuter.

We are looking for volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of the abandoned and orphan animals in our care. We need friendly, outgoing and personable volunteers to assist the public and work with the staff in our Animal Shelters and at off-site adoption events. To volunteer, click here.
