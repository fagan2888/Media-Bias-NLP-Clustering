Regardless, Thunder head coach Billy Donovan said he doesn't plan on resting any starters in the game, so it should be a tune-up contest for OKC as they try to click on all cylinders heading into the postseason.\n\nSteve will be tweeting updates throughout the game, so keep checking in to ensure you won't miss out on any of the action.\n\nRelated: Thunder vs. Nuggets Preview\n\nGame Over!
