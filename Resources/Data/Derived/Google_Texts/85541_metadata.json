Advocates on both sides of the issue describe the wave of changes as unprecedented.\u201d\n\nAlso affirming the success of the pro-life movement is Elizabeth Nash of the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\u201cAbortion access has changed dramatically,\u201d said Nash, who referred to the current Supreme Court as \u201cmuch more hostile.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe debate at the federal level affected what happened at the state level, and accessing abortion is much more difficult in 2014 than it was in 2009,\u201d she said.\n\nKliff views the high court\u2019s decision to strike down a Massachusetts law that created a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics, and its ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, whereby individuals do not lose their religious freedom when they open a family business, as further evidence of pro-life victories.\n\n\u201cEver since Roe v. Wade found a legal right to abortion in 1973, the United States has had a strong pro-life movement that has pursued more stringent abortion regulations,\u201d writes Kliff. \u201cIn the 1980s and 1990s, states pioneered spousal notification laws and 24-hour waiting periods prior to abortions.\u201d\n\nObserving events that helped drive the pro-life movement, Kliff identifies the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which fired up a national debate about abortion and its coverage in health insurance plans, and, six months later, the 2010 mid-term elections, which gave Republicans control of the House and a majority of governorships, as pivotal.\n\nKliff notes the frustration pro-life organizations experienced with the so-called Obamacare \u201ccompromise\u201d in which it was agreed health insurance plans would cover abortions but be prohibited from using taxpayer funds to pay for the procedures.\n\nCharmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life, agrees Obamacare was the turning point.\n\n\u201cThe frustration level with all the back-room dealing that lead to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage was high,\u201d Yoest said. \u201cThere was a real sense of betrayal and a sense that the system was broken, so I think that was rocket fuel for us.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that Barack Obama was an ardent supporter of abortion, the pro-life movement took its message to the states and the courts.\n\nKliff observes that between 2011 and 2013 an unprecedented 205 abortion restrictions were passed in the states, \u201cmore than the entire 30 years prior.\u201d According to national pro-life organization Operation Rescue, 87 facilities ceased performing surgical abortions in 2013 alone.\n\nIn addition, new state laws that require abortionists to have admitting privileges at local hospitals are seen by pro-choice advocates as \u201ca backdoor way of driving clinics out of business if the local hospital refuses to provide the necessary admitting privilege,\u201d writes Kliff.\n\n\u201cOver the last three years we\u2019ve been involved in over 70 pieces of legislation that have come to passage,\u201d Yoest said. \u201cIt\u2019s really broad-based and, when you look at the clinic regulations and some other things, it doesn\u2019t all come back to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nKliff writes that the pro-life movement has also succeeded in \u201ctargeting birth control funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2011, New Hampshire cut its family planning budget by 57 percent and Texas reduced spending by two thirds,\u201d she explains. \u201cMontana killed funding for family planning altogether.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, she states, \u201cEven with the Hobby Lobby decision, Obamacare will still expand no-cost birth control to millions of women with health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nKliff notes that though states have not passed as much pro-life legislation this year, advocates for life are continuing their work following three years of success.\n\n\u201cWe think [the Hobby Lobby decision] gives us a stronger legal foundation moving forward on defending conscience rights,\u201d Yoest said. \u201cThis year was an off year at the state level, but there\u2019s still a lot more room to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The left-wing online publication Vox finds the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Hobby Lobby case to be part of a", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The left-wing online publication Vox finds the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Hobby Lobby case to be part of a", "title": "Vox: Pro-Life Movement Winning -
