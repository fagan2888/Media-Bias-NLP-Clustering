A mild winter has allowed fleas and ticks to potentially have a population growth larger than normal this year.

Some people and veterinarians have already seen flea and tick problems.

"I've seen a couple of ticks being attached to some pets and even some fleas on pets over the winter, where usually, they all get killed off," said Veterinarian Vanessa Emming of Indian Hills Animal Clinics.

Emming says that people can look for fleas and ticks on their pets by coming their hair and parting it so the skin is visible.

She also said that when pets are bathed and the water develops a rusty tint, that is a sign of fleas.

There are several options for treating fleas and ticks.

Many topical medications can be purchased through retail stores. Oral medications usually require a veterinarian to write a prescription.

Fleas and ticks can transmit disease and intestinal parasites which is one reason to prevent them from attaching to pets.
