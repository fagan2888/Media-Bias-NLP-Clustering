A loophole allowed plates that were already in the application process to continue forward.\n\nDespite the moratorium, which doesn\u2019t end till July, a \u201cFallen Law Enforcement Officers\u201d plate (SB 132) has cleared three committees unanimously this session. Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, is sponsoring the bill.\n\nSen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, voted in favor of the plate. But that was after throwing up her hands in frustration at a recent meeting in the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI was here when the moratorium was established and every year, we fought it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m giving up now \u2026 I\u2019m throwing in the towel.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019ll support future requests, but also expressed a frustration that many have with the plates\u2019 proliferation: \u201cI look at them as I\u2019m driving and say, \u2018That can\u2019t be a Florida plate.\u2019\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement has complained for years that the increase in and diverse design of specialty plates makes it difficult for officers and crime witnesses to quickly identify a Florida vehicle.\n\nAmy Mercer, executive director of the Florida Police Chiefs Association, says the organization hasn\u2019t taken a position on individual plates.\n\n\u201cIn the past, though, the chiefs have had concerns with the high number of plates and I\u2019m not aware of any change in that position,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same time, specialty plate fans say there wouldn\u2019t be so many if they weren\u2019t so popular with motorists.\n\nSpecialty plates cost $15 to $25 a year above the standard registration fee.\n\nIn 2013, more than 137,000 specialty tags were sold and 1.2 million were renewed, creating revenue of nearly $34 million, according to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe money the tags generate goes to charities, such as the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, that are affiliated with the plate\u2019s themes.\n\n\u201cThe tag has been absolutely incredible for us,\u201d said Ron Hosler, program administrator, referring to the Estuary Program\u2019s \u201cTarpon\u201d tag.\n\nIt\u2019s made $1.5 million for the organization since 2001, including about $120,000 last year.\n\nThe money funds the program\u2019s \u201cbay minigrants,\u201d in which successful applicants get up to $5,000 for proposals that benefit the estuary, Hosler said.\n\nLawmakers also required groups that proposed a new specialty plate to \u201cpre-sell\u201d 1,000 of them in a two-year period before they would be manufactured.\n\nRecently, a Senate panel OK\u2019d an exception, granting extensions to the Hispanic Achievers and St. John\u2019s River plates to meet their sales goals.\n\nMiami Democrat Gwen Margolis, a former Senate president, disagreed with that show of leniency.\n\n\u201cWe got a little unnerved by all these license plates being on the street and we said there has to be a certain amount of pre-sales,\u201d she said. Now, \u201cif everybody thinks we should start to make a bunch of license plates again, amen.\n\n\u201cBut I think we\u2019re wasting a lot of energy on license plates. \u2026 We tightened it down and now we seem to be untightening it more and more,\u201d Margolis added.\n\nThe Legislature approved the first specialty plate in 1986 to honor astronauts killed aboard space shuttle Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff earlier that year.\n\nThe list of specialty tags now includes the \u201cImagine\u201d plate honoring musician John Lennon, \u201cStop Heart Disease\u201d and \u201cSupport Soccer,\u201d to name a few.\n\nSome proposed but unapproved plates have caused division over the last few years.\n\nA \u201cConfederate Heritage\u201d license plate, with a Confederate flag logo, would have funded graveyard maintenance and educational programs run by the Sons of Confederate Veterans.\n\nAnd former Sen. Gary Siplin, an Orlando Democrat, proposed an \u201cTrinity\u201d tag, originally envisioned with an image of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe state must discontinue a specialty license plate if its sales numbers fall below 1,000 plates for 12 consecutive months.\n\nOnly seven plates have been discontinued, according to records. They include a tag for the Tampa Bay Storm, which did not maintain the sales requirement. It stopped in January 2002.\n\nStill, if the Senate is any indication, specialty tag measures will continue to arise next year.\n\nAt a recent meeting, Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, joked that if Latvala\u2019s bill passes, he has \u201cthree or four\u201d new plates he wants to propose.\n\nThat had Sen. Greg Evers, R-Baker, piling on, saying he too had ideas for specialty tags.\n\n\u201cHey, more is better,\u201d Evers said.\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 13 Apr 2014 14:06:14 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Some rules in the capital are made to be broken, including one that said \u201cenough\u201d to the ever-growing number of Florida\u2019s specialty license plates.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Some rules in the capital are made to be broken, including one that said \u201cenough\u201d to the ever-growing number of Florida\u2019s specialty license plates.", "title": "Does Florida have too many specialty license plates?", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/does-florida-have-too-many-specialty-license-plates-20140413/", "image": {"width": 505, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140413/ARTICLE/140419664/AR/0/AR-140419664.jpg", "height": 284}, "updated_time": "2014-04-14T07:04:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Some rules in the capital are made to be broken, including one that said \u201cenough\u201d to the ever-growing number of Florida\u2019s specialty license plates.", "title": "Does Florida have too many specialty license plates?", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140413/ARTICLE/140419664/AR/0/AR-140419664.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-04-13T14:06:14Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T07:04:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5dd\"", "article_summary": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Some rules in the capital are made to be broken, including one that said \u201cenough\u201d to the ever-growing number of Florida\u2019s specialty license plates.\nThe state must discontinue a specialty license plate if its sales numbers fall below 1,000 plates for 12 consecutive months.\nThese are the best-selling specialty plates in Florida.\nNow, \u201cif everybody thinks we should start to make a bunch of license plates again, amen.\nSpecialty plates cost $15 to $25 a year above the standard registration fee."}
