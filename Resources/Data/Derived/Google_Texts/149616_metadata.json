European Pressphoto Agency\n\nStarbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world\u2019s largest coffee-growing countries.\n\nThe store at the corner of Hang Bai Street and Ly Thuong Kiet Street\u2013one of the busiest business corners in Hanoi\u2013is the first of the three outlets the coffee chain plans to open in the city this month. Starbucks entered Vietnam in February last year with its first stores in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\u2019s economic hub. It now has eight outlets there.\n\n\u201cWe look at Vietnam and we see so much potential. It\u2019s such a vibrant and exciting market,\u201d said Jeff Hansberry, president of Starbucks China and Asia Pacific, who was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear and city officials for the Hanoi store\u2019s grand opening.\n\nStarbucks will face competition from Vietnamese coffee shops, which are found throughout the city. As the Seattle-based company celebrated the opening of its first store in Hanoi, Phuong Linh, a Vietnamese coffee shop just a few steps away, was full of customers.\n\n\u201cI prefer Vietnamese coffee because it is stronger,\u201d said 35-year-old taxi driver Tran Duc Minh. \u201cVietnamese coffee is cheaper and is the real stuff for coffee addicts,\u201d he said.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 coffee will be priced slightly higher than most of its local competitors with prices ranging from 35,000 dong to 105,000 dong ($1.65 to about $5) a cup, depending on the drink size. A cup of traditional Vietnamese coffee at a local cafe generally costs about 20,000 dong, or less than $1.\n\nRead the full story at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Starbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world's largest coffee-growing countries.", "title": "Starbucks Expands in Vietnam With First Hanoi Store", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/24/starbucks-expands-in-vietnam-with-first-hanoi-store/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DU648_vietsb_P_20140723074836.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Starbucks Expands in Vietnam With First Hanoi Store", "description": "Starbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world's largest coffee-growing countries.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Vu Trong Khanh", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Starbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world's largest coffee-growing countries.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-24T18:43:58-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/24/starbucks-expands-in-vietnam-with-first-hanoi-store/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-976", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Starbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world's largest coffee-growing countries.", "title": "Starbucks Expands in Vietnam With First Hanoi Store", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/07/24/starbucks-expands-in-vietnam-with-first-hanoi-store/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DU648_vietsb_P_20140723074836.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-976", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-24T18:43:58-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Customers line up to order drinks during the opening of the first Starbucks in Hanoi, Vietnam.\nEuropean Pressphoto AgencyStarbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world\u2019s largest coffee-growing countries.\nAmbassador to Vietnam David Shear and city officials for the Hanoi store\u2019s grand opening.\nStarbucks entered Vietnam in February last year with its first stores in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\u2019s economic hub.\nAs the Seattle-based company celebrated the opening of its first store in Hanoi, Phuong Linh, a Vietnamese coffee shop just a few steps away, was full of customers."}
