Melissa Davenport, a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient, argues that sex toys saved her marriage of 24 years; she says that without them, her sex life may have been completely destroyed after the onset of her illness.\n\nHer lawsuit claims that multiple sclerosis, which impairs the central nervous system, also hampered her sex life, leaving her unable to enjoy it with her husband. \u201cIt had started to really tear us apart,\u201d 44-year-old Davenport told Atlanta\u2019s WSB TV. \u201cThe nerve pathways interfered with the nerves going to my intimate area to where I had no feeling.\u201d Despite this, no physicians would write her a prescription for sex toys. \u201cThey have this dirty mind about how people are going to use it,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nThe ordinance bans the sale of sex toys to anyone who lacks a \u201cmedical, scientific, educational, legislative, or law enforcement\u201d purpose. Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, an artist who uses sex toys in his work, claims that his career and artwork have suffered because he\u2019s unable to purchase sex devices. Meanwhile, Gerry Weber, the attorney filing the lawsuit, argues that the ordinance is a violation of right to privacy \u2014 claiming that people should be able to decide for themselves whether sex toys assist their sexual lives. \u201c[T]he government has no business being (in) the bedroom and second guessing that decision,\u201d Weber told WSB.\n\n\u201cPeople really do need devices because they need it for health reasons and to have a healthy intimate life with their spouse,\u201d Davenport said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sex devices, sex toy ban, melissa davenport, ms", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A woman claims that sex toys saved her marriage and improved her health, and is now suing a Georgia city that banned them.", "title": "Georgia Woman Sues City Over Banned Sex Toys; Says They Saved Her Health [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/georgia-woman-sues-city-over-banned-sex-toy-law-says-they-saved-her-marriage-283204", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/melissa-davenport.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A woman claims that sex toys saved her marriage and improved her health, and is now suing a Georgia city that banned them.", "title": "Georgia Woman Sues City Over Banned Sex Toys; Says They Saved Her Health [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/georgia-woman-sues-city-over-banned-sex-toy-law-says-they-saved-her-marriage-283204", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/melissa-davenport.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/17/melissa-davenport.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-17T17:26:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T17:26:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A woman claims that sex toys saved her marriage and improved her health, and is now suing a Georgia city that banned them."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10f0\"", "article_summary": "A Georgia woman is suing the city of Sandy Springs over a 2009 ordinance that requires people to have a prescription in order to purchase sex toys.\nThe ordinance bans the sale of sex toys to anyone who lacks a \u201cmedical, scientific, educational, legislative, or law enforcement\u201d purpose.\n\u201c[T]he government has no business being (in) the bedroom and second guessing that decision,\u201d Weber told WSB.\n\u201cIt had started to really tear us apart,\u201d 44-year-old Davenport told Atlanta\u2019s WSB TV.\nMelissa Davenport, a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient, argues that sex toys saved her marriage of 24 years; she says that without them, her sex life may have been completely destroyed after the onset of her illness."}
