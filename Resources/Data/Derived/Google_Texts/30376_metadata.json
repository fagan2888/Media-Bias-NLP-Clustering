She just wants to do it under the radar.\n\nClinton says that, if elected, she will once again push for a \u201cpublic option\u201d in the ObamaCare exchanges. That is, a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers. She\u2019s selling it as a way to \u201creduce costs and broaden the choices of insurance coverage for every American.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that entire purpose of the \u201cpublic option\u201d was to drive the health care system toward single payer.\n\nAs Mark Schmitt explained in the liberal American Prospect, Democratic pollsters warned party leaders in 2008 that the public wouldn\u2019t accept an outright government takeover of health care. With a frontal attack off the table, Democrats would have to get it done another way. And voila, the public option was born.\n\n\u201cThe public option was part of a carefully thought out and deliberately funded effort,\u201d Schmitt said, to convince the single-payer crowd that \u201cthey could live with the public option as a kind of stealth single-payer.\u201d\n\nThe idea was that most people would end up choosing the cheaper public option over private insurance until it became dominant and private health insurance \u201cbegins to wither away,\u201d as one advocate put it.\n\nTry as he might, however, President Obama couldn\u2019t convince enough of his fellow Democrats to fall for the ruse, and the public option died.\n\nBut if Hillary gets elected, she\u2019d likely have a much better chance of adding the public option to ObamaCare, for the simple reason that the ObamaCare exchanges are starting to fail, as private insurers jack up premiums and raise deductibles to keep up with its costs.\n\nCome 2017, the public option might look like the only way to salvage the law she\u2019s vowed to protect.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2016-02-24 14:23:11:-08:00", "description": "Health Reform: The Clinton campaign is bashing Bernie Sanders\u2019 massive single-payer \"Medicare for all.\" But she recently made it clear that she too plans to", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Health Reform: The Clinton campaign is bashing Bernie Sanders\u2019 massive single-payer \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But she recently made it clear that she too plans to push the country to a single\u2026", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Stealth Plan For Single-Payer Health Care", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/hillary-clintons-stealth-plan-for-single-payer-health-care/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EDIT2-health-022516-newscom.jpg", "height": 563}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EDIT2-health-022516-newscom.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDeditorials"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "hillary clinton,bernie sanders,hillary clinton health care,democrats push for single payer,public option in obamacare,election 2016,obamacare", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-24T22:23:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-24T22:23:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Her updated health care page tips her hand, showing that she wants to get to the same place as Sanders.\nTry as he might, however, President Obama couldn\u2019t convince enough of his fellow Democrats to fall for the ruse, and the public option died.\nCome 2017, the public option might look like the only way to salvage the law she\u2019s vowed to protect.\nClinton says that, if elected, she will once again push for a \u201cpublic option\u201d in the ObamaCare exchanges.\nAs Mark Schmitt explained in the liberal American Prospect, Democratic pollsters warned party leaders in 2008 that the public wouldn\u2019t accept an outright government takeover of health care."}
