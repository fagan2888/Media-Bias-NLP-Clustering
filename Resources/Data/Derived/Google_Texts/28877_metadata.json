(AP) - Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he would seal the U.S.-Mexico border by cutting all benefits that he says attracts illegal immigration.\n\nCarson made the comments to reporters Sunday after he and his wife spent the day campaigning in southern Nevada. He spoke at a friendly Evangelical church service in Las Vegas and then at an afternoon rally in nearby Henderson.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon, who had appeared in Arizona on Saturday, pointed to the efforts in state in Yuma County in proposing how he would try to secure the border. He again said it could be done easily in a year and suggested prosecuting all first-time offenders, installing a double fence and using technology-driven surveillance to cut down on the percentage of illegal crossings.\n\n\u201cYou can pretty much get it to 100 percent,\u201d he said of his proposal.\n\nCarson also said that eliminating \u201cany kind of benefit that a person who is illegal could get\u201d would be key to cutting the perception of incentives. He didn\u2019t name any specific benefits, but said that without them, \u201cyou won\u2019t have anybody even trying to do this.\u201d\n\nThose in the U.S. without a problematic record would be given a six month period to register and pay a tax penalty. They would have to pay taxes going forward by taking jobs as guest workers, but it wouldn\u2019t amount to citizenship or voting rights.\n\nHe also rejected the idea of accepting Syrian refugees into the U.S. on the grounds that it would threaten national security. Carson instead said he would support offering resources and diplomacy to help them stay settled or resettle in their own country.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that we should be bringing them here. And the reason I don\u2019t think we should bring them here is because it would be too easy to embed with them, within them, those who were members of the jihadists groups who would be interested in wreaking havoc in this country. There\u2019s no reason we should be facilitating such a thing,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson is returning to Nevada next week as keynote speaker at the Gift of Life Banquet, a fundraiser for the First Choice Pregnancy Services center in Las Vegas. He is scheduled for the event starting with a meet and greet at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino at 6 p.m. on Nov. 23.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he would seal the U.S.-Mexico border by cutting all benefits that he says attracts illegal immigration.", "Author": "SALLY HO", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/15/ben-carson-cut-illegal-immigration-by-cutting-bene/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he would seal the U.S.-Mexico border by cutting all benefits that he says attracts illegal immigration.", "title": "Ben Carson: Cut illegal immigration by cutting benefits"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ben Carson: Cut illegal immigration by cutting benefits", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he would seal the U.S.-Mexico border by cutting all benefits that he says attracts illegal immigration.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "HENDERSON, Nev.
