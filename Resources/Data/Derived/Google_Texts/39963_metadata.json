Saint Laurent\u2019s Hedi Slimane has been criticized, chewed up and thrown out a hundred times.\n\nThe Franco-Tunisian designer courted controversy first in 2012 amid accusations he threw out the precious YSL heritage in his debut collection for the revered Parisian house by going punk and dropping \u201cYves\u201d from the house name.\n\nYet the styles that fashion critics, including this one, lambasted him for \u2014 glam rock, grungy, punk, teddy boy, and uber-skinny styles \u2014 are now ubiquitous on the catwalk. As they are on the street. The house is apparently financially buoyant.\n\nThis fall-winter season, it\u2019s common to hear the phrase: \u201cThat\u2019s quite Hedi Slimane.\u201d\n\nTo quote Liberace, the once-wronged 46-year-old is now probably laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nSAINT LAURENT\u2019S BACK TO BLACK WITH A FRENCH TWIST\n\nIf the mantra \u201cthin is in\u201d applied to previous Saint Laurent shows, this new collection might be called \u201cthinner is inner.\u201d\n\nExtra-uber-skinny retro pants stood out in a collection that featured starved-looking women as well as men.\n\nSlimane carried on his \u201970s musing in suits with peaked lapels, winklepicker shoes, glam-rock fur \u201cfun\u201d coats and punk rock leopard-print sweaters with skinny black jeans that might have been worn by Sex Pistols star John Lydon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salma Hayek leads Saint Laurent menswear finale", "title": "Salma Hayek leads Saint Laurent menswear finale", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salma Hayek leads Saint Laurent menswear finale", "title": "Salma Hayek leads Saint Laurent menswear finale", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/26/salma_hayek_leads_saint_laurent_menswear_finale/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/paris-fashion-saint-laurent.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salma Hayek leads Saint Laurent menswear finale", "title": "Salma Hayek leads Saint Laurent menswear finale", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/paris-fashion-saint-laurent.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Adamson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf99\"", "article_summary": "Here are the highlights of Sunday\u2019s fall-winter menswear 2015 shows, including show reports from Paul Smith, Lanvin and Saint Laurent.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPARIS (AP) \u2014 Fashion royalty Salma Hayek \u2014 the Academy Award-nominated wife of the luxury heir Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault \u2014 led the front row pack at Saint Laurent, the highlight of the Paris menswear shows on Sunday.\nThe Saint Laurent collection \u2014 the final show on the final day of menswear \u2014 posed a serious question: Has controversial designer Hedi Slimane, who everyone loves to hate and hates to love, finally been vindicated?\nSAINT LAURENT\u2019S BACK TO BLACK WITH A FRENCH TWISTIf the mantra \u201cthin is in\u201d applied to previous Saint Laurent shows, this new collection might be called \u201cthinner is inner.\u201dExtra-uber-skinny retro pants stood out in a collection that featured starved-looking women as well as men.\nSaint Laurent\u2019s Hedi Slimane has been criticized, chewed up and thrown out a hundred times."}
