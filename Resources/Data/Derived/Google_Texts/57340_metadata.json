The proposal was rejected at the party\u2019s convention in early May, after the vast majority of Republicans in the state Assembly opposed it as \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201ca distraction.\u201d\n\nThe state Democratic Party, meanwhile, made headlines because its proposed 2014 platform called for legalizing marijuana and gay marriage. Both planks, which the party approved at its convention in early June, were actually golden oldies, having also passed in the party\u2019s 2012 platform.\n\nJoe Heim, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, says platforms often reflect the positions of a party\u2019s most ardent members: \u201cPeople who go to conventions tend to be a little more doctrinaire, a little more vested.\u201d Other delegates may \u201cgo along with some of the more unusual if not extreme proposals in the interest of maintaining party unity.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Heim says, these documents have not been taken too seriously, especially at the state level. But he suspects that is changing, as evidenced by the statement in the Democrats\u2019 platform that says candidates are expected to support these ideas and, if elected, work to bring them about.\n\nThe platforms and resolutions from Wisconsin\u2019s two parties convey vastly divergent political visions. If they serve as marching orders, they would take the state in profoundly different directions.\n\nAfter warning darkly of national developments that portend \u201cthe moral and economic collapse of our nation,\u201d the approved platform for the state Republican Party gets specific. It calls for, among other things, \u201cthe development of free market energy resources and the elimination of the Department of Energy\u201d and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u201cin favor of free market solutions.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 platform for the state Democratic Party, meanwhile, decries \u201cobstacles to voting,\u201d particularly to minorities, senior citizens and the poor. It champions nonpartisan redistricting, a constitutional amendment declaring that money is not speech, effective alternatives to incarceration, \u201caggressive action\u201d to address climate change, and farming systems that are \u201chumane to animals.\u201d\n\nThe GOP platform, citing the \u201ctyranny and suffering that can be imposed upon a disarmed and vulnerable people,\u201d opposes all efforts to require gun registration or restrict the ownership, manufacture, transfer, carrying or sale of firearms or ammunition. The party also backs constitutional carry \u2014 the ability to pack concealed weapons without any sort of state license.\n\nDemocrats, in their platform, beg to differ: \u201cWe support the right to hunt, to bear arms, a concealed carry ban, background checks on all gun sales, banning the sale of assault weapons, and limits on the size of magazines.\u201d\n\nAccording to the GOP, a person\u2019s natural rights \u201cbegin at conception and continue until death.\u201d The Democrats say: \u201cWe believe in freedom of reproductive choice, family planning, and the individual\u2019s right to choose death with dignity including physician\u2010assisted end\u2010of\u2010life.\u201d\n\nBesides platforms, both parties passed resolutions calling for specific initiatives. The Democrats posted these online immediately after their convention. Among them were resolutions to hike the minimum wage, ease the burden of student loans, and increase local control over frac sand mines.\n\nThe state Republican Party posted its approved platform in early June, a month after its convention. Its resolutions were not posted until June 16, more than six weeks after passage \u2014 prompting Heim to speculate that the party wanted to avoid calling attention \u201cto some resolutions that may not sit well with the general public.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s 2014 resolutions declare that \u201cmarriage between a man and a woman is the best environment to raise children and to teach them the values and morals required to maintain a free society.\u201d It also calls for cutting all state and federal tax money to Planned Parenthood, eliminating Common Core education standards, enacting Right-to-Work legislation, passing a new voter ID law and abolishing the state Government Accountability Board.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The platforms and resolutions from Wisconsin\u2019s two parties convey vastly divergent political visions.
