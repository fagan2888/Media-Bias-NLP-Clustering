The Fab Faux, contrastingly, are not interested in nostalgia \u2013 they are a musical ensemble, and, unlike any other Beatles recreation that I have seen, they play the Beatles canon like it was, well, music. They don\u2019t dress up in Beatles outfits or don fake mustaches and Sgt. Pepper suits \u2013 no more than Leonard Bernstein felt compelled to wear a powdered wig when he conducted Mozart. They don\u2019t address the crowd in faux-Liverpuddlian accents, no more than Wynton Marsalis feels the need to go around saying \u201clove you madly\u201d whenever he plays the music of Duke Ellington with the Jazz at Lincoln Orchestra.\n\nThe rather humorously named Fab Faux, which actually consists of five musicians; founder and bassist Will Lee, drummer Rich Pagano, and Jimmy Vivino,\n\nFrank Agnello, and Jack Petruzzelli on a battery of guitars and keyboards. The point is to get the music exactly, precisely right. Not just to play the Lennon-McCartney (and, in the case of the concert at The Beacon Theatre, Harrison) chord changes, but to play the exact voicings of those chords and the proper inversions. Although the Beacon Theatre concert will spotlight the contributions to the group of George Harrison (in honor of what would have been the guitarist\u2019s 70th birthday), one of the band\u2019s usual strategies is to recreate an entire Beatles album from start to finish, including that music from the second half of the 1960s which the Beatles themselves never even attempted to play live. (They\u2019re also playing at the Chicago Theater in Chicago on Saturday, November 9, and at the State Theater in New Brunswick on Novemer 23.)\n\nAnother factor that also makes the Faux unique is the additional musicians beyond the basic two guitars, bass, and drums; much of the Beatles\u2019 most memorable music involved instruments other than guitars, keyboards and drums (famously the string quartet behind Paul McCartney on \u201cYesterday\u201d) and most Beatles tribute bands will simply take care of this with a synthesizer \u2013 that\u2019s the way they did it on Broadway in \u201cLet It Be.\u201d The Fab Faux however makes a point of using an actual acoustic string section and real horns, not a digital simulation, sometimes there are as many as ten musicians on stage \u2013 there\u2019s even a piccolo trumpet on \u201cPenny Lane.\u201d (To date, I\u2019ve only heard a piccolo trumpet played twice in all my concert-going experience, \u201cPenny Lane\u201d by the Fab Faux and once as played by Jon Faddis in Leonard Bernstein\u2019s \u201cGlitter and Be Gay,\u201d simulating a stratospheric soprano.)\n\nThe overall effect of this so-called \u201ctribute band\u201d is to underscore the uniqueness of the achievement of the original Fab Four: among other things, they were the first to combine every step in the music-making process into a single seamless result: composing melodies, writing lyrics, arrangements, vocal and instrumental performance, the recording process \u2013 the classical music scholar Edward Green has compared the totality of their output to that of Wagner\u2019s gesamtkunstwerk (of course, today that would be gesamtkunst-twerk).\n\nThere\u2019s a story out there, quite probably apocryphal, that concerns \u201cBeatlemania,\u201d the first major Beatles recreation show, which played Broadway from 1977-1979, when John Lennon was living in Manhattan. Supposedly Lennon himself was in Times Square when he happened to run smack into the actor who was playing him at the Palace, in full costume, enjoying a smoke in between acts. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy even being a fake Beatle, is it?\u201d Lennon asked \u201cLennon.\u201d No matter, it\u2019s worth the effort. This is the best the music has sounded in over 40 years. So, if you\u2019re looking for a sentimental journey down memory lane, look elsewhere. As far as the Fab Faux are concerned, it\u2019s all about the music, man.\n\nThe Fab Faux\n\nThe Beacon Theatre\n\n\n\nNew York, N.Y.\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n[Correction: An earlier edition of this post said the Fab Faux were performing at Radio City.
