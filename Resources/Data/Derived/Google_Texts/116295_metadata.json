He is accused of handing classified material to New York Times reporter James Risen detailing the CIA\u2019s covert Operation Merlin, which was carried out under the administration of former President Bill Clinton to give Iranian government false information about nuclear technology in order to delay its alleged nuclear weapons program.\n\nRisen criticized the operation as reckless and dangerous, arguing that it accelerated\u2014rather than discouraged\u2014nuclear proliferation.\n\nSterling has maintained his innocence, and Reporters Without Borders notes that \u201cthe evidence that formed the basis of his conviction consisted only of multiple emails and telephone conversations between the two men, without any content to directly prove Sterling was the source.\u201d\n\nSterling, meanwhile, has long been heralded as a whistleblower by his supporters because he raised concerns about Operation Merlin by going through formal channels and informing the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \u201cHe had grave concerns about mismanagement of the program and potential harm to our country,\u201d Holly wrote. \u201cThis was a legal and proper channel for agency employees to voice any such concerns.\u201d\n\nYet it was on the grounds of this advocacy that he was suspected as Risen\u2019s source.\n\n\u201cEven worse,\u201d former CIA analyst and whistleblower John Kiriakou noted in a piece published in May, \u201cthe feds claimed that Sterling, who is black, did it out of resentment over a failed racial discrimination lawsuit against the agency\u2014in effect using Sterling\u2019s willingness to stand up for his rights against him.\u201d\n\nMany have argued that the Department of Justice has sought to make an example of Sterling, as part of the Obama administration\u2019s larger war on whistleblowers. Meanwhile, high-ranking government officials like retired general David Petraeus have received far less severe consequences for their confirmed leaks of classified information.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain the obvious disparate treatment of General Petraeus?\u201d Holly Sterling wrote to the president. \u201cIf one strips away the race, financial status, and political clout of Jeffrey and Mr. Petraeus and solely reviewed the alleged crimes of Jeffrey and those pled by the general, it is glaringly obvious this was selective prosecution and sentencing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey already had the machine geared up against me,\u201d said Sterling in a documentaryreleased earlier this year. \u201cThe moment that they felt there was a leak, every finger pointed at Jeffery Sterling.\u201d\n\nSterling is currently imprisoned in Littleton, Colorado\u2014900 miles from his wife and family in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cWife of Imprisoned CIA Whistleblower Looks to Obama for Pardon\u201d is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Does the government have no shame in destroying one man's life?\" asked Holly Sterling, wife of CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Sterling., Barack Obama, CIA, Iran, Jeffrey Sterling, Whistleblowers,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\"Does the government have no shame in destroying one man's life?\" asked Holly Sterling, wife of CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Sterling., Barack Obama, CIA, Iran, Jeffrey Sterling, Whistleblowers,", "title": "CIA Whistleblower's Wife Seeks Pardon From Obama", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wife-of-imprisoned-cia-whistleblower-looks-to-obama-for-pardon/210432/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cia_sterling-800x419.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-16T12:04:33-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Does the government have no shame in destroying one man's life?\" asked Holly Sterling, wife of CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Sterling., Barack Obama, CIA, Iran, Jeffrey Sterling, Whistleblowers,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cia_sterling.jpg", "title": "CIA Whistleblower's Wife Seeks Pardon From Obama", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Whistleblowers", "published_time": "2015-10-17T05:00:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-16T12:04:33-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcceda\"", "article_summary": "asked Holly Sterling, wife of CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Sterling.\n\u201cWife of Imprisoned CIA Whistleblower Looks to Obama for Pardon\u201d is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License\nWife Of Imprisoned CIA Whistleblower Looks To Obama For Pardon\"Does the government have no shame in destroying one man's life?\"\n\u201cHow do you explain the obvious disparate treatment of General Petraeus?\u201d Holly Sterling wrote to the president.\nThe wife of former CIA analyst Jeffrey Sterling on Thursday publicly called on U.S. President Barack Obama to pardon her husband\u2014who has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for, in her words, blowing the whistle and standing up for his rights."}
