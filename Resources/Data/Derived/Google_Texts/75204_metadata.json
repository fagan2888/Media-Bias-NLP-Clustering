He finished his bachelor\u2019s degree in history at UC Davis and his master\u2019s in educational policy and leadership from Sac State. He landed his first job in the field of education in 1996 as a teacher at La Entrada Continuation High School. He has worked as a teacher, after school coordinator, vice principal and principal in Elk Grove Unified School District.\n\nAfter returning for a while to San Juan\u2019s district office, where he worked as interim chief academic officer and oversaw all of that district\u2019s academic programs from preschool through adult education, he has moved to the helm of Roseville\u2019s largest elementary school district. His three-year contract, which started July 1, offers a $160,490 starting salary.\n\nGarcia joined the Press Tribune for a Q&A last week to discuss his thoughts and impressions of Roseville\u2019s elementary schools so far.\n\nHow did Roseville City School District come on your radar? What attracted you to the district?\n\nRoseville City has a stellar reputation throughout the Sacramento area. It\u2019s kind of known as a lighthouse district. It\u2019s one of the few districts that is growing and at the same time offers a lot of stability \u2026 As I did my research when the position came open, those strong relationships and bonds between the school district and staff, parents, community, were overwhelming, so it made the choice very easy.\n\nWhat are your impressions of the district so far? How would you characterize it compared to San Juan and other school districts you\u2019ve worked for?\n\nIt\u2019s worthy of its reputation. It really has a supportive board that is focused on students. It has a really talented staff top to bottom. I\u2019ve been in every school already thus far, and you can just see how engaged students are. The parents are here, and they\u2019re supportive of the school district as well. I guess the thing that\u2019s most impressive to me, beyond the human side, is the relationships the district has forged with the city, the chamber, the businesses, and when you put that all together, that\u2019s why you get such a great district.\n\nThis is a district of just under 10,000 students, 18 schools, and it\u2019s a district that\u2019s growing, so I think there is the opportunity here to continue the success they\u2019ve experienced over the last several decades. Whereas I\u2019ve always worked in the larger districts \u2013 Elk Grove is 60,000 students, and San Juan is just under 40,000 \u2013 this just feels like a much better-sized district to be a part of and work together toward student success.\n\nComing to the district with a clean slate and fresh eyes, is there anything you particularly want to achieve in the role of superintendent? What do you want to bring to Roseville City School District?\n\nI\u2019ve probably met, individually, with over 100 people so far, and I\u2019ve been asking them the same three questions: What\u2019s great about Roseville City, what deserves a second look and how can I support you in your current role? (I\u2019m) listening for themes throughout the community, because those questions aren\u2019t just being asked of teachers and principals and instructional aides; it\u2019s parents, it\u2019s community members, it\u2019s board members. I\u2019m trying to get a feel for why others value the district and what they see. We\u2019re doing a cabinet retreat (on Sept. 8) to talk about some of those things and we\u2019ll bring that information to the board at the next board meeting (on Sept. 18).\n\nWhat has been the focus of your first two months on the job so far?\n\nMy focus has been to engage the community in a conversation about the district and what makes it so good, and what are other opportunities to look at something for a second or third time to make sure it\u2019s benefitting our students? From there, the board will engage in a discussion and set some goals related to their priorities, and we\u2019ll work on that over the next several years.\n\nWhat I\u2019m hoping for is to get the board to settle on three-year goals that really focus the district and focus our work on students.\n\nObviously Common Core is a hot topic around the country right now, and has been for a couple years. What is your take on it?\n\nI have two boys, ages 5 and 7 in kindergarten and second grade, so I think it offers great opportunity for our children in terms of what it\u2019s asking them to do \u2013 especially around the reading, the writing, the algebraic or conceptual thinking around math, and just the overall thinking skills. When you\u2019re asking students to create arguments based on text starting in fifth grade, you\u2019re really getting to those higher-order thinking skills and a depth of knowledge that the previous standards never attained. We\u2019ve moved beyond the \u201cright\u201d answer, meaning the bubble answer on a Scantron or a California Standards Test question, and we\u2019re moving towards the thinking and justification of our answers.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s an exciting time. It\u2019s a lot of work though. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time, energy and resources. I don\u2019t want to give people the misperception that Common Core is like a light switch. You don\u2019t \u201cclick,\u201d and all of a sudden everything changes on the first day of school this year. This is going to take several years for teachers to think through the new standards and the new curriculum adoptions that are coming, and the assessments. I know it\u2019s going to be a little bit uncomfortable for folks, and I\u2019m OK with that uncomfortable-ness so long as on the other side, we\u2019re learning together and our students are actually growing their skills and thinking ability.\n\nAre there any challenges on the horizon for the district, anything that either concerns you or that you\u2019re preparing for?\n\nOn the academic side of the house, we\u2019re really looking at Common Core being this year\u2019s baseline, and the infusion of technology in terms of the testing itself. My understanding is, when they did the practice run last year, it went really well. But we go live this year, and any time you\u2019re doing something new there\u2019s a little bit of hesitancy, and I want to make sure we\u2019re well-prepared for when the assessments come.\n\nOn the business side, we are going to be a growing district and building new schools in the future, so for me it\u2019s balancing both the academic and the business side and making sure they\u2019re both successful.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to this year?\n\nFor me it\u2019s a year of firsts. You hit those little milestones \u2013 it\u2019s your first day at work, it\u2019s your first board meeting, it\u2019s the first day of school for me here in the district. What I\u2019m most excited about is the student learning, so I most enjoy being out in schools, walking classrooms, observing great teaching and seeing students engaged in learning.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
