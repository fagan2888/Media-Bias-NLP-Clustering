Much as they did with David Letterman before he bid farewell to late-night TV, the guests have tried to stop Jon Stewart from making a huge mistake.

Some have told him it's the exactly right time to leave because he's totally lost his stuff (Translation: Don't go!!!!). President Barack Obama volunteered an executive order. Denis Leary offered to just co-write the whole damn thing with Colin Quinn and Chris Rock for the bargain price of $25 million if Stewart would stay put.

But alas, the day that we've been dreading since he announced his intention to leave back in February is here. Tonight is the final episode of The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.

The Emmy-winning Comedy Central institution will of course go on under the guidance of incoming host Trevor Noah, who is charming and brilliant and seems pretty funny. Meh. He'll be great. Whatever. We'll probably even watch and enjoy it.
