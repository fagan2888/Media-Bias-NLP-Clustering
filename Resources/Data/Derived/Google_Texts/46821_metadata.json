The feds eventually backed down after being sued by Gov. Rick Scott over the matter.\n\nExpanding ObamaCare in Florida would\u2019ve been especially disastrous given the scale of the population, as the costs and enrollment projections are universally unreliable and unpredictable. Every expansion state reviewed in a recent Foundation for Government Accountability study showed their enrollment numbers had exploded way beyond all original projections, massively driving up the costs of the programs\n\n\u201cToday is a victory for Florida\u2019s neediest, who are currently covered by fragile programs that have already had to face massive cuts thanks to ObamaCare,\u201d said Tarren Bragdon, FGA CEO.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion would\u2019ve been nothing short of a disaster for Florida\u2019s patients, healthcare providers, and taxpayers. Fortunately Florida\u2019s Representatives didn\u2019t succumb to the talking points of big hospitals and the myth that there is a conservative way to adopt more ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans had pushed for a modified-ObamaCare expansion called the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program, based in part off of Arkansas failed Private Option which has cost that state millions in cost overruns. In Florida, the cost overruns would have to come out of other vital programs, or be compensated for raised taxes.\n\n\u201cWhile we do want to see all people have access to quality health care, threatening the programs that cover our neighbors, children, and grandparents is the wrong path,\u201d said Bragdon.\n\n\u201cNow that ObamaCare\u2019s expansion is defeated, the legislature can focus on cultivating sound economic policies that will encourage growth and provide real opportunities to all Floridians. Instead of placing able-bodied adults into an expensive welfare program, we can drive job growth and wages so they can control the health care they receive.\u201d\n\nThe House vote came during a special session that began on Monday focused on ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. The expansion bill faced an uphill battle as the House had already passed an anti-expansion resolution and Gov. Scott had threatened to veto the bill if it made it to his desk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers in Florida\u2019s House of Representatives saved critical state programs that serve the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens from a costly expansion of", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobiloud.android.OrthoSpineNews", "author": "OrthoSpineNews", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=990583391", "keywords": "florida,house of representatives,law,lawmakers,medicaid,obamacare,politics,state programs,victory,financial,top stories", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0e2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMedicaid expansion would\u2019ve been nothing short of a disaster for Florida\u2019s patients, healthcare providers, and taxpayers.\nExpanding ObamaCare in Florida would\u2019ve been especially disastrous given the scale of the population, as the costs and enrollment projections are universally unreliable and unpredictable.\nThe expansion bill faced an uphill battle as the House had already passed an anti-expansion resolution and Gov.\nLawmakers in Florida\u2019s House of Representatives saved critical state programs that serve the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens from a costly expansion of Medicaid under ObamaCare that would\u2019ve perversely prioritized benefits for able-bodied, working-age adults ahead of the elderly and disabled during a floor vote today.\nIn Florida, the cost overruns would have to come out of other vital programs, or be compensated for raised taxes."}
