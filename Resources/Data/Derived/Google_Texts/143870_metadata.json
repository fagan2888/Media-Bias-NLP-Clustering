Others have abandoned ship.\n\n\"We had enough notice that people could get out before the water started coming up,\" said Emerson.\n\nBoats are docked to the nearby levee, lined on top of it are cars of people who live in Island Harbor.\n\n\"All the neighbors check on each other, boat by and check on them,\" said Emerson.\n\nEmerson said despite the headache the town goes through when it rains hard, there's no other place people would rather live.\n\n\"It's more like a family out here than it is anything. we all get together and if it wasn't flooded, we'd all be someone's house watching the game today,\" said Emerson.\n\nJefferson County has been declared a disaster area. Many people said they are anxious to get things fixed so they can get back to their normal lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Floods waters still have a tight grip on many areas in Central Arkansas.", "author": "Jonathan Rozelle", "og": {"site_name": "ARKANSASMATTERS", "description": "Floods waters still have a tight grip on many areas in Central Arkansas.", "title": "Island Harbor Homes Flooded By Rising River", "url": "http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/island-harbor-homes-flooded-by-rising-river", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/arkansasmatters/photo/2016/01/02/IMG_1802_1451781463925_6204479_ver1.0_640_360.JPG", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 697714093708694}, "google-site-verification": "Z_P4LryacEsJyHM4crEcugDuRt5Tq977UP7ZyGT4NrY", "keywords": "Local News,News", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2016-01-03T00:38:57+0000", "modified_time": "2016-01-03T00:38:57+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Over in Pine Bluff, more than half Island Harbor is underwater due to the swelling, nearby, Arkansas River.\nPINE BLUFF, Ark -- Floods waters still have a tight grip on many areas in Central Arkansas.\nBoats are docked to the nearby levee, lined on top of it are cars of people who live in Island Harbor.\nSome people, whose homes are only surrounded by the high water, are sticking around, making the best of the situation.\nBut this time she said the water is higher -- more roads, signs and homes, including her own, are overtaken by flood water."}
