(Photo: Courtesy of David Wheeler)\n\nNEWARK - A New Jersey appeals court has overturned several motor vehicle convictions of a woman who claims a former romantic relationship with a Palisades Interstate Parkway police officer led to her being targeted for harassment.\n\nGail Lawrence was convicted of more than a dozen driving violations in two separate trials in 2011.\n\nHer appeal claimed she didn\u2019t waive her right to a lawyer but that the judge went ahead with the trial, forcing her to represent herself.\n\nShe also claimed police never produced dashboard videos that showed the alleged infractions.\n\nLawrence argued evidence she sought from the police department would show she was retaliated against after her relationship with the officer ended.\n\nParkway police didn\u2019t comment on the case Saturday.\n\nFriday\u2019s appeals court ruling sent the case back to municipal court.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
