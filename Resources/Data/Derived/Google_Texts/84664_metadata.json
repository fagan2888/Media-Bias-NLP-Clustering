But two-thirds of them have enrolled in a program that was actually created by Lyndon Johnson, not Barack Obama.\n\nMedicaid, the government health program for low-income Americans, has gotten the majority of sign-ups on HealthSource RI: 48,602 of the 68,292 Rhode Islanders who used the new marketplace to enroll through March 8 were added to the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls. (Even that may understate the Medicaid share, since 3,345 of the 19,690 who signed up for private insurance plans hadn\u2019t paid their first premiums yet.)\n\nIn fact, while December was HealthSource RI\u2019s biggest month for private insurance enrollment so far, the most recent reporting period from Feb. 12 to March 8 was actually the biggest one yet for Medicaid. The deadline to sign up for private plans for 2014 is March 31, but there is no deadline to sign up for Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid enrollment has already far surprised Rhode Island officials\u2019 expectations, which was for 28,000 residents to sign up by Sept. 30.
