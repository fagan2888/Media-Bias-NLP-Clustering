I think our country can be better.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the reason Great Bend OB-GYN Dr. Roger Marshall told a Hays audience Wednesday evening he is running for Congress.\n\nMarshall, who said he and his wife Laina, have been thinking about his candidacy the past two years, is taking on incumbent Kansas Congressman Tim Huelskamp, R-Fowler, for the Big First District.\n\nMarshall, 54, is in the midst of a 17-community tour over four days to make his announcement bid.\n\nHe is also a board member of Farmer\u2019s Bank and Trust community bank, and a former Governor of Rotary International\u2019s western Kansas district.\n\nMarshall said he is a \u201cpro-life, conservative Republican\u201d concerned first about the national debt as well as \u201cdisappearing economic freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and I can\u2019t be the entrepreneurs that we want to be.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s in banking and the Dodd-Frank Act, or the \u2018Not So Affordable Care Act\u2019 known as Obamacare, my life has drastically changed the past four to six years. I\u2019ve seen my hospital and the bank have parallel paths of increasing governmental intrusion upon our lives, but what I don\u2019t see is how it makes any better health care or how it makes us a better bank oftentimes,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nMarshall, who served seven years in the Army Reserve, is also a Commissioner of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism. He was raised on a farm and is involved in a cattle-feeder operation.\n\n\u201cI think it goes without saying we need a voice on the (U.S. House) Ag Committee,\u201d Marshall said in answer to a question from the audience.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled the state, I\u2019ve set down with the feedlot people, the dairy people, the packing plant people, and the constant theme is the overreach of government.\u201d\n\nRep. Huelskamp, a third-term Congressman, has become an outspoken Tea Party Republican and an opponent of House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nBoehner removed Huelskamp from the House Agriculture Committee in 2013, the first time a representative from western Kansas has not served on the panel in a century.\n\nMore information about Marshall and his candidacy for the the 2016 election is available on his webpage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Hays Post", "description": "By BECKY KISER Hays Post \u201cI think Kansas can be better.
