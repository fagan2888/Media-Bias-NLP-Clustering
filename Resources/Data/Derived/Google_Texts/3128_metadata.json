This was primarily a fallout of Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton's allegations on \"price gouging.\" Strong gains in biotech stocks helped the healthcare sector to rebound this month.\n\nClinton's intention to support the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a slew of mergers and acquisitions, and an increase in innovative product pipelines and approvals also boosted the sector. Further, recent data indicates that the number of U.S. baby boomers have risen considerably, which ensures higher demand for healthcare products in the future. These factors indicate that it would be prudent to invest in this space going at this time.\n\nSpectacular Recovery from Q1's Debacle\n\nThe Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) fell 4.6% in the first quarter, following the price gouging controversy. However, the XLV has increased 3% month to date following gains in biotech stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) has also agreed by a similar degree over the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has gone on to emphasize that she intends to expand the coverage of the ACA. She aims to provide incentives to those 30 states who have previously refrained from participating in the ACA program. Clinton's campaign announcements have helped to boost healthcare stocks.\n\nPromising Signs for the Future\n\nMoreover, with valuations approaching reasonable levels, we have already witnessed several merger and acquisition (M&A) agreements and are likely to witness many more as the year progresses. Quite a few of the major healthcare companies are rumored to be on the look-out for suitable deals.\n\nAdditionally, many companies in this sector continue to deliver on their pipeline while key products continue to perform well. Also, several companies are experimenting with multiple new drugs and working on bringing innovative and new treatments to the market.\n\nFurther, the sector is positioned to grow in the future thanks to an ageing American population, which will require more medical attention. According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, there are about 77 million U.S. baby boomers, which is quite a significant number.\n\n5 Potential Health Care Stocks\n\nGiven the rebound in the healthcare sector, stocks from this sector could be a good investment option. However, it is important to find healthcare stocks with strong fundamentals in order to derive healthy returns. Further, it is important to identify winning stocks.\n\nThis is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.\n\nSuch a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities.\n\nEmergent BioSolutions, Inc.
