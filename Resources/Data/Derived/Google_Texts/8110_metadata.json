All respondents owned the technology necessary to watch videos and TV programs (a computer, television and smartphone).\n\nTechnology has impacted people\u2019s viewing habits, according to the survey. Traditional TV viewers often watch their shows on-demand, with 36% using on-demand for more than half of their TV viewing and 13% using on-demand more than 75% of the time.\n\nStreaming video was also really popular, with 28% of viewers watching more than 15 hours of streamed content per week. Respondents between the ages of 35-44 were the largest consumers of streamed content with 33% watching 15 hours or more of streamed content each week.\n\nFor businesses, this survey may provide some insight into the most effective ways to use video. For example, 68% of respondents said that a short video would influence them more than a text-focused ad for getting information on a product.\n\nMajority of respondents (56%) usually skip online ads that play before videos. Twenty-four percent decide whether or not to watch the ad based on the content and 20% don\u2019t skip most online ads.\n\nRespondents also indicated a preference for shorter ads. Fifteen seconds or less was considered the ideal length for a video ad by 46% of respondents. Thirty-five percent said the optimal length of ads should be 16-30 seconds and 19% said 31 seconds or longer works best.\n\nWhen asked what time of the day respondents were most likely to watch video-based content, 67% said between 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., with 30% preferring to watch from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. and 37% from 8 p.m. to 12 a.m.\n\nGet Free Updates!
