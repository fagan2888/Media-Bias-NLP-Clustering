Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.), grew as even Obamacare proponents at the top echelons of the Obama administration acknowledged that it was unworkable.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, for instance, called the CLASS Act \u201ctotally unsustainable.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s website continues to promote the program, calling it \u201ca self-funded and voluntary long-term care insurance choice\u201d despite Sebelius\u2019 admission and the program\u2019s repeal.\n\n\u201cNo taxpayer funds will be used to pay benefits under this provision,\u201d the site insists. \u201cSafeguards will be put in place to ensure its premiums are enough to cover its costs.\u201d\n\nThose claims are fanciful, health care experts say.\n\n\u201cThe CLASS Act is the original Obamacare lie: a plan for long term care which didn\u2019t pass the most basic math test,\u201d said Ben Domenech, a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute specializing in health policy.\n\n\u201cThe only difference is that unlike the rest of Obamacare, CLASS\u2019s math had to work, thanks to a requirement added to the bill by then-Sen. Judd Gregg (R., N.H.)\u201d that required the program to be completely self-sustaining.\n\nThe program\u2019s structure prevented that self-sufficiency due to a problem called \u201cadverse selection.\u201d CLASS was designed to be voluntary, meaning the people who would sign up for it were those most likely to need long-term care.\n\nBecause few individuals were expected sign up unless they expected to later draw funds from the program, its critics pointed out, it would likely pay out far more than it took in, making it unsustainable without additional federal support, which the administration said it did not intend to provide.\n\nThat structure, some critics maintained, was used to game the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s deficit scoring of Obamacare generally.\n\nSince CLASS would begin taking in fees immediately but would not begin to pay out benefits for six years, its red ink was backloaded, improving Obamacare\u2019s 10-year deficit numbers, which would rise sharply in the out years as CLASS began paying out benefits.\n\nThe White House insisted as late as 2011 that the program\u2019s fiscal difficulties could be overcome. Obama said in October 2011 that he opposed repealing CLASS.\n\n\u201cRepealing the CLASS Act isn\u2019t necessary or productive,\u201d one administration official said. \u201cWhat we should be doing is working together to address the long-term care challenges we face in this country.\u201d\n\nHHS announced it was abandoning the program days later.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see a path forward to be able to\u201d implement it in compliance with provisions requiring it be financially sound, an HHS official said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on its continued promotion of the program.\n\nDomenech called that promotion \u201ccompletely irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only the rest of the bill\u2014heck, all bills Congress passes\u2014had to meet the same actuarial requirements as CLASS, we\u2019d have a lot fewer programs built on outright lies,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The White House is still promoting an Affordable Care Act program that was repealed earlier this year and repeating claims regarding its financial soundness that were contradicted even by top administ", "title": "White House Still Promoting CLASS Act", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/white-house-still-promoting-class-act/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/White-House-flickr-150x150.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The White House is still promoting an Affordable Care Act program that was repealed earlier this yea", "creator": "@lachlan", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/White-House-flickr-150x150.jpeg", "title": "White House Still Promoting CLASS Act", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39c8\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @lachlanThe White House is still promoting an Affordable Care Act program that was repealed earlier this year and repeating claims regarding its financial soundness that were contradicted even by top administration officials overseeing it.\n\u201cRepealing the CLASS Act isn\u2019t necessary or productive,\u201d one administration official said.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on its continued promotion of the program.\nThe White House insisted as late as 2011 that the program\u2019s fiscal difficulties could be overcome.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, for instance, called the CLASS Act \u201ctotally unsustainable.\u201dThe White House\u2019s website continues to promote the program, calling it \u201ca self-funded and voluntary long-term care insurance choice\u201d despite Sebelius\u2019 admission and the program\u2019s repeal."}
