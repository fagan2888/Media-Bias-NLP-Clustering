But they are not the tidy, cohesive force that they appear to be.\n\nEven al-Qaida has renounced them\n\nThe militant group, which now calls itself the Islamic State, has always used the tactic of public decapitations to terrorize populations and recruit followers with their show of force, said Humera Khan, executive director of Muflehun, a think tank that specializes in countering violent extremism.\n\nBut their tactics, which they claim advance their cause of forming an Islamic state, or caliphate, actually run counter to the mission of other Islamic extremist groups and has led to infighting.\n\nLast year, al-Qaida released a document called \u201cGeneral Guidelines for Jihad\u201d as a sort of best practices for achieving its goals. It says don\u2019t attack minorities or do indiscriminate killing. If you accidentally kill civilians, you have to apologize. Make sure local people lead the group within their country; for example, al-Qaida in Syria is led by Syrians.\n\nFor the most part, al-Qaida and its affiliates have been following these guidelines, but the Islamic State group has not, said Khan. Their level of brutality against civilians and minority groups has caused al-Qaida to distance itself from the fighters.\n\nAl-Qaida has outlined seven different phases for a caliphate and said now is not the right time for it, said Khan. But the Islamic State group still forged ahead, saying they are the ones achieving what al-Qaida never could.\n\n\u201cAl-Qaida has got patience. They have a strategy and they\u2019re willing to take the time for it to play out,\u201d said Khan. But the Islamic State militants are into instant gratification, she said, and have taken to taunting al-Qaida, saying they\u2019ve gone soft.\n\nThis rift has led other al-Qaida-linked groups, such as al-Nusra in Syria, to reject the Islamic State militants and actively fight them in Syria.\n\nFrom the perspective of the opposition, Khan said, the Islamic State militants might be saying they\u2019re trying to free the Syrian people from repressive regime of President Bashar al-Assad, but they\u2019re actually helping Assad.\n\nThey\u2019re not picky about who joins them\n\nThe Islamic State militants have a lower threshold for people to join them than al-Qaida does, said Khan. New recruits know they won\u2019t need to speak Arabic, and if they do choose to fight with the motley international group, they\u2019ll likely meet someone else from their home country, she said.\n\nOften it\u2019s the foreign fighters, such as from the United States or Europe, who are more willing to commit suicide attacks in Syria and Iraq than the people who come from those countries, said Khan. Either way, the Islamic State members will find something for the new recruits to do, whether it\u2019s spreading their message or helping train others.\n\nThey do use women for their cause\n\nThe Islamic State militants have said they don\u2019t use women in combat roles, but they do delegate them as police to enforce morality rules.\n\nPartly, it reflects social norms in the area that the women don\u2019t fight and instead help out with education and training, said Khan. The jihadists also have a reputation for kidnapping women and girls as sex slaves, in addition to other crimes reported by witnesses.\n\nOn the home front, the militants have wives and families, who mostly stay in their strongholds in Syria while the men are fighting in Iraq. While the men are gone, the women group together in the community.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to set it up as a regular town with working hospitals, marketplaces \u2014 people living their lives,\u201d said Khan.\n\nThe U.S.-Arab airstrikes in Syria have disrupted that way of life, but the full impact will be revealed only after the dust settles, she said.\n\nFollow @NewsHourWorld", "article_metadata": {"description": "Islamic State militants are notorious for their brutality and for luring foreigners to their cause.
