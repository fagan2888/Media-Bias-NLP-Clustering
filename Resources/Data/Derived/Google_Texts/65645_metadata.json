Jeb Bush talks to reporters at The Varsity restaurant during a campaign stop Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015, in Atlanta.\n\nJeb Bush is scheduled to release his tax plan on Wednesday, and the Washington Post says it knows who helped him with it.\n\nCiting \u201ctwo Republicans familiar with Bush\u2019s schedule,\u201d the Post reported that Bush met with Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore, publishing executive Steve Forbes, and CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow for an hour on Tuesday morning to discuss the details of the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s economic plan. The three men are supply-side conservatives \u2014 meaning, among other things, that they believe in tax breaks for the rich and less economic regulation.\n\nBut these men aren\u2019t just any trickle-down economists. They\u2019re all high-profile proponents of Reaganomics \u2014 they all actually advised Reagan while he was in the White House. It\u2019s also not an accident that the three of them met with Bush together. Kudlow, Forbes, and Moore recently formed a new group called the Committee to Unleash American Prosperity which, according to a summer press release, wants presidential candidates to advocate for traditional, Reaganesque economic policies \u2014 a low rate, flat tax; limited government spending; free trade; and little regulation. For what it\u2019s worth, all three men have denied the science of global warming.\n\nThe group\u2019s website is still under construction. But considering its founders are all advising a man who wants to be the next president, it\u2019s worth getting to know each, one at a time.\n\nLarry Kudlow\n\nLarry Kudlow speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland.

As the former host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Kudlow Report\u201d and current senior contributor to the station, he muses on the potential effects of politicians\u2019 proposed policies. He\u2019s also a former adviser to Ronald Reagan, and according to the New York Times, the former \u201ceconomic guru\u201d of conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.\n\nIt\u2019s unsurprising, then, that Kudlow is decidedly against government incentive programs, arguing they encourage people to be lazy. He\u2019s decried unemployment benefits for that reason, saying people are more likely to go back to work if they don\u2019t receive the subsidy. It\u2019s basically the same reason Kudlow doesn\u2019t like Obamacare \u2014 because of its expansion of Medicaid, he argued, people are rewarded for having low income. \u201c[Obamacare is] basically paying you not to work,\u201d he\u2019s said.\n\nIn the same vein, Kudlow seems more inclined to defend the intentions of the rich. In response to a 2009 Wall Street Journal story that revealed CEOs of banks receiving government bailout money were expensing personal vacation travel on private jets, Kudlow said he didn\u2019t have a problem with it. \u201cI think it\u2019s great because I want to stimulate the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad the CEOs are going around. I just wish they\u2019d take me with them.\u201d\n\nStephen Moore\n\nCREDIT: Gage Skidmore/Flickr\n\nAfter serving for years as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s economics columnist, Stephen Moore joined the Heritage Foundation \u2014 arguably America\u2019s most influential conservative think tank \u2014 as its chief economist in 2014. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d gone to work there \u2014 as ThinkProgress noted at the time, he served as a fellow there during the Reagan presidency.\n\nLater, he actually joined the administration, serving as the research director of Reagan\u2019s \u201cPrivatization Unit,\u201d which was formed to study ways government functions could be turned over to private business. In 1988, that commission recommended contracting with the private sector for prison administration; letting private sector companies compete with Medicaid; and ending government-assisted housing. In 2010, Moore said if he \u201ccould have my \u2018druthers,\u201d he would raise taxes on the poorest Americans to finance more tax cuts for the rich.\n\nMoore also founded the conservative Club for Growth PAC in 1999, which advocates a \u201cvision of limited government and lower taxes.\u201d Today, that PAC is steering donations toward five presidential candidates: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, and Jeb Bush.\n\nSteve Forbes\n\nSteve Forbes speaking at the 2013 FreedomFest in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Since then, he\u2019s advised other politicians seeking the presidency \u2014 Rick Perry and John McCain \u2014 and even sought the presidency for himself, twice.\n\nForbes himself is extremely wealthy \u2014 his net worth is about $430 million \u2014 mostly due to the fact that his father is Malcolm Forbes, the former chairman of Forbes Magazine. In fact, Forbes has been criticized heavily for \u201cnearly bankrupting\u201d his father\u2019s company in 2011 while taking hundreds of millions of dollars for himself.\n\nAt the same time, Forbes is probably best known for advocating low taxes on the rich. His preferred method would be some version of a flat tax, or a system that taxes everyone at the same rate. That method, as the American Prospect points out, also \u201cwould have also saved him a couple of billion dollars in taxes over the course of his lifetime.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "These men aren't just any supply-side conservative economists.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "These men aren't just any supply-side conservative economists.", "title": "Meet The Trickle-Down Conservatives Behind Jeb Bush\u2019s Tax Plan", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/09/09/3699564/jeb-bushs-economic-advisers/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/09094801/AP_232091451810.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These men aren't just any supply-side conservative economists.", "creator": "@@emorwee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/09094801/AP_232091451810-321x214.jpg", "title": "Meet The Trickle-Down Conservatives Behind Jeb Bush\u2019s Tax Plan", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/09094801/AP_232091451810.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/09094801/AP_232091451810.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-09T11:34:20+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emorweee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Economy Meet The Trickle-Down Conservatives Behind Jeb Bush\u2019s Tax Plan CREDIT: AP Photo/David Goldman Republican presidential candidate, former Florida Gov.\nJeb Bush is scheduled to release his tax plan on Wednesday, and the Washington Post says it knows who helped him with it.\nThe three men are supply-side conservatives \u2014 meaning, among other things, that they believe in tax breaks for the rich and less economic regulation.\nHis preferred method would be some version of a flat tax, or a system that taxes everyone at the same rate.\nJeb Bush talks to reporters at The Varsity restaurant during a campaign stop Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015, in Atlanta."}
