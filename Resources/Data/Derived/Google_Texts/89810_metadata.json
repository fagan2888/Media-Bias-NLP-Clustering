They\u2019re dynamic. They can change\u2026 and sometimes become a lot dumber than they started.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Data Science team published a blog post today examining how memes evolve as they spread from user to user. The post, called The Evolution of Memes on Facebook, shows how it\u2019s only a matter of time before users bend a meme to their will, sometimes improving upon them, sometimes turning them into \u201cThanks Obama\u201d right-wing rage rants, and sometimes just bungling the grammar.\n\n\u201cA meme is an idea that is readily transmitted from person to person. But we humans are not perfect transmitters. While sometimes we repeat the idea exactly, often we change the meme, either unintentionally, or to embellish or improve it,\u201d the team wrote.\n\nTo illustrate, Facebook looked at a status update meme from 2009. It started off as a fairly barebones declaration in support of affordable health care: \u201cNo one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. If you agree, post this as your status for the rest of the day\u201d.\n\nThe scientists noted that this exact quote was copied over 470,000 times during September 2009. But plenty of other variations cropped up: Facebook studied 121,605 different variants of the original phrase, used in 1.14 million status updates. The team compared the evolution of memes to the way genes mutatate and confirmed their belief that they follow similar patterns.\n\nThe team also showed how niche groups took the meme and tweaked the message to mean the opposite of its original, pro-Obamacare intent. Conservatives took the meme and changed it to complain about Obamacare, as well as taxes. Some liberals poked fun at the meme\u2019s serious tone, changing it to be about Star Warns and zombies. Other people made it about alcohol. Why not.\n\nFacebook chose a meme from 2009 because it predates the share button, which has made it easier to spread memes around but has also diminished permutations, since people who choose to re-post using the button aren\u2019t as inclined to put their own spin on the material.\n\nFacebook is trying to downplay the frequency memes appear in your Newsfeed, anyways; the social network recently adjusted its Newsfeed algorithm to de-prioritize memes and push news content to the top.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.ratio_4_3": "http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/1511316_10152134808693415_1229605590_n-480x360-c.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/1511316_10152134808693415_1229605590_n-50x50.png", "sailthru.author": "Kate Knibbs", "description": "Facebook's Data Science team took a look at how memes evolve on the social network, choosing a status update about Obamacare that went viral in 2009.", "tags": "Facebook,memes,Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Digital Trends", "description": "Facebook's Data Science team took a look at how memes evolve on the social network, choosing a status update about Obamacare that went viral in 2009.", "title": "From healthcare support to blaming Obama: the evolution of a Facebook meme", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/1511316_10152134808693415_1229605590_n-1200x630-c.png", "url": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/memes-evolve-facebook/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Digital Trends", "description": "Facebook's Data Science team took a look at how memes evolve on the social network, choosing a status update about Obamacare that went viral in 2009.", "title": "From healthcare support to blaming Obama: the evolution of a Facebook meme", "image": "http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/1511316_10152134808693415_1229605590_n-720x669.png", "creator": "@digitaltrends", "site": "@digitaltrends", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-08 12:58:36", "sailthru.title": "From healthcare support to blaming Obama: the evolution of a Facebook meme", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"app_id": 61377565444, "pages": 8522591132}, "sailthru.image.ratio_3_2": "http://icdn6.digitaltrends.com/image/1511316_10152134808693415_1229605590_n-600x400-c.png", "sailthru.tags": "Facebook, memes, Obamacare, Kate Knibbs, Social Media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrendsftw", "section": "Social Media", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-01-08T12:58:36+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "Facebook's Data Science team took a look at how memes evolve on the social network, examining a status update about Obamacare that went viral in 2009 as an example.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/1511316_10152134808693415_1229605590_n-720x669.png", "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Facebook, Facebook Data Science, Data Science, Facebook memes, memes, Facebook meme changes, Facebook Obamacare, Facebook political meme"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc77\"", "article_summary": "To illustrate, Facebook looked at a status update meme from 2009.\nFacebook\u2019s Data Science team published a blog post today examining how memes evolve as they spread from user to user.\nThe team also showed how niche groups took the meme and tweaked the message to mean the opposite of its original, pro-Obamacare intent.\nThe team compared the evolution of memes to the way genes mutatate and confirmed their belief that they follow similar patterns.\nConservatives took the meme and changed it to complain about Obamacare, as well as taxes."}
