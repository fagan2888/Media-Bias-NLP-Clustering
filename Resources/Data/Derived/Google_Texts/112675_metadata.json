And, the average subsidized individual health plan costs $101/month.\n\nThis is according to a new Marketplace report, released yesterday by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the Obamacare enrollment numbers for the 2015 open enrollment period, November 15, 2014 through February 22, 2015.\n\nObamacare Enrollment Numbers - Highlights\n\nOf the nearly 11.7 million people who selected a plan, 76 percent used the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, HealthCare.gov and 24 percent used a state-run Marketplace.\n\nNearly 7.7 million individuals with a plan selection in the states using HealthCare.gov qualified for an average tax credit of $263 per month. More than half (55 percent) paid $100 or less per month after premium tax credits.\n\n3.3 million young adults (ages 18 to 34) signed up for Marketplace coverage, representing 28 percent of all plan selections.\n\nAverage Subsidized Health Plan Costs $101/month\n\nAccording to HHS, the average premium before tax credits is $364/month for plans purchased through the federally-run Marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Eighty-seven percent (87%) are receiving tax credits and are paying an average of $101/month across all types of plans. The average premium tax credit is $263/month.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average cost to cover an individual with group health insurance in 2014 is $502/month (source).\n\n38% are Paying $50/month or Less\n\nFor those receiving premium tax credits, 38 percent are paying $50/month or less and 63% are paying $100/month or less.\n\nRead the full HHS report here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you think health insurance is too expensive for your family or your employees, think again. The average cost of individual health insurance in 2015 through the federally-run Marketplace is $101/month after premium tax credits are applied. The vast majority (87 percent) qualify for a discount.\n\nCompare this to the average cost of health insurance purchased by an employer - $502/month -- and it\u2019s easy to see why experts predict a massive shift to individual health insurance.\n\nWhat do you think?
