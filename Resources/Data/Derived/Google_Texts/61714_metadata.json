Gov. Gavin Newsom picked up a major endorsement for his 2018 campaign for governor Wednesday when the 90,000-member California Nurses Association gave him its blessing at a meeting in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough the primary election is more than two years away, it wasn\u2019t a hard choice, said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the union.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable that we were going to endorse Gavin,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one of the easiest endorsements we have ever made.\u201d\n\nThe key to the endorsement is Newsom\u2019s support for single-payer health care, a.k.a. \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which means that everyone\u2019s health-care costs would be paid by the government rather than by insurance companies. Newsom has cited his \u201cHealthy San Francisco\u201d plan, which he initiated as mayor, as a model for universal health care coverage.\n\n\u201cWe really hope Gavin can do single-payer,\u201d DeMoro said. \u201cWe have extremely high hopes he can make it happen.\u201d\n\nAlthough single-payer plans are found in countries across the world, they\u2019ve found little favor in the United States. President Obama had to drop his support for a publicly run insurance alternative to get his Affordable Care Act passed and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger twice vetoed single-payer plans passed by the Legislature.\n\nIn 2012, with Democrat Jerry Brown as governor, SB810, a single-payer plan by San Francisco state Sen. Mark Leno, didn\u2019t make it out of the state Senate.\n\nOne of the main problems is the projected price of the program, which the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office said could cost the state $210 billion the first year.\n\nBut supporters argue the costs are overstated and that health care should be a right for everyone living in California.\n\nIf Newsom is elected, DeMoro said, \u201cthe Legislature will have a heck of a time ignoring him when he talks about single-payer. He will have the power of government to make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe nurses\u2019 union is one of the strongest and most political savvy labor organizations in the state, providing both money and workers to the people it supports.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re committed, we\u2019re very deeply committed,\u201d DeMoro said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure (Newsom) wins.\u201d\n\n\u2014 John Wildermuth", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://blog.sfgate.com/politics/files/2012/12/uc15_0134_pc-e1356122643227.jpg", "sailthru.author": "John Wildermuth", "vf": {"unique_id": "wp_sfgate_blog_sfgate_com_politics_2285_blogEntryId32827"}, "title": "Nurses' union endorses Newsom, citing his single-payer position", "og": {"site_name": "Politics Blog", "description": "Lt.
