That verse reads: \u201cThen they will hand you over for persecution, and they will kill you. You will be hated by all nations because of My name.\u201d\n\nAusbun told his congregation that Middle Eastern Christians were given a choice to convert to Islam, pay a tax, leave immediately or face death. He also warned that ISIS is recruiting Westerners. He encouraged the church to pray for the Gospel message to advance despite terrorism and war.\n\nAbout three-and-a-half years ago, Ausbun started a YouTube channel for church members who missed the Sunday service. Over the years, he posted dozens of sermon videos without a single problem \u2013 until Aug. 27.\n\n\u201cI received an email from YouTube telling me that my account had been terminated for violation of the terms of service and their community guidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey actually terminated my entire account.\u201d\n\nAusbun said he decided to read YouTube\u2019s community guidelines, and that\u2019s when he put two and two together. They thought his sermon amounted to hate speech.\n\nYouTube clearly states that it doesn\u2019t permit \u201chate speech\u201d \u2013 and that includes \u201cspeech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion\u201d and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me exactly why they terminated my account, but by default there was nothing else wrong,\u201d Ausbun said. \u201cIt had to be hate speech.\u201d\n\nFor the past week he\u2019s been trying to reach someone at YouTube to explain what happened. So far, his calls have gone unreturned. I sent them a message, too. So far, no response.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t like what I preached on,\u201d Ausbun said. \u201cI shared about radical Islam from a Christian perspective, and they consider that to be hate speech.\u201d\n\nI wish I could direct you to a link of the pastor\u2019s message but YouTube deleted it. So, I can\u2019t tell you verbatim what the pastor said. However, according to his sermon notes, there was nothing hateful about what he preached.\n\nAusbun concedes that YouTube can censor whatever videos it wishes. But he does wonder \u2013 what else is it banning?\n\nYouTube came under a firestorm of criticism after ISIS was allowed to post a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with YouTube?\u201d Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly said on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d \u201cPosting that. The beheading. What the hell is the matter with YouTube? Nobody should post that.\u201d\n\nYouTube removed the video and explained its policy in a statement to the website Mediaite.\n\n\u201cYouTube has clear policies that prohibit content like gratuitous violence, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and used in an official capacity to further its interests.\u201d\n\nTo the best of anyone\u2019s knowledge, the First Baptist Church in Moreland is not a foreign terrorist organization. The pastor says he simply wanted to inform his church about the threat posed by Islamic terrorists and pray for the victims of their Islamic slaughter. Is that hate speech?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally terminated \u2013 like I\u2019m the terrorist,\u201d the pastor said.\n\nAusbun said what happened to him could happen to other American pastors under the guise of banning \u201chate speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything a pastor preaches on \u2013 whether it be radical Islam, homosexuality, the teachings of Jesus \u2013 YouTube can label that hate speech and censor their sermons,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Georgia preacher said he decided to contact me because people need to be aware of YouTube\u2019s censorship.\n\n\u201cISIS is recruiting Americans to get trained over there, and we know what they are going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not going to stay in Iraq and Syria. They\u2019re coming back to our country.\n\nPastors should be speaking out on this. This is a grave concern to our Christian brothers and sisters who are literally dying for their faith, and it could affect our lives here.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Pastor Ausbun has launched a new video channel \u2013 on Vimeo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pastor of a small-town Baptist church in Georgia says he got banned from YouTube after he posted video of a Sunday sermon he gave about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East..05/26/2016 5:40:44AM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The pastor of a small-town Baptist church in Georgia says he got banned from YouTube after he posted video of a Sunday sermon he gave about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East.", "title": "- Sermon Censorship?
