Everyone has experienced shyness or nervousness right before a big presentation, or before going on a date with someone they barely know.\n\nBut a form of severe shyness, known as social anxiety disorder, exists \u2014 and it isn\u2019t just stage fright. It\u2019s a far more serious and debilitating form of anxiety that can prevent people from socializing, doing well at their jobs, and finding new opportunities.\n\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder have a much more intense desire to avoid any social interaction, often isolating themselves, than people who are merely dubbed \"shy.\" People with this disorder are fearful of what others think about them, and constantly feel as though they are being negatively judged. They often feel sensations of embarrassment or criticism, and are worried that every social interaction will result in rejection. Physical symptoms like profuse sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid heartbeat or blushing, are also common when they're forced to interact with others in unfamiliar environments.\n\nSomeone with this disorder might sit wringing their hands about speaking at a wedding, even a year before the event.\n\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), about 15 million American adults have social anxiety disorder, and 36 percent don\u2019t seek help for almost 10 or more years after the onset of the disorder. Typically, it develops in children \u2014 the average age of onset is 13.\n\nLike other mental health disorders, social anxiety is caused by a mix of environment and genetics, taking factors like inherited traits, brain structure, negative experiences, and brain chemistry into account. If your parents are naturally anxious, you may learn from and develop their patterns. If you\u2019re a woman, for example, you\u2019re more likely to develop this disorder as well.\n\nSo how does someone manage an anxiety that they feel powerless against? Even if a person recognizes the excessiveness of their anxiety, it is often hard to break away from its clutches.\n\nLike most types of anxiety, people with social anxiety can undergo cognitive-behavioral treatment, take anxiety meds, and simply learn to become aware of their tendencies. Before taking medications like beta blockers or antidepressants, however, it may be important to try some basic personal steps at home. One of the first ways to begin conquering this crippling anxiety is to challenge negative thoughts. Some negative thoughts include, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a fool of myself,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019ll like me,\u201d and \u201cWhat if they think I\u2019m awkward and weird? I\u2019d rather just go home.\u201d The perception that discomfort in speaking in front of big groups is equivalent to you having nothing interesting to say, is damaging and often untrue. As Susan Cain, author of Quiet, has said: \u201cThere is absolutely no correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.\u201d\n\nQuestion your negative thoughts that have become a pattern. Will you really make a fool of yourself? Even if you\u2019re nervous or quiet, will people really think you\u2019re awkward or incompetent?\n\nAnxiety is also deeply connected with your physical state: When you begin to have a panic attack before a social event, remember to focus on breathing. Hyperventilating is common among people who have panic attacks, and it can exacerbate the problem and make you feel more nervous and dizzy. Regular lifestyle changes, like sticking to a healthy diet, getting enough sleep (maintaining \u201csleep hygiene\u201d), and exercising daily can greatly reduce stress, anxiety, and even specific disorders like social anxiety or social phobias.\n\nMeanwhile, taking small steps to prepare for social situations can help ease you into the habit of facing your anxiety. Spending time in public with a close friend, greeting others, complimenting someone, or initiating plans with friends can also help.\n\nCheck the Centre for Clinical Interventions on ways to practice calm breathing, muscle relaxation, a thinking-feeling connection, and self-help.\n\nIf these self-treatments still leave you lacking, taking part in cognitive-behavioral therapy or group therapy can help begin unraveling your patterns and teaching you ways to cope with your anxiety.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "social anxiety disorder, managing social anxiety, social anxiety", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Whether you\u2019re wringing your hands over a school presentation or constantly closed off to meeting new people, you may be interested in learning how to manage your social anxiety.", "title": "How To Conquer Your Social Anxiety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/social-anxiety-can-be-beaten-how-challenge-your-negative-thoughts-and-stop-running-away-your-fears", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/04/social-anxiety-disorder.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Whether you\u2019re wringing your hands over a school presentation or constantly closed off to meeting new people, you may be interested in learning how to manage your social anxiety.", "title": "How To Conquer Your Social Anxiety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/social-anxiety-can-be-beaten-how-challenge-your-negative-thoughts-and-stop-running-away-your-fears", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/04/social-anxiety-disorder.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/04/social-anxiety-disorder.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-04T14:06:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T14:06:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Whether you\u2019re wringing your hands over a school presentation or constantly closed off to meeting new people, you may be interested in learning how to manage your social anxiety."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb2c\"", "article_summary": "But a form of severe shyness, known as social anxiety disorder, exists \u2014 and it isn\u2019t just stage fright.\nIndividuals with social anxiety disorder have a much more intense desire to avoid any social interaction, often isolating themselves, than people who are merely dubbed \"shy.\"\nOne of the first ways to begin conquering this crippling anxiety is to challenge negative thoughts.\nSuffering from social anxiety disorder often entails hiding from social interactions and going to all costs to avoid other people or public events.\nLike most types of anxiety, people with social anxiety can undergo cognitive-behavioral treatment, take anxiety meds, and simply learn to become aware of their tendencies."}
