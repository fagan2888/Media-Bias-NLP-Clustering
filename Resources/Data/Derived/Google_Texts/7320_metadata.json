Jerry Brown called special sessions last year to address both issues, but he and lawmakers never came close to a deal on either, adding to the urgency this year.\n\nLawmakers are also eager to make big moves on signature issues such as climate change, higher education, income inequality and gun control. Ensuring a steady water supply to California\u2019s 39 million residents is also a priority after four years of drought.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll remain focused on pursuing big and bold ideas, tackle important issues facing Californians and the nation,\u201d Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, said.\n\nThe state\u2019s revenues are finally surging, potentially coming in $3.6 billion ahead of forecasts for fiscal 2015 with $12 billion in the state rainy day fund, according to the independent state legislative analyst.\n\nThat leaves both Democrats and Republicans with wiggle room to push for spending on social programs that were scaled back during the recession. The wish list includes paying more to doctors who treat patients in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health care program for the poor, boosting funding for the developmentally disabled and building more affordable housing.\n\nBut lawmakers will again be confronted with the Democratic governor\u2019s \u201cless is more\u201d spending approach when he releases his budget proposal, due by Jan. 10.\n\nLawmakers finished in August without coming up with a replacement for a major health care tax that will expire in June \u2014 money needed to pay for the Medi-Cal program that has seen a surge in enrollees under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe must hammer out a deal because we run the risk of a $1 billion hole in our general fund budget that has very real consequences, especially to the most vulnerable,\u201d de Leon said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s chief adviser, Nancy McFadden, has cautioned against relying on the extra tax money coming in, telling a Public Policy Institute of California panel in December that \u201cjust saying the general fund can pick this up doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nEven as more people enroll, the program faces a shortage of doctors since reimbursement payments were slashed by 10 percent during the recession.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve overpromised in California,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Jean Fuller, R-Bakersfield. \u201cWe\u2019ve promised that they\u2019d have services but we\u2019re paying such a low rate that doctors are opting out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers of both parties also appear to agree that the state should boost funding for services to help the developmentally disabled, another group that absorbed cuts during the recession. Hundreds of disabled people rallied outside the Capitol last session but the final budget deal did not include more money for the program.\n\nFuller said taking care of this vulnerable population \u201cis very clearly the state\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is the crumbling infrastructure. Brown\u2019s administration proposed a package of fees and taxes to fund a portion of the repairs in the final weeks of last year\u2019s session, but he has not been a public force in offering solutions.\n\nRepublicans have rejected the idea of taxes and fees, arguing that the state should return diverted transportation money and make major cuts to Caltrans before asking for more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done the new taxes over and over and over, and here we are again,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nDe Leon said he\u2019s optimistic about reaching a compromise, adding, \u201ceveryone needs to stretch a little bit.\u201d\n\nMany of the lawmakers returning for the second year of a two-year session face re-election. Looming over the work of the Legislature are dozens of initiatives that could appear alongside them on the ballot in November.\n\nMajor proposals so far include a $2-a-pack tax on cigarettes for health care, extending voter-approved Proposition 30 income taxes on the wealthy, boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour, legalizing recreational marijuana and a package of gun control measures proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocrats in both houses are also expected to propose a gun control package in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings, including how to address so-called ghost guns built at home from parts, making them difficult to trace.\n\nWith so many issues up for grabs, only one thing is certain: Whatever tasks the Legislature is unable or unwilling to finish could be in voters\u2019 hands come November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SACRAMENTO >> California lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday facing two of the most vexing problems from last year: a looming $1 billion hole in funding for the state\u2019s health care program for the poor and a $59 billion backlog in road", "title": "California lawmakers return with full plate of heady issues", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160103/california-lawmakers-return-with-full-plate-of-heady-issues", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160103/NEWS/160109889/AR/0/AR-160109889.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1001px"}, "type": "article", "title": "California lawmakers return with full plate of heady issues"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "SACRAMENTO >> California lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday facing two of the most vexing problems from last year: a looming $1 billion hole in funding for the state\u2019s health care program for the poor and a $59 billion backlog in road", "title": "California lawmakers return with full plate of heady issues", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160103/california-lawmakers-return-with-full-plate-of-heady-issues", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160103/NEWS/160109889/AR/0/AR-160109889.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "State legislature, State legislature news, Los Angeles State legislature news, CA State legislature news, US State legislature news, world State legislature news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "State legislature, State legislature news, Los Angeles State legislature news, CA State legislature news, US State legislature news, world State legislature news."}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers are also eager to make big moves on signature issues such as climate change, higher education, income inequality and gun control.\nThe wish list includes paying more to doctors who treat patients in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health care program for the poor, boosting funding for the developmentally disabled and building more affordable housing.\nJerry Brown called special sessions last year to address both issues, but he and lawmakers never came close to a deal on either, adding to the urgency this year.\nSACRAMENTO >> California lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday facing two of the most vexing problems from last year: a looming $1 billion hole in funding for the state\u2019s health care program for the poor and a $59 billion backlog in road repairs needed over the next decade.\nEnsuring a steady water supply to California\u2019s 39 million residents is also a priority after four years of drought."}
