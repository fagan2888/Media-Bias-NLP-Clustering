What makes Garcia\u2019s case unique is that he\u2019s lived in the U.S. illegally for 20 years. The Court\u2019s decision on a closely watched test case for immigrant rights came Thursday morning. The Associated Press reported that Garcia had challenged a 1996 law that barred people living in the country illegally from receiving \u201cprofessional licenses\u201d from government agencies or public funding unless state lawmakers vote otherwise.\n\nDespite the court\u2019s ruling, Garcia will still have to work for himself, given no law firm or other employers can legally hire him.\n\nWhile working as an almond picker and at a grocery store, Garcia went to law school and passed the California bar on his first attempt four years ago. His license was granted but then rescinded due to his undocumented status.\n\nGarcia\u2019s lawyers claimed that there was no legal impediment to his admission as a member of the California State Bar. But the U.S. Department of Justice argued that granting him a license would violate federal law that bars people who are illegally in the U.S. from receiving government benefits. Despite the Obama administration\u2019s support of DREAMers, the AP reported that it had opposed granting Garcia a law license as an undocumented immigrant.\n\nDuring oral arguments in September, Justice Department\u2019s Daniel Tenney said it wouldn\u2019t be a conflict for federal law if a state legislature legalized authorization for state courts to issue law licenses to undocumented immigrants.\n\nThat is exactly what California\u2019s lawmakers proceeded to do. Days after the oral arguments, California\u2019s state legislature passed AB-1024, which authorizes the California Supreme Court to provide licenses even to \u201can applicant who is not lawfully present in the United States.\u201d\n\nCalif. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law last October, and it went into effect Wednesday.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Sept. 4, 2013 in a case that determined whether Sergio Garcia could become a licensed attorney.\n\nThough Garcia is undocumented, NPR reported last October that he moved to the U.S. as a child and has been waiting more than 19 years for a green card for which he was already approved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California's highest court ruled Thursday that immigrants living in the U.S. without proper documentation can become licensed lawyers.Photo by Wikimedia Co", "pubdate": 20140102, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "California's highest court ruled Thursday that immigrants living in the U.S. without proper documentation can become licensed lawyers.Photo by Wikimedia Co", "title": "California's Supreme Court rules undocumented immigrants can be licensed to practice law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour.s3.amazonaws.com:80/photos/2014/01/02/Supremecourtofcaliforniamaincourthouse_blog_main_horizontal.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/californias-supreme-court-rules-undocumented-immigrants-can-be-licensed-to-practice-law/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "California's highest court ruled Thursday that immigrants living in the U.S. without proper documentation can become licensed lawyers.Photo by Wikimedia Co", "title": "California's Supreme Court rules undocumented immigrants can be licensed to practice law", "image": "http://newshour.s3.amazonaws.com:80/photos/2014/01/02/Supremecourtofcaliforniamaincourthouse_blog_main_horizontal.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Law"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccca5\"", "article_summary": "California\u2019s highest court ruled Thursday that immigrants living in the U.S. without proper documentation can become licensed lawyers.Photo by Wikimedia Commons user CoolcaesarThe California Supreme Court has granted immigrant Sergio Garcia\u2019s bid to the California State Bar as a licensed lawyer.\nCalifornia Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Sept. 4, 2013 in a case that determined whether Sergio Garcia could become a licensed attorney.\nGarcia\u2019s lawyers claimed that there was no legal impediment to his admission as a member of the California State Bar.\nDuring oral arguments in September, Justice Department\u2019s Daniel Tenney said it wouldn\u2019t be a conflict for federal law if a state legislature legalized authorization for state courts to issue law licenses to undocumented immigrants.\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s support of DREAMers, the AP reported that it had opposed granting Garcia a law license as an undocumented immigrant."}
