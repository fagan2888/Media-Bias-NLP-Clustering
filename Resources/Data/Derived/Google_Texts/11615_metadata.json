This knowledge sounds almost too futuristic, and in many ways it is. But experts say genome sequencing technology is rapidly advancing and becoming less expensive, and it could shape the way we approach preventative care and the insurance industry.\n\nToday, parents can receive newborn screens that check for diseases that need to be treated in infancy as well as genetic testing during early pregnancy that identify possible abnormalities.\n\nThe current cost of a complete genome sequencing using blood and saliva comes with a price tag of about $1,000, according to Jeffrey Kahn, deputy director for policy and administration at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.\n\n\u201cIt takes a few hours to produce now. As that gets faster and cheaper, it becomes something that is on a scale where it is almost worthwhile to do for everyone,\u201d Kahn says. \u201cIt would be a big change, moving from that newborn screen to doing full genome sequencing on every child that is born.\u201d\n\nBut having access to a child\u2019s sequence today doesn\u2019t mean much. In fact, Kahn likens it to having all of the telephone numbers in the white pages without the names. The sequence would have to be run through software that could pick out certain gene mutations to determine predispositions.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe question then is: who should access this data, and for what purposes?\u201d he says.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn 2013, the Food and Drug Administration warned Google-backed (NASDAQ: GOOG) 23andMe to stop selling its $99 genetic tests sold at retailers because it had not received regulatory clearance. The FDA says products that are designed to diagnose or prevent disease are technically \u201cmedical devices\u201d and need regulatory approval.\n\nMisha Angrist, assistant professor at the Duke Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy, says the biggest \u201cbottleneck\u201d within the industry is interpretation.\n\n\u201cWith 23andMe, the FDA said you cannot tell people what this genetic information means for their health,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can tell them about their ancestry or a gene that may make their pee smell funny if they eat asparagus, but you may not go into detail about what this means. So the question becomes, who gets to interpret this?\u201d\n\nAngrist says giving this information to parents makes sense, but cautions that introducing genome scans on a mass clinical scale within the next five years would inundate the medical world and consumers since they will provide too much information on too wide of a playing field.\n\n\u201cIt is the \u2018drinking from a fire hose\u2019 problem,\u201d she says.\n\nHealth Insurance and Prevention\n\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, protects Americans from being discriminated against based on their genetic information in regards to health insurance and employment. The act promises \u201cpersonalized medicine without fear of discrimination.\u201d\n\nInsurers have become even more regulated since GINA passed with the Affordable Care Act becoming law two years later, which mandates that no individual can be charged more by insurers for having a pre-existing condition. In the past, sick individuals could be charged up to five times as much for coverage as healthier or younger enrollees. Now, that ratio has been reduced to three-to-one, as far as what insurers can charger older and sicker people compared to what they charge young and healthy people.\n\nKahn says the only way genetic information would impact the health-insurance industry would be if GINA changes in response to advanced genome technology.\n\n\u201cToday, we spread the risk around, which is the whole point of community-based insurance,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t use this information unless federal law is changed.\u201d\n\nLaura Lyman Rodriguez, director of the division of policy, communications and education at the National Human Genome Research Institute, says it\u2019s unlikely GINA would ever be reversed, even as genomics continues to advance.\n\n\u201cI think where risk assessment is important is in clinical care. It\u2019s increasingly important for physicians to know about it to guide care,\u201d Lyman Rodriguez says. \u201cSo much of what we actually develop has to be with how and when we live our lives. Something about your genomics, at the base level of information, means you can make different interventions in preventative ways: exercising more, not living on macaroni and cheese, or choosing a particular drug or course of treatment.\u201d\n\nLife Insurance and Long-Term Care\n\nWhile health-insurance industry would not be able to charge individuals more based on their genomic data, Lawrence Brody, chief and senior investigator at the Genome Technology Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute, points out life insurance and long-term care don\u2019t not fall under the rules of GINA.\n\n\u201cIf you have a motorcycle, it changes your life insurance rates,\u201d Brody points out. \u201cIf you work as a roofer, it changes your rates, so clearly they can separate out people who are prone to Type 2 diabetes [with genomic information] and actuaries would love to use that type of information.\u201d\n\nBut breaking down those seeking insurance by who is susceptible to heart disease versus muscle disease and conducting risk assessment based on these stats may leave life insurers with very few people to insure, or that they actually want to insure, Brody says.\n\n\u201cThe question is for life insurance is \u2018will [these stats] be useful tools?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIf they turn out to be, we do have societal issues, such as if you can actually be compelled to give over a genetic result or to take a genetic test.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 10:24:48 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Researchers are getting closer to being able to determine a person\u2019s full genome sequence at birth.
