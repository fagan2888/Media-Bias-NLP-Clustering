Just one.\n\nIt sounds like a simple task, given America\u2019s very public discontent with Washington. A mere 14% of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, according to August\u2019s Gallup poll, a 3% drop from the month prior. Depending on which side of the political aisle you fall, the face of the establishment could be House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi or Speaker of the House John Boehner \u2014 each known for their headline-making roles in passing and attempting to repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut as team behind Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s \u201cLie Witness News\u201d discovered, while Americans have strong opinions about Congress, they don\u2019t know much about who runs it.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like they aren\u2019t listening,\u201d one woman on the street of Los Angeles said about lawmakers. Yet that comment could arguably apply to her, as well. When prompted by Kimmel\u2019s undercover crew, she was unable to name her congressman. In fact, she was so out of the loop that the camera crew connived her into sending a message to Neville Longbottom, a fictional friend of Harry Potter from the magical series by J.K. Rowling.\n\nMore shocking is that she doesn\u2019t seem to be alone. The four other Americans questioned for the segment complained about the economy as a common source of discontent. But they also had a similar shortcoming: None could name a member of Congress to blame. Not one.\n\nWatch the full segment from \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d above to see the stunning and at times hilarious results.
