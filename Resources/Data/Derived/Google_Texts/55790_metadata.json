February 27, 2016 (Photo: Jenna Esarey, Special to the CJ)Buy Photo\n\nCelebrating its 25th anniversary, the Maple Syrup Festival at LM Sugarbush kicked off on Saturday, luring thousands to the Salem farm for a celebration of all things maple.\n\nThe two-weekend festival continues this Saturday and Sunday with live music, primitive craft vendors, maple-syrup making demonstrations, games, food and more.\n\nEach year, the festival draws large crowds - up to 12,000 by organizer\u2019s estimates. This year could be a record-breaker if Saturday\u2019s crowds were an indicator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this crowded this early,\u201d said Sugarbush co-owner Jennifer Reisenbichler.\n\nWith no admission or parking fees charged, festival organizers can only guess at actual attendance figures. Remaining family and budget-friendly is a priority. People \u201ccan come out here and eat, play the games and get a little jug of syrup for less than they\u2019d spend going to the movies,\u201d Reisenbichler said.\n\nShe and her husband Nic, along with her sister Emily and her husband Robert Blackman, purchased LM Sugarbush from their parents in 2013 and kept the popular festival going.\n\nTours to a 40-acre section of the 140-acre farm each day allow guests to witness sap collection from some of the approximately 4,500 maple trees.\n\nWith variable weather all winter, the sap run this year has been hit or miss, Reisenbichler said.\n\nBuy Photo A visitor gets a sampling of maple syrup during preparation at the 25th annual Maple Syrup Festival at LM Sugarbush in Salem on Saturday. (Photo: Jenna Esarey, Special to the CJ)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s below average, but better than it\u2019s been the last couple of years,\u201d she said.\n\nTo ensure an adequate supply of syrup for their guests, Sugarbush purchases additional syrup from local Amish families.\n\n\u201cThey are all within 16 miles of here and they use wood-fired evaporators just like we do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s identical to what we make here.\u201d\n\nVisitors could follow the changes in maple syrup technique over time as they watched demonstrations of Native American and pioneer preparations. In the sugarhouse, the modern process was displayed as steam rose from the wood-fired evaporator where fresh sap was converted to syrup before being bottled and rushed to the Sugar Store to be sold.\n\nThe Sugar Store offers several grades of maple syrup, maple candy, maple cream, maple cotton candy, Amish breads and more.\n\nHot food, ranging from pancakes and waffles all day to maple-barbecued chicken, pork chops and pulled pork dinners served from noon on, is always a draw with lines often wrapping around the building.\n\nTo alleviate some of the crowding, additional food vendors were added last year, offering barbecue, snacks and authentic Italian street food.\n\nA number of games and activities, from tomahawk throwing, rustic merry-go-round rides, handling a cross-cut saw, candle dipping and much more appealed to families.\n\n\u201cThis is our fifth straight year,\u201d said Jonathan Reynolds of Georgetown. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing to do.\u201d\n\nJohn Schmitt of Floyds Knobs commended the festival's originality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s great about it.,\" he said, \"there\u2019s not an X-Box or Nintendo in sight.\"\n\nIf You Go:\n\nMaple Syrup Festival at LM Sugarbush, 321 N Garrison Hollow Rd, Salem, IN 47167\n\nMarch 5 \u2013 6, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nFree admission and parking.\n\nMore information: lmsugarbush.com or call 812-967-4991 or 1-877-841-8851.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/2144LFq", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Maple Syrup Festival at LM Sugarbush kicked off Saturday luring thousands to the Salem farm for a celebration of all things maple.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "The Maple Syrup Festival at LM Sugarbush kicked off Saturday luring thousands to the Salem farm for a celebration of all things maple.", "title": "Festival celebrates all things maple", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2016/02/28/festival-celebrates-all-things-maple/81073258/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Maple Syrup Festival at LM Sugarbush kicked off Saturday luring thousands to the Salem farm for a celebration of all things maple.", "title": "Indiana Maple Syrup Festival lures thousands", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/74166112fc6bf47c3c9db44d193d327ded242e83/c=0-20-499-519&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/28/Louisville/Louisville/635922579550493301-maplesyrupvert.png", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Indiana", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Indiana", "title": "Festival celebrates all things maple", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/becb5b45f01dfce1f99257591f4b7e807ab335a1/c=0-0-499-665/local/-/media/2016/02/28/Louisville/Louisville/635922579550493301-maplesyrupvert.png", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a6d393d8f642b7bc2d6daf09f801cdfafb042af/c=0-20-499-519/local/-/media/2016/02/28/Louisville/Louisville/635922579550493301-maplesyrupvert.png", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41b4cc73f7e4d23709f033c869ffb180294a9e60/c=0-0-499-375/local/-/media/2016/02/28/Louisville/Louisville/635922579550493301-maplesyrupvert.png", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9c4277fae0a9192a145d3670c656647af920a85c/c=0-400-499-682&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/02/28/Louisville/Louisville/635922579550493301-maplesyrupvert.png", "publishtime": "2016-02-28T12:40:12.003000-05:00", "shorthed": "Love maple syrup?
