The genial TV and movie actor, who lives with wife Kathleen in Chelsea, Mich., had some fun in the backstage media room after his win, playing off his onstage acceptance speech in which he said the only award he\u2019d ever won was from AARP \u2013 a \u201cgolden Barcalounger.\u201d\n\nWhen, as an AARP writer, I asked him to tell us more, Daniels let the press room laughter subside before explaining: \u201cLet me say, I flew out special for that award! And you gave me a golden Barcalounger, a little golden Barcalounger about this big. I use it to hold my meds.\u201d\n\nMore seriously, Daniels said, \u201cI admitted to Kathleen, my wife, \u2018We\u2019re going to have to make room next to that because I \u2013 look, you know, I don\u2019t win much. It meant a lot and I was glad to get it.\u201d\n\nAnd as far as being acknowledged with an Emmy at age 58, he said, \u201cMy dad told me years ago, he said, \u2018You know, I think you\u2019re going to grow into your face.\u2019 I guess it might happen later for you.\u2019 He ran a lumber company, so what did he know about entertainment? But he was right.\u201d\n\nDaniels heads to Atlanta today to begin production on Dumb and Dumber 2 with Jim Carrey. Going from his brilliant Newsroom character, TV anchor Will McAvoy, to Harry Dunne, he said makes him feel as if he is \u201cin intellectual free-fall.\u201d\n\nDaniels was just one of many seasoned actors who won Sunday: Breaking Bad, led by Bryan Cranston\u2019s iconic performance as meth maker Walter White, won top Drama Series honors; Michael Douglas, won richly-deserved Outstanding Actor in a Miniseries or Movie honors for his work as Liberace in Behind the Candelabra; and Ellen Burstyn won for her work in USA\u2019s Political Animals. She thanked series creator Greg Berlanti for having \u201cthe wisdom to write a woman over 65 who still had a lot of juice.\u201d\n\nWe asked Douglas about thanking \u201cLee\u201d during his acceptance speech, and he said that indeed, he did feel close to Liberace\u2019s spirit while making the film. He said, \u201cOne day I was dealing with mortality issues with my cancer, the next day I was handed this jewel with Steven (Soderbergh) and Matt (Damon).\u201d Having to wait a year to get well before beginning Behind the Candelabra gave me a long time to sort of absorb Lee and the talents that he had\u2026It helped me a lot in terms of freedom of spirit, and gave me appreciation of Lee.\u201d\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus said that winning the Emmy for Veep, her fifth Emmy, \u201cmeans a ton, because I\u2019ve lost many, many more times. I\u2019ve lost 10 times, as a matter of fact.\u201d Asked where she was going to put the Emmy, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep with it.\u201d\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Daniels, who won Outstanding Lead actor in a Drama Series Sunday night for his performance in HBO\u2019s The Newsroom, will indeed be placing his new Emmy statue next to AARP\u2019s Movies for Grownups Award, which he won for the 2005 movie\u00a0The Squid and the Whale.
