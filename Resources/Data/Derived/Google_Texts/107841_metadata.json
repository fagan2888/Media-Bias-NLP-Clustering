They were not given a gift, they were given a opportunity. Many, like my ancestors that came in bondage, had to fight for that opportunity.\n\nAmerica is a land of opportunity. America is a land of great riches. America is a land filled with people from around the world. America is not an entitlement.\n\n\u201cGive me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d\n\nThe Statue of Liberty promises a door, but to walk through any door requires asking for entrance. Not demanding as these protestors did at the lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree, interrupting Speaker John Boehner\u2019s address:\n\nThis Christmas season, the president has handed five million plus illegal aliens a twelve days of Christmas present that is gift wrapped in expensive entitlements that he creates by an unconstitutional order. In giving that gift, stealing from the Americans, from first to generational immigrants, already here.\n\nRobert Rector of the Heritage Foundation insists that the president\u2019s amnesty order will plunge the nation into an even larger deficit hole. He suggests, \u201cThe net cost \u2014 which is total benefits minus total benefits paid in \u2014 of the amnesty recipients I estimate will be around $2 trillion over the course of their lifetime.\u201d\n\nFor the president who had insisted nearly two dozen times he did not have the authority to do so, his Christmas gift for illegal aliens bypasses the law. Even when President Lincoln granted freedom to slaves in the Confederate slave states, there were no entitlements attached for them.\n\nRead More: The Lincoln Catechism and President Barack Obama\n\nObama\u2019s political intentions to grant illegals a Christmas entitlement wish is a legal check that he does not have the authority to write or for them to cash while claiming that his amnesty order will not break the nation\u2019s budgetary bank. Well Obama\u2019s lies have a way of catching up with him. America remembers his, \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\u201d Or if you like your health plan you can keep it.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Christmas should be a celebration of truths and not lies. All Americans should support the hope of millions around the world who want to cherish and eventually legally possess what citizens possess in this great nation.\n\nWhen a president grants special favors, creates a nation where laws do not matter, and legalization of illegal entry is rewarded citizenship itself is devalued. In the end what type of nation is an America like that?\n\nThe \u201c12 Days of Illegal Immigrants\u2019 Christmas\u201d is a way to explain what Obama\u2019s executive order has done and how a broken system allows entitlements while ignoring the nation\u2019s legal immigration laws\n\n\u201cIllegal Immigrants\u2019 Twelve Days of Christmas\u201d\n\nOn the First Day of Christmas My Obama Executive Order gave to me a Social Security card given at a Walmart parking lot.
