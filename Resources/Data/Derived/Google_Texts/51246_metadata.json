Bill Owens, who went onto become governor, and Sen. Dennis Gallagher, now the Denver city auditor.\n\nWith the 2015 session ready to convene on Jan. 7, here\u2019s an interesting look back:\n\nLegislature tamer, duller, better, lawmakers a lot less wild, much drier than they used to be\n\n\n\nBy John Sanko\n\nThe Rocky Mountain News\n\nOct. 23. 1991\n\nThe Colorado legislature is a lot tamer than it used to be \u2014 thank goodness, insiders say.\n\nDrinking has been cut way back. The practical jokes have almost disappeared. Everyone seems a lot more serious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully dull,\u201d says Sen. Dottie Wham, R-Denver. \u201cIt\u2019s just not like it used to be. But it\u2019s for the better.\u201d\n\nLess wheeling and dealing may mean the wheels of government grind more slowly, though.\n\nColorado lawmakers, who couldn\u2019t wrap up their 25-day special session two weeks ago, trudge back to the statehouse today, hoping to finish what they began: work on the sensitive issues of school finance and congressional redistricting.\n\nThose chores would have been handled differently in bygone days.\n\nTen years ago, legislators tossed three different districting maps at Gov. Dick Lamm. He vetoed them all before the fight wound up in federal court. This year, legislators haven\u2019t agreed on a single map to send to Gov. Roy Romer.\n\nA decade ago, the unsettling fight over school funds would have been settled in a caucus, with some gentle arm-twisting and not-so-subtle threats.\n\n\u201cThe day of the all-autocratic leader is gone, never to return,\u201d said Senate president Ted Strickland, R-Westminster, an old arm-twister himself. \u201dAnd that\u2019s good in my judgment.\u201d\n\nWhy this kinder, gentler legislature?\n\nMany credit the 1972 \u201csunshine law\u201d as the start. It slowly has forced open meetings and caucuses. The final blow to blatant secrecy was the \u201cGive A Vote to Every Legislator\u201d amendment approved by voters in 1988. GAVEL made sure each bill got a vote and budgeting was done in the open.\n\nBut changes in personalities have had an effect, too.\n\nRep. Wayne Knox, D-Denver credits first-year House Speaker Chuck Berry, R-Colorado Springs. Berry replaced Carl \u201cBev\u201d Bledsoe, a symbol of the old-boy network, and was applauded at the end of the regular session in May for integrating Democrats.\n\nSen. Dennis Gallagher, D-Denver, said he\u2019s seen his minority party play a role in budgeting for the first time since he came to office in 1971.\n\nStrickland points to the departures of Sens. Steve Durham of Colorado Springs and Cliff Dodge of Denver, two of the more conservative elements of the Senate who tried unsuccessfully to dump Strickland from power. Dodge, a former member of the Joint Budget Committee, left in 1987 to become Denver\u2019s lobbyist; Durham didn\u2019t seek re-election the following year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d go down to The Profile and try to figure ways to prevent things from happening,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cThey\u2019d try to gum up the works.\u201d\n\nThe Profile, a local bar, used to be packed with legislators. But that\u2019s changed, too. Drinking is down. The poker table in the press room and the refrigerator stocked with beer have vanished.\n\nWith 120-day limits on sessions and with issues more complex than ever, Wham, who was first elected to the legislature in 1984, says the legislators are just too busy to spend their evenings carousing. Her husband, Bob, also previously served in the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be some kind of a sot to go out drinking until midnight and be at your desk next morning,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it used to be. And you don\u2019t see anybody drunk on the floor anymore.\u201d\n\nThe legislators are changing, too. Lawmakers are more likely to be city folk now, and a good number of them are from the Denver area.\n\nAlso, 32 of the 100 legislators are women. The \u201cgood ol\u2019 boy\u201d network is pretty much gone.\n\nInstead of going out at night, Sen. Bill Owens, R-Aurora, said most lawmakers have jobs and families to occupy their spare time.\n\nWith three children, ages 8, 5 and 6 months, Owens said his wife, Frances, \u201dis always eager for more assistance at home\u201d in the evenings.\n\n\u201cI think the legislature reflects changes in society,\u201d Owens said.\n\nRep. Jerry Kopel, D-Denver, attributes some change to the fact that legislators now have offices at the statehouse. Until the late 1960s, only legislative leaders had their own offices. Other lawmakers had only a desk on the House or Senate floor and shared a file cabinet with colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe were forced to communicate, forced to have a camaraderie, forced to know one another on a personal basis,\u201d Kopel said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true now. Now everybody takes off and goes off on their own. Sometimes a few legislators go out together. But it\u2019s isn\u2019t the old-boys fraternity that it used to be.\u201d\n\nThat means there\u2019s less kidding around on the legislative floors, fewer hijinks \u2014 such as the time the flags in the Senate were rigged to stand at attention when superpatriot Sen. Sam Zakhem spoke at the podium. Or when jokesters filled Senate president Freddy Anderson\u2019s water pitcher with vodka. Or the plastic tube hidden in a plant so cigar smoke could be blown at tobacco-hating Sen. Hugh Fowler.\n\nKopel, a former legislative staff bill writer and archives staffer, said one thing already had changed when he arrived in the mid-1960s \u2014 lobbyists no longer were allowed on the legislative floors.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201950s, when I was an employee here, I remember a guy from CF&I, the steel plant in Pueblo, one of the most powerful lobbyists at the time, sitting in the back of the House chambers. He would go up or down with his thumb like Roman emperors in the Colosseum.\n\n\u201cHeads would turn his way.\u201d\n\nThose were the bad old days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an open process anymore that it\u2019s really hard to think that skulduggery is going on,\u201d said Wham.\n\nBut more democracy takes more time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no getting around it. If you want shorter sessions, you have to have stronger arms to twist,\u201d Owens said. \u201cEverything takes longer today than it used to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bill Owens,Chuck Berry,Cliff Dodge,Dennis Gallagher,Dick Lamm,Dottie Wham,Jerry Kopel,John Sanko,Roy Romer,Steve Durham", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Colorado legislature has changed much over the years, with less drinking, fewer pranks and government out in the open.", "title": "Colorado legislature", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/22/colorado-legisature-good-ol-days/115526/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Colorado legislature has changed much over the years, with less drinking, fewer pranks and government out in the open.", "title": "The Colorado legisature: The good ol\u2019 days \u2014 or were they?", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/22/colorado-legisature-good-ol-days/115526/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Colorado legislature has changed much over the years, with less drinking, fewer pranks and more government out in the open."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb01f\"", "article_summary": "1991The Colorado legislature is a lot tamer than it used to be \u2014 thank goodness, insiders say.\nInstead of going out at night, Sen.
