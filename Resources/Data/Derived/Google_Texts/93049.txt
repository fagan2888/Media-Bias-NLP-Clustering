CRAIG — Firefighters on Friday were keeping a 20,000-acre blaze from spreading in northwestern Colorado as scattered showers fell in the area.

Lynn Barclay of the Northwest Colorado Fire Management Unit said Friday that the Alkali fire remained 75 percent contained, with full containment expected Sunday.

Barclay said some rain fell in the area overnight Thursday.

The fire has destroyed a cabin, barn and propane tank. No injuries have been reported, but three head of cattle were killed and ranchers moved other livestock.

The fire was reported Wednesday, and the cause was still under investigation. It’s burning on mostly private property and some federal land northwest of Craig.
