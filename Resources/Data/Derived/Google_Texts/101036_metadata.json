Lee Bright and Tom Davis to help push momentum for the bill which passed the House in June. The bill will be up for a special vote within the next few weeks, Davis says.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a terrible piece of legislation,\u201d Davis says. \u201cIt is ill-conceived and is having a damaging impact on the U.S. economy. It\u2019s making things more difficult for health-care providers. What we can do, as a state, is slow down the implementation until Congress can repeal it.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSouth Carolina Freedom of Health Care Protection Act,\u201d was sponsored by Rep. William Chumley in the House and Davis, who is also chair of a special committee investigating the constitutionality of the bill in its current form, in the Senate.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in June 2012, but Davis says states can still continue to push back against certain aspects of it.\n\nHe cites the \u201canti-commandeering doctrine\u201d which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1997 that says the federal government cannot direct states to use their funding to carry out federal laws.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cStates aren\u2019t subdivisions to help you [the federal government] carry out your law,\u201d he says. \u201cIn addition, the bill says no state subdivision will apply for grants or accept federal money or let you use our personnel, to implement the law.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina has also declined to create a state-run health-care exchange, so Davis argues that taxpayer cash within the state cannot be used to subsidize the cost of care for those purchasing coverage via federal exchanges.\n\nUnder the ACA, every individual in the country must have insurance by April 1 or they will face a penalty of $95, or 1% of their annual income for failing to comply with the law. Those fines will help to pay for the cost of subsidized care via state and federal exchanges.\n\nDavis\u2019 bill declines to expand Medicaid within the state, which would have the potential to bring South Carolina\u2019s pool of Medicaid participants to 1.6 million from 1.1 million, out of 4.6 million residents in the state.\n\n\u201cTo have 1.6 million people on federal Medicaid would be a disastrous policy for our state,\u201d Davis says. \u201cThe house of cards in D.C. will collapse, and the deficits will come home to roost. And when Congress has to get fiscally sane, money coming down will be the first thing they stop.\u201d\n\nBright says if the bill passes, it will slow government meddling into South Carolina residents\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we have to stand against this\u2014the federal government has gotten so intrusive in our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cSenators have to take a stand now, because if people don\u2019t act, the legislature wouldn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nHe says Chumley has received calls from other state lawmakers inquiring about the fate of the bill.\n\nAnd Davis says he feels confident the bill will move forward, and serve as a model for other states. \u201cI look forward to making my case, and feel strongly it will pass,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata":
