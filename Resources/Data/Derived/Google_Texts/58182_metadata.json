Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co., LLC v. Owens, No. 13-719 (Dec. 15, 2014).\n\nReversing the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the majority opinion (authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor) held that a notice of removal need not contain evidentiary submissions because the plain language of the removal statute itself requires only a \u201cshort and plain statement of the grounds for removal.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nIn the case below, the plaintiff, Brandon Owens, had filed a putative class action in Kansas state court alleging that defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company, LLC and Cherokee Basin Pipeline, LLC underpaid royalties they owed to Owens and the putative class members under oil and gas leases. The complaint failed to plead a specific amount of damages, seeking only \u201ca fair and reasonable amount\u201d of damages on behalf of Owens and the putative class members.\n\nThe defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas under CAFA. In their notice of removal, the defendants alleged that the purported underpayments to the putative class members totaled more than $8.2 million, but defendants did not attach to their notice of removal any evidence to support the alleged amount in controversy. The plaintiff moved to remand the case, alleging that the defendants\u2019 notice of removal was deficient because it failed to include evidence proving the amount in controversy exceeded the $5 million threshold under CAFA. The District Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand. A divided Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently denied defendants\u2019 petition for review and petition for en banc review.\n\nSupreme Court Decision\n\nIn the majority opinion, the Supreme Court noted the federal statute setting forth the requirements for a notice of removal (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a)) requires only that the notice contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.\u201d The majority went on to note that, \u201c[b]y design, \u00a7 1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated in Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d and that the legislative history of \u00a7 1446(a) indicates the statute was intended to \u201csimplify the pleading requirements for removal and . . . clarify that courts should apply the same liberal rules [to removal allegations] that are applied to other matters of pleading.\u201d\n\nThe majority went on to explain that \u201cwhen a defendant seeks federal-court adjudication, the defendant\u2019s amount-in-controversy allegation should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.\u201d When the plaintiff does contest the defendant\u2019s amount-in-controversy allegation, the majority held, \u201cboth sides submit proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied.\u201d The majority concluded by stating that a notice of removal need only include \u201ca plausible allegation\u201d that the amount in controversy is met, and evidence to establish the amount in controversy is required only when the amount in controversy is contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent (which was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Elena Kagan, and joined in part by Justice Clarence Thomas) did not focus on the underlying question regarding the requirements for removal under CAFA. The dissent questioned whether the Supreme Court could even address the substantive issue in light of certain procedural and jurisdictional questions, and does not call into question the reasoning of the majority\u2019s substantive holding.\n\n***\n\nThe majority\u2019s opinion resolves a prior split among circuit courts regarding a defendant\u2019s burden when removing a case under CAFA. The law is now settled that a removing defendant need only make a good faith allegation in the notice of removal regarding the amount in controversy in order to meet its burden on removal. Only if the amount in controversy is challenged must a defendant offer evidence. Moreover, the majority made it clear that there is no presumption against removal jurisdiction in cases removed under CAFA, rejecting an argument often made by the plaintiffs contesting removal under CAFA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a divided 5-to-4 opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that defendants seeking to remove a case to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act need only allege in the notice of removal an amount in controversy in excess of the $5 million threshold and need not attach evidence to the notice of removal proving the amount in controversy.
