To reduce regulations, to actually change the way of thinking about government today.\"\n\n\"We've become a regulatory and controlled society because of everything that's been going on; through taxes, through regulations, through frankly, the big media, through the political parties, which are trying to dominate the choices that people have,\" Gilmore continued. \"And I think that people are angry and frustrated.\"\n\n\"As president of the United States,\" Gilmore said, \"I intend to address the issue of how we can learn to be free people again, and really look back to our Constitution ... and Declaration [of Independence] and remember that our rights don't come from the government or from regulators. They come from God and they're natural rights. And we need to remember that and learn how to be free people again.\"\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Donald Trump outsources campaign operations to RNC Some Republicans fear the RNC will be too consumed with Trump to focus on House, Senate and governors races.\n\nGilmore concluded the interview stressing that he is \"not the kind of person who is going to try and destroy everything,\" but is also \"not a person who is satisfied with this go along to get along type of approach that we've been seeing in Washington, D.C.\"\n\n\"I'm asking asking people in the movement ... not to be seduced by some of these other people who are phonies and pretend conservatives,\" Gilmore said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidate Jim Gilmore says that while angry and frustrated conservatives are tired of the incremental strategy of congressional Republican leaders, Sen.
