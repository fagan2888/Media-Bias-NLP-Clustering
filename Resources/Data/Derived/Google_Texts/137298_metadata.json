Comcast had recently met with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. The deal had been troubled for weeks.\n\nThe Justice Department and FCC had reason to carefully evaluate the merger, which was first announced in Feb. 2014 and had been expected at the time to be completed by the end of 2014 or early 2015. If the two companies had joined, they would have controlled just under 30 percent of the country\u2019s pay TV market and, by one measure, roughly 57 percent of the broadband Internet market (Comcast put the figure at 35 percent).\n\nComcast\u2019s argument that the merger would have minimal competitive harm seems to have unraveled. Here\u2019s some of what could have gone wrong.\n\nTV program stifling\n\nComcast is already the largest video and TV service distributor in the country, according to the Leichtman Research Group. With a wider geographic footprint, it could have usedits weight to push out competition on TV airwaves, according to critics of the merger. In fact, it already has. Comcast refused to carry Univision\u2019s sports network, Deportes Univision, one of the largest sports networks in the country and a competitor to Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal and Comcast. Randy Falco, Univision\u2019s CEO, said in an earnings call in Apr. 2014 just after the merger was proposed that he feared \u201cthis type of anticompetitive conduct would continue.\u201d Comcast responded by saying it \u201chas had an extraordinary, long-standing commitment to Hispanic programming,\u201d adding through its merger with Time Warner Cable it is \u201ccommitted to bringing high-quality Hispanic content to millions of additional Americans.\u201d Just five months later, Comcast announced that it would offer Univision Deportes to its Xfinity TV subscribers in certain urban Latino markets.\n\nJohn Bergmayer, senior staff attorney at Public Knowledge, expressed concerned that these practices would expand if Comcast merged with Time Warner Cable, bringing the combined company the ability to reach 33 million cable subscribers. \u201cIn a world of lots of smaller video distributors, no one of them has the ability to single-handedly dictate terms like that since a video programmer could walk away,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nMonopoly on broadband Internet service\n\nAside from TV, Comcast would have a number of mechanisms to squeeze out online companies. A typical household requires at least 25 mbps of Internet speed to go about their daily online routines. That might include watching an HD video over Netflix while also posting pictures to Instagram as another person in the home works on their laptop. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are two of the country\u2019s major providers of broadband service of this speed. If they were to merge, there would be few other Internet service providers that could compete, leaving many content companies like Google\u2019s YouTube with only one option to reach their subscribers, according to FCC filings by opponents of the merger. In this scenario, a merged Comcast/Time Warner Cable behemoth could leverage its interconnection points, which is where services like YouTube connect to stream video to their customers. Comcast could keep YouTube from offering services over its network, degrade their traffic or charge them a high fee to connect to Comcast customers. DISH Network wrote to the FCC that such chokeholds \u201cover the broadband pipe would stifle future video competition and innovation, all to the detriment of consumers,\u201d adding that the merger would consolidate \u201ctoo much power in the hands of too few.\u201d Comcast argued that it would \u201cbring significant benefits to Time Warner Cable customers, including higher Internet speeds and greater reliability.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The merger looked like a done deal as recently as last week, despite FCC concerns.
