But while the Republican\u2019s record mirrors that of other tea party-backed members of Congress, his rhetoric is noticeably cooler.\n\nThat much was clear during his recent conversation with members of the Trotter Group, a national association of African-American columnists, who spent a few days in Washington meeting with policymakers from various parties and persuasions.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott (Rainier Ehrhardt/AP)\n\nThough proud of his record, Scott led with biography, his life story as a confused and unsettled child of divorce, moving from Michigan back to South Carolina. \u201cFrom 7 years old to about 14, I kind of just drifted,\u201d he said, mostly in the wrong direction. A business owner mentor stepped in to assist his hard-working mother, he said, and \u201cstarted talking to me about thinking your way out of poverty.\u201d Scott became a business owner \u2013 working in insurance, an expertise that comes in handy when explaining his opposition to the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a Christian and the state\u2019s first black senator since Reconstruction.\n\nNow, along with Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey, with whom he said he\u2019s had some \u201creally good conversations already,\u201d Scott is one of just two African Americans in the U.S. Senate. How will he stay there? Scott, the former U.S. congressman appointed by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Jim DeMint, who resigned to lead the Heritage Foundation, has been serving since January. He will have to win an election next year to serve the two years that remain in DeMint\u2019s term, which should not be difficult with his antiabortion, small government, low tax views in a state with only one Democrat, James Clyburn, in its Congressional delegation. Scott had to beat the son of South Carolina icon Strom Thurmond in the primary to win his House seat, which was no small feat.\n\nBut there\u2019s the example of the state\u2019s senior senator, Lindsey Graham, who is facing challenges from those who question his conservative credentials in his own 2014 race. Scott \u2014 who has declined to endorse Graham \u2014 has to be mindful of the voters who have gotten him this far while trying to appeal to the largest possible constituency.\n\nIn the Washington meeting, Scott listened to research from David Bositis, acting vice president of the Civic Engagement and Governance Institute of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which found that in South Carolina, 65 percent overall and 85 percent of African Americans favored the Medicaid expansion. Scott, who is against it, turned the conversation to \u201chealth outcomes\u201d as opposed to buying health insurance. \u201cOur focus ought to be on preventative medicine,\u201d Scott said.\n\nScott acknowledged the above national average 18 percent uninsured in his state, about 700,000, he said. He talked about a program at his church that brings doctors, nurses and dentists into communities that have challenges. \u201cCan we make health care more accessible and affordable?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe answer is yes. Does it happen better when we have the federal government play a larger and larger role? My answer is no.\u201d\n\nScott never used the term \u201cObamacare\u201d; for that, you have to look at his campaign Web site.\n\nOn race, Scott was similarly careful, touting his history of impressive wins in majority white districts, though the black voters there usually favor the Democrat. \u201cIf we spend less time trying to just attract the minorities to our party and more time trying to win people to our philosophy, then the elections will take care of themselves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Cory and myself to work together across these aisles and find some common ground on some legislative path forward,\u201d Scott said.\u201dWe believe there\u2019s an opportunity on the issue of education to do so.\u201d When I asked if he would ever consider joining the Congressional Black Caucus so he and his friend could have more time for policy discussions, he said no, he didn\u2019t see a need to join. \u201cWe\u2019re better together,\u201d he said.\n\nScott knows his audience, all of them. He can give personal testimony about the role of Jesus Christ in his life at the faith-centered Bob Jones Academy in Greenville, S.C., and answer questions with talking points \u2013 as most politicians do \u2014 at a Washington meeting of journalists.\n\nHis Democratic opponent next year could be former Commerce Department official and South Carolina native Rick Wade, who has entered the race for the nomination and who is also African American.\n\nScott has managed to toe a strict conservative line while being firm and friendly. Right now, he is ahead in the race to make history as the first African American elected statewide in South Carolina since Reconstruction.
