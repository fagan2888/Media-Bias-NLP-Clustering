The 13-year-old pitcher from Philadelphia \u2014 one of two girls in the Williamsport, Pennsylvania, series \u2014 threw a two-hit shutout in the opening game for her team.\n\nThe original \u201cQueen of Baseball\u201d would be proud.\n\nOnly 18 girls have ever played in the Little League World Series, and just four of them have been American. So now we celebrate the return of young girls \u2014 and maybe women \u2014 to the game of baseball with boys and perhaps men as if it is breaking new ground.\n\nIt is, though, a return. A century ago, women playing the National Pastime was not such a novelty. Their numbers were growing, and so were the occasional opportunities to play with and against men on a competitive level.\n\nBut, ironically, it was Little League Baseball that dealt the death blow to women playing with the founding of the organization in 1939 and the decision that it would be for boys only.\n\nSoftball began growing in popularity, and was emphasized by physical educators as a less strenuous way for women to participate in the competition of baseball. Women who were determined to play hardball did so among themselves, the most well-known outlet of which was the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, founded by Chicago Cubs owner Philip Wrigley during World War II.\n\nBut just two decades earlier, the door had seemingly been open for women to possibly be more than a wartime exhibition. There was debate about whether women would be playing baseball with men. And at the center of the debate was the original \u201cQueen of Baseball\u201d \u2014 Lizzie Murphy.\n\nShe grew up in a man\u2019s world \u2014 born in Warren, Rhode Island, in 1894, and working in one of the textile mills there when she was 12 years old. When she wasn\u2019t working, she would compete against the boys in town in all sorts of sports \u2014 baseball in particular.\n\nIn an interview years later, Murphy talked about how her love for the game grew.\n\n\u201cI was always dreaming of the outdoors and baseball,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when I was too small to play, I used to beg the boys to let me carry the bats. Finally, I was allowed to join the team for only one reason \u2014 I used to steal my father\u2019s gloves and bats and bring them along, so I was a valuable asset to them when I could furnish some of the equipment.\u201d\n\nSoon she became more valuable as a player, and by the age of 15, she was playing for the top amateur baseball clubs in town \u2014 the Warren Silk Hats, the perennial Inter-State League champions, and the Warren Baseball Club.\n\nMurphy would be recruited to play for the town semi-pro baseball team, and became its star attraction. She had the talent and the toughness to survive and thrive in a man\u2019s game.\n\nThe story goes that the team managed to bring in $85 for her first appearance in a game, but when the money was divided among the team, she received nothing. That didn\u2019t happen again.\n\nWarren had a big game coming up on the road in Newport, and Murphy\u2019s presence on the Warren team was a big selling point for promoting the game. So when it came time to get on the bus for the game in Newport, Murphy told the manager she wasn\u2019t going unless she got a cut of the gate. \u201cNo money, no Newport,\u201d she said.\n\nMurphy got her money.\n\nThe legend of Lizzie Murphy grew, and so did her stature in the game. She began playing pro ball full-time in 1918 for the Providence Independents, and toured around New England.\n\nEddie Carr noticed. The ballplayer/performer had put together a popular barnstorming pro team known as \u201cEddie Carr\u2019s All Stars,\u201d playing about 100 games throughout the summer in New York, New England and Canada. He signed Murphy to play first base for the club.\n\n\u201cNo ball is too hard for her to scoop out of the dirt,\u201d Carr told reporters upon signing Lizzie. \u201cAnd when it comes to batting, she packs a mean Wagon Tongue\u201d \u2014 a brand of bat manufactured by Spalding.\n\nMurphy was the star of the All-Stars \u2014 the only player to have her name on the front and back of her uniform. She sold postcards with her picture on them to the crowds, and sold tickets for the team with her presence.\n\n\u201cShe swells attendance, and she\u2019s worth every cent I pay her,\u201d Carr said. \u201cBut more important, she produces the goods. She\u2019s a real player and a good fellow.\u201d\n\nThen came the moment \u2014 Aug. 14, 1922, at Fenway Park in Boston \u2014 where Murphy would step on the field against major league ballplayers.\n\nIt was an exhibition charity game featuring the All-Stars against the Boston Red Sox. Murphy was not in the starting lineup, but entered the game later at first base, where she played two innings, and got the attention of the crowd by fielding a wide throw from the third baseman to get the runner at first.\n\nHer appearance gained national attention, and seemed, given the tenure of the times \u2014 women emerging in political and social circles \u2014 that Murphy had perhaps paved the way for women in the men\u2019s game.\n\nBut it never came to pass.\n\nMurphy would go on to play another less-heralded all-star game against the Boston Braves in 1928, and made an appearance with the Cleveland Colored Giants in the Negro Leagues.\n\nShe stopped playing in 1935, married two years later and worked a variety of jobs in the mills in Warren and on oyster boats. Murphy died on April, 17, 1964, at the age of 70 \u2014 a pioneer who could play a slick first base, the \u201cQueen of Baseball.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 radio and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only 18 girls have ever played in the Little League World Series, and just four of them have been American.
