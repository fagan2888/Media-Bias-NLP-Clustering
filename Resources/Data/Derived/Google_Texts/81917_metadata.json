On the same day, Swedish officials cited the escalating military tension as a reason to continue re-arming the strategically important Gotland Island off that country\u2019s eastern coast.\n\nAround noon on Monday, according to Finnish defense officials, a monitoring system detected what appeared to be a submarine in the waters off Helsinki. Ships were dispatched to search the area, and after they made additional contact on Tuesday, they dropped depth charges near the vessel to drive it off.\n\nRelated: Defiant Putin Calls Invasion of Crimea \u2018Historic Justice\u2019\n\nA Finnish naval spokesman told reporters that the charges dropped were not intended to damage the vessel \u2013 they were the size of a hand grenade \u2013 but were meant to make it clear that its presence had not gone unnoticed.\n\nWhat government officials did not specify, but was widely assumed, was that if there was a submarine in Finland\u2019s territorial waters, it was probably Russian. Countries in the Baltic region and even as far away as the United Kingdom have seen increasingly aggressive activity by Russian warplanes and naval vessels.\n\nThe reports about Russia led to increased calls Tuesday for the government of Sweden to re-establish a strong military presence on the Baltic island of Gotland, which lies in a strategically important area northwest of the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The chairman of the legislature\u2019s defense committee told fellow lawmakers that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201cpreparing for war.\u201d Media reports say the Swedish government now aims to reverse what has been dramatic reduction in military presence on Gotland in recent years by stationing an infantry battle group, a tank company and new naval assets there in the future.\n\nRelated: Did Putin Snag U.S. Uranium and Sell it to Iran?\n\nThe anxiety about Russian intentions in Finland and Sweden is mirrored in numerous countries in northern Europe. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year, and in the face of its continued support of armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine, many have called for military expansion and have sought closer cooperation with the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has traditionally served as a counterweight against Russia.\n\nPutin did nothing to ease his neighbors\u2019 concerns when, over the weekend, Russian state television released a documentary in which Putin said that, among other things, he views the various former Soviet Socialist Republics in Eastern Europe as territories that Russia voluntarily granted freedom to, not necessarily as sovereign nations with the right of self-determination.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Finland dropped depth charges on a suspected submarine, and Sweden looked to fortify a key island in the Baltic, as concerns about Russian aggression grew in Northern Europe.", "title": "Finns Flip Out Over Putin War Games", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/29/Finns-Flip-Out-Over-Putin-War-Games", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04272012_Putin_19_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/29/Finns-Flip-Out-Over-Putin-War-Games", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04272012_Putin_19_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Finland dropped depth charges on a suspected submarine, and Sweden looked to fortify a key island in the Baltic, as concerns about Russian aggression grew in Northern Europe.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7e4\"", "article_summary": "Around noon on Monday, according to Finnish defense officials, a monitoring system detected what appeared to be a submarine in the waters off Helsinki.\nOn the same day, Swedish officials cited the escalating military tension as a reason to continue re-arming the strategically important Gotland Island off that country\u2019s eastern coast.\nWhat government officials did not specify, but was widely assumed, was that if there was a submarine in Finland\u2019s territorial waters, it was probably Russian.\nCountries in the Baltic region and even as far away as the United Kingdom have seen increasingly aggressive activity by Russian warplanes and naval vessels.\nThe anxiety about Russian intentions in Finland and Sweden is mirrored in numerous countries in northern Europe."}
