Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute posted a blog entry with the provocative title: \u201cWhy Is Obama Trying to Make America More Like Sweden when Swedes Are Trying to Be Less Like Sweden?\u201d\n\nGood question! When you put it that way, it does seem pretty perverse. Why, Mr. President, are we swimming against the current of history, while social welfare states around the world\u2014even rich little Sweden!\u2014are cutting back on expensive benefits and high taxes? \u201cIf Swedes have learned from their mistakes and are now trying to reduce the size and scope of government,\u201d Mitchell writes, \u201cwhy are American politicians determined to repeat those mistakes?\u201d\n\nAnswering this question will require an extremely scientific chart. Here\u2019s what the world looks like to the Cato Institute:\n\nThe x-axis represents Swedishness, and the y-axis is some measure of prosperity. Don\u2019t worry about exactly how we\u2019re quantifying these things. The point is just this: according to the chart, the more Swedish you are, the worse off your country is. The Swedes, no fools, have figured this out and are launching their northwestward climb toward free-market prosperity. But Obama\u2019s sliding in the wrong direction.\n\nLet me draw the same picture from the point of view of people whose economic views are closer to President Obama\u2019s than to those of the Cato Institute:\n\nThis picture gives very different advice about how Swedish we should be. Where do we find peak prosperity? At a point more Swedish than America, but less Swedish than Sweden. If this picture is right, it makes perfect sense for Obama to beef up our welfare state while the Swedes trim theirs down.\n\nThe difference between the two pictures is the difference between linearity and nonlinearity, one of the central distinctions in mathematics. The Cato curve is a line; the non-Cato curve, the one with the hump in the middle, is not. A line is one kind of curve, but not the only kind, and lines enjoy all kinds of special properties that curves in general may not. The highest point on a line segment\u2014the maximum prosperity, in this example\u2014has to be on one end or the other. That\u2019s just how lines are. If lowering taxes is good for prosperity, then lowering taxes even more is even better. And if Sweden wants to de-Swede, so should we. Of course, an anti-Cato think tank might posit that the line slopes in the other direction, going southwest to northeast. And if that\u2019s what the line looks like, then no amount of social spending is too much. The optimal policy is Maximum Swede.\n\nUsually, when someone announces they\u2019re a \u201cnonlinear thinker\u201d they\u2019re about to apologize for losing something you lent them. But nonlinearity is a real thing! And in this context, thinking nonlinearly is crucial, because not all curves are lines. A moment of reflection will tell you that the real curves of economics look like the second picture, not the first. They\u2019re nonlinear. Mitchell\u2019s reasoning is an example of false linearity\u2014he\u2019s assuming, without coming right out and saying so, that the course of prosperity is described by the line segment in the first picture, in which case Sweden stripping down its social infrastructure means we should do the same.\n\nBut as long as you believe there\u2019s such a thing as too much welfare state and such a thing as too little, you know the linear picture is wrong. Some principle more complicated than \u201cMore government bad, less government good\u201d is in effect. The generals who consulted Abraham Wald faced the same kind of situation: too little armor meant planes got shot down, too much meant the planes couldn\u2019t fly. It\u2019s not a question of whether adding more armor is good or bad; it could be either, depending on how heavily armored the planes are to start with. If there\u2019s an optimal answer, it\u2019s somewhere in the middle, and deviating from it in either direction is bad news.\n\nNonlinear thinking means which way you should go depends on where you already are.\n\nThis insight isn\u2019t new. Already in Roman times we find Horace\u2019s famous remark \u201cEst modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines, quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum\u201d (\u201cThere is a proper measure in things. There are, finally, certain boundaries short of and beyond which what is right cannot exist\u201d). And further back still, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle observes that eating either too much or too little is troubling to the constitution. The optimum is somewhere in between; because the relation between eating and health isn\u2019t linear, but curved, with bad outcomes on both ends.\n\nSomething-doo economics\n\nThe irony is that economic conservatives like the folks at Cato used to understand this better than anybody. That second picture I drew up there? The extremely scientific one with the hump in the middle? I am not the first person to draw it. It\u2019s called the Laffer curve, and it\u2019s played a central role in Republican economics for almost forty years. By the middle of the Reagan administration, the curve had become such a commonplace of economic discourse that Ben Stein ad-libbed it into his famous soul-killing lecture in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d:\n\nAnyone know what this is? Class? Anyone? . . . Anyone? Anyone seen this before? The Laffer Curve. Anyone know what this says? It says that at this point on the revenue curve, you will get exactly the same amount of revenue as at this point. This is very controversial. Does anyone know what Vice President Bush called this in 1980? Anyone? Something-doo economics. \u201cVoodoo\u201d economics.\n\nThe legend of the Laffer curve goes like this: Arthur Laffer, then an economics professor at the University of Chicago, had dinner one night in 1974 with Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Wall Street Journal editor Jude Wanniski at an upscale hotel restaurant in Washington, DC. They were tussling over President Ford\u2019s tax plan, and eventually, as intellectuals do when the tussling gets heavy, Laffer commandeered a napkin and drew a picture. The picture looked like this:\n\nThe horizontal axis here is level of taxation, and the vertical axis represents the amount of revenue the government takes in from taxpayers. On the left edge of the graph, the tax rate is 0%; in that case, by definition, the government gets no tax revenue. On the right, the tax rate is 100%; whatever income you have, whether from a business you run or a salary you\u2019re paid, goes straight into Uncle Sam\u2019s bag.\n\nWhich is empty. Because if the government vacuums up every cent of the wage you\u2019re paid to show up and teach school, or sell hardware, or middle-manage, why bother doing it? Over on the right edge of the graph, people don\u2019t work at all. Or, if they work, they do so in informal economic niches where the tax collector\u2019s hand can\u2019t reach. The government\u2019s revenue is zero once again.\n\nIn the intermediate range in the middle of the curve, where the government charges us somewhere between none of our income and all of it\u2014in other words, in the real world\u2014the government does take in some amount of revenue.\n\nThat means the curve recording the relationship between tax rate and government revenue cannot be a straight line. If it were, revenue would be maximized at either the left or right edge of the graph; but it\u2019s zero both places. If the current income tax is really close to zero, so that you\u2019re on the left-hand side of the graph, then raising taxes increases the amount of money the government has available to fund services and programs, just as you might intuitively expect. But if the rate is close to 100%, raising taxes actually decreases government revenue. If you\u2019re to the right of the Laffer peak, and you want to decrease the deficit without cutting spending, there\u2019s a simple and politically peachy solution: lower the tax rate, and thereby increase the amount of taxes you take in. Which way you should go depends on where you are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How Republicans embraced a promising economic theory \u2014\u00a0and distorted it beyond recognition", "author": "Jordan Ellenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How Republicans embraced a promising economic theory \u2014\u00a0and distorted it beyond recognition", "title": "Math vs. Reaganomics: Why GOP\u2019s anti-tax hysteria falls flat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/math_vs_reaganomics_why_gops_anti_tax_hysteria_falls_flat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ronald_reagan_math.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How Republicans embraced a promising economic theory \u2014\u00a0and distorted it beyond recognition", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ronald_reagan_math.jpg", "title": "Math vs. Reaganomics: Why GOP\u2019s anti-tax hysteria falls flat", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Math vs. Reaganomics: Why GOP\u2019s anti-tax hysteria falls flat", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Economics, Mathematics, Reaganomics, Ronald Reagan, Supply-side economics, The Laffer Curve, trickle-down economics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5626\"", "article_summary": "It says that at this point on the revenue curve, you will get exactly the same amount of revenue as at this point.\nOn the left edge of the graph, the tax rate is 0%; in that case, by definition, the government gets no tax revenue.\nThe Laffer Curve.\nIt\u2019s called the Laffer curve, and it\u2019s played a central role in Republican economics for almost forty years.\nThe Cato curve is a line; the non-Cato curve, the one with the hump in the middle, is not."}
