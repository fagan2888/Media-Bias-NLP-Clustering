The sketches resemble the victim's tattoos on his upper right chest, a seal of the Cherokee Nation and an image of bull skull with a snake that represented a Cherokee Indian legend.

Investigators are following leads in the case of a body burned and dumped in Logan county.



"When you burn someone it sends a significant message," Captain Richard Stephens of the Logan County Sheriff's Office said.

It's not a well received message in town. The discovery of a body with its arms and legs bound and then burned is unnerving, even to investigators.

"It's pretty malicious and evil," Stephens said.

So investigators are hoping a key piece of evidence, forensic sketches of tattoos, will help identify the victim and ultimately the suspect.

The sketches resemble the victim's tattoos on his upper right chest, a seal of the Cherokee Nation and an image of bull skull with a snake that represented a Cherokee Indian legend.

Jimmy Paulk, a tattoo artist at Atomic Lotus in Oklahoma City, explained that tribal tattoos are common in Oklahoma, but the combination of the two images could stand out to someone.



"If you show it out to the public, someone will recognize their own work," Paulk said.

Paulk mentioned that the tattoo artists have helped authorities in the past.

"If we've done a tattoo, then we have records," Paulk said.

During his 20 plus years of experience, Paulk has done one tattoo of the Cherokee Nation Seal and admits he's never seen the bull skull tattoo before.

"Every tribe has their own unique stuff," Paulk added.

He recommends taking a close look at the rendering to see you if recognize the tattoo from family members or friends.
