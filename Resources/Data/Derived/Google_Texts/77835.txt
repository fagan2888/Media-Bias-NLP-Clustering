CA Senate OKs Expanded Scope-of-Practice Bill for Optometrists

The bill permits qualified optometrists to administer flu shots and two other vaccinations to adults and to perform some minor procedures.

In another legislative move that could help ease the physician shortage in California, lawmakers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of expanding the scope of practice for optometrists.

The California State Senate on May 22 approved a bill that would allow optometrists to perform minor eye surgeries and administer vaccinations to adults. The senate voted 34-4 to approve Senate Bill 622, which was authored by Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina).

The bill, which would allow optometrists to pursue additional training and expand their scope of service into one area of primary care, will move next to the state Assembly for consideration.

"The Affordable Care Act has placed three million additional Californians into our healthcare system," says Hernandez. "This bill will allow doctors of optometry to examine, diagnose, prevent, and treat conditions to the full extent of their training."

In order to be accredited for expanded services, optometrists will need to be certified and undergo "50 hours of post-doctoral education and training on human patients." Optometrists who undergo training will be able to administer vaccinations to people aged 18 and older for influenza, herpes zoster, and pneumonia. With proper training, optometrists will also be eligible to perform laser procedures to treat glaucoma and minor surgeries that entail removing small lesions from the surface of the eyelid.
