There was a red-meat talk to a union crowd, a high-profile cable-news interview about why he sees no reason not to run in 2016, and then there\u2019s the fact that he is getting back on the train again.\n\nSharply dressed in a sharp navy suit and pocket square, the affable Veep rode the Amtrak to Philadelphia Thursday, inviting a couple of reporters along for the ride. Sitting down with TIME on Thursday in his rolling office, a first-class car surrounded by aides and bodyguards, Biden interspersed nearly every answer with a reminder that he is more than \u201cPresident of the Amtrak fan club,\u201d as his traveling partner, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, would introduce him at an afternoon event.\n\n\n\nThe ostensible reason for the trip was a new job he had just been handed, managing a new a career-training portfolio given to him by President Barack Obama. But there are other things to talk about too, and it just happens to be the sort of stuff you would hear from a guy who plans to run for President. He\u2019s traveled more than 800,000 miles carrying out foreign policy, he boasts. \u201cI\u2019ve known and continue to know every one of these major world leaders by their first names and I have access to them,\u201d he says. He reminds the reporter he oversaw the 2009 Recovery Act. \u201cLess than 1% waste, fraud or abuse in the system,\u201d he gushes in his speech later, quoting a Republican calling it \u201cthe best-run federal government program.\u201d Then there\u2019s Iraq, the Americas, \u201cthe Pacific Basin, China, Japan and Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cAs well as what I\u2019m doing now, like Ukraine. You know I\u2019m the guy on the phone every day \u2014 well, not every day, but \u2026\u201d\n\n(MORE: White House Defends Joe Biden From Gates Criticism)\n\nHe\u2019s got plenty to say about domestic policy too. \u201cI\u2019ve been basically the guy who has the final say in the criminal-justice side of the budget,\u201d he says. And he is perfectly happy to talk about how he compares with others in his job. He cites one of historian Robert Caro\u2019s biographies on Lyndon Johnson to highlight his role in the Obama Administration. \u201cThere is no inherent power in the office of the vice presidency. Zero. None. It\u2019s all a reflection of your relationship with the President,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, Kennedy never let Johnson in the office. I spend somewhere between four and seven hours a day with the President.\u201d\n\nOf course, none of this means Biden is definitely running for President. It\u2019s hard to see Biden mounting a campaign if Hillary Clinton runs. In a January Quinnipiac University survey, Biden polled as a distant second among Democratic primary voters with 8%, compared with Clinton\u2019s 65%. And even if she doesn\u2019t, he faces an uphill battle, fighting history (former VPs have fared poorly at the ballot box) and his underwater favorability numbers. \u201cThere may be reasons I don\u2019t run, but there\u2019s no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run,\u201d Biden told CNN on Friday, adding he\u2019d make up his mind next summer. Clinton, meanwhile, has pledged to make a decision by the end of the year.\n\nBut Biden is a political shark, an old-school pol who never stops swimming forward. He wants to leave his options open, and maybe more than anything be talked about running. If he decides to run, it would be his third attempt. He\u2019s undoubtedly better known and better prepared, and has racked up a significant roster of accomplishments \u2014 even if he\u2019s a little too eager to share them.\n\n\u201cYou guys are the only guys keeping the barbarians at the gate,\u201d he told the United Automobile Workers at their annual meeting in Washington last week. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was irked by Biden calling LaGuardia Airport something of the third world, but it was far from an offhand comment. Biden knows how to grab headlines. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing and it\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s stupid. It puts us literally behind,\u201d he says of the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\n\nFor Biden, the challenge has always been how to square both sides of his persona: the man who wants to sell you a Corvette and the deeply influential policy hand. But that duality is also his strength. Clinton may not have driven a car in 20 years, but Biden can\u2019t wait to get behind the wheel of the new Stingray. On the campaign trail in 2012, it was that combination that allowed him to connect in the blue collar areas unreceptive to Obama. \u201cThe middle class is shrinking. Income inequity has to be addressed,\u201d he says in Philadelphia. But he adds, \u201cThe world knows America\u2019s coming back stronger than ever before.\u201d\n\n(VIDEO: Vice President Joe Biden Gives Keynote Speech)\n\nAs Democrats flee Obama, Biden says he plans to help at least 150 Democrats in midterm elections this year. \u201cI used to be talked about as the young, idealistic guy who was optimistic, and they now write about me as the White House optimist as if I\u2019m the guy, as my grandpa from Scranton would say, who just fell off the turnip truck yesterday,\u201d Biden tells the crowd in Philadelphia, repeating a theme that helped re-elect Obama and just might elect himself one more. \u201cI\u2019ve been there longer than all of them, but I guarantee you there\u2019s a total justification for my incredible optimism about this country. It\u2019s time. It\u2019s time to move.\u201d\n\nAs the train car made its way up the Acela corridor, a trip he estimates he has made 7,800 times, Biden spoke exclusively with TIME. Here is a lightly edited transcript of that exchange.\n\nMatt Rourke / AP\n\nAfter the State of the Union, the President gave you the job-training portfolio. What\u2019s your goal now for the second term? What would you like to do differently? What would you like to leave office having accomplished?\n\nWell, look, No. 1, there\u2019s really no change in responsibility. When I took office, when the President and I talked about my coming on as a vice-presidential candidate and his Vice President, I asked him why he wanted me on, and he said he wanted me to help him govern because I have a fair amount of experience and because if you go back and look at those 13 debates we had, the only two people who never disagreed on a policy matter were Barack and me. I mean, seriously. It\u2019s not a joke. Although we\u2019ve disagreed occasionally on tactics since he\u2019s been President. So it makes it really easy. So he said, What portfolio do you want? And he talked about how [former Vice President Dick] Cheney had a portfolio and [former Vice President Al] Gore, and all the important Vice Presidents. And I said, I don\u2019t want a portfolio. I said I wanted two things. One, I get to be the last guy in the room when every decision gets made. And literally, not figuratively. Literally. So after we do a national-security meeting, and I speak my mind there and the rest of everybody else does, I get to walk back up to the Oval with him and sit down. And [that\u2019s] the reason why it always surprised me when everyone says they know what I advised the President. My final advice is always he and I alone. No. 2, I said I want assignments that have sell-by dates on them. Because the one thing you can do as Vice President \u2014 by the way, there is no inherent power in the office of the vice presidency. Zero. None. It\u2019s all a reflection of your reflection of your relationship with the President. You\u2019re probably a political junkie like me, and you read Caro\u2019s book on Johnson when he was Vice President. I mean, Kennedy never let Johnson in the office. I spend somewhere between four and seven hours a day with the President. I attend every single meeting. I\u2019m there.\n\n(MORE: Biden: \u2018I Could Make a Good President\u2019)\n\nThe second point is, the value of the Vice President is you can cross jurisdictional lines. For example, this guy [Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx] is first-rate, I\u2019m not saying it because he\u2019s there. And I\u2019m not saying he was picked because I recommended him, because the President knew who he wanted. I mean this sincerely and we travel a lot together. But I am able to bring in transportation, labor, commerce and education, when we\u2019re talking about this new job I have. None of these guys worry I want their authority. I\u2019m not looking to \u2014 my brother-in-law has an expression: you never cut another guy\u2019s grass. They know I want no wide authority in any of this, but I\u2019m able to be the guy \u2014 I have a convening power. And the good news about it when the President gives me an authority, as Anthony already knows, he never second guesses, he just says do it. And I do it.\n\nThe second term is going to be more of the same. What you saw at the State of the Union was not fundamentally different than Biden\u2019s gonna do Iraq, Biden\u2019s gonna do the Recovery Act, Biden\u2019s gonna do the \u2014 there are things that are urgent needs that he says go do it. So I don\u2019t see any fundamental change. And on foreign policy, I\u2019ve traveled 800,000 miles as Vice President. And because I\u2019ve known and continue to know every one of these major world leaders by their first names, and I have access to them because they know when I speak, I speak directly for him. They don\u2019t wonder if I spend five and a half hours with [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] as Vice President \u2014 it\u2019s like why the Vice President? It\u2019s not me, they know that there\u2019s no filter. I speak for the President. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to continue to be doing a lot of foreign travel, particularly as it relates to this hemisphere, the Pacific Basin, China, Japan and Korea. As well as what I\u2019m doing now, like Ukraine. You know I\u2019m the guy on the phone every day \u2014 well, not every day, but \u2026 that\u2019s kind of been the pattern. It\u2019ll be different assignments, different things. I guess the best way to say it is the way the President tags it is, he\u2019s got a full plate, what are those things that demand his attention that he doesn\u2019t have time to do full time that he slides them over onto my plate. They are the kinds of things I expect the next three years will be about.\n\nOne of the things the President has worked on now, is criminal-justice reforms, in particular regarding drug policy. This is something that you have a long record on, from inventing the drug czar. The President talked to David Remnick about legalization of marijuana. Is that something that you\u2019ve come around on, and do you support some of the efforts there?\n\nNo. Look, I support the President\u2019s policy. I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources. Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization, and that is and continues to be our policy.\n\nBut on the entire criminal-justice front, the good news is there are two things the President asked in the beginning that I wanted to have sort of day-to-day jurisdiction over. And one was I said the violence-against-women portfolio and law enforcement, cops. The great news is that I have an incredible relationship with the Attorney General. Other Attorney Generals might go \u201cWhoa, whoa, wait, Biden shouldn\u2019t be picking who\u2019s gonna be in each of these offices,\u201d but I\u2019m able to do that. When we put together the budget, I\u2019ve been basically the guy who has the final say in the criminal-justice side of the budget. So and I\u2019m still a point person along with the Attorney General with law enforcement, with the criminal-justice system and all those issues relating to violence against women. One of the things the President and I agree on, and I think most of the Cabinet secretaries agree on: when something in their shop gets pulled into the White House, it has a little more horsepower. And those things that get pulled are usually things [that] get handed to me. I\u2019m going to say something self-serving \u2014 because I get along \u2014 I\u2019ve never had a Cabinet secretary who\u2019s gone \u201cWhoa, whoa\u201d \u2014 notwithstanding [former Defense Secretary Robert] Gates\u2019 book \u2014 or has there ever been any kind of \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s he doing,\u201d because I\u2019ve never, as I said, cut their grass.\n\n(MORE: Vice President Joe Biden Not High on Marijuana Legalization)\n\nSo on the criminal-justice side, I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I\u2019m also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of [the Senate Foreign Relations Committee], trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder. I mean, I worked for the last five years I was there, and [Illinois Senator Richard] Durbin\u2019s continuing to work. And [New York Senator Chuck] Schumer. And the President shares this. And I\u2019m still engaged in those things. I don\u2019t know if this explains it very well, but what happens is, with the exception of violence against women, which is sort of totally my deal, sometimes the plate gets filled up. For example, during the air-identification-zone mini-crisis with China, well, I was asked to go try to work that. And [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe and [South Korean President] Park [Geun-hye], and I was asked to work that. In the meantime there were some things that came, everything from marijuana to drug control. And I was on another assignment. When I\u2019m in there, when we\u2019re both in town, I attend every meeting [Obama] has.\n\nMatt Rourke / AP\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office report the other day gave Republicans a lot of fodder.\n\nBut when you look at the report, it gives no fodder. It says, No. 1, there\u2019s not any corporations or businesses that are laying people off because of this. No. 2, it talks about how the act has worked pretty damn well in terms of \u2014 the ACA has worked well. And what they\u2019re talking about, which is the headline, if you look at [Congressional Budget Office director Douglas] Elmendorf\u2019s testimony, he said no, it doesn\u2019t cost any jobs. What we\u2019re talking about is it a good thing. It\u2019s a bad thing I think \u2014 to paraphrase him, it\u2019s a bad thing when somebody gets laid off and they have no job. It\u2019s a bad thing when someone wants to stay in a job and it\u2019s closed down or frozen. He said it\u2019s not a bad thing when an employee goes in and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to retire because I have the ACA. I as the husband or wife, I don\u2019t need this job, which used to be the only vehicle for my health care. Now I\u2019m going to go home and take care of the kids, or I\u2019m going to go back to college, or I\u2019m going to do whatever.\u201d But what that does in a macroeconomic sense, as you know, that means is someone\u2019s not in the labor market. That cost a job. That reduces the growth in the GDP. Well, you\u2019ve got a whole baby-boomer generation that were hanging on to jobs, not moving because either they were tied down because their mortgage was underwater or they couldn\u2019t leave because they had health care. This frees people up. And there is zero evidence that this is costing people jobs now.\n\nTwo quick Senate questions: Do you intend to campaign against Senator Mitch McConnell, and is Mike Bloomberg wrong to be running ads against Democrats who voted against Democrats who voted against background checks like Mark Pryor?\n\nLook, I have a really close relationship with Mike Bloomberg. And I have campaigned a lot. I\u2019m probably going into 150 more races. But I have never campaigned against a sitting Republican. What I do is, I campaign for the Democrat. So, will I go into Kentucky? Jerry Lundergan, who is the dad of our candidate, is a close friend of mine. He was the Biden chairman for my effort to win Kentucky, which we never got to in \u201908, so I\u2019m sure I will help his daughter if they ask to raise money. I think it\u2019s a bad idea, and it\u2019s happened too much but I\u2019ve never done it, for sitting Senators of either party, and leaders of either party, to campaign personally against the other leader. But I will be campaigning for a lot of Democratic races where there is an incumbent Republican.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an exclusive interview with TIME, the vice president says there's no evidence the Affordable Care Act is 'costing people jobs now'", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In an exclusive interview with TIME, the vice president says there's no evidence the Affordable Care Act is 'costing people jobs now'", "title": "Interview: Vice President Joe Biden On Amtrak, Obama and Pot", "url": "http://time.com/5647/joe-biden-interview-2016-presidential-campaign/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/biden-infrastructure_fitz.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/biden-infrastructure_fitz.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "In an exclusive interview with TIME, the vice president says there's no evidence the Affordable Care Act is 'costing people jobs now'", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Interview: Vice President Joe Biden On Amtrak, Obama and Pot"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016 election, amtrak, china, japan, joe biden, korea, newsmaker interview, obama, president, trains", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016 election, amtrak, china, japan, joe biden, korea, newsmaker interview, obama, president, trains"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e8f\"", "article_summary": "They don\u2019t wonder if I spend five and a half hours with [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] as Vice President \u2014 it\u2019s like why the Vice President?\nAnd he talked about how [former Vice President Dick] Cheney had a portfolio and [former Vice President Al] Gore, and all the important Vice Presidents.\n(MORE: Biden: \u2018I Could Make a Good President\u2019)The second point is, the value of the Vice President is you can cross jurisdictional lines.\nYou\u2019re probably a political junkie like me, and you read Caro\u2019s book on Johnson when he was Vice President.\nYou know I\u2019m the guy on the phone every day \u2014 well, not every day, but \u2026 that\u2019s kind of been the pattern."}
