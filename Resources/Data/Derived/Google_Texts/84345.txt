Bloomington resident Robert Hall announced his candidacy for the 9th congressional district seat Tuesday morning via social media.

Hall is the founder and editor of Grassroots Conservatives eNews, and he coordinates the Monroe County Patriots, according to roberthallforcongress.com, his new campaign site.

“I’m the only candidate who will vote against John Boehner on day one, oppose raising the debt limit, oppose Omnibus spending bills and continuing resolutions, fight for every child’s right to life, and demand constitutional amendments for term limits and balanced budgets,” Hall said in the release.

Hall is entering a crowded Republican race for the seat currently held by Rep. Todd Young, R-9th district. State Sen. Erin Houchin, R-Salem; State Sen. Brent Waltz, R-Greenwood; and Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, another Republican, are also running for the seat.

Monroe County Council member Shelli Yoder is the only Democrat currently in the race.

Should he win, Hall’s website states he will work to repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS and defund Planned Parenthood.
