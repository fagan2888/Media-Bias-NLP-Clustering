These are essential factors in protecting the oral health and overall health of Missourians and their families, and this drives our business and social mission.\u201d\n\nThe company has developed several benefit plans that focus on prevention and comprehensive oral health care. Those who purchase a Delta Dental Individual and Family plan can choose any dentist and have coverage, but individuals will pay the lowest out-of-pocket costs when they receive services from a dentist in the Delta Dental PPO Network. On the new site, members can find a dentist, print an ID card, manage their own accounts, make profile changes and review claims. Personal assistance is also available at 866-991-7345.\n\nFor more information, visit individual.deltadentalmo.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Delta Dental of Missouri today announced the launch of individual.deltadentalmo.com, an e-commerce site for persons looking to purchase individual or family dental coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "St. Louis American", "description": "Delta Dental of Missouri today announced the launch of individual.deltadentalmo.com, an e-commerce site for persons looking to purchase individual or family dental coverage.", "title": "Delta Dental-MO launches website for dental plan purchases", "url": "http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/article_f5d43bb2-9b26-11e3-a015-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/stlamerican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/da/2da2a920-9b27-11e3-8163-001a4bcf887a/53079d251d744.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C332", "height": 332}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@stlouisamerican", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157786209183}, "keywords": "local_news", "news_keywords": "local_news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e9b\"", "article_summary": "Delta Dental of Missouri today announced the launch of individual.deltadentalmo.com, an e-commerce site for persons looking to purchase individual or family dental coverage.\nThose who purchase a Delta Dental Individual and Family plan can choose any dentist and have coverage, but individuals will pay the lowest out-of-pocket costs when they receive services from a dentist in the Delta Dental PPO Network.\nThe new site allows shoppers to compare plan options, obtain a quote, access the provider network, view a wealth of oral health information and purchase dental coverage online.\nWhile pediatric dental care is covered under the Affordable Care Act, adult coverage is not.\nThese are essential factors in protecting the oral health and overall health of Missourians and their families, and this drives our business and social mission.\u201dThe company has developed several benefit plans that focus on prevention and comprehensive oral health care."}
