It centered on Daraprim, treatment for a parasitic infection frequently afflicting those with weakened immune systems, like HIV or cancer patients. The story gained serious traction because it had a classic villain attached: Martin Shkreli, a pharmaceutical executive who\u2019d jacked up the price of Daraprim to $75,000, simply because he felt the cost was too low and he could get more.\n\nThat conversation about prescription drug costs has made its way to Iowa with an event at Drake University last month, hosted by the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing. The Register wrote an editorial putting pressure on presidential candidates to address this issue.\n\nBut what John Rother, the campaign's director, and others may have overlooked was the less-heralded denouement to this tale: an Associated Press article reporting that a competitor will begin selling Daraprim at a rate of $99 for 100 pills. Yes, just 99 cents a pill. It\u2019s a perfect example of free markets sweeping in and correcting an imbalance. Daraprim isn\u2019t worth $75,000, it turns out, and nobody will get away with selling it at that cost for long.\n\nWhile many individual drug costs may reach extraordinary levels for various reasons, every Iowan is more broadly affected by serious jumps in the cost of buying health insurance. This year alone they\u2019re facing premium increases of up to 24 percent. That\u2019s not just one extraordinary tale; that\u2019s not over a decade or rising due to inflation; that\u2019s just one year of price spikes for keeping yourself and your family covered.\n\nAt Americans for Prosperity, we know these untenable jumps in cost are because most parts of the health care sector have become partly or wholly insulated from price signals in the marketplace. In other words, the invisible hand of supply and demand is not around to call shenanigans like in the Daraprim case. Government waste and over-regulation alone have gone a long way toward putting that invisible hand to rest and allowing costs to creep up and up, then jump through the roof.\n\nYet Rother\u2019s Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing is steered by a group that includes organizations with a history of supporting more government intervention in health care. AARP and the AFL-CIO, for example, were key supporters of Obamacare.\n\nMany Iowans are paying astronomical prices for some of these live-saving drugs, and working on a solution for prescription drugs prices is admirable \u2014 but not if it\u2019s going to apply the same methods that have been disastrous for every other part of the health care sector.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the landscape:\n\nInsurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs: Skyrocketing even more after Obamacare\u2019s implementation\n\nCosts for routine tests: Too high, due in part to pricing set by mismanaged government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nCosts of doing business for physicians: Continuing to grow to comply with government mandates.\n\nWith that track record, how can we expect government interference in the pharmaceutical industry to go any better?\n\nWhere we agree with Rother\u2019s campaign is that every Iowan deserves to see their health care costs become more manageable, but it shouldn\u2019t be limited to drugs. We need to make insurers and private-sector providers respond to the marketplace again, no matter if they\u2019re on a new drug, or they need an MRI, or they just want to see their trusted doctor of choice. Increasingly, it\u2019s clear that more government is not going to be the Rx.\n\nDrew Klein directs the Iowa chapter of Americans for Prosperity.
