Why was it so important to Fox host Megyn Kelly to repeatedly look into the camera and tell America\u2019s children that Santa is \u201cjust white\u201d?\n\nIt is laughable, yes\u2014and Jon Stewart helped us laugh at it when he asked, \u201cWho is Megyn Kelly talking to? Children who are sophisticated enough to watch the 10 o\u2019clock news, yet na\u00efve enough to believe in Santa, and racist enough to be upset that he might not be white?\u201d That is, as he points out, a fairly narrow segment of viewers.\n\nBut what Kelly\u2019s insane rant really shows is just how mean-spirited she really is, that her vaunted empathy extends only to white working women, or rather to white working right-wing women who think like her. Her empathy deficit is front and center in the repetition of the word, \u201ckids,\u201d and the use of the word \u201cjust.\u201d When she says, Santa is \u201cjust white\u201d to the \u201ckids\u201d out there, and they are just going to have to deal with it, it seems that she is also talking to non-white kids. Just deal with it, you non-white kids. Santa\u2019s not for you.\n\nIn the ensuing kerfuffle, she accused her detractors of race-baiting \u2014 and claimed it was an off-handed remark, that she was just kidding \u2014 and again asserted that Santa us white. In response to a thoughtful article on Slate by Aisha Harris, who chronicles the genuine pain she felt reconciling Santa\u2019s \u201cwhiteness\u201d with her African-American family\u2019s Christmas celebration, Kelly ratcheted up the jerkiness. \u201cJust because it makes people uncomfortable, doesn\u2019t mean it has to change.\u201d\n\nBecause you can\u2019t change the facts of a made-up story about a jolly man who flies around and gives children toys. And made-up stories belong on the news, kids.\n\nKids!? Are you listening?\n\n2. Pat Robertson: Letting lesbians into your house could turn your kids gay.\n\nPatty Robertson slays us. He really does. His delusional view that gayness is a contagious germ was revealed this week when a viewer named Catherine wrote in for some advice. She had recently reconnected with an old best friend who, it turned out, was a lesbian. Catherine had invited her old friend to meet her children, but became concerned when her old friend wanted to bring her life partner along.\n\nBig mistake, the 700 Club host told her. Having lesbian friends in her home could turn her children gay, and \u201cyou don\u2019t want your children to grow up as lesbians.\u201d\n\nExactly how this transmission of sexuality would occur, he did not explain. It, like the lord, works in mysterious ways, but suffice it to say, \u201cDanger!\u201d\n\nWhile Catherine should not risk infecting her children with the acceptance-of-the-lesbian-lifestyle virus, Rev. Pat said nor should she shun her old friend. Because, who knows, maybe Catherine could infect her friend with the good Christian, heterosexual lifestyle, ummm, virus.\n\nFailing that, he counseled: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to tell somebody, \u2018Look, I love you and we\u2019re going to do what we can to be friends if we can, but I have my lifestyle, it\u2019s Christian. And you have yours, it\u2019s not. And so, I\u2019m sorry, we can\u2019t indulge in certain things together.\u2019\u201d\n\nLike lesbian sex, we\u2019re presuming. That\u2019s out.\n\n3. Trump rejoices at having his birther conspiracy confirmed.\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s obsession with the wide-ranging conspiracy to obscure President Obama\u2019s real birthplace could be better sorted out by a psychiatrist, one who specializes in racist delusions. Know anybody?\n\nOf course, the wonderful thing about conspiracies is that everything proves them. And so it was this week that a tragedy gave the real estate tycoon Spy magazine dubbed \u201cthe short-fingered vulgarian\u201d further fodder for his ongoing crusade to prove the president is a \u201cfurriner.\u201d (Note that we high-minded, progressive scribblers would never make fun of someone for physical attributes they can\u2019t help, so we won\u2019t repeat that short-fingered thing again. Vulgarian, maybe.)\n\nLoretta Fuddy, the 65-year-old Hawaii state health director who authorized the release of Obama\u2019s birth certificate was killed in a small plane crash over the coast of Hawaii. Nine other passengers survived. \u201cHow amazing, the state health director who verified copies of Obama\u2019s \u2018birth certificate\u2019 died in plane crash today. All others lived,\u201d the Donald tweeted.\n\nThe implication is clear. The president had his thugs kill her. How? you ask. Or, more to the point, why? Since the birth certificate is released, confirmed Obama\u2019s Hawaii birth and the matter closed for everyone except the truly irrational.\n\nDunno.\n\nMaybe the comb-over can explain.\n\n4. Jim Garrow: Of course, Obama was in on that plane crash, and he also tried to nuke America (God stopped him!).\n\nThe Donald is not the only eminently reasonable man who thinks Obama arranged that plane crash. He enjoys the company of Conservative nutjob Jim Garrow, who also knows for a fact that Obama killed Andrew Breitbart, Michael Hastings and Tom Clancy. Oh, yes, and he tried to nuke America.\n\n\u201cThere are no coincidences with this administration and with the thugs that have brought Chicago tactics to bear,\u201d Garrow said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing murder.\u201d\n\nHis theory: Fuddy was killed with neurotoxins before the plane crash.\n\nDastardly plan revealed. Mwah-ha-ha-ha, the president said in a statement.\n\n5. Beck manages to make the strange story of the fraudulent sign language interpreter at Mandela\u2019s funeral even stranger.\n\nFor many, truth can truly be stranger than fiction. Much of what is in the news would not be believable in a fictional universe. The revelations about the fraudulent, schizophrenic sign language interpreter at Nelson Mandela\u2019s funeral, who may have thought he was signing the voices inside his head, was one such story. It was all the responsible media could do to keep up with the bizarre facts as they were revealed. But for Glenn Beck, mental illness and a history of violence were not enough. Something else, an even more sinister plot, had to be at work. He wants the man\u2019s blood tested, he said on his radio show \u201cto find out if anybody jacked him on anything.\u201d Why, you say?\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of guy,\u201d Beck said, \u201cyou hire to stand next to all of the world leaders at something like this hoping that he will do something. I believe it is not unreasonable to check his bloodstream to find out if anybody jacked him on anything to have him hallucinate \u2026 It might have just been enough to say somebody cause some kind of problem at this, for whatever the reason. But something is really wrong here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Megyn Kelly feels VERY strongly about Santa's ethnicity, while Donald Trump loses it, again, over birtherism", "title": "10 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 white Santa edition", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Megyn Kelly feels VERY strongly about Santa's ethnicity, while Donald Trump loses it, again, over birtherism", "title": "10 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 white Santa edition", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/16/10_worst_ring_wing_moments_of_the_week_white_santa_edition/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/megyn_kelly2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Megyn Kelly feels VERY strongly about Santa's ethnicity, while Donald Trump loses it, again, over birtherism", "title": "10 worst right-wing moments of the week \u2014 white Santa edition", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/megyn_kelly2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, birtherism, Donald Trump, Megyn Kelly, santa claus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecf9\"", "article_summary": "Catherine had invited her old friend to meet her children, but became concerned when her old friend wanted to bring her life partner along.\nWhy was it so important to Fox host Megyn Kelly to repeatedly look into the camera and tell America\u2019s children that Santa is \u201cjust white\u201d?\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s obsession with the wide-ranging conspiracy to obscure President Obama\u2019s real birthplace could be better sorted out by a psychiatrist, one who specializes in racist delusions.\nPat said nor should she shun her old friend.\nIn the ensuing kerfuffle, she accused her detractors of race-baiting \u2014 and claimed it was an off-handed remark, that she was just kidding \u2014 and again asserted that Santa us white."}
