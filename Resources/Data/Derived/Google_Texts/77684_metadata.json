Instances of such efforts or so numerous there wouldn\u2019t be room for all the stories if the newspaper tried to package all of them in a single edition, be it daily or weekend.\n\nProbably everyday, someone or some group somewhere in Topeka is doing something to help other people.\n\nThat may involve efforts to clean and beautify the community, raise scholarship money for students who need assistance or attract students to careers in which more people are needed. It may involve raising money or products for a food bank or shelter for the needy. It may involve feeding people at Thanksgiving or erecting an enormous holiday light display to raise money for people whose ability to help themselves is limited. It may involve helping making Christmas a happy occasion for some unfortunate members of the community.\n\nSome people sell ducks and drop them in a lake each year or fly huge balloons to support worthy causes, while others sponsor or participate in golf tournaments, softball tournaments or one of the many run/walk events designed to raise money for and direct attention to a specific cause.\n\nOther people donate directly to the United Way, Red Cross, Salvation Army or one of the other organizations designed to offer assistance. Others step forward to help individuals file tax returns each year. Most recently, people have stepped forward to help some of their neighbors understand all the twists and turns to be encountered in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere are many other causes that aren\u2019t mentioned here, as the Volunteer Center of Topeka could attest. That organization matches volunteers with needs and honors their contributions each year.\n\nVolunteers and others who strive to help their neighbors are one of the major factors that make Topeka the caring community it is. They all deserve to be recognized and honored.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Opinion, The Capital-Journal, Editorials", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Readers of The Topeka Capital-Journal and CJOnline.com have read stories recently about Topekans who have been doing great things to help others.", "title": "Editorial: Helping others helps the community", "url": "http://cjonline.com/opinion/2013-10-06/editorial-helping-others-helps-community", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/new100513hishmeh.topekahigh.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Readers of The Topeka Capital-Journal and CJOnline.com have read stories recently about Topekans who have been doing great things to help others."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde297\"", "article_summary": "It may involve helping making Christmas a happy occasion for some unfortunate members of the community.\nThat may involve efforts to clean and beautify the community, raise scholarship money for students who need assistance or attract students to careers in which more people are needed.\nVolunteers and others who strive to help their neighbors are one of the major factors that make Topeka the caring community it is.\nIt may involve feeding people at Thanksgiving or erecting an enormous holiday light display to raise money for people whose ability to help themselves is limited.\nIt may involve raising money or products for a food bank or shelter for the needy."}
