Hickenlooper warns govs on pot\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper urged fellow governors Saturday to be cautious about following his state\u2019s lead in embracing marijuana.\n\nThe Democrat worries other states will legalize pot so that they can tax it and fill budget shortfalls.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe jury is still out on this thing,\u201d he said in between meetings at the National Governors Association in Washington . \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one of the great social experiments of the 21st century. As we implement it, we want to make sure that our society is no worse off than it was before this was passed. If we were legalizing whiskey, I\u2019d be doing the same thing.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Feds help banks with pot shops)\n\nHickenlooper opposed a 2012 ballot measure that legalized marijuana, but he\u2019s worked with the Legislature to regulate the drug after it passed.\n\nThe state of Colorado estimated this week that stores will sell $1 billion of the product in the next fiscal year, generating $134 million in tax and fee revenue.\n\nHe said \u201cseveral\u201d other governors asked about the revenue projections on marijuana taxes, and he said they should watch to see whether legalization reduces his prison population.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to look at this and say the tax revenues we\u2019re raising are not to reduce other taxes or reduce government spending,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should be looking at it as a source of revenue.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Lawmakers ask Obama to change marijuana classification)\n\nHickenlooper proposes using the windfall on programs aimed at treatment and prevention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like promoting gambling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always makes you nervous when you see government promoting gambling or any of those sin trades. They are revenue sources. \u2026 We know people are not going to be better off smoking pot. It doesn\u2019t mean they should be arrested \u2026 but we know it doesn\u2019t make you smarter.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper fears that pot use will spike among younger people. He cited neurological studies about the risk of permanent memory damage if kids smoke pot.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The Millennial-industrial complex)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more adults smoking pot than there used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do have polls that show a larger number of kids expect to experiment with it because they think it\u2019s not as dangerous as they used to think because now it\u2019s legal.\u201d\n\nThe governor cited a news story last week about a child in Madrid who went into a coma after eating marijuana-laced brownies.\n\n\u201cWe are going to very, very closely monitor the number of kids who slip off the tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cThose kids are expensive to get back on the tracks.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper had been mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential contender, but his approval rating has slipped over the past year and Republicans now express hope he can be defeated in November.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Medical marijuana gains in South)\n\nThe governor said he knows he and Sen. Mark Udall, also a Democrat, will both face competitive reelection campaigns, but he expressed confidence and defended his push for universal background checks and other gun measures.\n\nRepublicans think the unpopularity of Obamacare also creates an opening. Hickenlooper responded by mentioning a new study that he said found less growth in health care costs over the past three years than any time over the previous 50 years.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t think it will be an issue,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cThe issue in Colorado is going to be jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur own exchange is doing fine: 210,000 people signed up already, we\u2019re meeting our goals, everything\u2019s going the way it should,\u201d he added. \u201cBut that rollout affected everybody in the country one way or the other. He [Obama] knows that.\u201d\n\nIn a conversation this week, Hickenlooper said an Obama administration staffer compared the botched rollout to the 1981 movie \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d about runner Eric Liddell.\n\n\u201cThat one race where he starts out on the blocks and he falls down on his face,\u201d the governor recalled. \u201cHe\u2019s got that moment where he\u2019s either got to get up and run or just sit there and do better the next time. And he gets up and he runs, and he wins. That was the metaphor: When they ran out of the blocks, they fell. But they\u2019re not staying down. They\u2019re doing a much better job.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He worries other states will legalize weed so that they can tax it and to fill budget shortfalls.", "title": "Hickenlooper warns govs on pot", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/john-hickenlooper-marijuana-legalization-103810.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/04/03/130403_hickenlooper_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "John Hickenlooper,Colorado,Marijuana,Governors", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He worries other states will legalize weed so that they can tax it and to fill budget shortfalls.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hickenlooper says governors shouldn't look to pot legalization as a source of revenue.\nHe [Obama] knows that.\u201dIn a conversation this week, Hickenlooper said an Obama administration staffer compared the botched rollout to the 1981 movie \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d about runner Eric Liddell.\nHickenlooper warns govs on potColorado Gov.\nJohn Hickenlooper urged fellow governors Saturday to be cautious about following his state\u2019s lead in embracing marijuana.\nThe Democrat worries other states will legalize pot so that they can tax it and fill budget shortfalls."}
