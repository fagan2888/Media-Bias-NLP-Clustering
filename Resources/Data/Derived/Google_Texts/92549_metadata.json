The bill has identical language as the bill that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in May and has 45 co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cHere is the theory of the case: Roe v. Wade was about medical viability. Roe v. Wade acknowledges that there is a compelling state interest in protecting the unborn child at the point of medical viability. I would argue that since 1973 to now that standard has probably changed. But we\u2019re coming up with a new standard that I think is very compelling. The standard of medical practice, today, in America, is that if you operate on an unborn child at 20 weeks\u2026you have to provide anesthesia to the baby because they\u2019re capable of feeling extreme pain,\u201d Graham said during a press conference introducing the bill on Thursday.\n\n\u201c\u201cSo here\u2019s the choice for America: if the doctor is required to provide anesthesia to the child\u2014to help save his life because they feel pain in the process of being operated on\u2014is it okay for society to say, \u2018well at that stage in the pregnancy, we don\u2019t want the operation to be an abortion\u2019? I believe, that most Americans will say yes. We don\u2019t want 20-week abortions on demand\u2014we want out of this club\u2026If this is not worthy of a debate of a great nation, than what would be?\u201d Graham added.\n\nAmong the 45 co-sponsors of the bill are U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Marco Rubio (R-FL).", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/06/lindsey-graham-introduces-pain-capable-unborn-child-protection-act/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lindsey-Graham-Pain-Capable-Unborn-Child-Protection-Act-1024x568.png", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-06-13T05:35:30+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "abortion, chuck grassley, joni ernst, late-term abortion, lindsey graham, marco rubio, pain-capable unborn child protection act, pro-life bills, rand paul, s. 1553, ted cruz, u.s. politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced S. 1553, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill he is sponsoring in the U.S. Senate on Thursday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced S. 1553, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill he is sponsoring in the U.S. Senate on Thursday.", "title": "Lindsey Graham Introduces Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lindsey-Graham-Pain-Capable-Unborn-Child-Protection-Act-1024x568.png", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/06/lindsey-graham-introduces-pain-capable-unborn-child-protection-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced S. 1553, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill he is sponsoring in the U.S. Senate on Thursday.", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lindsey-Graham-Pain-Capable-Unborn-Child-Protection-Act.png", "title": "Lindsey Graham Introduces Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "section": "U.S. Politics", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-06-13T00:35:30-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5aa\"", "article_summary": "Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced S. 1553, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill he is sponsoring in the U.S. Senate on Thursday.\nRoe v.
