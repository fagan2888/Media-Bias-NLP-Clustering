Nor do some of them feel well equipped to advise patients and their families on the need for long-term home care or community based social services.\n\nThese were some of the findings of the survey of doctors in 10 industrialized countries, including the U.S. and Canada. The physicians were asked to compare their experiences in providing care to patients with complex problems, using health information technology, and coordinating care outside of office.\n\nAlthough the U.S. has a younger population than many other developed countries, the study notes, \u201cThe U.S. has a higher share of patients with multiple chronic conditions, severe mental illnesses and other significant health care challenges.\u201d\n\nAs a group, these older, sicker patients constitute a disproportional share of health care spending in this country, and yet they do not fare well \u2013 in part because the nation\u2019s primary care practices are ill prepared to meet their needs,\u201d the study asserts.\n\nRelated: Why the U.S. Is Being Gouged on Drug Prices Compared to Other Countries\n\nAlthough the U.S. population is rapidly aging and in need of quality medical treatment, fewer and fewer medical students are choosing to become primary care physicians \u2013 opting instead for better-paying specialties.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are a total of 435,084 general practitioners in the U.S., including 179,040 practicing internal medicine, 127,756 in family practices and just 1,188 in geriatrics.\n\nBy one estimate, only 30 percent of all physicians in the U.S. are practicing primary care medicine. Meanwhile, there were more than 44 million people 65 and older in 2013, or 14 percent of the overall population, with estimates that number will grow to 98.2 million by 2060 \u2013 or one in four Americans.\n\n\u201cIf it were properly staffed and compensated and strengthened, primary care could play a major role in helping to improve quality and control costs going forward,\u201d Eric C. Schneider, a senior vice president for research at Commonwealth Fund and co-author of the study, said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cBut it\u2019s really going to take an investment in strengthening primary care.\u201d\n\nRelated: Medicare Sees Striking Increase in Specialty Drug Costs\n\n\u201cWe have a system that is very heavy on specialist care but not primary care, so we don\u2019t have a sufficient number of primary care doctors,\u201d said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care. \u201cAnd we have the baby boomers adding to Medicare at the rate of 10,000 every day. And the boomers are now getting to their 70s, when multiple conditions become common.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s not a good picture,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a mismatch between the need and the ability to deliver the appropriate care.\u201d\n\nResearchers analyzed survey responses from more than 11,000 primary care doctors in Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The doctors were asked to assess how well prepared their practices were \u2013 in terms of training and organization to meet the challenge of treating older patients with complex health care problems.\n\nPhysicians in the Netherland and Germany indicated they were the most confident in their ability to meet their patients\u2019 needs, with only 12 percent saying they felt unprepared.\n\nRelated: Abolish Medicare? Ben Carson's Mixed Message on Health Care\n\nBy contrast, many U.S. doctors interviewed conceded their practices were behind in training and could do a lot more for older patients in terms of responding to emergencies, steering them to the right specialists or simply following up with patients after they are discharged from a hospital.\n\nFor instance, only one in three primary care doctors interviewed said they were notified when one of their patients was discharged from the hospital or seen in an emergency room, according to the report. By contrast, 69 percent of doctors in the Netherlands \u2013 the country with the best overall performance \u2013 reported that they were always notified at the time of their patients\u2019 release.\n\n\u201cAcross most countries, about half of doctors said their practices routinely coordinate care with home care providers,\u201d according to the study. \u201cIn the U.S., just over 40 percent reported communicating with social service providers on issues related to housing, meals, and transportation, compared with 65 percent of practices in the United Kingdom.\u2019\n\nOne of a doctor\u2019s more important responsibilities is to serve as quarterback for their patients in arranging for referrals and responding to crises. However, according to the Commonwealth Fund survey, slightly less than 40 percent of U.S. primary care doctors had arranged for patients to receive after-hours care without going to the emergency room.\n\nThat was the lowest rate in the survey \u2013 in contrast with 94 percent in the Netherlands, 92 percent in New Zealand, and 89 percent in the United Kingdom.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As America continues to age, many U.S.", "title": "How US Primary Care Is Falling Behind the Developed World", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/09/How-US-Primary-Care-Falling-Behind-Developed-World", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122011_doctor_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/09/How-US-Primary-Care-Falling-Behind-Developed-World", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122011_doctor_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As America continues to age, many U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut it\u2019s really going to take an investment in strengthening primary care.\u201dRelated: Medicare Sees Striking Increase in Specialty Drug Costs\u201cWe have a system that is very heavy on specialist care but not primary care, so we don\u2019t have a sufficient number of primary care doctors,\u201d said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care.\nBy one estimate, only 30 percent of all physicians in the U.S. are practicing primary care medicine.\nHowever, according to the Commonwealth Fund survey, slightly less than 40 percent of U.S. primary care doctors had arranged for patients to receive after-hours care without going to the emergency room.\n\u201cAcross most countries, about half of doctors said their practices routinely coordinate care with home care providers,\u201d according to the study.\nFor instance, only one in three primary care doctors interviewed said they were notified when one of their patients was discharged from the hospital or seen in an emergency room, according to the report."}
