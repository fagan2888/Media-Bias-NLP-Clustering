Red Oak, IA – Starting in early January, Mother, Soldier and Proven Conservative, Joni Ernst successfully launched an exciting new effort – visiting every one of our counties to discuss 99 Reasons “Why Bruce Braley’s Obamacare is Bad for Iowa.”

At each stop so far we have heard tales of Obamacare’s devastation on local businesses, health care providers, and everyday Iowans. For example, this Facebook post details a mother in Buchanan County whose healthcare costs have risen nearly 300% after her old plan was cancelled. Or this Facebook post where Johnson County residents told Joni about how Obamacare’s mandates are causing budget headaches for their community.

While other candidates are trying to follow Joni’s lead, the reality is that Joni Ernst is the only Republican in this race who has a proven record of fighting against Bruce Braley’s failed policy. As a state senator, Joni fought and voted against Iowa state senate Democrats and their efforts to expand Medicaid here in Iowa.

With that in mind, Joni Ernst for US Senate is announcing the launch of a new website,BraleysObamacare.com, highlighting the ways Bruce Braley’s Obamacare is impacting everyday Iowans.

“For months we’ve heard horror stories as Iowans have been faced with uncertainty about their health coverage due to Obamacare’s flubbed rollout and implementation. Bruce Braley helped pass a bad law and Iowans are paying the price. While Bruce Braley is now ducking the issue, I’m talking to Iowans about my record in the state senate fighting against these policies, holding him accountable next November and repealing and replacing Obamacare with common-sense solutions,” said Joni Ernst.

BraleysObamacare.com features Obamacare nightmares from Iowa voters, Obamacare press clips, and an opportunity for Iowans concerned about Bruce Braley’s Obamacare to sign up to join Team Joni at their precinct caucus later this month.
