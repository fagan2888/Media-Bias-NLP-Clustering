As the researcher awaits trial in federal court, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently announced that the remaining members of Han\u2019s team will not be awarded their promised $1.38 million in grant money.\n\nThe NIH originally awarded Han\u2019s research team, which is led by biomedical sciences professor Michael Cho, $6.8 million to be distributed over the course of five years. Unfortunately, following the controversy surrounding Han\u2019s inauthentic lab results, the NIH announced on Tuesday that it would no longer award Iowa State University\u2019s AIDS research team their final installment, Time reported. In an email from an agency spokesperson, it was explained that the NIH \u201cmakes funding decisions based on scientific merit of the proposed research,\u201d and \u201cthe researchers are eligible to apply for future NIH grant funding through their institutions just as other researchers may apply.\u201d\n\nThe NIH is the leading source of federal money for medical research, the Des Moines Register reported. Along with not receiving the final grant payment, ISU will need to reimburse the agency $496,000 for costs related to Han\u2019s employment.\n\nThe withholding of the final installment may not have severe consequences on the team\u2019s ongoing project. Iowa State University\u2019s spokesman, John McCarroll, explained that the remaining 10 team members, who were completely unaware of Han\u2019s forgery, may have enough funding to continue their work. Healing from the negative perception, however, may take between two and five years, according to experts. Team leader Cho believes that the scandal, \u201cwill allow the team to emerge much stronger in the long run.\u201d\n\nThe project of which Han and his team were working on involved using rabbits to test an HIV vaccine. Although test results initially found that the team\u2019s vaccine had caused the rabbits to develop antibodies to HIV, a major medical breakthrough at the time, a follow-up review from external researchers showed that the rabbit blood had been tainted with human antibodies. This rendered the results inaccurate. Han admitted that he tainted the lab results \u201cbecause he wanted [results] to look better.\u201d\n\nThe 57-year-old South Korean native is currently awaiting trial on four counts of making false statements in research reports. He is free on bond and scheduled for a trial on Sept. 2 but for the time being is allowed to live in Ohio near his family.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aids, research, scandal, iowa, state, causes, nih, withdraw, promise, 138m, grant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The NIH has decided to withhold the final $1.38 million in grant money for Iowa State University following the scandal surrounding Dong-Pyou Han's tainted lab results.", "title": "Iowa State Loses $1.38M NIH Grant Following Falsified AIDS Research", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aids-research-scandal-iowa-state-causes-nih-withdraw-promise-138m-grant-292158", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/lab.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NIH has decided to withhold the final $1.38 million in grant money for Iowa State University following the scandal surrounding Dong-Pyou Han's tainted lab results.", "title": "Iowa State Loses $1.38M NIH Grant Following Falsified AIDS Research", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aids-research-scandal-iowa-state-causes-nih-withdraw-promise-138m-grant-292158", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/lab.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/lab.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-09T15:03:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T15:12:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The NIH has decided to withhold the final $1.38 million in grant money for Iowa State University following the scandal surrounding Dong-Pyou Han's tainted lab results."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2bc\"", "article_summary": "The research team at Iowa State Univerity will no longer recieve $1.38M in grant money to go towards an AIDS vaccine.\nLast year, Iowa State University researcher Dr. Dong-Pyou Han resigned after news of his falsified research results regarding an HIV vaccine became public knowledge.\nThe NIH originally awarded Han\u2019s research team, which is led by biomedical sciences professor Michael Cho, $6.8 million to be distributed over the course of five years.\nUnfortunately, following the controversy surrounding Han\u2019s inauthentic lab results, the NIH announced on Tuesday that it would no longer award Iowa State University\u2019s AIDS research team their final installment, Time reported.\nIowa State University\u2019s spokesman, John McCarroll, explained that the remaining 10 team members, who were completely unaware of Han\u2019s forgery, may have enough funding to continue their work."}
