The makers of the new historical drama \u201cVersailles\u201d hope so.\n\nBased on King Louis XIV, the series has a budget of $30 million \u2014 making it the most expensive show France has ever produced. And the biggest surprise for a nation known for Gallic pride: The show will be in English.\n\nThe ambition is none other than to put France on the international television map. French television had already been making global strides with the French zombie series \u201cThe Returned\u201d bagging the 2013 International Emmy Award and Netflix launching in France with a new French political thriller, \u201cMarseille.\u201d With \u201cVersailles,\u201d the goal is to compete head-to-head in the United States with the likes of Britain\u2019s \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and American fantasy smash hit \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nThe show will be broadcast from November in France on Canal+. The plan is then to bring it to the United States, Britain and beyond.\n\nIn order to give it more international appeal, \u201cVersailles\u201d was filmed entirely in English, from a script by British and American writers. That\u2019s tantamount to sacrilege in a nation that fiercely defends its language \u2014 and where intellectuals rail against Hollywood domination.\n\nThe producers are unapologetic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the French Academy would say. We\u2019re going to get a lot of flak. But they should relax,\u201d said co-producer Claude Chelli. \u201cIt\u2019s realpolitik \u2014 if you want to be heard and seen everywhere in the world, you have to go through English.\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cVersailles\u201d airs at home this fall, it will be subtitled or dubbed into French.\n\n\u201cI know it seems strange to French people. But it\u2019s nice to have another angle to our own culture,\u201d Chelli said. \u201cThe English and American (scriptwriters) brought something and wrote stuff that no French person could write.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s plot has been shrouded in secrecy. All that is known so far is that the series explores the life of Louis XIV and features George Blagden from \u201cVikings\u201d as the womanizing king; Lizzie Brochere from \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d; and Amira Casar as a trouble-ridden courtesan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New series \u201cVersailles\u201d hopes to mark French TV golden age", "title": "New series \u201cVersailles\u201d hopes to mark French TV golden age", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New series \u201cVersailles\u201d hopes to mark French TV golden age", "title": "New series \u201cVersailles\u201d hopes to mark French TV golden age", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/13/new_series_versailles_hopes_to_mark_french_tv_golden_age/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/france-versailles.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New series \u201cVersailles\u201d hopes to mark French TV golden age", "title": "New series \u201cVersailles\u201d hopes to mark French TV golden age", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/france-versailles.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Adamson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsVERSAILLES, France (AP) \u2014 Will the Sun King usher in the dawn of a French television golden age?\nThe ambition is none other than to put France on the international television map.\nBased on King Louis XIV, the series has a budget of $30 million \u2014 making it the most expensive show France has ever produced.\nIn order to give it more international appeal, \u201cVersailles\u201d was filmed entirely in English, from a script by British and American writers.\n\u201cThe English and American (scriptwriters) brought something and wrote stuff that no French person could write.\u201dThe show\u2019s plot has been shrouded in secrecy."}
