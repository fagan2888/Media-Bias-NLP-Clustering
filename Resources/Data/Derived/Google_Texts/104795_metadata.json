Airy icon, as visible and hardy as Lincoln Drive (but much more compassionate) since she became a partner in the Mt. Airy Family Practice, 760 Carpenter Lane, in 1989. Dr. Good, 67, graduated with high honors from every school she ever attended since being the valedictorian of her class at Mt. Pleasant High School in Wilmington, DE, in 1966.\n\nBut Dr. Good, who is regarded as an angel of mercy by thousands of patients (currently about 10,000 active patients) at the Mt. Airy Family Practice because of her kind, caring manner and her refusal to allow a corporate takeover, recently announced that she would be leaving the practice in early July. She is not retiring from the practice of medicine, however, as she expects to do volunteer work, possibly on behalf of the large homeless population in the city.\n\nI hate to use cliches, so I won\u2019t say that her successor has big shoes to fill (I don\u2019t even know what size Dr. Good\u2019s shoes are), but it is definitely a tough act to follow. (Sorry; that clich\u00e9 just slipped out.)\n\nLauren Kummer, MD, 28, who will be joining the group on Independence Day (no political significance there, though), is a graduate of Temple University School of Medicine. She completed her residency in Family Medicine at Chestnut Hill Hospital. Dr. Kummer sees patients of all ages and has a special interest in women\u2019s health, preventative medicine, minor office procedures and sports medicine.\n\n\u201cI felt strongly about staying in the community in which I have been practicing for the last three years,\u201d Dr. Kummer said last week. \u201cI was specifically drawn to Mt. Airy Family Practice\u2019s unique commitment to patient-centered care.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting with the providers and staff, it was clear to me that they work efficiently as a team to coordinate care and that they are very accessible to patients.\u201d\n\nDr. Kummer grew up in Southampton, Bucks County but now lives in the Chestnut Hill area. She went to Mount St. Joseph High School and the University of Notre Dame before Temple Medical School.\n\n\u201cThe first two years of medical school,\u201d she said, \u201cwere essentially all classroom-based study. The abrupt transition from the classroom to the world of clinical medicine in my third year was difficult but very rewarding. The concepts I had learned began to truly sink in when I had the opportunity to apply them to patients I met in person.\u201d\n\nDr. Kummer admits the thought that she may have made the wrong career choice briefly crossed her mind during a few long overnight shifts in the hospital as a resident, but she is now very confident in her career choice.\n\nOne major issue these days is how much Obamacare has changed family practice, if at all. \u201cPrimary care offices have seen an influx of patients who had previously been uninsured,\u201d replied Dr. Kummer, \u201cand then obtained coverage through the Obamacare marketplace.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, there has been a policy shift from emphasis on volume of patients seen to quality of care provided. This has allowed practices to make an investment in improving overall patient care and inviting patients to become more engaged in their health care process\u2026\n\n\u201cI have had the opportunity to work with primary care physicians who knew their patients so well that they could just feel when things were awry with their health. I knew that I wanted this continuity of care in my career in medicine, with the cornerstone being on the ongoing, patient-physician relationship.\u201d\n\nWe have all seen medical dramas on TV. What do they usually get right, and what do they usually get wrong about the real-life practice of medicine?\n\n\u201cMedical dramas often tell high-adrenaline stories of patients with the rarest of conditions, some of which may never be encountered in an average physician\u2019s career. Underlying the wacky story lines, there are some grains of truth. Medicine is very team-based, physicians deal with ethical issues on a regular basis, and residency is really hard work.\u201d\n\nWho are Dr. Kummer\u2019s favorite writers? \u201cOne of my favorite writers is Atul Gawande. He is a surgeon who has written several books about medicine and public health based on his personal experiences. His writing is much less dry than medical textbooks.\u201d\n\nWhat was the hardest thing the young doctor ever had to do? \u201cThe hardest thing I ever had to do was say goodbye to my grandmother, who was a very important part of my life.\n\n\u201cShe was suffering from advanced colon cancer as I was leaving to go away to college. Knowing that I would not be back in the area for two months, our final goodbye was quite a challenge. This provided me with an introduction to the struggles of the end-of-life process, even before I had decided on a career in medicine.\u201d\n\nWhat is the best advice Dr. Kummer ever received? \u201cListening is very different from hearing. I learned early on in medical school that what you say matters less than what people hear and understand.\u201d\n\nIn her spare time the Chestnut Hill resident, who is able to keep calm in high-pressure situations, enjoys outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, skiing, playing basketball and attending sporting events.\n\nMore information at 215-848-6880 or www.mtairyfamilypractice.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Lauren Kummer will be joining the Mt.
