(AP) \u2014 Malcolm Brogdon said he wasn\u2019t trying to assert himself any more than usual. It just worked out that way.\n\nBrogdon scored 17 of his 26 points in the first half and No. 3 Virginia used a 16-5 second-half run to break open a tie game and held off No. 7 North Carolina 79-74 on Saturday night, the Cavaliers\u2019 19th consecutive home victory.\n\n\u201cI just had opportunities,\u201d Brogdon said of the first half, when he made 6 of 8 shots, including a pair of 3-pointers, to help the Cavaliers to a 38-35 lead at the break. \u201cI try to come out aggressive every game. I try to take what the defense gives me but at the same time, I try to sense when my team is struggling on offense or doing well on offense and I try to adjust my game to that.\u201d\n\nAnthony Gill added 15 points and London Perrantes 12 for the Cavaliers (22-6, 11-5 Atlantic Coast Conference), who moved within one game of the Tar Heels in the conference standings with two regular season games to play.\n\nIt was Brogdon who set the tone, North Carolina coach Roy Williams said, and it carried over all game long.\n\n\u201cMalcolm in the first half was as good a performance as we\u2019ve had against us this year, maybe several years,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter halftime, Gill led the way, scoring 11 of his points, including the last six in the run that whipped the sellout crowd, which included Virginia great Ralph Sampson, into a frenzy. After a recent scoring slump, Gill\u2019s resurgence was a welcome sight, coach Tony Bennett said.\n\n\u201cWe needed it all, and that\u2019s what I like to see,\u201d he said.\n\nJoel Berry II led the Tar Heels (23-6, 12-4) with 21 points, including five 3-pointers. Marcus Paige added 13 points and Brice Johnson and Justin Jackson each had 12, but Johnson, like Brogdon a league player of the year candidate, didn\u2019t score for the last 17 minutes of the game.\n\n\u201cHe got very discouraged,\u201d Williams said of the 6-foot-10 senior, who arrived averaging 17.2 points and 10.6 rebounds, but was limited to just nine field goal attempts and was guilty of five of the Tar Heels\u2019 13 turnovers, including one pass that went well into the crowd.\n\n\u201cHe got discouraged at that point, too,\u201d Williams said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brogdon\u2019s 26 lead No. 3 Virginia past No. 7 UNC, 79-74", "title": "Brogdon\u2019s 26 lead No. 3 Virginia past No. 7 UNC, 79-74", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brogdon\u2019s 26 lead No. 3 Virginia past No. 7 UNC, 79-74", "title": "Brogdon\u2019s 26 lead No. 3 Virginia past No. 7 UNC, 79-74", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/28/brogdons_26_lead_no_3_virginia_past_no_7_unc_79_74/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/north-carolina-virginia-basketball.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brogdon\u2019s 26 lead No. 3 Virginia past No. 7 UNC, 79-74", "title": "Brogdon\u2019s 26 lead No. 3 Virginia past No. 7 UNC, 79-74", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/north-carolina-virginia-basketball.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hank Kurz Jr.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Joel Berry II led the Tar Heels (23-6, 12-4) with 21 points, including five 3-pointers.\nAfter halftime, Gill led the way, scoring 11 of his points, including the last six in the run that whipped the sellout crowd, which included Virginia great Ralph Sampson, into a frenzy.\nBrogdon scored 17 of his 26 points in the first half and No.\n3 Virginia used a 16-5 second-half run to break open a tie game and held off No.\nIt was Brogdon who set the tone, North Carolina coach Roy Williams said, and it carried over all game long."}
