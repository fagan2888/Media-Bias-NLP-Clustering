Blaine resident Bill MacNally received the National Volunteer of the Year award from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 6. Photo courtesy of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society\n\nMacNally, 65, of Blaine, volunteered with a number of organizations even before his retirement in 2003, but dearest to his heart is his work with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nLast month, the society bestowed upon MacNally its highest honor: the National Volunteer of the Year Award.\n\nMacNally accepted the award at the National MS Society\u2019s National Leadership Conference in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 6.\n\nHis wife, Janet, and son, Andrew, were along to see MacNally recognized.\n\n\u201cI was very moved by it,\u201d MacNally said. \u201cI don\u2019t do this work because I want to be honored or achieve some kind of recognition \u2013 I do it because I care about the people and the cause.\u201d\n\nMacNally has been highly involved with the National MS Society since shortly after his MS diagnosis at age 46 in 1996.\n\nHe sits on the MS Society\u2019s Board of Trustees as the Government Relations Committee chairperson, leveraging his experience as a hospital administrator to really dive into policy.\n\nRecently, MacNally recalls lobbying for Medicare expansion, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, legalization of marijuana, additional transportation options, improved access to neurologists and MS specialists and more.\n\nHe strives to work at all MS fundraising events and programs in Minnesota, including walks, bike rides and MuckFest.

Photo courtesy of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to volunteer engagement, Bill truly leads the way,\u201d said Holly Anderson, president of the National MS Society Upper Midwest Chapter. \u201cHis passion and dedication is evident in everything he does. There is no doubt that Bill\u2019s contagious enthusiasm has surely brought us closer to a world free of the disease.\u201d\n\nMS affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide, 400,000 in the United States. The disease affects the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the body\u2019s nerves and the brain.\n\nSeveral forms of MS exist and vary in their severity. MacNally has relapsing-remitting MS, one of the more mild manifestations of the disease.\n\nMacNally experiences numbness and tingling in his limbs. He has double vision and experiences foot drop, causing him to wear customized braces on both legs. He doesn\u2019t tolerate heat well and fights fatigue daily.\n\nNo cure for MS exists, and when MacNally was diagnosed, there was nothing available to treat the disease.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the first drugs hit the market.\n\nMacNally takes three shots weekly to manage his MS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made fantastic progress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to have MS, but it\u2019s a great time to have it.\u201d\n\nResearchers are hard at work developing drugs for individuals with more debilitating forms of the disease \u2013 secondary-progressive and primary-progressive.\n\nMacNally will continue his work with the National MS Society.\n\n\u201cIt means a great deal to me,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ABC Newspapers", "title": "Blaine resident is MS Society\u2019s Volunteer of the Year", "url": "http://ecmpublishers.com/2015/12/11/blaine-resident-is-ms-societys-volunteer-of-the-year/", "image": "http://abcnewspapers.ecmpublishers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/12/MSAward2-300x200.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117651516683}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Blaine resident Bill MacNally received the National Volunteer of the Year award from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 6.\nMacNally accepted the award at the National MS Society\u2019s National Leadership Conference in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 6.\nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society Board Chairperson Eli Rubenstein, left, and National Multiple Sclerosis Society President and Chief Executive Officer Cynthia Zagieboylo, right, stand with 2015 National Volunteer of the Year Bill MacNally, of Blaine.\nPhoto courtesy of the National Multiple Sclerosis SocietyMacNally, 65, of Blaine, volunteered with a number of organizations even before his retirement in 2003, but dearest to his heart is his work with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\nMacNally will continue his work with the National MS Society."}
