Berman, who joined Tuality in 1983, rises to lead the company as it launches an \"aggressive new long-range strategic plan focused on growth.\" That growth includes a major expansion of its Forest Grove hospital, with plans to double the number of employees there.\n\n\n\nStenson will stay with the company through February as a special advisor to the board of directors.\n\n\n\nTuality Healthcare operates its main hospital in Hillsboro with smaller service centers and clinics in its downtown campus and in Forest Grove.\n\n\n\nIn a press release, the company praised Stenson for spearheading employee and facility growth while building partnerships with groups including Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center and Pacific University.\n\n\"The Tuality Healthcare board is grateful for the leadership Dick Stenson has provided and his unwavering commitment to the special role we play as a Community Hospital in the health and wellness of our entire community, including our most vulnerable members,\" said Darell Lumaco, the board chair.\n\n\n\n\n\nStenson leaves as CEO in an uncertain environment for the future of community hospitals.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, federal government payments to hospitals have been cut and hospitals with high readmission rates are penalized. The hospital industry is undergoing a big wave of mergers where smaller hospitals are gobbled up into larger systems.\n\nTuality had entered \"affiliation\" discussions with Providence Health & Services in 2012, although it would have remained an independent hospital.\n\nTuality posted a net loss of $5.8 million in 2011 after an accounting, non-cash adjustment of about $10 million for a pension plan change, according to data gathered by The Lund Report, an Oregon health news site, and Tuality.\n\nAnd on a local level, Kaiser Permanente opened its Westside Medical Center in August, Washington County's first new hospital in 40 years. The emergency room competes with Tuality Community Hospital's. Stenson told The Lund Report in October that he feared the upcoming Kaiser hospital might poach employees.\n\n--Fenit Nirappil: 503-294-4029; fnirappil@oregonian.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Fenit Nirappil | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "tuality healthcare", "title": "Tuality Healthcare CEO Dick Stenson retires after 22 years", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Tuality Healthcare CEO Dick Stenson retires after 22 years\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2013/09/tuality_healthcare_ceo_dick_st.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/hillsboro_news/photo/13405971-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11239182\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-14T00:36:38Z\", \"author\": \"Fenit Nirappil | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@argus-news\",\"@breaking-news\",\"@business\",\"@health\",\"@hillsboro\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@washington-county\",\"tuality healthcare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/hillsboro_news/photo/13405971-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Manny Berman, current COO, takes over in November.", "card": "summary", "site": "@oregonlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 16, 2013, 10:30 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/hillsboro_news/photo/dick-stenson-ad5261adb3e22a00.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"nirapp-f\", \"author_nickname\": \"Fenit Nirappil | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"10589965\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Hillsboro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Manny Berman, current COO, takes over in November.", "title": "Tuality Healthcare CEO Dick Stenson retires after 22 years", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2013/09/tuality_healthcare_ceo_dick_st.html", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_olive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, September 13, 2013,  5:36 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Manny Berman, current COO, takes over in November."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde01b\"", "article_summary": "Dick Stenson is retiring as President and CEO of Tuality Healthcare, which operates hospitals and medical centers in Hillsboro and Forest Grove, after 22 years.\nTuality Healthcare operates its main hospital in Hillsboro with smaller service centers and clinics in its downtown campus and in Forest Grove.\nThe emergency room competes with Tuality Community Hospital's.\nStenson leaves as CEO in an uncertain environment for the future of community hospitals.\nBerman, who joined Tuality in 1983, rises to lead the company as it launches an \"aggressive new long-range strategic plan focused on growth.\""}
