The satirical comic poked fun at their attempt to establish a \u201ccaliphate,\u201d an Islamic state ruled by a religious or political leader, and even went as far as to claim the terrorist group was \u201cjealous\u201d over the attention given to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nOn the same day ISIS released their crudely made threat, President Obama announced the deployment of 3,000 American troops to help \u201ccombat and contain\u201d the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has currently claimed over 2,200 lives.
