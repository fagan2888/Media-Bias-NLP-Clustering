In Kootenai County, it looks like nearly 7,000 human beings who can\u2019t get health insurance. In Shoshone County, it\u2019s about 800. Statewide, it\u2019s 78,000 \u2013 the population of Coeur d\u2019Alene plus Post Falls plus Rathdrum \u2013 all people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidized insurance, and who have been left hanging by Idaho\u2019s lawmakers, who would rather spend more state and county tax money and deny their constituents health care than buckle to the tyranny of Obamacare.\n\nWhat else does it look like? Most people in Idaho\u2019s Medicaid gap work \u2013 68 percent of uninsured households have at least one employed person. More than half have kids at home. You might wonder: Do they not get sick, these residents of the gap? Of course they do. But without insurance, they tend to go longer without care and thus get sicker, tend to ignore chronic problems until they reach a crisis, tend to wind up in expensive emergency services and tend to wind up costing state and local governments a lot of money.\n\nThat has been the conclusion of two special working groups of experts convened in Idaho, both of which recommended that Idaho expand its Medicaid program under Obamacare. Hospital officials and county commissioners \u2013 whose budgets are strained by indigent care \u2013 have urged the same. Idaho lawmakers, like those in 20 other red states, refused because a government-run health care program is like the Holocaust.\n\nIs there any reason to hope that Jenny Steinke\u2019s death might change their mind?\n\nSteinke was a 36-year-old woman living squarely inside the Medicaid gap when she died in Idaho Falls last month following a severe asthma attack. She had been suffering worsening symptoms for weeks before she died, taking increasingly frequent hits off short-acting inhalers while waiting for the insurance from her husband\u2019s new job to take effect so she could see a specialist, according to a story in the Idaho Falls Post Register.\n\nSteinke had a severe asthma attack Sept. 1 and arrived at the hospital blue in the face and not breathing. Days later, she died. Her mother called it \u201cdeath by poverty.\u201d Her ER doc, Ken Krell, told the Post-Register that if she\u2019d been able to get preventive care earlier, she likely would have been put on oral steroids and not even needed hospitalization at all.\n\n\u201cSeveral times a week I see people who have delayed medical care because they don\u2019t have coverage, either Medicaid or insurance,\u201d said Krell, who has been a public advocate of Medicaid expansion. \u201cThey put off being seen until it\u2019s really dire. It\u2019s a very common occurrence.\u201d\n\nIdaho lawmakers do not listen to people like Krell. They listen to people like Wayne Hoffman, the president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation. The IFF is a bogus charity that claims tax-free status as an educational institution, though its only educational effort seems to be teaching legislators how to vote.\n\nHoffman wrote a blog post last week lashing out at those who would draw a connection between Steinke\u2019s death and the Legislature\u2019s decision to keep the Medicaid gap open. He said that doing so was \u201ca lie,\u201d and part of a \u201cdesperation narrative,\u201d and pointed out that, hey, get over it, people die.\n\n\u201cPeople in private insurance die, just as people on government programs or no program,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLest you think Hoffman is simply ignorant and selfish, he wants you to know that he opposes Medicaid because Medicaid is bad for people\u2019s health. He said that \u201cseveral studies have found with great consistency that people on government health programs don\u2019t necessarily do better than people on no program at all. \u2026 These reports all found, consistently, that patients would have been better off if they weren\u2019t part of the federal government\u2019s Medicaid system.\u201d\n\nThe reports find no such thing. They make much more narrow conclusions about health outcomes in populations and find, unsurprisingly, that the Medicaid population is sicker and more troubled than average.\n\nI asked Hoffman for some citations. They included: A University of Pennsylvania study showing slightly higher mortality rates and incidence of surgical complications for Medicaid patients than uninsured patients. A study in Florida showing Medicaid patients were more likely to have certain late-stage cancers at diagnosis \u2013 rather than being caught by earlier care \u2013 than the uninsured. A University of Pittsburgh study showing throat cancer patients on Medicaid had a far greater likelihood of advanced cancer at diagnosis than \u2026 people with private insurance.\n\nDoes Hoffman believe that Medicaid causes these outcomes?\n\nI asked him this and he said no, then added: \u201c\u2026 when you create an entitlement for which people are merely enrolled, there are other possible side effects, and not all of them good.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026. yes? Sounds like yes.\n\nThis is like concluding that homeless shelters cause homelessness. The Kaiser Family Foundation notes that the Medicaid population starts off with \u201cdistinctly higher rates of poverty, chronic illness and disability\u201d than both the privately insured and the uninsured.\n\n\u201cA large body of studies over several decades provides consistent, strong evidence that Medicaid coverage lowers financial barriers to access for low-income uninsured people and increases their likelihood of having a usual source of care, translating into increased use of preventive, primary and other care, and improvements in some measures of health,\u201d the foundation said in a 2013 report.\n\nBut the argument is not really about science. There is a form of magical thinking at work here, in which government of any kind \u2013 from a zoning regulation in Burley to a federal health insurance program \u2013 is a villain of Voldemortian proportions, so much so that Hoffman and the people who share his views can believe, or at least say they believe, that people are better off with no health insurance than they are with insurance that is tainted by government.\n\nWonder what Jenny Steinke would say about that.\n\nShawn Vestal can be reached at (509) 459-5431 or shawnv@spokesman.com.
