Denver police are investigating the fatal shooting of a man and a subsequent car chase and resulting accident that occurred early Saturday morning, authorities say.

The name of the homicide victim has not been released.

He was pronounced dead at Harvard Gulch West Park near West Vassar Avenue and South Federal Boulevard in southwest Denver.

Police have arrested a man following a car chase that may be related to the homicide, said Sonny Jackson, Denver police spokesman. Jackson said that a police officer was hurt when he crashed during the same car chase. “We’re not sure this individual is related to the homicide,” Jackson said. “It might be related.”

The man is being held on an unrelated outstanding arrest warrant, he said.

Police were called at 10:22 a.m. about a shooting in the park, he said. When they arrived, police set up a perimeter and began looking for a suspect.

Officers saw a man who appeared to match a description of the shooter near the park at South Federal Boulevard and West Mansfield Avenue.

The man climbed into an SUV and drove rapidly away. A car chase ensued. During the chase, the person of interest crashed near West 25th Avenue and Clay Street, Jackson said.

An officer who was involved in the chase also crashed.

Jackson said neither the officer nor the person involved in the chase were seriously injured.

Their names have not been released.
