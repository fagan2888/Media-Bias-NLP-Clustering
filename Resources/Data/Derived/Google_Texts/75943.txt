J.C. Flowers Takes Over AmeriLife

The deal comes as more private equity firms back companies offering insurance products, including Nassau Reinsurance and York Risk Services

Private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC has agreed to acquire AmeriLife Group, an independent distributor of annuity, life and health insurance products.

The deal marks an exit for Reservoir Capital Group and Black Diamond Capital Partners, which have owned AmeriLife since 2007. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the price tag was reportedly around $500 million.

The companyÂ’s management has agreed to reinvest a significant portion of their proceeds alongside J.C. Flowers. AmeriLife specializes in servicing the senior market.

Morgan Stanley & Co. has acted as financial adviser to J.C. Flowers in the transaction, and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP has acted as its legal adviser.
