The ruling also spurred the creation of the Super PAC, which has been frequently utilized by Democrats and Republicans to raise millions of dollars for their campaigns. Super PACs have become known for their negative political advertisements during election season, as well.\n\nMcCain has made it clear in the past that he has never supported the Court\u2019s ruling on the matter. Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in June 2012, McCain called the decision \u201carrogant, uninformed, na\u00efve,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cI think there will be scandals associated with the worst decision of the United States Supreme Court in the 21st century,\u201d the Senator said to then-host David Gregory. Discussing the Justices themselves, McCain quipped, \u201cI just wish one of them had run for county sheriff.\u201d\n\nThe Citizens United decision also removed financial protections that McCain had worked tirelessly to create with Democrat Russ Feingold, a former U.S. Senator from Wisconsin. The 2002 financial reform limited the amount of monetary influence corporations could have on campaigns and elections and was considered a landmark piece of legislation due to the bipartisanship and effectiveness of the bill.\n\nOddly enough, McCain, a self-described \u201cmaverick\u201d in his own party, did not list the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in 2012 on the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, which kept in place the majority of the President\u2019s definitive domestic achievement. Since that ruling, Republicans, particularly in the U.S. House of Representatives, have voted to repeal the legislation several times.\n\nSources: The New York Times, 12 News \u2013 Arizona\n\nPhoto Credit: nationofchange.org, 12 News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Speaking to reporters in Cave Creek, Arizona, on May 25, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona discus...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "'We Will Have A Reform': John McCain Blasts Citizens United Ruling", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/john-mccain-names-supreme-court-s-worst-decision", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "Speaking to reporters in Cave Creek, Arizona, on May 25, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona discus...", "title": "'We Will Have A Reform': John McCain Blasts Citizens United Ruling"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-28T16:04:05+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2015-05-28T16:04:05+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 855096}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1752\"", "article_summary": "Senator John McCain of Arizona discussed the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission case.\nDiscussing the Justices themselves, McCain quipped, \u201cI just wish one of them had run for county sheriff.\u201dThe Citizens United decision also removed financial protections that McCain had worked tirelessly to create with Democrat Russ Feingold, a former U.S.\nIn January 2010, the Court sided with Citizens United, in ruling that businesses and unions were allowed to contribute unlimited funds into political campaigns via advertisements to promote a lawmaker\u2019s candidacy.\nMcCain has made it clear in the past that he has never supported the Court\u2019s ruling on the matter.\n\u201cI think there will be scandals associated with the worst decision of the United States Supreme Court in the 21st century,\u201d the Senator said to then-host David Gregory."}
