I was inclined to. Not only because I\u2019m a fan of her acting and like that she\u2019s an oddball who seems allergic to bullshit, but because she too is a member of the dead dad\u2019s club, and her first book has her dad\u2019s fingerprints all over it. Parker\u2019s debut, \u201cDear Mr. You,\u201d is a celebration of the masculine presented in the form of letters penned to various men in Parker\u2019s life, including the grandfather she never met, her accountant and the \u201cfuture man who loves my daughter\u201d (which appeared in a column Parker wrote for Esquire).\n\nIn person, Parker buzzes with an electric intelligence, moving at warp speed between the poetry of Philip Larkin, the life of bees, blow jobs and Yaqui Indian holy days. She is warm, pathologically charming, quick to laugh, and her trademark second-too-long stare \u2014 which makes her appear capable of breaking down the molecular structure of a spoon \u2014 suggests she is just dialed in deeper to the universe than the rest of us poor fools. Which you\u2019d only need read the book to discover.\n\nOur conversation took place in a diner in Brooklyn Heights. We began talking about how loud it is appropriate to talk in a caf\u00e9, given the ratio of customers on computers to just-there-for-the-brew customers, and ended nearly two hours later recalling our favorite lines from Kevin Young\u2019s \u201cBereavement,\u201d a poem about the sudden death of his father and the dogs he\u2019d left behind. \u201cTheir grief is colossal and forgetful,\u201d we say.\n\nThe good news \u2014 no, the great news \u2014 is that \u201cDear Mr. You\u201d is a revelation and Ms. Parker, who I hope writes many more books, the real deal.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest and say I didn\u2019t know what to expect from \u201cDear Mr. You.\u201d I\u2019ve always been a fan of your acting, but when I heard you had written a book I was like, God, I hope it\u2019s good. I knew you\u2019d written for Esquire, but I had no idea you were such a gifted, natural, amazing like I\u2019m dog-earing-pages-and-underlining-sentences good writer. I could imagine people in the literary world rolling their eyes like, Super, another Tom-Hanks-in-the-New-Yorker situation.\n\nMy agent wanted to send it out blind without my name on it. That was a very good idea.\n\nIt was a very good idea.\n\nThe tricky thing about the book is, you know, Mary Louise Parker wrote a book, but it\u2019s hopefully not the book that you think she would write. There\u2019s very little about acting in the book anyway. It wasn\u2019t like a conscious omission or anything. It wasn\u2019t one of those stories that I was compelled to tell. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a hugely famous person. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m an icon or something \u2014 why would you wanna read it anyway? It would be pretty audacious of me to write a book like that.\n\nAnd I love books and I love reading and I love writing. I\u2019m not interested in reading those other kind of books, either, and I completely understand that someone would think that\u2019s what I wrote, of course they would be skeptical because why would they think otherwise? Unless they read my writing in Esquire. After a certain point I got used to people making comments, like Did you write that yourself? I didn\u2019t really tell anyone I was writing a book. I just saw a couple of smirks, which I understand, I really do.\n\nPlus, you are a famously private person.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in laying out the story of life in any way or sense. Whatever was revealed about me in this book was by default. I was telling all these stories about these men, and I took a lot of creative license with it. I wanted to write a book that was entirely about gratitude but still unflinching in the way that I depicted certain things \u2014 and about the fact that I haven\u2019t figured out all of this.\n\nSome people have called it a memoir but it\u2019s more literary non-fiction.\n\nIt was not a memoir to me. How could it be? There\u2019s so little about acting, there\u2019s so little about so much of my life. The term memoir \u2014 there\u2019s no give in that definition, that I realized.\n\nI think also you have to write the book you want to read and the book only you can write. Someone else can write a book about you, and if you worked with them it could be a perfectly acceptable representation of your life. But no one else could write this book. Only you could write this book. I don\u2019t know why anybody would waste their time writing something they don\u2019t care deeply about or that they\u2019re not really passionate about. If you really do things wholeheartedly, you wouldn\u2019t want to compromise like that.\n\nWhat inspired the book, what sparked it was my relationship with my dad. At the end of the day that\u2019s why the book exists at all. On a number of levels, so much of it, even the cover \u2013 I wanted that oyster on the cover, you know, for my dad.\n\nMy first book \u2014 it\u2019s a novel in short stories \u2014 is in part about my father.\n\nReally? Some people don\u2019t get that. They\u2019re suspicious of it.\n\nPeople are suspicious of the daddy thing. And they\u2019re suspicious of women who like men. When a man likes women, it\u2019s a really positive thing. If a woman says she likes men, it\u2019s like warning bells.\n\nI never thought about that before. I think that\u2019s probably true.\n\nWhen a man likes women, it\u2019s seen as a positive thing. You know, \u201cOh, George Clooney, he really likes women,\u201d and every one goes, \u201cWow, how marvelous!\u201d\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t he?\n\nI know. But if a woman who enjoys the company of men, she\u2019s suddenly suspect. It\u2019s, \u201cOh, she\u2019s one of those women\u2013a woman who doesn\u2019t like women.\u201d\n\nOh right, right, right. \u201cWho needs that attention?\u201d \u2014 which is also true. What\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s lovely attention to have, and to bask in it is lovely. Why wouldn\u2019t you want that? If you live your life at the expense of other things, obviously, that\u2019s a different story. But the book is just about things male. Themes male and textures and smells and things like that. Like in \u201cMan out of Time\u201d \u2014\n\nThe man you meet at the party with the beautiful shoes, who has cancer\u2026\n\n\u2014 the way he\u2019s dressed, there\u2019s something so male about him. He was really beautiful.\n\nThat reminds me, we meet his girlfriend in that piece \u2026 Some reader-reviewers have objected to the fact that there aren\u2019t more women in the book.\n\nIn \u201cDear Orderly,\u201d I go on about my mother, but the point is, that\u2019s not the book I wrote. I wrote a book called, \u201cDear Mr. You.\u201d I didn\u2019t write a book called, \u201cThis Is the Story of My Life and My Appreciation of Humanity.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t read comments or reviews or things like that, so it gives me the freedom to kind of imagine whatever book I wanted. I wasn\u2019t doing something to try to please someone, except my Dad, wherever he is, and myself.\n\nIt\u2019s really quite simple to untangle. It\u2019s like these are some men that I found heroic, and I wanted to write my own rumination on that, and I wrote it in probably four and a half months. It might have been a different book if I had more time to write it. There are a lot of people I would have loved to have written about.\n\nDid you write any letters that didn\u2019t make the cut?\n\nOh yeah, many.\n\nWas it because you were dissatisfied with the way they turned out, or in the end, did they not work as part of the whole?\n\nWell, some felt like they were repeating an emotional note. Some weren\u2019t as vivid. Then there was one about this painter that I love so much, and he had a very big effect on my life. I was actually writing it the night that I got sick \u2014 that turned into \u201cDear Doctor.\u201d\n\nAnd I do like that letter, it just didn\u2019t fit in with the rest of the book. It was tonally very different. But some of my favourite sentences were in that letter.\n\nThere is one letter, \u201cDear Cerberus,\u201d that is written not to one man, but to three beastly ex-boyfriends who you say, \u201cYou were the worst of those I called darling.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a conversation that I still have with myself. I fully don\u2019t understand those relationships, but I am grateful for them as corny as it sounds\u2013there were sweet aspects to those relationships. In the book I say, \u201cI could be the bad person in someone else\u2019s story.\u201d\n\nYou are exceptionally even-handed.\n\nThere\u2019s one mean line in the entire book, and I just could not take it out, because I liked it so much.\n\nI think I know what it is.\n\nIn the end, I admit that \u201cHaving sex with you was like making snow angels under a rhino\u201d \u2014 I couldn\u2019t take that out.\n\nI knew it. And no, you\u2019re not going to kill that darling,\n\nI didn\u2019t say who it was! When I was writing for Esquire, I once wrote something, or maybe twice if I\u2019m honest \u2026 I took a shot at somebody, in some way, for a joke. It was not that funny, the piece was not better \u2014 I was so filled with shame when I saw it. I really don\u2019t think I would ever do that again. It would take a lot. Words are so powerful to me, and now they\u2019re so endurable and transferable, and they show up somewhere else 20 years later. There\u2019s no reason.\n\nI wanted to write \u2014 I have a son \u2014 something positive, something good. These are good stories about people that don\u2019t get told. These men, they\u2019re heroic and incredible, and Father Bob [\u201cDear Father Bob,\u201d in which MLP asks the minister if there is anyone in Hell] changed the entire way I look at religion just by pausing before he answered my question at the age of nine. It had a profound effect on the way I treat other people.\n\nIs that so?\n\nI\u2019m a deeply, deeply, obviously flawed person but I wanted it to be something sweet. I didn\u2019t want it to be an indictment of anyone or a finger wagging, because I could write that book. It could be really clever, and there are a lot of things I could say that are salacious or whatever. But, that\u2019s not what I want to show my children.\n\nI\u2019ve written things that, at the time, I thought were so clever, so funny, so smart, but in hindsight just seem naked and pathetic. The person who took the napalm to the face doesn\u2019t see it as naked or pathetic, of course; they just see what I wrote as nasty.\n\nThe most injurious thing is to make someone believe something unkind about themselves. There\u2019s nothing I can do, there\u2019s no bubble I can put myself in, that will protect me from cynicism and disdain and aggression. I\u2019m totally aware that that\u2019s a world I live in, because I chose to do this with my life. Had there been cell phones and Internet when I started acting, I\u2019d probably be a kindergarten teacher.\n\nIf that technology existed while I was in high school, I would have had to kill myself to protect my family\u2019s honor.\n\nNo way, no way. There\u2019s no way. There\u2019s so many more ways of being dishonest now that didn\u2019t exist before, in terms of, like, the way people flirt with each other on the Internet. Or the way that people behave inappropriately or things that we say about one another \u2014 it depresses me. People have been so kind to me. I\u2019m always so grateful for that.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if someone takes issue with what I wrote for lack of \u2026 bitchiness. My children were at the book party last night and I really felt like they understood what was different about my book. My son especially was proud, and that\u2019s, like, as big an achievement as my parents being proud of me. I got to have that moment for just a little second. It\u2019s hard for me to take in things that are good sometimes. I got to feel that for a second. I\u2019m glad that when they grow up \u2014 if they choose to read it \u2014 that\u2019s the book I wrote.\n\nThe first book you wrote.\n\nYeah, hopefully. I can just flail around for a whole decade. It\u2019s hard to organize me.\n\nIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t decide. Obviously I haven\u2019t had a lot of space to sit around and think, but it just isn\u2019t clear yet. But thank you for saying my first book. I want to so deeply start writing again, because I feel good when I\u2019m doing it. Not a lot of stuff feels this good.\n\nI get it. Nothing in the world feels as good as writing when it\u2019s going well. Writing is the only thing I\u2019ve ever done outside of being a mother that when I\u2019m doing it I don\u2019t feel like there is something else, something else more important, that I should be doing.\n\nI have it on stage as well. It\u2019s hard to give to that and be a mother. So I don\u2019t do as many plays as I used to.\n\nAnd your kids are proud of you!\n\nWell, they were for a second. But I don\u2019t know if they are, or they should be, because I\u2019m not the world\u2019s most perfect mother.\n\nWho is? Who would like her?\n\nRight, right!\n\nSomething that I liked \u2014 this gets back to what we were talking about earlier \u2014 what would people go for the book for? One thing a certain kind of reader is going to go to the book for is a letter to your ex. [Billy Crudup, who in an act of supreme dickishness left MLP for Claire Danes when she was seven months pregnant.] But he\u2019s not physically there. Instead what we see in \u201cDear Mr. Cab Driver\u201d is you, hugely pregnant, having an epic meltdown and screaming at a Sikh taxi driver.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could have any faith in me as the narrator of that book, if I didn\u2019t present myself honestly. There\u2019s a moment where somebody unwittingly held up a mirror \u2014 just by staring at me \u2026\n\nWe all suffer in different ways.\n\nI was so caught up in myself, and feeling persecuted. Had I reacted a different way that morning, I would\u2019ve been heroic but I had about this much going for me. I feel like you can maybe invest in me a little bit more as the person who\u2019s telling you the stories in this book.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Talking politics, feminism, sex and parenting -- sometimes all at once -- with the brilliant actress-turned-writer", "title": "\u201cI\u2019m the parent who wants their kids to have sex\u201d: Mary Louise Parker talks poetry, nudity, one-night stands and her brilliant new book", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Talking politics, feminism, sex and parenting -- sometimes all at once -- with the brilliant actress-turned-writer", "title": "\u201cI\u2019m the parent who wants their kids to have sex\u201d: Mary Louise Parker talks poetry, nudity, one-night stands and her brilliant new book", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/19/im_the_parent_who_wants_their_kids_to_have_sex_mary_louise_parker_talks_poetry_nudity_one_night_stands_and_her_brilliant_new_book/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/mary_louise_parker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Talking politics, feminism, sex and parenting -- sometimes all at once -- with the brilliant actress-turned-writer", "title": "\u201cI\u2019m the parent who wants their kids to have sex\u201d: Mary Louise Parker talks poetry, nudity, one-night stands and her brilliant new book", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/mary_louise_parker.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elissa Schappell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Dear Mr. You, Editor's Picks, Love and Sex, mary louise parker, Parenting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I think also you have to write the book you want to read and the book only you can write.\nI really don\u2019t care if someone takes issue with what I wrote for lack of \u2026 bitchiness.\nThe tricky thing about the book is, you know, Mary Louise Parker wrote a book, but it\u2019s hopefully not the book that you think she would write.\nTopics: Books, Dear Mr. You, Editor's Picks, Love and Sex, mary louise parker, Parenting, Life News, Entertainment NewsI was told I\u2019d like Mary Louise Parker.\nI really don\u2019t think I would ever do that again."}
