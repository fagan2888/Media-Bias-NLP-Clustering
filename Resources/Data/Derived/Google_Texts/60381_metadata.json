The last of those suits, against industrial giant Honeywell International Inc., really caught everyone\u2019s attention.\n\n\n\nThis has been a surprising turn from the Obama administration, which fully embraced wellness efforts with larger tax incentives in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nBut the case for those breaks continues to be under severe attack.\n\n\n\nJust this week, the most prominent skeptics of workplace wellness published their latest study\u2014on the blog of the well-regarded Health Affairs academic journal\u2014arguing that wellness programs actually increase employer spending on health care, rather than decreasing it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause today\u2019s conventional programs fail to pay for themselves and confer no proven net health benefit (and may on balance adversely affect health through over-diagnosis and promotion of unhealthy eating patterns), conventional wellness programs may fail the Americans with Disabilities Act\u2019s \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d standard if the financial forfeiture for non-participants is deemed coercive,\u201d wrote Al Lewis, Vik Khanna and Shana Montrose. That is exactly why the EEOC filed its three lawsuits against employer wellness programs, they added.\n\n\n\nA key piece of their analysis came from an academic journal review published in July of nearly 30 years of workplace wellness studies. The overall results of those 51 studies suggested wellness programs produce a 138 percent return on investment. But when looking only at the highest-quality studies\u2014those that randomized participants and compared them to a control group\u2014the study found that wellness programs produced a negative ROI of 22 percent.\n\n\n\nSo is that it? Are wellness programs worthless?\n\n\n\nCertainly not everyone is convinced. Julie Joerger, the director of global HR at Hillenbrand, said it makes sense for her company because its employees, who are predominantly male, stay for long periods of time.\n\n\n\nIf workers start developing more serious health issues in their 40s, odds are, Joerger said, they are still going to be on Hillenbrand\u2019s payroll 20 years later. It also has short-term advantages, she added, although they tend to be harder to measure.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis kind of program has so much more of an impact than just on their physical health,\u201d Joerger told me, citing mental health, home life and productivity on the job. \u201cIt makes us a better company.\u201d\n\n\n\nKarl Ahlrichs, a benefits consultant at Indianapolis-based Gregory & Appel who convenes a regular roundtable of local chief financial officers, said wellness is valuable strategically as a way to promote a more productive workforce and workplace culture.\n\n\n\nBut if CFOs are going to insist that wellness pay for itself in each fiscal year, he added, they\u2019re likely to be disappointed.\n\n\n\nAfter listening to all these folks, it seems as if wellness is just like the rest of health care: It\u2019s an area of spending, not savings. Yet its value, while hard to quantify, is likely significant.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Believe it or not, wellness is now a minefield for businesses.
