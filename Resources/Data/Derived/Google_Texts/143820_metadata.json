The organization runs two hospitals just across the Michigan border near Lake Erie and recently built a new five-story, 285,000-square-foot facility and renovated an existing five-story, 335,000-square-foot hospital tower. \u201cKeeping up with the rapid pace of change\u2014in terms of technology, new medical practices and procedures, process improvement/Lean initiatives, evolving regulations, and shifting patient demographics\u2014is a real design challenge.\u201d\n\nAdding even more complexity to the mix in the U.S. is the expectation that the Affordable Care Act will drive more non-urgent acute care into ambulatory care settings. \u201cThis also implies that the care delivered on the inpatient side of the equation will continue to increase in acuity levels,\u201d says John C. Schrott, president and managing principal architect with IKM (Pittsburgh). \u201cTo prepare for that eventuality, providers are looking to create flexibility for their patient units such that the conversion from acute to step down to critical care can be accomplished in the most cost and time effective manner.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of ways that healthcare facility design\u2014from infrastructure to interiors\u2014can be approached to make future transitions a bit easier. Granted, there will be more upfront cost required. However, experts say the investment today will better prepare providers for the unknowns of tomorrow.\n\nStarting with structure\n\nTo create necessary spatial clearances to support the reassignment of space in the future\u2014and to accommodate the new equipment and clearances that may be required, as well\u2014structural bays, defined as spacing from the center of one structural column to another, has grown from 28 feet to more than 32 feet for new clinical settings. This allows enough space for surgery, imaging, inpatient, or emergency bays, for example, to be sized appropriately now and retrofitted for other uses later without column placement restricting options, explains Curtis Skolnick, managing director of CBRE Healthcare (Richmond, Va.).\n\nFor deck heights\u2014as measured from the top of one floor slab to the bottom of the floor slab above\u2014Skolnick recommends 14 feet to 18 feet to allow mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) and information technology (IT) systems to be appropriately sized for current use and future adaptability.\n\nIn urban settings, or smaller sites with limited property space, it\u2019s also important to build with the foundation and structural support systems to allow future vertical expansion, he continues. \u201cBy placing mechanical spaces on the roof, they can later function as interstitial spaces for vertical expansion, which will allow for easy tie-in to critical infrastructure in the future.\u201d\n\nSchrott also advises to analyze head-end capacities for MEP equipment, which refers to primary system components such as the chiller and air handling units, to permit changes in space usage without the need to modify the systems in place. This includes stubbing the IT and MEP infrastructure behind the walls so that it can be easily tapped or expanded. In addition, \u201cplacing the plumbing chases appropriately, typically on the outboard side or stacked, helps when converting a fit-out room from medical/surgical to intensive care, or vice-versa,\u201d he adds.\n\nIncorporating additional shelled space in an initial build-out should also be considered, to support everything from the addition of elevators to expansion bays for boilers to large mechanical equipment. \u201dSome shelled spaces can be used for soft functions, such as storage or offices, and repurposed and fit-out later for their intended long-term use,\u201d Skolnick says.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Remodel / Renovation,Rooms and Workspaces,Architectural Design Ideas,Construction,Engineering,Facility Planning,Materials,Planning for Technology,Financial Matters,Building Ideas,Design Ideas", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd618b\"", "article_summary": "Click To View GalleryWhile healthcare organizations have always faced the challenge of adapting their facilities to evolving services, needs, technology, and healthcare delivery models, the tempo of that change is accelerating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible for a design that is one snapshot in time to support an ever-changing environment like healthcare,\u201d says Lisa Regan, director of performance and transformation for Bluewater Health of Ontario, Canada.\n\u201dSome shelled spaces can be used for soft functions, such as storage or offices, and repurposed and fit-out later for their intended long-term use,\u201d Skolnick says.\nThis includes stubbing the IT and MEP infrastructure behind the walls so that it can be easily tapped or expanded.\nIn urban settings, or smaller sites with limited property space, it\u2019s also important to build with the foundation and structural support systems to allow future vertical expansion, he continues."}
