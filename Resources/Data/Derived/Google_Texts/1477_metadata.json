Florida Hospital is now separating these roles.\n\nEffective Dec. 1, Houmann, who is also executive vice president of Adventist Health System, will be devoted full-time to the Florida Division.\n\n\u201cWith the ever-changing and growing landscape of the healthcare industry, the need for a Division focus has evolved significantly in recent years,\u201d said Don Jernigan, AHS president and chief executive officer. \u201cAdditionally, the Florida Division continues to thrive by addressing population health, the shift to a consumer-driven experience, as well as other strategic initiatives with system-wide reach. Our system will benefit from a more unified approach and our Florida Division leaders will help further ensure engagement while also mitigating risk.\u201d\n\nDaryl Tol, current president and chief executive officer of Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center, as well as the five Florida Hospitals in Volusia and Flagler counties, will become chief executive officer of the nine Florida Hospitals in the Orlando area.\n\nRob Fulbright, current senior executive officer for Florida Hospital Orlando, will become the chief executive officer of the five Florida Hospitals in Volusia and Flagler counties. Fulbright has held leadership positions at various Florida Hospitals, including in DeLand. He is known for shaping a positive culture, his understanding of CREATION Health, and his support of physician well-being.\n\nAs part of the leadership change, Houmann will be joined at AHS by Eddie Soler, who currently serves dual roles as the Chief Financial Officer of Florida Hospital and the Florida Division; and Chief Strategy Officer David Banks.\n\nHoumann, Soler and Banks will form the core leadership team will work to advance the strategic initiatives of the Florida Division.\n\n\u201cThe fresh perspective brought by these key leaders will instill new energy into the organizations and communities they serve. I\u2019m very excited about the opportunities this brings to our organization,\u201d Jernigan said. \u201cThese leaders are deeply devoted to our mission of extending the healing ministry of Christ and will be a tremendous asset in their new roles.\u201d\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
