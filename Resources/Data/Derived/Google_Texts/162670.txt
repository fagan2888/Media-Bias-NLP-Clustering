What if the government took over the internet? Ted Cruz’s office imagined what it might be like, with a pixelated Obama announcement that keeps stalling and can’t quite manage to load.

“Today I am happy to announce that the FCC has taken over the Internet and made it a public utility,” a fake Obama announces in the blurry video. “Your internet will be faster than ever. This is the same government that brought you the online success of HealthCare.gov and we know that we can continue to do great things for you online.”

And then the rest of the announcement gets cut off:

The FCC is expected to vote on net neutrality rules this month. Cruz has been a vocal opponent of regulation, calling net neutrality “Obamacare for the internet.”
