The IRS reported this week that 6.6 million people paid the ObamaCare mandate penalty for not having insurance last year, which the administration says is 10% higher than they’d expected.

This isn’t exactly good news, given that the entire point of the mandate penalty tax is to encourage everyone to buy coverage.

Even if it were, the number comes with two big caveats.

First, 250,000 of those people didn’t owe the penalty at all because they qualified for one of ObamaCare’s many exemptions. Another 50,000-plus paid too big a penalty. All told, these overpayments added up to $35 million, the IRS says.

The second big caveat is the fact that, whatever the administration says about the number of people paying the penalty, the actual money raised by the tax is far lower than had been predicted.

Assuming the IRS pays those 300,000 people back, the tax will have raised just over $1.2 billion this year.

That’s well below the $2 billion that the Congressional Budget Office had projected just this March — 40% below forecast, as a matter of fact.

The IRS says the revenue numbers aren’t final and could change. Even so, they’re not likely to reach the CBO’s forecast.

This shortfall, combined with the fact that other ObamaCare taxes aren’t raising nearly as much as predicted, puts ObamaCare’s finances in even deeper trouble.

Editor’s note: This post has been updated. The original version said the CBO had projected in 2010 that the individual mandate would raise $9 billion in 2015. In fact, that number was the combination of revenues from both employer and individual mandate tax.
