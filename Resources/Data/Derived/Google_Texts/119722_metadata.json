For families, the nursery has a private lounge, kitchenette, bathroom, lockers and breast-feeding support.\n\n\"We are thankful to be able to provide this kind of high-level acute care in our community, keeping so many newborns and their families together close to home,\" said Carol Veldkamp, the nurse clinical manager of the Boven Birth Center.\n\nMore than 1,800 babies are born each year at the hospital's birth center.
