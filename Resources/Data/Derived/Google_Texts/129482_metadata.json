Wade decision establishing a right to abortion.\n\nCurrent Supreme Court precedent says the right to abortion cannot be severely infringed as long as the fetus is not deemed viable.\n\nSince the Roe v. Wade decision, the states have produced a \u201clatticework\u201d of abortion law, with 42 banning abortion after a certain point in the pregnancy \u2014 a threshold that usually hinges on how lawmakers view a fetus\u2019 viability, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health and rights.\n\nThe bill the House takes up Wednesday, written by Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona Republican, also includes language designed to head off repeats of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia and is now serving a life term for killing three babies born alive at his practice, as well as an adult patient.\n\nWednesday\u2019s vote is timed to coincide with the second anniversary of Gosnell\u2019s conviction.\n\nMr. Franks\u2019 bill would insist that a second neonatal physician be present at abortions performed after 20 weeks under one of the bill\u2019s exemptions, so that a baby born alive during an abortion can be cared for.\n\nBabies born alive are recognized as persons under the law.\n\n\u201cWe know of no issues or concerns with the exception provisions, and are confident the bill will pass with strong Republican support,\u201d Franks spokeswoman Destiny Decker said.\n\nThe bill includes an exemption for women whose lives are in danger because of the pregnancy, and in cases of incest in which the victim is a minor \u2014 although that must have been reported to law enforcement or a government agency.\n\nRepublicans in January voted to ban the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize abortions under Obamacare, a measure that attracted only three Democrats, after withdrawing the first version of the 20-week ban.\n\nPresident Obama is likely to veto the new bill should it clear the Senate, and Democrats remained unimpressed by the GOP\u2019s revisions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the vote will be much different than it would have been [before the changes],\u201d said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, who decried the legislation Tuesday as \u201canother message bill.\u201d\n\nWhile conservative groups like Heritage Action cheered the GOP effort, pro-choice organizations like Planned Parenthood Action Fund and NARAL Pro-Choice America urged House members to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThey said the timing of the bill was particularly troubling, coming just days after the administration made overtures to insure contraception coverage under Obamacare and recognize women\u2019s health needs.\n\n\u201cThe anti-choice GOP clearly missed the message the first time around: Americans don\u2019t want these politicians inserting themselves into our personal health care decisions,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans are set to muscle through a revamped abortion bill Wednesday that bans the controversial procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, insisting they've finally settled an internal GOP fight that capsized a similar bill in January.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Republicans are set to muscle through a revamped abortion bill Wednesday that bans the controversial procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, insisting they\u2019ve finally settled an internal GOP fight that capsized a similar bill in January.", "title": "Republicans push bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/12/republicans-push-bill-to-ban-abortion-after-20-wee/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/12/TrentFranks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/12/TrentFranks.jpg", "description": "House Republicans are set to muscle through a revamped abortion bill Wednesday that bans the controversial procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, insisting they've finally settled an internal GOP figh", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans push bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans are set to muscle through a revamped abortion bill Wednesday that bans the controversial procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, insisting they\u2019ve finally settled an internal GOP fight that capsized a similar bill in January.\nLong sought by pro-life advocates, the bill would impose a national ban on abortions at the point where some research says fetuses can feel pain.\nThis week\u2019s vote comes just days after new research found that some babies born prematurely, as soon as 22 weeks, can survive \u2014 further complicating the already-complex issue of when a fetus is considered viable outside the womb.\nCurrent Supreme Court precedent says the right to abortion cannot be severely infringed as long as the fetus is not deemed viable.\nPresident Obama is likely to veto the new bill should it clear the Senate, and Democrats remained unimpressed by the GOP\u2019s revisions."}
