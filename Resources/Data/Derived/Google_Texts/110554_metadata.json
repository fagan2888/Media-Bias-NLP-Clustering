The premiums of all of our ACA-compliant individual plans have been reviewed and approved by HHS and ADOI.\"\n\nMackin did not provide a figure for the average BCBS rate hike, but there have been numerous anecdotal reports of premiums doubling or more.\n\nFairhope resident Linda Tom, a human resources executive for more than two decades and former vice president of human resources at Ohio State University, said the rate increases are among \"the most astronomical I have ever seen.\"\n\n\"I talked with a friend who had her insurance increased 150 percent,\" she said. \"Another couple we know had their premium increased close to 200 percent.\"\n\nAlabama Department of Insurance governmental affairs manager Mark Fowler said the department did review premiums for compliance with the health reform law -- but not for rates.\n\n\"After that we were pretty much out of it,\" Fowler said. \"The federal government totally runs the exchange in Alabama.\"\n\nAlabama received $1 million on Aug. 16, 2010, from HHS to improve its rate review process.\n\nHHS allows states that did not set up their own exchanges to use ACA grant money for other defined purposes.\n\nIn total, the Alabama Department of Insurance received more than $10 million in three different HHS grants, including the rate review grant, to implement various aspects health care reform.\n\nThe department has not responded to questions posed Friday and Monday about how the money has been spent.\n\nDespite this infusion of federal dollars, Alabama's review process has been determined to be ineffective, joining Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming in that category.\n\nAn effective rate review program must be able to consider a host of factors during a review, including changes in benefits, changes in utilization of services and the impact of geographic factors and variations. An effective program must also provide a way for receiving public comments on rate hikes and make a determination of reasonableness under a standard set by state statute, according to the CMS website.\n\nThe law also requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of their premium dollars on direct medical care or improving quality instead of such things as advertising, executive salaries and bonuses. Consumers could get a rebate if the insurer fails to meet this threshold.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation report last year said evidence showed insurers made fewer requests to raise rates by 10 percent or more after the new rate review provisions when into effect on Sept. 1, 2011.\n\nAn American Medical Association study last year found Alabama to be the least competitive commercial health insurance market in the country with Blue Cross accounting for 88 percent of that market.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Who is watching out for excessive health insurance rate hikes in Alabama under Obamacare?", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \" Who is watching out for excessive health insurance rate hikes in Alabama under Obamacare?\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/11/who_is_watching_out_for_excess.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13712147-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11575067\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-04T23:46:09Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"affordable care act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13712147-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MikeOliverAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "View full sizeMarilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2013, before the House Ways and Means Committee hearing on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act...."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, November 05, 2013,  4:48 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/spotnews/photo/cms-administratorjpg-f167d42f2ed0b504.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"toniokroger\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com\", \"author_id\": \"9375881\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from Birmingham\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/spotnews/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "View full sizeMarilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2013, before the House Ways and Means Committee hearing on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act....", "title": "Who is watching out for excessive health insurance rate hikes in Alabama under Obamacare?", "url": "http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/11/who_is_watching_out_for_excess.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13712147-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, November 04, 2013,  5:49 PM", "article_author": "Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com", "Description": "One of the checks on health insurance sticker shock under the Affordable Care Act was new requirements for premium rate review by states.
