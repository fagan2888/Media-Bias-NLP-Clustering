In a comprehensive 123 page opinion, Hanen smacks down the Obama administration repeatedly.\n\nHanen begins by examining the legacy of executive branch failures to enforce immigration law, then points out that states have borne the brunt of cost related to ineffectual immigration enforcement:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile the States are obviously concerned about national security, they are also concerned about their own resources being drained by the constant influx of illegal immigrants into their respective territories, and that this continual flow of illegal immigration has led and will lead to serious domestic security issues directly affecting their citizenry.\n\nHanen then quotes Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion in his infamous greenlighting of Obamacare to the effect that Congress has the power to determine immigration policy. Hanen writes:\n\nThe ultimate question before the Court is: Do the laws of the United States, including the Constitution, give the Secretary of Homeland Security the power to take the action at issue in this case?\n\nHanen says that he is not questioning the policy decency of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program pushed by President Obama, but of aspects of its legality. He adds that President Obama\u2019s program may or may not be an amnesty, but says that it makes no difference what you call the program; only its legality is in question. Finally, Hanen sums up the issues:\n\n(1) whether the States have standing to bring this case; (2) whether the DHS has the necessary discretion to institute the DAPA program; and (3) whether the DAPA program is constitutional, comports with existing laws, and was legally adopted.\n\nAfter summing up the legal and factual background of the case, noting the contentions of both the administration\u2019s critics and the administration\u2019s responses, Hanen comes to the actual legal arguments.\n\nStanding\n\nHe first discusses the issue of \u201cstanding,\u201d the requirement in any case that the plaintiff in a case be directly affected by the law in question. That requirement breaks down into three elements: that the plaintiff suffer a \u201cconcrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent\u201d; that there is a causal relationship between the statute and the damages; and that the injury could \u201clikely\u201d be addressed by the court striking down the regulation. Further, the judge points out, a broad harm to the general population should be addressed politically, not in the courts.\n\nThe judge points out a second level of standing as well: standing under the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows standing to a \u201cperson suffering a legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.\u201d\n\nThe ruling states that the states do have standing to contest the executive amnesty, citing the costs associated with processing of driver\u2019s license, and the fact that supposed workarounds to avoid costs will likely be contested by the federal government, as the federal government did with regard to Arizona\u2019s immigration law. \u201cThe federal government made it clear in Arizona (and would not retreat from that stance in this case),\u201d the ruling states, \u201cthat any move by a plaintiff state to limit the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses would be viewed as illegal.\u201d The court further rules that these damages are not generalized, but particular to the driver\u2019s license program. The judge slams the federal government\u2019s incoherent immigration policy:\n\nAlthough the federal government conceded that states enjoy substantial leeway in setting policies for licensing drivers within their jurisdiction, it simultaneously argued that the states could not tailor these laws to create \u2018new alien classifications not supported by federal law.\u2019 In other words, the states cannot protect themselves from the costs inflicted by the Government when 4.3 million individuals are granted legal presence wit the resulting ability to compel state action. The irony of this position cannot be fully appreciated unless it is contrasted with the DAPA Directive. The DAPA Directive unilaterally allows individuals removable by law to legally remain in the United States based upon a classification that is not established by any federal law. It is this very lack of law about which the States complain. The Government claims that it can act without a supporting law, but the States cannot.\n\nAs the judge adds, it is certainly ironic that the federal government is butting into the driver\u2019s license business, given that it is traditionally a state function. He also points out that the feds require the states to pay certain fees for processing of driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nWith regard to causation, Judge Hanen finds that there is a clear relationship between the regulation and the cost. He also finds that striking down the regulation would achieve the goal of avoiding that cost.\n\nHanen also points out several other possible grounds for standing. Hanen says parens patraie \u2013 the ability of a state to bring suit \u201cto protect the interests of its citizens\u201d \u2013 applies to state suits against the federal government. The state argued that businesses will be forced to cover health insurance for illegal immigrants under the new program. The federal government made the frightening argument that the federal government is the protector of the interests of citizens, so states could not file suit against the feds. Hanen says states could file parens patraie suit, but that this case has not yet materialized because the federal government has not made clear its intentions with regard to Obamacare.\n\nHanen then moves on to the biggest argument of all: the argument that the federal government\u2019s refusal to enforce its borders costs the states money, and that that loss makes federal policy justiciable. He says that these costs are not directly related to DAPA:\n\nThe Court finds that the Government\u2019s failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country. Further, the record supports the finding that this lack of enforcement, combined with this country\u2019s high rate of illegal immigration, significantly drains the States\u2019 resources. Regardless, the Court finds that these more indirect damages described in this section are not caused by DAPA; thus the injunctive relief requested Plaintiffs would not redress these damages.\n\nThe court also rejected the argument that allowing illegal immigrants to stay increases costs with regard to programs like education, explaining that the \u201cConstitution and federal law mandate that these individuals are entitled to state benefits merely because of their presence in the United States, whether they reside in the sunshine or the shadows.\u201d The Court adds that the specific costs associated with DAPA \u2013 the argument that \u201ccontinued presence in this county will increase state costs\u201d \u2014 is solid, but that the federal argument that the economy will pay for all of that is at least supportable. Finally, the Court states that the federal government\u2019s statements encouraging illegal immigration are not redressable.\n\nThe Court then turns to the issue of standing with regard to abdication. Judge Hanan says that \u201cThe most provocative and intellectually intriguing standing claim presented by this case is that based upon federal abdication,\u201d the theory by which the \u201cfederal government asserts sole authority over a certain area of American life and excludes any authority or regulation by a state; yet subsequently refuses to act in that area. The Court calls this argument indisputable. \u201c[T]he Government has abandoned its duty to enforce the law,\u201d the Court states. The Court drops the hammer: \u201cIf one had to formulate from scratch a fact pattern that exemplified the existence of standing due to federal abdication, one could not have crafted a better scenario.\u201d\n\nDiscretion\n\nNext, the Court turns to the question of prosecutorial discretion. The Court explains that prosecutorial discretion is the purview of the executive branch, but that the DAPA program is not discretion at all. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Court points out, there has been no rule promulgated that meets the requirements of notice and hearing. The Court states, \u201cThe responsibility of the federal government, who exercises plenary power over immigration, includes not only the passage of rational legislation, but also the enforcement of those laws. The States and their residents are entitled to nothing less.\u201d The Court also says that this is not a question of merely federal inaction, but \u201caffirmative action rather than inaction\u2026.Exercising prosecutorial discretion and/or refusing to enforce a statute does not also entail bestowing benefits.\u201d Most tellingly, the Court quotes President Obama himself stating that he instructed the Department of Homeland Security to \u201cchange the law.\u201d The Court then concludes:\n\nWhile the Government would not totally concede this point in oral argument, the logical end point of its argument is that the DHS, solely pursuant to its implied authority and general statutory enforcement authority, could have made DAPA applicable to all 11.3 million immigrants estimated to be in the country illegally. This Court finds that the discretion given to the DHS Secretary is not unlimited.\n\nIn a final slap, the Court states, \u201cIn the instant case, the DHS is tasked with the duty of removing illegal aliens. Congress has provided that it \u2018shall\u2019 do this. Nowhere has Congress given it the option to either deport these individuals or give them legal presence and work permits.\u201d\n\nThe Court also calls out President Obama directly for contending publicly that he changed the law, then sending his lawyers to claim that DAPA is supposed to be advisory in nature. The Court then states that the only \u201cdiscretion\u201d used has \u201calready [been] exercised by Secretary Johnson in enacting the DAPA program and establishing the criteria therein.\u201d The Court concludes, \u201cThe DAPA program clearly represents a substantive change in immigration policy\u2026it contradicts the INA. It is, in effect, a new law.\u201d\n\nInjunction\n\nThe Court issued an injunction in this case because, as Judge Hanan writes, \u201clegalizing the presence of millions of people is a \u2018virtually irreversible\u2019 action once taken,\u201d both in terms of cost, and in terms of the presence of the illegal aliens themselves. \u201cOnce Defendants make such determinations,\u201d the Court writes, \u201cthe States accurately allege that it will be difficult or even impossible for anyone to \u2018unscramble the egg.\u2019\u2026.This genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle.\u201d The Court points out that the status quo ante would not be changed by striking down the regulation; we would merely have the clarity of knowing whether the government has the authority for DAPA before it is implemented.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn short, the Court eviscerates the Obama administration\u2019s position. The case will be appealed to the Fifth Circuit, but Judge Hanan\u2019s heavy reliance on Fifth Circuit case law makes it unlikely to be reversed at that level. The injunction means that the case will expedite to the Supreme Court level. Now the question becomes whether the lawless Obama administration will obey the judge\u2019s ruling even though the injunction has been granted.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
