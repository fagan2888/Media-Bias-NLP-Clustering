Joyce Kaylor, a homemaker, cosmetologist, and gifted singer, piano/organ player who often played later in life for fellow residents at NHC-Columbia, was born into the Great Depression in 1930 in Nashville, TN as Joyce Taylor (Taylor was her maiden name and her rhyming name was a longstanding family joke).

Her father took his life when Joyce was only 5 years old leaving her to care for her younger sisters while her mother went to work to support the family. Joyce was later raised by her mother and step-father until marrying Bob Kaylor in 1949. After losing their first child, Bob, Jr., at 3 days old, Joyce gave birth to sons Clark in 1951 and Steve in 1953. Bob’s work took them to Memphis, TN. Joyce suffered two miscarriages before giving birth to her youngest son Mak in 1964. Bob and Joyce were married for 48 years. In her 60s, Joyce cared for both Bob, who had Alzheimer’s disease, and her very ill mother at the same time in their home until their deaths in 1997. Mak and wife LeAnn moved Joyce back to her hometown Nashville after Bob’s death. At age 75, Joyce wed Harvey Brown and remained married until her death at age 85 in Columbia, TN on November 20th, 2015. Joyce was a lifelong member of the Church of Christ and resided at NHC-Columbia at the time of her passing.

Joyce Kaylor leaves three sons (Clark Kaylor of Tucson, AZ, Steve Kaylor of Memphis, TN and Mak Kaylor of Columbia, TN), five grandchildren, and four great-granddaughters.
