In defending himself against lawsuits from women who say he sexually assaulted and then defamed them, Bill Cosby is facing mountainous legal expenses.

Luckily for him, he has homeowners’ insurance.

That is the surprising tool Mr. Cosby is using to pay his legal fees as he battles defamation claims filed by 10 women in three states.

Mr. Cosby’s insurer, American International Group, better known as AIG, has gone to court to deny him coverage, arguing, among other things, that it should not have to cover claims that arose from alleged acts of sexual misconduct.

But so far, Mr. Cosby is winning.

“The court finds that plaintiff has a duty to defend,” Judge Beverly Reid O’Connell, of Federal District Court in Los Angeles, said in a ruling last November that favored Mr. Cosby.

Though it may seem novel, Mr. Cosby’s policy is a lot like those held by millions of affluent homeowners and other wealthy people who bolster their insurance coverage so that they are protected if they are ever sued.

The pitcher Roger Clemens, O. J. Simpson and Bill Clinton have all used so-called personal injury coverage, typically tied into their homeowner’s policy, to battle lawsuits.
