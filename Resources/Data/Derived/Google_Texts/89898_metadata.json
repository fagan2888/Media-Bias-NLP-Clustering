Traffic is backed up for miles in both directions, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.\n\nADOT suggests eastbound I-10 travelers take State Route 287 east to State Route 87, then south to I-10 to get around the snafu. They say doing the reverse will work for westbound traffic.\n\nThe multi-vehicle collision happened a little after 10 a.m. on eastbound I-10, according to the Department of Public Safety's public information office. There are multiple serious injuries, and the eastbound lanes of I-10 were closed for nearly two hours. State troopers and fire department responded to the scene.\n\nThe following tweets are in chronological order:\n\nRollover crash on I-10 East near I-8. Expect delays on both freeways. \u2014 Arizona DOT (@ArizonaDOT) March 13, 2016\n\nCrash on I-10 East appears to be just before the I-8 interchange. I-8 traffic: No delays.
