U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler agreed, ruling the Federal Reserve set illegal conditions for an $85 billion rescue loan to AIG in September 2008, though he didn\u2019t award damages.\n\nUpdate: Greenberg Will Appeal AIG Bailout Case Win Over Lack of Damages\n\nThe loan saved the insurer from bankruptcy, but it came with a 12 percent interest rate and gave the U.S. an 80 percent stake until AIG could pay it off. Boies said that amounted to \u201cextortion\u201d and took every opportunity to compare it to the generous terms enjoyed by the Wall Street banks that were famously bailed out.\n\n\u201cFrom a matter of pure professional satisfaction, it\u2019s a victory, a considerable intellectual achievement,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Donnell, a Washington-based attorney not involved in the case. It\u2019s \u201ca remarkable result in having the court declare the government\u2019s action illegal.\u201d\n\nOver eight weeks, Boies questioned most of the 36 witnesses himself, a task shared on the government side by at least seven lawyers. They repeatedly earned rebukes from the judge for missteps, such as reading lengthy records already in evidence and using redacted documents in violation of the rules, while Boies suffered relatively few reprimands.\n\nComplex Proceedings\n\nThe 74-year-old lawyer\u2019s career history of 85 trials includes 10 with more than $1 billion at stake \u2014 and in this one the sum requested by plaintiffs was $25 billion, which the judge determined wasn\u2019t warranted however badly the Fed acted.\n\nEven so, the ruling solidifies Boies\u2019s reputation for winning long-shot cases, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. It\u2019s \u201canother notch, one of those signature victories.\u201d\n\nBoies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome of his best-known cases haven\u2019t involved money. In December 2000, he represented Vice President Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court case that handed the presidency to George W. Bush, and 13 years later teamed up with his adversary in that proceeding to win the high-court appeal that overturned California\u2019s ban on gay marriage.\n\n\u2018Demonizing\u2019 AIG\n\nIn Wheeler\u2019s courtroom in Washington, Boies represented Starr International, Greenberg\u2019s private investment holding company and AIG\u2019s largest shareholder before the bailout. Boies was backed by a team from his own firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, and from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.\n\nHis mastery of the complex proceedings appeared to win over Wheeler, who at times seemed to defer to the lawyer, asking him in one instance what he thought about a government objection to his questioning of New York Fed official Sarah Dahlgren. Boies was self-deprecatingly magnanimous.\n\n\u201cI think the objection is well-taken, your honor,\u201d he told Wheeler, adding that he \u201cwas asleep at the switch\u201d when he had failed to object to similar behavior by Justice Department lawyers.\n\nAgain and again, Boies zeroed in on what he portrayed as the government\u2019s biased treatment and harsh depiction of AIG. \u201cThey tried to demonize AIG and suggest somehow that AIG was a poster child for problems during the financial crisis,\u201d he said in his opening statement Sept. 29.\n\nBias Claims\n\nHe made the case throughout the eight-week trial that AIG wasn\u2019t a villainous behemoth threatening the global economy with its underwriting of toxic securities but a victim of regulators intent on protecting Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and other big Wall Street banks at the insurer\u2019s expense, and making a few bucks in bargain.\n\nHis fairness argument gave the judge a way to think about the case beyond the legal fine points, said Kenneth Feinberg, who was a federally appointed special master for 9/11 victims and other funds and who oversaw compensation for AIG executives as part of the bailout.\n\n\u201cHe focused on the disparity and how AIG became a kind of punching bag for public unhappiness for the crisis itself,\u201d said Feinberg, who\u2019s known Boies since they worked together on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee 40 years ago. \u201cIt provides the judge an additional argument, quite apart from the technicalities, on what is fairness, what is equitable?\u201d\n\nThe claims of bias resonated enough that Wheeler brought them up during the government\u2019s closing argument April 22.\n\n\u201cThe thing that still perplexes me is, I don\u2019t understand why the moral hazard and the risk with regard to AIG is any different than it was with Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citibank, any of those, Goldman Sachs,\u201d Wheeler told government lawyer Kenneth Dintzer. \u201cDoes it really justify an interest rate that\u2019s four times higher and the taking of an 80 percent equity interest? I mean, nobody else had that kind of arrangement.\u201d\n\n\u2013With assistance from Andrew Zajac in Washington\n\nCopyright 2016 Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "During the trial, David Boies was his usual mildly rumpled and mostly unpretentious self, peering over his reading glasses, padding around in his hallmark", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "During the trial, David Boies was his usual mildly rumpled and mostly unpretentious self, peering over his reading glasses, padding around in his hallmark", "title": "How Greenberg's Lawyer, Boies, Won AIG Bailout Battle", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1725, "identifier": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2013/12/Court.jpg", "height": 2432}, "updated_time": "2015-06-16T19:29:18-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/06/16/371931.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During the trial, David Boies was his usual mildly rumpled and mostly unpretentious self, peering over his reading glasses, padding around in his hallmark", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2013/12/Court.jpg", "title": "How Greenberg's Lawyer, Boies, Won AIG Bailout Battle", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2015-06-16", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "government bias against AIG", "published_time": "2015-06-16T06:35:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T19:29:18-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "\u2018Demonizing\u2019 AIGIn Wheeler\u2019s courtroom in Washington, Boies represented Starr International, Greenberg\u2019s private investment holding company and AIG\u2019s largest shareholder before the bailout.\nAgain and again, Boies zeroed in on what he portrayed as the government\u2019s biased treatment and harsh depiction of AIG.\nUpdate: Greenberg Will Appeal AIG Bailout Case Win Over Lack of DamagesThe loan saved the insurer from bankruptcy, but it came with a 12 percent interest rate and gave the U.S. an 80 percent stake until AIG could pay it off.\nBoies was backed by a team from his own firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, and from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.\n\u201cThey tried to demonize AIG and suggest somehow that AIG was a poster child for problems during the financial crisis,\u201d he said in his opening statement Sept. 29."}
