The festivities also attract visitors from hours and hours away.\n\nAmerica's Dairyland lost a few of its own this Fourth of July. Samantha Juve arrived in Sioux Falls at 1:30 am, after she drove seven hours from Wisconsin.\n\n\"We did do coffee twice this morning already,\" Juve said.\n\nThis year, the city's big July 4th celebration doubled as a small family reunion for Juve and her loved ones.\n\n\"My brother and his girlfriend live in Casper, Wyoming, so it's a good halfway meeting spot for us to meet. We don't get to see them very often. Couple times a year,\" Juve said.\n\n\"Sioux Falls has kind of become a family center for us. We like to come frequently,\" Rennae Petersen said.\n\nPetersen did not have quite as long of a trip, but she did drive from Marshall, Minnesota. Beyond meeting her family, Petersen said she was impressed with Sioux Falls' Independence Day lineup.\n\n\"This parade has really developed. At first it was just very, very short. Not many in it and it's getting longer every year,\" Petersen said.\n\nOf course, there are always a few other reasons why South Dakota is the perfect place to celebrate America's birthday.\n\n\"We do have a few fire crackers, or something, tonight. Since, you know, in Minnesota that's not legal. You have to come here and do that,\" Petersen said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "From the parade to the picnic, people in Sioux Falls flock to downtown to honor the red, white, and blue.
