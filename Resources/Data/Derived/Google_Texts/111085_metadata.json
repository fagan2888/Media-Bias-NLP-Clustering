Alas, it\u2019s not time to relax just yet.\n\nEach day more than 10,000 baby boomers enter retirement. Yet only around one-quarter of workers 55 and older say they\u2019re doing a good job preparing for the next phase, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The last 12 months before you call it a career is especially critical to putting your retirement on a prosperous path. It\u2019s time to get your portfolio, health care, and other finances in order so you can enjoy your new life.\n\n\n\nTHE TURNING-POINT CHECKLIST\n\n12 Months Out:\n\nDial back on stocks now. You still need the growth that equities provide, but even a 15% market slide in the year before you retire can erase four years\u2019 worth of income. Cap stock exposure to around 50% in your sixties, advises Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning at Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nRaise cash. Your paychecks are about to stop. So as you downshift from stocks, move that money into a savings or money market account to fund at least one year of expenses, says Judith Ward, T. Rowe Price senior financial planner.\n\nSet a realistic retirement budget. Use the worksheet on Fidelity\u2019s free retirement-income planner to list all of your fixed and discretionary expenses. Then use T. Rowe Price\u2019s free retirement-income calculator to see how safe that level of spending is likely to be, based on the size of your nest egg and age.\n\n6 Months Out:\n\nPlay out Social Security scenarios. You can claim Social Security at 62, but if you can hold off until 70 your checks will be 76% bigger. Tool around FinancialEngines.com\u2019s free Social Security Income Planner to find the best strategy for you.\n\nFigure out how you\u2019ll pay for health care. Check if your company offers retirees medical, long-term care, and other insurance coverage. If you won\u2019t get health insurance and aren\u2019t yet 65 (when you qualify for Medicare), then compare plans offered via the Affordable Care Act at eHealthInsurance.com. Or use COBRA, where you can stay on your employer plan up to 18 months after leaving.\n\n3 MONTHS OUT:\n\nBegin the rollover process. In a small 401(k) plan, average fund expenses can run north of 0.6% of assets. You can cut those fees at least in half by shifting into index funds at a low-cost IRA provider. See if your plan provides free access to investment advisers to help you decide.\n\nSign up for Medicare. Nearing 65? You can enroll for Medicare up to three months before turning that age. Also, figure in supplemental plans to cover expenses that Medicare does not, such as dental care and prescription drugs.\n\nGet a running start. Put your post-career itinerary into action. Research volunteer groups that you want to join, reach out to contacts if you plan to keep a hand in work, start a new exercise routine, or begin planning that big trip.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Getting ready to retire?
