But he does have a new insurance plan picked out.\n\nBlome was one of 46,000 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska policyholders who were notified by letter of their plan terminations and options. Blome was told he could buy a similar Blue Cross plan \u2014 with the 10 essential benefits mandated by Obamacare \u2014 but his premium would go up 65 percent, or nearly $4,000 per year.\n\nBlome didn\u2019t like having to submit what he considered an \u201coverwhelming amount of personal information\u201d to shop around for a policy on the federally run Healthcare.gov website. Instead, he contacted three of the four insurance companies offering insurance on the federal exchange, as well as two private insurance brokers.\n\nIn the end, Blue Cross\u2019s offer was the best deal for his family. His premium will increase from $502 to $780 per month, a 55 percent jump over what he pays now. His family\u2019s deductible went from $10,000 to $12,700, and he expects to meet it.\n\nAll in all, his new policy will cost him an additional $6,000 between increased premiums and deductibles. While Blue Cross has estimated about half its customers who buy their own insurance will be eligible for federal subsidies to help pay their premiums \u2014 available to a family of four earning between $23,550 and $94,000, for example \u2014 the Blomes don\u2019t qualify for the tax credits.\n\nWhile President Obama has said many Americans getting cancellation letters had \u201ccut-rate plans\u201d without real protection, the Blomes\u2019 insurance policy was not junk, and they liked it.\n\nUnder Blome\u2019s new plan, if his family ends up getting care out of its network, the deductible is $25,300 \u2014 the lowest he could find. CoOportunity Health, a federally funded cooperative selling plans in Nebraska, would have had an out-of-network deductible of $40,000, and Blome said the group has a small network. Coventry\u2019s was $12,500 with a 50 percent copay after the deductible was met and there was no limit on the out-of-pocket copay.\n\nTough choices, and he\u2019s not the only person making them. As an accountant, he fields lots of questions from customers about Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance has continued to be the number one topic of conversation with clients when I speak with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting a lot of people.\u201d\n\nOne of his clients is giving up health insurance and paying the federal fine rather than pay a much higher premium. Another business client has about 45 employees and desperately wants to open a new business, but that would put him over the 50-employee threshold and trigger the Obamacare requirement that he offer health insurance to all of the employees. He has decided not to open the new business.\n\n\u201cCrazy times,\u201d Blome said.\n\nThe president apologized Thursday to Americans losing their health insurance plans, despite his repeated assurances to the contrary, but that was little comfort to Blome.\n\n\u201cHis apology doesn\u2019t change the fact that millions of perfectly fine health insurance policies were cancelled and replaced with much more expensive and less generous policies,\u201d Blome said.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
