Diane Black, R-Tenn., and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. It is designed to empower states to regain control of their lands from the federal government in order to pursue their own energy goals. That is a challenge in an oil-rich state like Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe need to streamline the process as there are very real consequences to poor [or nonexistent] management,\u201d Tubb, a Heritage research associate, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cEmpowering the states is the best solution. The people who benefit have a say and can share in the benefits. If there are consequences, they can address them locally with state and local governments that are much more responsive to elections and budgets than the federal government.\u201d\n\nEmphasizing the need to streamline the process, Tubb pointed to the findings in the new report.\n\n\u201cThe Bureau of Land Management estimates that it took an average of 227 days simply to complete a drill application,\u201d Tubb said.\n\nThat\u2019s more than the average of 154 days in 2005 and more than seven times the state average of 30 days, according to the report.\n\nThe report blames this increase in the application process on the drop in drilling on federal lands.\n\n\u201cSince 2009,\u201d Tubb and Loris write, \u201coil production on federal lands has fallen by nine percent, even as production on state and private lands has increased by 61 percent over the same period.\u201d\n\nDespite almost \u201c43 percent of crude oil coming from federal lands,\u201d government-owned lands have seen a 13-point drop in oil production, from 36 percent to 23 percent.\n\nThe report also examines the recent oil-related job boom.\n\n\u201cJob creation in the oil and gas industry bucked the slow economic recovery and grew by 40 percent from 2007 to 2012, in comparison to one percent in the private sector over the same period,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThat boom has had a big impact on jobs.\n\n\u201cEnergy-abundant states like Colorado and Alaska would stand to benefit tremendously. We\u2019ve seen oil and natural gas production increase substantially in Colorado over the past eight years, bringing jobs and economic activity to the state,\u201d said Loris, an economist who is Heritage\u2019s Herbert and Joyce Morgan fellow.\n\nTubb cautioned that any change will happen slowly. \u201cThe federal government likely will not release the land that easily.\u201d\n\nLoris agreed, noting the long-running debate about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n\u201cIt was no surprise that the Alaskan delegation was up in arms when the administration proposed to permanently put ANWR off limits to energy exploration,\u201d Loris told The Daily Signal. \u201cMany in the Alaskan delegation and Alaskan natives, including village of Kaktovik\u2014the only town in the coastal plain of ANWR, support energy development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are putting power to the people,\u201d Tubb concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study shows that current government regulations imposed by the Bureau of Land Management are harming energy production and holding back the U.S. economy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Study shows that current government regulations imposed by the Bureau of Land Management are harming energy production and holding back the U.S. economy.", "title": "Study: Government's Control of Land Is Hurting Oil Production, Job Growth", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150220_BLM.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-22T08:41:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1EzmI4K"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Study shows that current government regulations imposed by the Bureau of Land Management are harming energy production and holding back the U.S. economy.", "title": "Study: Government's Control of Land Is Hurting Oil Production, Job Growth", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150220_BLM.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "property rights", "published_time": "2015-02-22T03:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T08:41:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bureau of Land Management, Drilling, Gas, Oil, Jobs, Economy, Energy Independence"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc25c\"", "article_summary": "Current government regulations imposed by the Bureau of Land Management are harming energy production and holding back the U.S. economy, a new study reveals.\nThe report focuses on the Federal Lands Freedom Act, introduced by Rep.
