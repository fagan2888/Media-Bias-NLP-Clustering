(AP) - The head of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association will be retiring later this year and the industry group has launched a national search for his replacement.\n\nSteve Henke's last day will be Sept. 1. He has served as president of the group for the past six years. He previously was in charge of the Bureau of Land Management's Farmington office.\n\nHenke will be stepping down amid depressed energy prices that have curbed exploration and drilling nationwide. In New Mexico, the decline has left the state scrambling for revenues and oilfield and service businesses have been forced to lay off workers.\n\nHenke said in a statement Friday that the association has a great staff that will be able to serve the industry in what he described as demanding times.\n\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
