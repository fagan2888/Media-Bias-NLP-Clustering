Families could be in for an early Christmas present, with some up to $4000 a year better off under planned changes to the Federal Government's childcare policy.

On the eve of the final sitting week of 2015, Education Minister Simon Birmingham is laying the groundwork for his child care reforms.

"It will be simpler, fairer and more affordable for most Australian families," he said.

"We want all families to be encouraged to participate in the workforce."

After six months of tweaking, and a change in Ministers, the $3 billion Jobs For Families package will be introduced into Parliament this week.

From July 2017, families with a combined income of under $170,000 a year will be around $30 a week better off.

"This is an incredibly fair measure ensuring that those on the lowest incomes, get the most subsidy, those working the most hours get greatest number of hours," Mr Birmingham said.

Couples earning a combined $250,000 a year and above, will no longer get the 50 percent rebate.

That will pay for a $20 million safety net for grandparents who have custody of their grandchildren, meaning they won't have to meet a new work-activity test to qualify for childcare.

Independent Senator Nick Xenophon wants the rebate threshold lowered to $180,000.

"That part of it needs to be scaled back otherwise it won't be equitable," he said.

Childcare groups are waiting to see the detail of the legislation, but they are worried the testing of work hours could see children of single parents fall through the cracks.
