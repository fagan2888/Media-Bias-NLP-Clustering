Rep. Michael Burgess, Rep. John Culberson, Rep. Louie Gohmert, and Rep. John Ratcliffe have all said they plan to back Cruz’s White House bid, according to a press release obtained by The Texas Tribune.

“With a Ted Cruz Presidency, America will finally be respected around the world again as other nations will see a courageous and intellectual leader, NEVER wavering on principle, who stands by our allies leaving other countries afraid to be our enemy,” Gohmert previously wrote.

Gov. Rick Perry, Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), are three other GOP contenders with ties to the lone star state. Perry was Texas’ longest serving executive and both Bush and Paul grew up in Texas.

But one Texas delegation member said earlier this year he will not be endorsing Cruz, or anyone else. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn isn’t planning to endorse a candidate, not even Cruz, he told the Tribune earlier this year.
