ALBANY - Victims of domestic violence and spousal abandonment will soon have year-round access to New Yorkâ€™s Obamacare health insurance exchange, the Daily News has learned.

Gov. Cuomo is expected to announce a new policy Monday that gives victims of domestic violence and spousal abandonment the ability to obtain insurance coverage beyond the normal enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31.

"Victims of domestic violence should not be forced to ensure additional hardships because they lack access to quality health coverage for themselves or their children," Cuomo said.

Under the state's new policy, all insurers operating on the exchange will be required to offer enrollment to victims of domestic violence and spousal abandonment as of April 15.

Insurers will not be allowed to set any time limitations on when the incidents of domestic violence or abandonment occurred.

"Violence often has economic and health consequences for survivors," said Legal Momentum President Carol Robles Roman. "Maintaining health coverage is an important way to help them."
