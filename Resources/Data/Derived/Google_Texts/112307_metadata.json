(David McNew/Getty Images)\n\n4557572\n\nCalifornia is considering dropping nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars every year to provide health insurance for illegal immigrants in the state.\n\nA new Senate fiscal analysis found the proposal to extend subsidized health insurance to illegal immigrants in the state and to allow others to purchase coverage, could cost as much as $740 million annually, reported the Los Angeles Times.\n\nFederal law already requires California to provide emergency and pregnancy services to its estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants through California\u2019s Medicaid program Medi-Cal. Those services cost the state and federal government a combined $1.1 billion last year. (RELATED: Report: 2 Billion Spent Annually For Medicaid Emergencies, Largely For Illegal Immigrant Baby Delivery)\n\nThe new proposal would extend Medi-Cal eligibility or the opportunity to purchase a private insurance plan to all illegal immigrants. Those with lower incomes could sign up for free Medi-Cal coverage, and those with higher incomes could purchase a plan through a special marketplace administered by California\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\nIllegal immigrants are barred from Obamacare coverage, and California would have to apply for a federal waiver to set up the separate exchange, which California would pay for, reported the Contra Costa Times.\n\nThe bill is Sen. Ricardo Lara\u2019s second attempt to extend health insurance coverage to illegals. His first would have extended Medi-Cal coverage eligibility to all illegal immigrants, regardless of income, and had a $1.3 billion price tag. That bill failed last year.\n\nThe new version is stuck in the Senate until the end of May, when it can be reviewed against the state budget, and then either brought to the floor for a vote or rejected.\n\n\u201cAccess to health care is a human rights issue and until everyone is included, our work is unfinished,\u201d Lara said in a December statement introducing the second bill. \u201cI look forward to working with a broad coalition of immigrant, health care and legislative advocates to achieve the goal of health for all in the coming year.\u201d\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
