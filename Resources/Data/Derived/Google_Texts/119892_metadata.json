African currencies are caught in the riptide, hurting companies that rely on dollars to buy foreign goods.\n\nThat is threatening to exacerbate trade deficits that were already climbing, as consumer demand outpaces manufacturing. Hundreds of millions of people in what the African Development Bank describes as a nascent consumer class have helped diversify Africa\u2019s economy away from mining and oil drilling.
