This new minimum wage is higher than the current California minimum wage, which is $9 per hour. In 2012, San Jose took the lead and increased its minimum wage to $10.Mayor Chris Clark said he was willing to go above the San Jose minimum wage, but he said the city should do this in a \u201cfair and prudent manner.\u201d Clark said the right way to do this \u201cis to build a coalition like Mayor (Ed) Murray did\u201d in Seattle, which has adopted a $15 minimum wage.Councilmember Margaret Abe-Koga directed city staff to come up with a work plan of achieving $15 by 2018.Before the special session, more than 50 people rallied outside the city hall asking for a $15 minimum wage. Rally organizer Meghan Fraley said $15 has become the \u201cnew norm in the Bay Area.\u201d\u201cSilicon Valley is the heart of technological innovation, but also the heart of economic disparity. People who work hard can\u2019t make a living,\u201d Fraley said.\n\nPam Marley said she got $10.40 as a cashier at Walmart in Mountain View. She said her salary was not enough to pay for rent.\n\n\u201cI am now homeless. I sleep in my car. I can\u2019t afford a room. I can\u2019t afford anything right now,\u201d Marley said.Marley said she loved her job and her customers, but she might need to find another job or a second job to make ends meet.\u201cThe raise of minimum wage to at least $15 will put the American spirit back in people, will have people believe more in the country, have people believe that the government does care about them,\u201d said Dominic Ware, a former Walmart associate who showed up to support Marley.For another Mountain View resident Guadalupe Garcia, $15 means her education dream could come true.\u201cI have put my education on \u2018taking time off,\u2019 what people would say, not because I wanted to. The reality is I cannot afford tuition,\u201d Garcia said.Garcia said she has been working on three jobs for more than 60 hours per week to save money for graduate school, since she graduated college in 2010. She said she worked as an assistant attorney for a nonprofit organization, while working at a cafeteria and as a nanny at the same time. She said all three jobs paid $12.\u201cI have a bachelor\u2019s degree, but I don\u2019t see any higher-paying jobs,\u201d Garcia said.Since the new city minimum wage will be $10.30, Garcia\u2019s hourly wage will stay the same. She said she understood that this was how politics works.\u201cHopefully, someday we will get to $15 an hour. Someday, I just keep hoping someday,\u201d Garcia said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "The Mountain View City Council has approved an ordinance to increase the city minimum wage to $10.30 with annual adjustment to inflation, starting July 1, 2015.", "title": "Mountain View boosts its minimum wage to $10.30, with $15 goal by 2018 - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-02T23:27:30+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/21/mountain-view-minimum-wage-increase/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "Yuqing Pan", "published_time": "2014-10-21T07:22:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-02T23:27:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mountain View City Council has approved an ordinance to increase the city minimum wage to $10.30 with annual adjustment to inflation, starting July 1, 2015.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.jpg", "title": "Mountain View boosts its minimum wage to $10.30, with $15 goal by 2018 - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2263\"", "article_summary": "This new minimum wage is higher than the current California minimum wage, which is $9 per hour.\nMountain View adopted a minimum wage of $10.30 per hour on Oct. 9, with a goal to reach $15 by 2018.\nWith a 6-1 vote in a special session, the Mountain View City Council approved an ordinance to increase the city minimum wage to $10.30 with annual adjustment to inflation, starting July 1, 2015.\nPam Marley said she got $10.40 as a cashier at Walmart in Mountain View.\nShe said all three jobs paid $12.\u201cI have a bachelor\u2019s degree, but I don\u2019t see any higher-paying jobs,\u201d Garcia said.Since the new city minimum wage will be $10.30, Garcia\u2019s hourly wage will stay the same."}
