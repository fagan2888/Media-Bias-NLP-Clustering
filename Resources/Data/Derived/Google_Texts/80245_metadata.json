One way to achieve those ends is through an informed electorate \u2014 one which, as with a corporate board of directors, makes decisions based on what is best for the institution.\n\nThat can\u2019t happen unless voting is limited to at least those with skin in the game \u2014 taxpayers (those who actually pay taxes; not Americans who get refunds on taxes never paid). When you pay the bill, you have greater incentive to demand efficiency to keep your costs down.\n\nTo that end, in the early history of the country, most states allowed only property owners and taxpayers to vote. (The U.S. Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote.)\n\nBut there are those who don\u2019t like the American system of government as envisioned by the founders, those who would prefer a socialist state where government is not limited, but rather controls everything from requiring you to buy a product (Obamacare) to even requiring you to vote, as President Obama proposed last week.\n\n\u201cIf everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country,\u201d Obama said. It would \u201ccounteract money more than anything\u201d \u2014 this from the champion of political fundraising.\n\nEighty-five percent of nations in the world lack compulsory voting. Those that do require it mostly include Third World or corrupt countries found mostly in South America and Africa.\n\nOf course, hell will freeze over before the U.S. Constitution is rewritten to require citizens to vote or suffer some consequence. And even the thought of an American president suggesting such a departure from our basic freedoms would boggle the mind if it were not Obama.\n\nThe problem is not that Americans don\u2019t vote. The problem is that too many cast an uninformed vote, including teens who lack the maturity to understand the American system of government and adults who have not a clue or who seek only to perpetuate or expand government free stuff.\n\nThat\u2019s what needs fixing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The free enterprise system lowers cost and improves quality through competition.
