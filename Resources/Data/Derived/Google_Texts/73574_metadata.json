I\u2019ve never been in foreclosure, never applied for food stamps, never had to choose between feeding my children or paying the rent, and never feared I\u2019d lose my paycheck when I had to take time off to care for a sick child or parent. I'm not thrown into crisis mode if I have to pay a parking ticket, or if the rent goes up. If my car breaks down, my life doesn\u2019t descend into chaos.\n\nBut the fact is, one in three people in the United States do live with this kind of stress, struggle, and anxiety every day. More than 100 million Americans either live near the brink of poverty or churn in and out of it, and nearly 70 percent of these Americans are women and children.\n\nThe lines separating the middle class from the working poor and the working poor from those in absolute poverty have blurred.\n\nFifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson envisioned the Great Society and called for a War on Poverty, naming my father, Sargent Shriver, the architect of that endeavor. The program worked: Over the next decade, the poverty rate fell by 43 percent.\n\nIn those days, the phrase \u201cpoverty in America\u201d came with images of poor children in Appalachian shacks and inner-city alleys. Fifty years later, the lines separating the middle class from the working poor and the working poor from those in absolute poverty have blurred. The new iconic image of the economically insecure American is a working mother dashing around getting ready in the morning, brushing her kid\u2019s hair with one hand and doling out medication to her own aging mother with the other.\n\nA series from The Atlantic and The Shriver Report Read More\n\nFor the millions of American women who live this way, the dream of \u201chaving it all\u201d has morphed into \u201cjust hanging on.\u201d Everywhere they look, every magazine cover and talk show and website tells them women are supposed to be feeling more \u201cempowered\u201d than ever, but they don\u2019t feel empowered. They feel exhausted.\n\nMany of these women feel they are just a single incident\u2014one broken bone, one broken-down car, one missed paycheck\u2014away from the brink. And they\u2019re not crazy to feel that way:\n\nWomen are nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers in the country.\n\nMore than 70 percent of low-wage workers get no paid sick days at all.\n\nForty percent of all households with children under the age of 18 include mothers who are either the sole or primary source of income.\n\nThe median earnings of full-time female workers are still just 77 percent of the median earnings of their male counterparts.\n\nFor this year\u2019s Shriver Report, A Woman\u2019s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink, we polled more than 3,000 adults to determine how Americans feel about the economy, gender, marriage, education, and the future. Here are some highlights from the poll respondents who are low-income women:\n\nSeventy-five percent of them wish they had put a higher priority on their education and career, compared to 58 percent of the general population\n\nSeventy-three percent wish they had made better financial choices (as did 65 percent of all those we polled)\n\nThey were less likely to be married (37 percent, compared to 49 percent of all the men and women we polled) \u2026\n\nAnd more likely than men to regret marrying when they did (52 percent, compared to 33 percent of low-income men)\n\nNearly a third of those with children wished they had delayed having kids or had fewer of them\n\nFifty-two percent of low-income women regret marrying when they did, compared to 33 percent of low-income men.\n\nOverwhelmingly they favor changes that will help balance work and family responsibilities. Eighty-seven percent of low-income women\u2014and 96 percent of single moms\u2014identify paid sick leave as something that would be very useful to their lives.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the opinion of the general public is on their side: 73 percent of Americans said that in order to raise the incomes of working women and families, the government should ensure that women get equal pay for equal work. And 78 percent said the government should expand access to high-quality, affordable childcare for working families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fifty years after the War on Poverty began, millions of women are still struggling to get by.", "author": "Maria Shriver", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Fifty years after the War on Poverty began, millions of women are still struggling to get by.", "title": "The Female Face of Poverty", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/20130821_tsr_0006/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-female-face-of-poverty/282892/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd9a\"", "article_summary": "The lines separating the middle class from the working poor and the working poor from those in absolute poverty have blurred.\nFifty years later, the lines separating the middle class from the working poor and the working poor from those in absolute poverty have blurred.\nIn those days, the phrase \u201cpoverty in America\u201d came with images of poor children in Appalachian shacks and inner-city alleys.\nMany of these women feel they are just a single incident\u2014one broken bone, one broken-down car, one missed paycheck\u2014away from the brink.\nThe median earnings of full-time female workers are still just 77 percent of the median earnings of their male counterparts."}
