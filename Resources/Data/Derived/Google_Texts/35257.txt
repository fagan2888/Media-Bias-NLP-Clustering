Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his allied super-PAC plan to flood the New Hampshire TV airwaves ahead of the state's Republican presidential primary, the Boston Herald reported Saturday.

The ad blitz includes $14 million in commercials in the New Hampshire and Boston markets, including two Super Bowl ads.

ADVERTISEMENT The move is designed to boost Bush’s struggling presidential campaign in a state where it's critical for him to perform well. Bush and his team have come under scrutiny for spending $35 million on TV ads nationally with little to show.

A mid-December CBS News/You Gov poll showed the candidate in sixth place in the Granite State at 6 percent. Bush is polling around 4 percent nationally, far behind top-tier candidates such as Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), his former protégé in the Sunshine State.

The $14 million Team Bush plans to spend on New Hampshire ads far outpaces his next closest competitor, Rubio, whose campaign and super-PAC plan to pour $6 million into TV ad time, according to the Herald.

Voters will go the polls in New Hampshire on Feb. 9.
