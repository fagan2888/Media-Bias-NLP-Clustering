About 30 percent of the county\u2019s 1,500 miles of paved road are in \u201cvery poor to poor condition,\u201d according to county leaders.\n\n\u201cThere are 26 bridges that were built in 1938 \u2026 They need to be fixed,\u201d Commissioner Keith Nelson said after the meeting. \u201cLargely we\u2019re looking at a lot of safety concerns.\u201d\n\nNess had argued \u2014 both on Facebook and at a news conference \u2014 that the tax was getting pushed to a board vote too quickly and will disproportionately draw from Duluth and Hermantown, which have most of the county\u2019s retailers but only a small portion of county roads. An estimated $6 million of the annual tax would be generated from businesses in Duluth; another $1 million from businesses in Hermantown, Ness pointed out, while Duluth has less than 1.5 percent of the county\u2019s roads and Hermantown has about 2 percent. In Duluth, the county maintains only about 10 percent of the roads, Ness said.\n\nNess said that the process could have benefited from more thoughtful discussion with stakeholders throughout the county.\n\nextra sales tax passed Last year the Minnesota Legislature gave counties the ability to implement a local option sales tax for transportation funding. St. Louis County joins eight other counties that have passed such a tax: Becker, Beltrami, Douglas, Fillmore, Olmsted, Rice, Todd, Wadena\n\n\u201cOur city engineers have been kind of scrambling and looking for solutions with county engineers,\u201d Ness said. \u201cIt felt like we just ran out of time.\u201d\n\nCommissioners declined to pass an amendment that would have dedicated part of the money to infrastructure projects in Duluth.\n\nAbout a third of the tax money raised will come from non-county residents who shop in St. Louis County and use the roads, according to the county.\n\nBusinesses districts in Duluth and Hermantown also benefit from county residents shopping there, Nelson had pointed out.\n\nThe Legislature gave counties the ability to implement a local option sales tax for transportation funding in 2013. Six counties had passed the tax, according to the Association of Minnesota Counties: Wadena, Olmsted, Rice, Douglas, Becker and Beltrami. Fillmore and Todd counties also passed it, effective Jan. 1.\n\nThe new St. Louis County tax passed on a 5-1 vote and is scheduled to go into effect April 1. It will be applied to most everything except food, clothing and vehicles. Vehicles bought from a dealer will instead incur a one-time tax of $20.\n\nRight after the vote on the tax, commissioners unanimously approved a motion to \u201cengage with all municipalities and townships for discussion on mutually beneficial projects\u201d that the tax could fund.\n\nThe tax has no end date and could be imposed indefinitely, or it could be repealed if new funding sources come through, according to a county spokeswoman. In addition to road repair, money could be used on county highway safety projects, off-road trails for bikes, pedestrians and vehicles, and gravel road stabilization, according to the county.\n\nLater last week, the Duluth City Council reconsidered a $5-per-month street maintenance fee imposed on property owners over the summer. Some council members talked about raising the fee, which now generates nearly $3 million per year. Others talked about lowering it. They will likely decide by year\u2019s end.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite opposition from Duluth mayor and others, commissioners approved half-percent sales tax Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Despite opposition from Duluth mayor and others, commissioners approved half-percent sales tax Tuesday.", "title": "St. Louis County adds sales tax for roads", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/st-louis-county-adds-sales-tax-for-roads/284984531/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141790843027406.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141790843027406.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite opposition from Duluth mayor and others, commissioners approved half-percent sales tax Tuesday.", "title": "St. Louis County adds sales tax for roads", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/st-louis-county-adds-sales-tax-for-roads/284984531/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141790843027406.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141790843027406.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "roads"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Duluth,St. Louis County,sales tax,roads"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdb0\"", "article_summary": "extra sales tax passed Last year the Minnesota Legislature gave counties the ability to implement a local option sales tax for transportation funding.\nThe new St. Louis County tax passed on a 5-1 vote and is scheduled to go into effect April 1.\nA sales tax for road repair will roll forward in northern Minnesota\u2019s St. Louis County despite opposition from some leaders in its cities.\nAbout a third of the tax money raised will come from non-county residents who shop in St. Louis County and use the roads, according to the county.\nThe Legislature gave counties the ability to implement a local option sales tax for transportation funding in 2013."}
