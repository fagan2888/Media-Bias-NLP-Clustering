But \u201cwe see credit beginning to expand again in the mortgage market and the credit card market.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have been critical of the CFPB\u2019s action on indirect auto lenders, which the agency claimed discriminated against minority customers with unfair borrowing prices. The agency settled for more than $300 million in restitution funds for borrowers identified through zip codes and last names to see if they were among the customers \u201cdisparately impacted\u201d by the practice.\n\nRepublicans hammered Cordray and the CFPB for what they claimed was a faulty and fraud-susceptible crackdown based on flimsy evidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that the lender can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of race because the race of the customer is unknown to them,\u201d said Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). \u201cSome believe that y\u2019all are after money instead of justice. What do you make of that?\u201d\n\nCordray countered that the CFPB was simply enforcing the law and following its mandate from Congress, and the actions based on disparate impact \u2014 or unintentional discrimination \u2014 have been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIf people are not following the law, they should pay,\u201d said Cordray. \u201cDisparate impact is the law of the land.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans, the bureau\u2019s actions on indirect auto lenders speak to their bigger issue with how the CFPB regulates the financial industry. GOP critics insist the CFPB is too quick penalize banks and lenders without first going through a rule-making process. That, they say, leaves industry without clear answers and subjects consumers and lenders to opaque and undemocratic regulation.\n\n\u201cThis would be a posterchild for rule-making as opposed to an enforcement action,\u201d said Shelby of the auto lending action.\n\nCordray insisted that the agency must punish those who break the law and doing so sends a clear signal to industry members who could be engaged in the same illegal activity.\n\nCordray also insisted that the CFPB\u2019s actions were not limiting consumer choices, pointing to increases in mortgage issuances, credit union memberships and auto loans since the bureau\u2019s opening in 2011. That earned him praise from Democrats, who applauded the CFPB\u2019s work and fought back Republican criticism.\n\n\u201cThe issue of accountability is bewildering to me,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod BrownThe Hill's 12:30 Report Clinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick Groups urge Senate to oppose defense language on for-profit colleges MORE (Ohio), the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, who charged Republicans with trying to turn the CFPB into \u201cideological roadkill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CFPB has exposed bad behavior by financial companies that previously had no federal regulator,\u201d added Brown, \u201cAnd we finally have strong mortgage rules and disclosures designed for the people who have to pay the mortgage.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also pressed Cordray on CFPB\u2019s pending rule on payday lenders, which is geared toward protecting customers from endless debt, and how emerging financial technology could impact how the bureau regulates the industry.\n\nCordray said the CFPB was doing its best to stay on top of developments to make sure their regulatory effort keep pace with technology.\n\n\u201cIt may be that banking system and the fintech system will converge in some ways,\u201d said Cordray. \u201cIf we fall behind it, this will dramatically affect markets over time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "CFPB head defends record to Republicans", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-07T17:35-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "CFPB head defends record to Republicans", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/275541-consumer-protection-bureau-director-defends-record-to-republicans", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cordrayrichard_030315gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-07T17:35:43-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/275541-consumer-protection-bureau-director-defends-record-to-republicans", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-07T17:09-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sylvan Lane", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Sherrod Brown,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-07T17:09:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-07T17:35:43-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/275541-consumer-protection-bureau-director-defends-record-to-republicans", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "CFPB head defends record to Republicans"}}, "article_summary": "Republicans hammered Cordray and the CFPB for what they claimed was a faulty and fraud-susceptible crackdown based on flimsy evidence.\n\u201cDisparate impact is the law of the land.\u201dFor Republicans, the bureau\u2019s actions on indirect auto lenders speak to their bigger issue with how the CFPB regulates the financial industry.\nCordray said the CFPB was doing its best to stay on top of developments to make sure their regulatory effort keep pace with technology.\nGOP critics insist the CFPB is too quick penalize banks and lenders without first going through a rule-making process.\nThe head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau defended its record Thursday to critical Republican senators, who charged it with preferring punitive action over transparent rules and stifling the country\u2019s credit market through unaccountable actions."}
