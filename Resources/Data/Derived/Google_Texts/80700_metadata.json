I will be rearranging my schedule as necessary so I can undergo treatment by physicians at Emory Healthcare. A more complete public statement will be made when facts are known, possibly next week.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Carter Center had disclosed the the former president had undergone elective surgery to \u201cremove a small mass in his liver.\u201d No further details were offered at the time.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more here in our main story, that will be updated through the evening. A piece:\n\nJill Stuckey, a close friend of Jimmy and his wife Rosalynn, said residents have been \u201cpraying ever since we found out about the small mass on his liver.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s done everything right. He exercises, he eats right, that\u2019s how he\u2019s gotten to be 90 and (still) going to different continents,\u201d said Stuckey, who helps manage the crowds of visitors at Maranatha Baptist Church when the former president gives lessons. There\u2019s a history of cancer in Carter\u2019s family, she added, \u201cbut if anyone can beat it, it\u2019s Jimmy Carter.\u201d\n\nThe well wishes flowed in from across the political world. From his vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, President Barack Obama called Carter and sent the following statement:\n\n\u201cMichelle and I send our best wishes to President Carter for a fast and full recovery. Our thoughts and prayers are with Rosalynn and the entire Carter family as they face this challenge with the same grace and determination that they have shown so many times before. Jimmy, you\u2019re as resilient as they come, and along with the rest of America, we are rooting for you.\u201d\n\nRep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, who worked in the Carter administration, passed this along:\n\n\u201cI am very sorry to hear about the illness of President Jimmy Carter. He has been a very active, productive former president. We need his wisdom, his words, and his leadership now more than ever before. We need him to continue to speak out on the great issues of our time. I will keep him, his wife and his family in my prayers. He has my most hopeful wishes for a complete recovery.\u201d\n\nSeveral more pols weighed in on Twitter:\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with President Carter and Rosalynn (@CarterCenter) today.
