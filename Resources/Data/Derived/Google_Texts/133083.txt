I know there are a lot of Dave Ramsey fans in our audience, and I think you’ll appreciate how succinctly and effectively he explains in under 10 minutes why ObamaCare cannot be anything but a disaster. It’s much the same thing we’ve been saying here all along, but it’s Dave Ramsey.

And he pulls no punches. ObamaCare is communism. And once he explains why, it’s really not even arguable. ObamaCare obliterates basic principles that govern how insurance works, taking away every method insurers use to mitigate risk, and mandates a) everyone be treated exactly the same, regardless of who they are or the level of risk they represent; and b) everyone participate whether they want to or not.

You know how auto insurers reward you with lower premiums if you’re a good driver? Sensible policy, yes? ObamaCare makes anything like that impossible in health insurance, because the whole idea is that low-risk policyholders and high-risk policyholders must be treated exactly the same, and must pay the same - and no one can opt out because if you can afford to pay and won’t take much from the system, the system needs you! Or more precisely, the system needs your money.
