Understandably, Oneida Healthcare\u2019s patients have many questions and concerns.\n\nIn response to that need for a reliable source of information, the hospital\u2019s business office now has specially trained counselors who can explain the changes and how they will affect each patient\u2019s individual situation. They can help patients understand, apply, and enroll for health coverage through the Marketplace, including Medicaid, Healthy NY, Child Health Plus, Family Health Plus or a Qualified Exchange Plan.\n\nSpecialist Jani McLaughlin is on hand at the hospital, Monday \u2013 Friday from 8am to 4PM, to assist patients who are admitted and identified as \u201cself pay\u201d (without insurance) via OHC\u2019s Emergency Department or Direct Admissions process. Another specialist is available to assist during high volume periods and additional staff members are also being trained.\n\nPatients who would like to speak to a CAC (Certified Application Counselor) must call to schedule an appointment, as walk-ins cannot be accommodated. \u201cThey (patients) really do need to call first,\u201d said Patient Access Services Manager Jeff Darling, noting that appointments can take upwards of two hours. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone by having them wait for an extended period of time while our specialist is either already assisting someone or may have a scheduled appointment with another patient.\u201d\n\nOneida Healthcare patients can call 361-2230 to schedule an appointment with an application counselor.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of dynamic change for health care and for our patients and we want to be a trusted resource they can turn to for answers,\u201d Darling concluded.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Madison County Courier", "description": "Specialist Jani McLaughlin is available at the Oneida Healthcare to answer questions about Affordable Care Act.
