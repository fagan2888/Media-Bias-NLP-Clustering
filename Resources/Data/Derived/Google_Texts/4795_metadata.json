The measure sets policies for all Pentagon programs and activities for the coming fiscal year.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon\u2019s New Bomber Faces a Potentially Costly Delay\n\nThe $612 billion policy roadmap, unveiled last week after months of conference negotiations by House and Senate lawmakers, includes acquisition reforms put forward by Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) that shift responsibility for purchasing programs away from the office of the secretary of defense and gives it to the military service chiefs and secretaries.\n\nThe new scheme scraps a roughly 30-year-old buying system that gave one acquisition official -- the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics -- authority over weapon efforts.\n\nIn a committee hearing last week, McCain castigated the civilian office for its role overseeing the navy\u2019s Ford-class aircraft carrier program, which he labeled \u201cone of the most spectacular acquisition debacles in recent memory.\u201d The effort is estimated to be $6 billion over budget.\n\n\u201cWhile the navy and the contractors deserve much of the blame, the milestone decision authority for the Ford-class program rests with the office of the secretary of defense, specifically the undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics,\u201d he said.\n\nCivilian appointees would retain oversight of joint weapons programs (those involving more than one military branch) and would be given control of major efforts such as the highly-anticipated long-range strike bomber if cost overruns reach more than 15 percent.\n\nShould such an overrun \u2013 known as a Nunn-McCurdy breach, named after the authors of the law \u2013 take place, the services would also have to pay penalties of 3 percent of the cost overrun to the Pentagon.\n\nRelated: How to Build a $400 Billion F-35 That Doesn\u2019t Fly\n\nThe change in authority would apply to new programs starting in fiscal 2017.\n\nMcCain\u2019s sweeping alterations largely beat out those championed by his House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX). His plans focused more on streamlining the Pentagon\u2019s acquisition bureaucracy and eliminating red tape to get cutting-edge weapons onto the battlefield faster, but left the chiefs largely out of the decision-making process.\n\nAides from both committees agree the differences between the two plans weren\u2019t all that great and that any improvements are welcome to revamp a system that by many accounts has become bloated and costly.\n\nMcCain\u2019s approach is the right one, according to Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute and a consultant who works with several defense contractors.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\n\u201cCentralization of acquisition functions has not worked. Rather than bringing greater coherence to the defense department\u2019s investment choices, it has spawned a vast bureaucracy that slows the development of needed weapons while second-guessing the judgment of those who will use them,\u201d he wrote last month in Forbes.\n\nIn July, Defense Secretary Ash Carter sent a letter Congress to express \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the proposed power shift, warning the move could lead to \u201cunwarranted optimism in program planning.\u201d\n\nBut speaking at a Defense One summit on Tuesday, Frank Kendall, DOD\u2019s acquisition chief, said the \u201cmost egregious\u201d problems with the buying overhaul had been removed in conference.\n\nBesides the change in authority, the policy blueprint contains provisions that make it easier for the Pentagon to buy commercial, off-the-shelf technology, bypassing the acquisitions regime all together.\n\nThe Senate will likely approve the NDAA on Wednesday. But President Obama has threatened to veto the legislation because it includes a $38 billion increase to the Pentagon\u2019s war fund, which would allow the agency to skirt sequestrations caps.\n\nThe legislative maneuver has riled Democrats, who want to negotiate a broader budget deal with the GOP that would lift the spending caps for both defense and domestic programs.\n\nThe bill contains \u201cmade-up money,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Defense subpanel, said on the Senate floor before the procedural vote.\n\nMcCain responded angrily, noting the measure is \u201can authorization bill. It has nothing to do with the appropriations process.\u201d\n\nThe House passed the NDAA conference bill last week 269 to 151, not enough to overcome the president\u2019s veto.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress is poised to approve a compromise bill that radically overhauls how the Depar", "title": "Targeting Bloat and Waste, Congress Eyes a New Way to Buy Weapons", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Targeting-Bloat-and-Waste-Pentagon-Has-New-Way-Buy-Weapons", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Washington_DC_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Targeting-Bloat-and-Waste-Pentagon-Has-New-Way-Buy-Weapons", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Washington_DC_Capitol.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Congress is poised to approve a compromise bill that radically overhauls how the Depar", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congress is poised to approve a compromise bill that radically overhauls how the Department of Defense buys and develops weapons, despite a looming veto threat from the White House.\nCivilian appointees would retain oversight of joint weapons programs (those involving more than one military branch) and would be given control of major efforts such as the highly-anticipated long-range strike bomber if cost overruns reach more than 15 percent.\nThe bill contains \u201cmade-up money,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Defense subpanel, said on the Senate floor before the procedural vote.\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\u201cCentralization of acquisition functions has not worked.\nThe new scheme scraps a roughly 30-year-old buying system that gave one acquisition official -- the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics -- authority over weapon efforts."}
