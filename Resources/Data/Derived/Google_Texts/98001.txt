BOULDER — Oregon State senior quarterback Sean Mannion is considered a future NFL player and is on track to become the Pac-12’s all-time leader in passing yards.

Following Colorado’s Monday practice, Buffs defensive backs coach Charles Clark was asked what makes Mannion (6-foot-5, 220 pounds) so effective.

“He has a big arm, he can throw the deep ball,” Clark said of Mannion. “He’s about 6-6, so he can see things maybe a little better than some quarterbacks.

“He’s in a pro-style offense,” Clark added. “He’s in the shotgun at times, he’s under center at times. He throws the ball well and has some receivers that can make plays for him as well.”

On Saturday in Boulder (2 p.m., Pac-12 Network), Colorado is hoping for a much better defensive performance against Mannion. He led the Beavers last season to a 44-17 win over the Buffs in Corvallis with six touchdown passes.In that game, Mannion completed 27-of-52 passes for 414 yards with one interception against Colorado.

“We had alignment problems last year in that game,” Clark said. “And you have to execute.”
