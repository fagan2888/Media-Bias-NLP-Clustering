Pitts also posted a more positive review about the speech to his official Facebook page, putting the emphasis on abortion:\n\nPope Francis is the most popular and respected leader in the world today because of his personal example of gentleness, humility, and kindness. Today's speech, centered around the examples of four great Americans, was a moral exhortation to Congress to use its power for the sake of those without power. I hope that my colleagues and I will go forth now, inspired by his message, to protect life at every stage, defend the family, and create opportunity for those in need.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/static/global/config/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Lawmaker who reps part of Chester County wanted more socially conservative talking points", "p": {"domain_verify": "eecb67825f8dac79c48fd3fd2c5a2a10"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "Lawmaker from Chester County wanted more socially conservative talking points", "title": "Pa. congressman 'disappointed' by Pope Francis", "url": "http://www.phillyvoice.com/pa-congressman-was-disappointed-pope-francis/", "image": {"src": "http://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/AP768873731893.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg"}, "site": "@thephillyvoice", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#603cba", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://www.phillyvoice.com/pa-congressman-was-disappointed-pope-francis/", "image": "http://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/AP768873731893.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "site_name": "PhillyVoice", "description": "Lawmaker from Chester County wanted more socially conservative talking points", "title": "Pa. congressman 'disappointed' by Pope Francis"}, "msvalidate.01": "4D5580B7E87BE36A95828119B7AB1BE3", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/global/images/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "philadelphia, news, pope in philly, politics, chester county, pennsylvania", "google-site-verification": "eWg_5HU7qyxLIjJ6ohS8pXIxrquJK4ZaWrLrk50o0Ss", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While Pope Francis' Thursday speech at Congress caused one Philadelphia lawmaker to swipe a glass of discarded papal water, and left John Boehner in tears before quitting his job, one Southeastern Pennsylvania politician left the speech \"disappointed.\"\nPer Vox:\"I was disappointed that he didn't use his forum to speak on behalf of the unborn and on marriage,\" Pitts said, acknowledging that the pope did make \"very veiled\" references to those issues.\nAs Vox points out, the pontiff did make references to those issues but he was not very explicit.\nAccording to Vox, Rep.
