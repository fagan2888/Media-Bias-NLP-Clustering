Native parents, who were often punished for speaking it in school, gradually stopped speaking and teaching their peoples\u2019 languages. As a result, new generations grew up not knowing their own mother tongue and instead faced a wall, a language barrier, keeping them locked outside their birthright. The resulting shame and anger are just some of the emotional baggage Native people carry with them when they try to learn their indigenous languages as adults.\n\n\u201cBut with little kids, you speak the language to them and they get it.\u201d\n\nAlaska Native Languages Assistant Professor Xh\u2019unei Lance Twitchell, University of Alaska Southeast, thinks it\u2019s time to stop trying to fix the old state-run, English-based education system.\n\n\u201cWe have an education system that graduates about 50 percent of Alaska Native students. At some point, as Alaska Native people, we\u2019re going to have to say that\u2019s not enough, that\u2019s not good enough.\u201d\n\nTwitchell envisions building an entirely new system in which everything is taught through the medium of Alaska Native languages. He plans a pilot program to begin in 2017 that\u2019s designed around the Tlingit language and culture.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to teach all of the content that a typical school would, from a much more cultural perspective, and we\u2019re going to teach it all through the Tlingit language.\u201d\n\nWorking with several different tribal organizations, in particular the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, he plans to open a Tlingit language immersion preschool, or \u201cLanguage Nest,\u201d in April, followed by a Tlingit immersion kindergarten in the fall of 2017.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to start with kindergarten in the fall of 2017 and then to build it one year at a time, because we\u2019re going to have to build curriculum, train teachers to teach this method, recruit students. I believe that this is the most sure path to language revitalization.\u201d\n\nTwitchell patterns the new school after the Ke Kula \u2018o N\u0101wah\u012bokalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu (Nawahi) Hawaiian Immersion School in Kea\u2019au, one of the most advanced and successful language revitalization programs in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re down to about 100 speakers now, but I think if you look at Hawaii, they were in a similar situation about 30 years ago and now they have 4,000 people learning the language in college, or in their preschools, or in their K through 12 schools.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1994, the Nawahi Immersion School provides instruction for nearly 200 preschool through 12th grade students in everything from science to math. All classes are taught in Hawaiian. It has a 100 percent high school graduation rate with 80 percent going on to attend college.\n\nIn Alaska, as in Hawaii, it will all start with little kids coming to a preschool where only their mother tongue is spoken.\n\n\u201cReally you\u2019re just practicing being in a home environment where Tlingit would be the first language. It\u2019s been 50 years since we\u2019ve had kids who were raised in the language.\u201d\n\nThe pain caused by this lack of new speakers is demonstrated for Twitchell when he talks with fluent Native language speakers in their mother tongue.\n\n\u201cA lot of them would say things like, \u2018Gee, I haven\u2019t spoken like this since my father died.\u2019 And sometimes they\u2019ll say, \u2018You know, it\u2019s been 20 years and I\u2019ve hardly spoken the language at all.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwitchell\u2019s own grandfather, Silas Dennis Sr., first interested him in learning Tlingit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about Tlingit until I was about 20 years old and I started asking my grandpa about it. And it formed a bond with us. We were the only ones in our family that could really do anything with the language. I didn\u2019t learn very much before he passed away. Then it sort of became this way to keep a special memory of him alive.\u201d\n\nTwitchell remembers how his grandfather pushed him to learn, imparting a sense of urgency about learning that he never forgot.\n\n\u201cHe really seemed in a hurry to tell me a lot of things. I noticed that it went from us conversing to him talking and then me beginning to talk and then him just talking right over me. And I was okay with that because I felt like he had things that he needed to let me know. So he was setting me up for a life where I was going to go and be walking with our culture and with our language, which is a tough thing to do.\u201d\n\nIn his role as an Alaska Native language instructor, Twitchell has often confronted the pain his adult students feel when trying to learn their mother tongue.\n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019s going to be all these different triggers that sort of emerge because we\u2019re a people just right on the cusp of this very successful genocide, because our language is just right there slipping away from us. As we come back, as we sort of emerge and we try to reclaim this identity, we\u2019re going to find so many different points of pain and shame, all this array of feelings. A lot of them are very negative. We\u2019ve got to face those things.\u201d\n\nStudents often give up and quit when confronted with their own negative feelings. Instead of working through them, they simply ignore or deny the feelings and abandon their studies.\n\n\u201cBut the problem with forgetting and just not looking at it is that you just get absorbed into this assimilation machine. Our elders always say, \u2018Our language is like medicine.\u2019 There\u2019s so much power in the language and we\u2019re trying to tap into that.\u201d\n\nBy recognizing this quality of Native languages, tribal-run Native language immersion schools will bring healing to many generations, from young children who will pick up the language naturally, to their parents who can use the opportunity to overcome the demons of assimilation, and to the elders who will see from the fruits of the program their way of life is not lost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alaska Native Languages Assistant Professor Xh\u2019unei Lance Twitchell thinks it\u2019s time to revitalize the Tlingit language through an immersion school.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/03/27/our-language-medicine-tlingit-immersion-school-provide-path-revitalization-163787", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tlingit-language-mary-folletti_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "\u2018Our Language Is Like Medicine\u2019: Tlingit Immersion School to Provide a Path to Revitalization"}, "abstract": "Alaska Native Languages Assistant Professor Xh\u2019unei Lance Twitchell thinks it\u2019s time to revitalize the Tlingit language through an immersion school.", "dc": {"title": "\u2018Our Language Is Like Medicine\u2019: Tlingit Immersion School to Provide a Path to Revitalization"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/03/27/our-language-medicine-tlingit-immersion-school-provide-path-revitalization-163787", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Frank Hopper, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, Alaska, Tlingit, Indigenous Language Revitalization, Language Preservation, Immersion School, Language Immersion", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2016-03-27T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "\u2018Our Language Is Like Medicine\u2019: Tlingit Immersion School to Provide a Path to Revitalization"}, "article_summary": "He plans a pilot program to begin in 2017 that\u2019s designed around the Tlingit language and culture.\n\u201cWe have an education system that graduates about 50 percent of Alaska Native students.\nI believe that this is the most sure path to language revitalization.\u201dTwitchell patterns the new school after the Ke Kula \u2018o N\u0101wah\u012bokalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu (Nawahi) Hawaiian Immersion School in Kea\u2019au, one of the most advanced and successful language revitalization programs in the country.\nGenocide stole our Native languages and replaced them with shame.\nNative parents, who were often punished for speaking it in school, gradually stopped speaking and teaching their peoples\u2019 languages."}
