Now he jokingly compares himself with the Mel Gibson character in \u201cWhat Women Want,\u201d the ad man awash in products intended for women.\n\nMen are unlikely to request peels (they just complain about their skin), but dermatologists, facialists and skin-care companies say they are selling more to men every year to treat a variety of problems.\n\n\u201cMen feel comfortable with peels because they work fast and there are no injections, so they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re having work done,\u201d said Dr.\n\nFrancesca Fusco, a dermatologist in Manhattan, who uses them to treat brown spots (the top complaint), fine lines, wrinkles, ingrown hairs and large pores (especially on the nose) and to address skin texture.\n\nFor men, there is the welcome side effect of a closer shave, she said, and skin-care professionals like that the peel has become a gateway drug to other cosmetic procedures.\n\n\u201cMen come in for that, and then maybe the next year they\u2019re asking about skin tightening,\u201d Fusco said. Men tend to stick to gentler peels, like those with glycolic acid (as opposed to, say, fraxal laser peels) because they\u2019d rather not walk around pink and flaking.\n\nJim Massaro, a strength and conditioning coach in Nyack, New York, first went to a dermatologist because he was worried about the brown spots on his face and hands. (He sheepishly admits to rarely wearing a hat.) Now, about once a season, he has a peel (usually glycolic acid or trichloracetic acid, a relative of vinegar), which he says has reduced the spots about 90 percent.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do injections or laser because that might give you downtime,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want athletes making fun of me, thinking I\u2019m getting Botox or something.\u201d\n\nJoanna Vargas, a facialist in Manhattan, has seen a steady increase in male clients, and she said she gives them peels because they\u2019re a quick way to see results \u2014 and, most especially, because they make removing blemishes less painful.\n\n\u201cWomen think it\u2019s OK to suffer a bit for beauty, but men are a little more sensitive to extractions,\u201d she said.\n\nShe avoids anything that smells like a woman\u2019s product and opts for higher concentrations of fruit acid (men\u2019s skin is thicker) mixed with paprika.\n\n\u201cThey like the heat of the paprika,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cIt\u2019s invigorating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/MEN_FACIAL_PEELS_1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "To prepare for important meetings, Robert Tomson, the owner of a women\u2019s activewear company, has a secret weapon: an at-home two-step facial peel.\nNow he jokingly compares himself with the Mel Gibson character in \u201cWhat Women Want,\u201d the ad man awash in products intended for women.\nNow, about once a season, he has a peel (usually glycolic acid or trichloracetic acid, a relative of vinegar), which he says has reduced the spots about 90 percent.\n\u201cMen come in for that, and then maybe the next year they\u2019re asking about skin tightening,\u201d Fusco said.\nFor men, there is the welcome side effect of a closer shave, she said, and skin-care professionals like that the peel has become a gateway drug to other cosmetic procedures."}
