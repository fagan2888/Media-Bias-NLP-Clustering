His temperature has also been reduced to around 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) to reduce swelling.\n\nBy being unconscious, the brain is also switched off to sounds, light and other triggers that cause the organ to use up oxygen as it processes the stimuli.\n\nIt is as yet unclear exactly how the accident happened, but a source close to a probe into the incident told AFP that Schumacher's helmet, which medics say saved his life, had been smashed \"in two\" by the impact.\n\nKehm told journalists on Tuesday that Schumacher was skiing \"with a small group of friends\" as well as his 14-year-old son Mick.\n\nShe said he was not skiing at high speed when the accident happened. \"He seems to have hit a rock as he took a turn. It was a chain of unfortunate circumstances.\"\n\nKehm added that the accident could have happened even \"at 10 kilometres (six miles) per hour\" and took place during \"a normal turning manoeuvre\".\n\nSchumacher's condition has attracted attention from around the world and several people have tried to sneak through the hospital and approach the former racer, she said.\n\n\"There apparently was a person dressed up as a priest, who tried to get near Michael. I am asking everyone to let the doctors work and leave the family to spend peaceful time with Michael.\"\n\nAsked whether the priest was a journalist, she said: \"It's what I was told... We have clearly noted that people are trying to get beyond the press room here in the clinic. It's revolting, in my opinion.\"\n\nSchumacher, who won the last of his world titles in 2004, towered over the sport since his debut in 1991, winning more Formula One world titles and races than any other. He had a record 91 wins and is one of only two men to race in 300 grands prix.\n\nHis duels in his heyday with Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve, fired by an unquenchable competitive spirit, have gone down in Formula One lore.\n\nBorn in January 1969 near Cologne, Germany, his father ran a local go-kart track where his mother worked in the canteen.\n\nBy 1987, Schumacher was the German and European go-kart champion and was soon racing professionally. In 1991 he burst into Formula One by qualifying seventh in his debut race in Belgium and a year later, he won his first Formula One grand prix.\n\nHe joined Ferrari in 1996 and went from strength to strength over the next decade, dominating the podium, before retiring aged 37.\n\nBut he could not resist the lure of the track and in 2010 he came out of retirement, signing a deal with Mercedes before quitting for good in 2012.\n\nAFP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Motorsport", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Doctors rule out any transfer from clinic, which they say would be &quot;dangerous&quot;.", "title": "Schumacher 'stable' on third night in hospital", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/schumacher-stable-on-third-night-in-hospital-20140101-305xw.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/6/8/k/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.305xw.png/1388578369177.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/6/8/k/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.305xw.png/1388578369177.jpg"}, "description": "Doctors rule out any transfer from clinic, which they say would be \"dangerous\".", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Schumacher 'stable' on third night in hospital"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Doctors rule out any transfer from clinic, which they say would be \"dangerous\"."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc682\"", "article_summary": "Formula One legend Michael Schumacher remained \"stable\" on Wednesday after spending a third night in hospital with severe brain injuries sustained while skiing in the French Alps.\nClick for more photos Michael Schumacher in critical condition after ski crash Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is in a critical condition in hospital after suffering a brain hemorrhage in a skiing accident in France.\nCritically injured ...
