that surging Medicaid enrollments, rather than sign-ups for private insurance, threaten to derail ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cClearly, if they\u2019re not enrolling in the exchanges \u2026 that undercuts the entire picture that (the administration) presented: that enrollment was being successful at the state program, because (people) were enrolling in an entirely different program,\u201d she said on \"The Kelly File.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a major problem, Barber explained, because the system is unsustainable if only sick people are collecting insurance subsidies and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have healthy people paying into the exchanges, then the entire system will collapse,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd unlike the federal government, which can run a budget deficit, nearly all states have balanced budget provisions \u2013 which severely curtails their spending flexibility when it comes to accommodating all the new Medicaid recipients.\n\n\u201c(The states) cannot expand spending, even if they want to,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have to care for all these people on Medicaid now, when they haven\u2019t planned for it in their budget, they\u2019re either going to have to raise taxes, raise income payroll taxes, or cut things from other spending, like roads, schools and things like that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care",
