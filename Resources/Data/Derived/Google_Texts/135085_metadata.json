And thousands of his supporters are in jail for no other reason than their political affiliations. At the same time, Egypt continues to be a recipient of significant American foreign aid.\n\nThe hypocrisy and incoherence of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy could not be more clear. We actively support the incompetent and kleptocratic governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. We were instrumental in the overthrow of the dictatorship in Libya. But when a legitimately elected president is imprisoned and sentenced to death \u2014 we do nothing.\n\nAmericans deserve an explanation from our elected representatives about what our policy is regarding support of military dictatorships. And the residents of countries around the world should take note \u2014 when the Americans come and say they want to support democracy in your country, don\u2019t believe it.\n\nSteve Laudeman, Denver\n\nThis letter was published in the May 25 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/05/24/egypts-mohammed-morsi-and-the-hypocrisy-of-u-s-foreign-policy/37798/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/05/mohammed-morsi-495x327.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Egypt's Mohammed Morsi and the hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Egypt\u2019s Mohammed Morsi and the hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/05/24/egypts-mohammed-morsi-and-the-hypocrisy-of-u-s-foreign-policy/37798/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/05/mohammed-morsi-495x327.jpg", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The democratically elected president of a major U.S. ally \u2014 former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi \u2014 has been sentenced to death on charges that are clearly inflated and politically motivated."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd75df\"", "article_summary": "The hypocrisy and incoherence of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy could not be more clear.\nRe: \u201cOusted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sentenced to death,\u201d May 17 news story.\nThe democratically elected president of a major U.S. ally \u2014 former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi \u2014 has been sentenced to death on charges that are clearly inflated and politically motivated.\nBut when a legitimately elected president is imprisoned and sentenced to death \u2014 we do nothing.\nAmericans deserve an explanation from our elected representatives about what our policy is regarding support of military dictatorships."}
