And according to a new study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, children who experience parasomnias may experience psychotic symptoms when they grow older.\n\n\u201cWe have previously demonstrated a cross-sectional relationship between the presence of nightmares and night terrors and psychotic experiences at age 12,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cHowever, it is essential to determine whether parasomnias are possible precursors of psychotic experiences using longitudinal data. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the most common parasomnias in childhood\u2026to later psychotic experiences reported at 18 years using data from a large UK birth cohort.\u201d\n\nThe cohort is the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which began in order to see what factors into development, health, and disease during childhood. The present study culls the cohort\u2019s parental reports and participant interviews to assess individuals\u2019 experience with nightmares at certain ages throughout the study: between ages 2 and 9; age 12; and age 18.\n\nThe results showed those who have nightmares and night terrors at age 12 are more likely to experience psychotic symptoms at age 18. However, this link was influenced by cofounding variables, such as age, mood, family history, as well as baseline psychotic experiences at age 12.\n\n\u201cThe presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms as confounding factors in those with sleep disturbance could potentially explain the findings,\u201d Dr. Andrew Thompson, lead study author from Warwick Medical School, said in press release. \u201cExperience of stressful events has also been related to both the development of both nightmares and psychotic symptoms in late childhood and may be important.\u201d\n\nWhile this confirms the prior study\u2019s finding of a relationship between nightmares, night terrors, and psychotic symptoms, it doesn\u2019t speak to sleepwalking. And in this study, the relationship with night terrors wasn\u2019t as strong. Even so, researchers conclude these findings \u201csuggest that specific parasomnias \u2026 are a potential risk indicator for the development of \u2026 psychotic experiences.\u201d\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation reported parasomnias often run in the family, and there may be a genetic factor in many cases. Brain disorders, too, influence parasomnias, as do other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nBut for some, parasomnias can be improved just by adopting healthy sleep habits. Maintaining a regular schedule, managing stress, and getting the recommended amount of sleep can control symptoms. Drug therapies are also available.\n\nSource: Fisher L, Wolke D, et al.
