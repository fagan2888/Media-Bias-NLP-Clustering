In fact, you back legislation (the Carper-Coburn bill) that would worsen the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s financial situation.\n\nTo your credit, you note that the Postal Service runs on earned revenue, not taxpayer funds. You also accurately note that most of the red ink stems from a 2006 congressional mandate that the Postal Service pre-fund future retiree health benefits.\n\nBut you then inexplicably support calls by some legislators to degrade service to residents and businesses in Denver and throughout the country, proposals that would slow the mail, end Saturday delivery and substitute neighborhood \u201ccluster boxes\u201d for door-to-door delivery \u2014 sending residents traipsing around the neighborhood in Colorado weather to get their mail.\n\nIt makes no sense to degrade postal networks that are profitable, and have been since October 2012. With the economy gradually improving, letter revenue is once again rising. Meanwhile, skyrocketing online shopping has boosted package revenue, making the Internet a net positive for the USPS \u2014 auguring well for the future.\n\nFiscal Year 2014 saw a $1.4 billion operating profit; fiscal 2015\u2019s first month alone (October) was $633 million in the black.\n\nBeyond inconveniencing Denver\u2019s residents and businesses, reducing services and delivery standards would send the Postal Service on a downward spiral by driving away mail \u2014 and revenue. And it would cost jobs. The national mailing industry, which depends on a robust, six-day-a-week Postal Service, employs 7.5 million Americans in the private sector \u2014 including 135,000 in Colorado.\n\nRather than break what\u2019s working, Colorado\u2019s representatives in Washington should help fix what a lame-duck Congress broke when it made the Postal Service the only agency or company required to pre-fund. No one else is required to do so for even one year; the Postal Service has to pre-fund 75 years into the future and pay for it all over a decade. That $5.6 billion annual charge is the \u201cred ink.\u201d\n\nThis is a tale of red ink driven not by technological progress but rather by flawed public policy. Congress needs to address the pre-funding fiasco.\n\nFredric Rolando is president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, based in Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "The wrong fix for the U.S. Postal Service", "title": "The wrong fix for the U.S. Postal Service", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/the-wrong-fix-for-the-u-s-postal-service/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__OP05ROLANDOp1.jpg", "height": 510}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__OP05ROLANDOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T14:18:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:36:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Postal Service needs major fix,\u201d Dec. 25 editorial.\nThe national mailing industry, which depends on a robust, six-day-a-week Postal Service, employs 7.5 million Americans in the private sector \u2014 including 135,000 in Colorado.\nYou also accurately note that most of the red ink stems from a 2006 congressional mandate that the Postal Service pre-fund future retiree health benefits.\nTo your credit, you note that the Postal Service runs on earned revenue, not taxpayer funds.\nPostal Service\u2019s financial situation."}
