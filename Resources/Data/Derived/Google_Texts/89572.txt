Story highlights The Super PAC behind Jeb Bush -- Right to Rise -- released a video overnight attack his primary rivals

The ad is a sign of how national security has risen as a priority in the 2016 presidential campaign

(CNN) The Super PAC backing Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released a new ad early Tuesday ripping his GOP rivals and accusing front-runner Donald Trump of being "reckless" and "impulsive."

The 30-second spot from Right to Rise Super PAC, titled "Desk," hits leading Republican contenders Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on potential vulnerabilities.

"Will he be impulsive and reckless, like Donald Trump?" the narrator asks. "Will he have voted to dramatically weaken counter-terrorism surveillance, like Ted Cruz? Will he have skipped crucial national security hearings and votes just to campaign, like Marco Rubio?"
