Michael Bennet took on an electoral tint Tuesday, as the GOP launched robo-calls in Colorado attacking the Democrat ahead of his 2016 re-election bid.\n\nIn the calls \u2014 which went to thousands of independent women voters \u2014 the National Republican Senatorial Committee accused Bennet of \u201cfilibustering bipartisan legislation to combat human sex trafficking.\u201d Bennet is one of the few vulnerable Senate Democrats on the ballot in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe Denver Post recently reported that Colorado Is A \u2018Breeding Ground\u2019 For Human Trafficking so one would think Senator Bennet would be leading the charge to get this bill passed, instead of blocking it,\u201d the robo-call script reads. \u201cCall Senator Bennet today at 303-455-7600 and tell him to stop playing political games with women and children who have been victimized by human traffickers.\u201d\n\nThe NRSC refused to disclose how much it spent on the robo-call campaign, making it unclear whether it would leave a mark on the race.\n\nThe GOP message tells only half the story and the partisan squabbling is being cast as typical Washington. Senate Democrats blocked the legislation Tuesday because of an anti-abortion provision tucked into the legislation \u2014 just the kind of issue that Democrats argue is part of the GOP\u2019s \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it, Republican Senators are currently playing politics with women\u2019s health to the detriment of victims of human trafficking,\u201d said Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThe anti-human trafficking bill is a bipartisan effort and it should be cleared of this poison bill that is preventing it from becoming law as quickly as possible. In their first months in the majority, Republican Senators have played politics with the Department of Homeland Security, stopping Iran from becoming a nuclear power, and now women\u2019s health and victims of human trafficking. Voters will remember these kinds of despicable political games come 2016.\u201d\n\nThe NRSC also is trying to tie Bennet to a decision made by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s administration not to allow 190,000 health insurance policies to continue in 2016 because they don\u2019t meet Affordable Care Act requirements.\n\nThe NRSC will announce Wednesday that it filed a public records request for communications between Bennet and his staff with the state Department of Insurance regarding the impending cancellations. A similar records request entangled U.S. Sen. Mark Udall in a mess regarding health care plans during his losing 2014 re-election bid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never know all the conversations that may have taken place behind the scenes, but the least we can do to hold Senator Bennet accountable is to make a public records request for these emails,\u201d said NRSC spokesman Matt Connelly.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Republican campaign targeting Sen.
