Like most refugees, they first lived in apartments, but they realized quickly that \u201cat the end of the day, there\u2019s no equity,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he said, he comes from a savings-oriented society whose members are \u201ccredit-averse\u201d and hesitate to ask for help.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t like to get big loans,\u201d Bastola said.\n\nBhutan is an independent kingdom in the Himalayas. Although it doesn\u2019t share a border with Nepal, it is close enough that Bhutan\u2019s monarchy felt threatened by the onslaught of ethnic Nepalese and thus drove many into exile. About 80,000 of Bhutan\u2019s ethnic Nepalese have been resettled in the United States.\n\nOhio officials said that 1,737 Bhutanese refugees have been placed here since 2009, including 425 this year. The population has increased as family members and others have arrived in Ohio from other parts of the United States.\n\nTara Dhungana, employment-services program manager for Community Refugee and Immigration Services, said the Bhutanese population in Ohio could be close to 15,000.\n\nJennifer Johnson, the state\u2019s refugee coordinator, said that number is probably too high, but \u201cit\u2019s hard to track secondary migration. We don\u2019t have a good mechanism of tracking those\u201d who come from elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nFor now, most of the refugees still live in apartments, said Bastola, who runs an Asian grocery. But more are saving to buy their own houses - one of many signs that the immigrants have been successful in adjusting to a new life in the U.S.\n\nMany buy homes with extended-family members, pooling money to make down payments, said Durga Timsina, an agent with Carleton Realty and himself a member of the community.\n\n\u201cThey always have three or four people working in the family,\u201d Timsina said. They save money and take out conventional 30-year mortgages.\n\nTimsina said he has sold homes to about 14 Bhutanese families. While many families first settled in apartments along or near Morse Road in the Northland area, about 50 families have purchased homes in or near Reynoldsburg, he said.\n\nWhy? Better schools and newer, larger houses, he said.\n\nTimsina, 38, moved to central Ohio from Georgia in 2012. He lives at an apartment complex and is looking to buy a house in or near Westerville.\n\nHe is a partner with Bastola in the South Asian Bazaar, a Morse Road grocery that sells everything from clothes to diapers to dry goods.\n\nTheir wives are sisters.\n\nBastola, 42, leads the Bhutanese Nepali Community of Columbus. He also prepares taxes, having studied to become a certified public accountant in India before migrating to the U.S. in 2008. He settled in Cincinnati, then moved here in March 2012.\n\nAlthough his bustling store caters mostly to the Bhutanese Nepali community, he also attracts African-American, Burmese and Indian customers in what has long been becoming one of Columbus\u2019 most diverse areas.\n\nGanesh Dhami and his family used to live near Bastola\u2019s market, but they recently bought a four-bedroom house in Pickerington with the help of Dhami\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cWe could never have done it alone, but with help from my parents and a brother and sister, we were able to save enough money to make it happen,\u201d Dhami said.\n\nHis wife works part time at a day-care center and he juggles two jobs - working for a hotel during the day and at a shipping company sorting boxes at night - to pay the mortgage, but it\u2019s worth it, he said. His parents live with the couple and help care for their three children, ages 3 to 10.\n\nOnce they\u2019re more financially comfortable, Dhami hopes to give money to a cousin, Siddhartha Subedi, so he can buy a home, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re family; we look after each other,\u201d Dhami said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bhim Bastola has been in the United States for six years and in Columbus for two.", "Author": "MARK FERENCHIK and ENCARNACION PYLE", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bhim Bastola has been in the United States for six years and in Columbus for two.", "title": "Ohio sees growing Bhutanese refugee population", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/3/ohio-sees-growing-bhutanese-refugee-population/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/c99f3c657ff334006a0f6a706700e84a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/c99f3c657ff334006a0f6a706700e84a.jpg", "title": "Ohio sees growing Bhutanese refugee population", "description": "Bhim Bastola has been in the United States for six years and in Columbus for two.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf301\"", "article_summary": "Tara Dhungana, employment-services program manager for Community Refugee and Immigration Services, said the Bhutanese population in Ohio could be close to 15,000.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Bhim Bastola has been in the United States for six years and in Columbus for two.\nBut he and others in the city\u2019s growing Bhutanese Nepali community already are buying houses, even though many work in low-paying jobs.\nThe population has increased as family members and others have arrived in Ohio from other parts of the United States.\nOhio officials said that 1,737 Bhutanese refugees have been placed here since 2009, including 425 this year."}
