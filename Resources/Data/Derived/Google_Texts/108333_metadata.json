(Seriously, he nails it.)\n\nWhere we part company, however, is when he gets around to describing his preferred option for addressing the situation.\n\nFrum\u2019s recipe for \u201cTrue Reform\u201d includes this:\n\nMake peace with universal health-insurance coverage: Mend Obamacare rather than end it. Cut taxes less at the top, and use the money to deliver more benefits to working families in the middle. Devise immigration policy to support wages, not undercut them.\n\nEmbracing Obamacare and delivering more \u201cbenefits\u201d strikes me as an interesting way to head off what many think of as a Right-wing movement. In fairness, though, Frum is absolutely correct when he acknowledges that Trump supporters \u201caren\u2019t necessarily superconservative. They often don\u2019t think in ideological terms at all. But they do strongly feel that life in this country used to be better for people like them\u2014and they want that older country back.\u201d\n\nYes, people are pissed. But this doesn\u2019t mean conservatives should abandon their principles in favor of adopting liberal stances masquerading as populism.\n\nMy forthcoming book Too Dumb to Fail really picks fights with two enemies: Lunatics and heretics. Both are dangerous. And, in this case, Frum is essentially marrying the two of them. This is the worst of both worlds. The key for conservatives is to modernize, not to moderate. (If you\u2019re interested in more on that, pre-order it today.)\n\n* * *\n\nLastly, a note: Thank you for reading me this year.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nMatt", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt K.
