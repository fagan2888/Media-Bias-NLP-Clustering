And in my state we had a whole list of moderate Republicans who actually were concerned about the environment, education, women\u2019s rights. They didn\u2019t have our politics, but they had deep concerns about the welfare of ordinary people.\n\nI want to start off by sharing with you a document of the 1980 Libertarian Party. The candidate for Vice President from that party was one David Koch, who is half of the Koch brothers. When you see this document, you understand how far the Republican Party has moved to the right. Take a look at these exact quotes from the platform that David Koch ran on. It\u2019s not just that he received 1 percent of the vote. It\u2019s that many of the ideas that he put forth in that campaign were thought to be crazy, wacky, fringe ideas.\n\nBut listen to how those ideas reflect today\u2019s mainstream Republican thinking.\n\nThis is a quote: \u201cWe urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws and the immediate dissolution of the despotic Federal Election Commission.\u201d\n\nRight now, as you know, because of the efforts of the Republican Party, the Koch brothers, and others, the Supreme Court gave us the disastrous 5 to 4 decision in Citizens United, one of the worst decisions in the history of the United States of America. The decision says corporations are people, and corporations and wealthy people can spend as much money as they want on independent expenditures.\n\nFor the Koch brothers and today for the leadership of the Republican Party, you have to understand, that does not go far enough. They want, and this is what David Koch was talking about thirty-five years ago, they want billionaires to be able to directly hand checks of $50 million to the candidates of their choice. That is now the position of the top of the Republican Party.\n\nHere is also what they talked about back then and what they believe today: \u201cWe favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programs.\u201d\n\nAnd here is another quote: \u201cWe favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social Security system.\u201d\n\nIn the papers today, the Republicans in the Senate are talking about what their agenda will be if, God forbid, they gain control of the Senate. They are back again to talking about \u201centitlement reform.\u201d And when they talk about \u201centitlement reform,\u201d know exactly what they are talking about: massive cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. We will not allow them to do that.\n\nAnother quote from that 1980 Libertarian platform: \u201cWe propose the abolition of the U.S. Postal Service.\u201d And they\u2019re trying to do that today. And despite what you read, the truth is the Postal Service this year, excluding the horrendous $5.5 billion pre-payment for future health care retirees, is actually making money.\n\nNow all of you know that right now the federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. And I hope all of us are united on raising the minimum wage.\n\nBut I want you to hear what the Koch brothers\u2019 view is on the minimum wage: \u201cWe support the repeal of any requirement that impedes any person from finding employment, such as minimum wage laws.\u201d\n\nSo employers will be able to say to workers, \u201cI don\u2019t have to pay you the minimum wage. I\u2019m going to pay you three bucks an hour, and if you don\u2019t like that, there are thirty other workers who will take that.\u201d\n\nNo minimum wage, no worker safety protection on the job. That\u2019s their vision.\n\nLet me tell you what the Koch brothers\u2019 view is on education: \u201cWe advocate the complete separation of education and state. Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.\u201d\n\nWell, very succinctly stated, that\u2019s the end of public education in America. So if you\u2019ve got the money, you can send your kids to fine private schools. But if you don\u2019t have the money, tough luck.\n\nGoodbye, as I read this, state universities. Goodbye Pell grants. All gone.\n\nAnd this next part should not surprise us coming from folks who have made most of their money from fossil fuel. Many of us, and I\u2019m on both the environment and energy committees, are struggling with how we reverse carbon emissions, and get a handle on global warming. This is their view: \u201cWe support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of parts of the 1980 document, but this is the last one I want to share with you:\n\n\u201cWe oppose all government welfare, relief projects and \u2018aid to the poor\u2019 programs. All these government programs are privacy invading, paternalistic, demeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.\u201d\n\nNow do you know what that means in English?\n\nIt means that if you are seventy-five years of age and you\u2019re diagnosed with cancer, Medicare is not there. If you are poor and you want to go to a doctor, Medicaid is not there. If you are a worker who loses his or her job and needs unemployment insurance, that\u2019s gone.\n\nWhat this is about, and indeed what the Republican Party is telling us today, is that they have moved to become a rightwing extremist party. Their goal is to repeal virtually every major piece of legislation passed since the 1930s to protect the elderly, the sick, the middle class, and the poor.\n\nThis is their agenda.\n\nThe fact is that today we have more serious problems than at any time since the Great Depression. And if you throw in the enormous planetary crisis of global warming, it may well be that these are the most challenging times facing our country since the Civil War.\n\nThe reality is that the middle class, the working class in this country, is stressed out. We have millions of people working longer hours for lower wages. Median family income has gone down $5,000 since 1999. That median male worker, that guy right in the middle, made $283 less last year than he did forty-four years ago. Female workers earned $1,700 less last year than they did in 2007.\n\nIn other words, the American working class is on the move. The problem is they are moving in the wrong direction.\n\nWhat galls people is not just that the middle class is in decline, not just that we have more people living in poverty than at any time in the history of the United States of America, but that the wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well. And the largest corporations are enjoying record profits.\n\nToday in America, we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth, and worse in America today than at any time since 1929.\n\nToday in America the top 1 percent owns 37 percent of the wealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns 1.7 percent of the wealth.\n\nToday one family the Walton family of Walmart, owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.\n\nToday twenty-five hedge fund managers, the wealthiest, make more money than 435,000 public school teachers.\n\nNow why is this an issue of huge consequence?\n\nFirst of all, it is a moral issue.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, are we content as a nation to see a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time that the middle class disappears and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth? Is that the country we aim to be? The answer is no!\n\nBut it is not just a moral issue. It is a political issue. Because what the billionaire class is doing is not putting their incredible wealth under the mattress. Many of them, led by the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and others, are apparently not content to have billions of dollars in wealth. One might think that if you were the Koch brothers and you had $80 billion that might be enough. But apparently it is not. Last year they increased their wealth by $12 billion. And what these people currently feel an enormous urge to do is not just to collect more money for themselves, but they feel impelled to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the programs that working people and the poor survive on.\n\nFrankly, I think what you\u2019re looking at is not even a political problem here. It is a psychiatric problem.\n\nWe all know people with substance abuse problems. There are people who can\u2019t get enough to drink and wreck their lives. There are people who need more and more drugs.\n\nWell, these people are addicted to greed and money, and it is a sickness that is destroying the economy of the United States of America.\n\nIt is also an economic issue. We have tens and tens and tens of thousands of American workers who literally have no money to spend. I was in Mississippi a couple of weeks ago, talking to workers who have worked at McDonald\u2019s for years. And they are not kids. They\u2019re mothers. And they make $7.35 an hour. Now if you make those wages, or you\u2019re unemployed, you cannot go out and buy products. You cannot go out and buy services. You are not spending money in your community. And if working people are not spending money, jobs are not being created.\n\nLet me talk about what I see as a progressive agenda.\n\nIssue number one: We need a grassroots movement from California to Wisconsin to Vermont demanding the overturn of Citizens United and moving us to public funding of elections.\n\nNumber two: If we are serious about the future of this country, we have to understand that while we are better off than we were sixty years ago, we have to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put millions and millions of people to work. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that in order to get our crumbling infrastructure system up to par, we need to invest $3 trillion. Now interestingly enough, $3 trillion is exactly what we spent on the damn war in Iraq that we never should have gotten into in the first place. But if we were conservative and only invested $1 trillion in rebuilding our infrastructure, we could create thirteen million decent-paying jobs, and that makes sense to me.\n\nAnd we also have to talk about an issue that the media doesn\u2019t talk about. I am proud to tell you that I have never voted for one of these damn trade agreements that result in shipping jobs out of the country. It was a bipartisan corporate drive, in Washington, with Bill Clinton and the Republicans working hand-in-hand. Young people in America don\u2019t know that there was actually a time when you could walk into a department store and buy a product made in America, not in China. We need to start making products again in Wisconsin, and Vermont, and all across this country.\n\nThe United States of America is the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of its people as a right.\n\nI believe the Affordable Care Act has helped us in some ways. But it is a modest step forward. Our job is to pass a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program to guarantee health care for all.\n\nOn the issue of education, if you can believe it, about thirty years ago the United States led the world in terms of the percentage of people graduating from college. Today we are in twelfth place. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of bright young people who have given up the dream of going to college because they can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAnd there are millions of others who come out of school $30,000, $50,000 in debt. God didn\u2019t create free education up to the twelfth grade. And there are countries all over the world that say to their young people, if you have the ability, you will go to college without cost, because we need you to help develop a strong economy. That is a lesson that we should learn.\n\nThe crises facing this country and the world are enormous. But these crises have been caused by human decisions\u2014policy decisions made by people in state capitols and in Washington. They were made by human beings, and they can be addressed by human beings.\n\nWhat we have got to do, it seems to me, is reach out and find commonality among the people of this country.\n\nAnd I want to tell you some very good news in that respect\u2014the truth is, on every major issue facing this country, the American people are united.\n\nYou go to the most conservative states in this country, and you say, \u201cHey, I think we should cut Medicare and Social Security, and give tax breaks to billionaires, what do you think?\u201d\n\nAnd the people in Alabama, and in Mississippi, and Oklahoma, and all the conservative states will say, \u201cYou are nuts.\u201d\n\nAnd then you go out and you say, \u201cHey, what do you think democracy is about? Is it about billionaires buying elections?\u201d And they will tell you, \u201cNo! That\u2019s not what democracy is about. We need campaign finance reform.\u201d\n\nAnd you go out and you talk to people and you say, \u201cDo you think the federal government should invest in infrastructure and create jobs all over this country?\u201d That\u2019s what the American people are saying.\n\nWe have to understand what the stakes are that we are playing for.\n\nDo we create an economy that works for the middle class and working people?\n\nDo we create a political system where everybody is empowered?\n\nOr do we create an oligarchic system, where the billionaire class not only controls the economy, but they control the political life of this country?\n\nThat is the struggle we are engaged in. Nothing less than that.\n\nI know that in Wisconsin and in Vermont and all over this country, people politically are feeling under the weather. They are dispirited. They are discouraged.\n\nBut do not ever forget that real change does not come easily. People have fought and died year after year, decade after decade for human rights and dignity.\n\nLet me just give you a few examples that we take for granted, although we should not.\n\nIf we were here together thirty years ago and someone stood up and said, \u201cYou know, I think thirty years from now, the United States of America will overcome its racism and elect an African American President, and reelect him,\u201d nobody would have believed it was possible. People would have said, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Racism is too deeply embedded in our culture.\u201d Well, the United States overcame that racism and elected an African American President.\n\nAnd that is something we should be very proud of. It didn\u2019t happen easily. People died, went to jail, to help us overcome racism.\n\nWe still have a long way to go. But no one can doubt that we have come a long way.\n\nIn terms of women\u2019s rights, twenty-five years ago there were two women in the United States Senate. Today there are twenty, and in fifteen years half the Senate will be women.\n\nTake disability rights. When I was growing up, kids with disabilities were shunted aside as somewhat less than human. They weren\u2019t in public schools. They were in institutions. And people fought very hard to say no, people with disabilities are human beings. They\u2019ve got to be integrated into our society.\n\nAnd again, we take it for granted.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, forget thirty years ago, forget twenty years ago, if ten years ago we were standing here and we were saying that conservative states in America would vote for gay marriage, you would have thought we were crazy.\n\nAnd yet that\u2019s exactly what is happening.\n\nIn many respects, because of your efforts, we have made some very profound changes in making this nation a significantly less discriminatory nation. And we should be proud.\n\nToday we are up against something a little bit different and little bit harder. Today we are taking on a billionaire class that wants to move us into an oligarchic form of society where they have all of the power.\n\nAnd this is not an easy fight. They have huge resources. They have think tanks. They have media. You name it, they\u2019ve got it.\n\nBut there is one thing they don\u2019t have. While they have unlimited sums of money, what we have is the people\n\nAnd if we can overcome some of our differences, we can focus on the broad issues facing America: jobs, health care, education, the environment, the needs of children. And on these issues, believe it or not, we are a united nation.\n\nSo let us reach out to our brothers and our sisters, fellow workers, fellow family members, and let us create a movement that tells Washington: We are not asking you, we are telling you.\n\nChange will take place in America not through some backroom negotiations.\n\nChange takes place in America when millions of people demand it.\n\nLet\u2019s say it together. Let\u2019s make that change. Thank you all, very much.\n\nBernie Sanders is the Independent U.S. Senator from Vermont.
