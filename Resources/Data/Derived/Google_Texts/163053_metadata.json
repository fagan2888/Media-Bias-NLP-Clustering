Most of the proposals are drawing criticism from their fellow conservatives behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a couple lines in an op-ed. Who knows what it really means? In some of those, they may not know, frankly,\u201d said one conservative strategist and former Hill healthcare staffer.\n\nCreating even a temporary solution for ObamaCare subsidies is a huge dilemma for the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nSome Republicans have even said, albeit quietly, that the party could be better off if the administration\u2019s policy survives the Supreme Court challenge.\n\n\u201cThen we won\u2019t be put into a really difficult spot and can move on. There is something really appealing about that,\u201d one GOP Senate aide said.\n\nAs a matter of political reality, no GOP fallback plan can appear to extend \u2014 or even sign off on \u2014 ObamaCare in any way. Any bill that would put Republicans on the record upholding the Affordable Care Act would be untenable.\n\nInstead, many in the party believe their best hope is in finding a temporary \u201cbridge\u201d away from ObamaCare.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) pitched a plan this week that would create 18 months of tax credits under a Reagan-era law called COBRA, intended for people who unexpectedly lose their jobs.\n\nThe credits would not be called \u201csubsidies\u201d but would serve much the same purpose.\n\nSasse said the debate over ObamaCare subsidies should not turn into a debate over how to replace the whole law. He said such an overall approach would have to wait until at least after the 2016 elections.\n\n\u201cI absolutely think there\u2019s an imperative that we would act,\u201d Sasse said in an interview. \u201cThe national conversation of replacement needs to happen, but we need a Republican nominee to carry the mantle.\u201d\n\nThe debate over subsidies is even more complex because so many unknowns still surround the court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn its last decision on ObamaCare, the Supreme Court created a whole new set of rules that neither party had expected. Many believe the same thing could happen again.\n\n\u201cWe can't really say, \u2018This is the definitive answer,\u2019 when we don't know what the Supreme Court's going to do, and they're not going to do anything for another three and a half months, probably,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said.\n\nDemocrats have dismissed any new GOP strategies as attempts to sway the court. But that\u2019s a strategy that their members are also trying.\n\nThis week, several Democratic members, as well as White House press secretary Josh Earnest, have tried to highlight Congress's recent logjams, such the near-shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security this month, as proof that any decision that depended upon subsequent action on Capitol Hill would be fraught with danger.\n\nRepublicans have answered the criticism with more attacks against the Obama administration, which continues to argue that it has \"no plans\" that could address the massive disruption if the subsidies are erased.\n\n\"While the administration has no alternative, Republicans are discussing thoughtful solutions to help middle-class families and give them more control over their health care. We owe that to all those who have been hurt by this nightmare of a law,\u201d Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) wrote in a statement after the arguments.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Party ponders how to avert chaos if subsidies are struck down.", "description": "Party ponders how to avert chaos if subsidies are struck down.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Party ponders how to avert chaos if subsidies are struck down.", "title": "GOP braces for ObamaCare win", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/234941-even-if-scotus-rules-its-way-gop-faces-obamacare-dilemma", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/kingvburwellscotus_030415gn4.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-07T19:57:07-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-07T19:57-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/234941-even-if-scotus-rules-its-way-gop-faces-obamacare-dilemma", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-07T11:45-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Niall Stanage", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "ObamaCare, Affordable Care Act, Supreme Court,Ben Sasse, Antonin Scalia,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-07T11:45:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-07T19:57:07-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/234941-even-if-scotus-rules-its-way-gop-faces-obamacare-dilemma", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Party ponders how to avert chaos if subsidies are struck down.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP braces for ObamaCare win"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP braces for ObamaCare win"}, "article_summary": "Sasse said the debate over ObamaCare subsidies should not turn into a debate over how to replace the whole law.\nCreating even a temporary solution for ObamaCare subsidies is a huge dilemma for the GOP-controlled Congress.\nIn its last decision on ObamaCare, the Supreme Court created a whole new set of rules that neither party had expected.\nAs a matter of political reality, no GOP fallback plan can appear to extend \u2014 or even sign off on \u2014 ObamaCare in any way.\nRepublicans are under pressure to prove they can avert a massive healthcare meltdown if the party wins its latest ObamaCare battle in the Supreme Court this spring."}
