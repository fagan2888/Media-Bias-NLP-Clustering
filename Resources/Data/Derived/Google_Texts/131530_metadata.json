DAVID McKINLEY: I haven\u2019t heard one of you apologize to the American public. [\u2026] Are apologies not in order? [\u2026] I\u2019ve just, I\u2019ve not heard the word, I\u2019m sorry. [\u2026] Apologize. [\u2026] I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s not an apology. [\u2026] But, I apologize. I haven\u2019t heard that from any one of the four of you.\n\nBILL MOYERS: He got it.\n\nMARILYN TAVENNER: I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should.\n\nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS: You deserve better. I apologize.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Considerate, appropriate, and futile. The apology didn\u2019t squelch the partisan tirades or quench the Republican thirst for revenge, their outrage that the Affordable Care Act, that is, ObamaCare, even got this far. But it did provoke some of us to wonder, isn\u2019t it fair to also expect at least a tiny bit of remorse, just a morsel of apology, from the Republicans? As NPR\u2019s astute health care reporter Julie Rovner reminded us recently.\n\nJULIE ROVNER:: When it became clear that HHS would need more money to build the federal exchange than had been allocated in the original law, Republicans in Congress refused to provide it.\n\nBILL MOYERS: So to get it started, officials had to scrape together money from a variety of other offices. This happened back in the thirties after congress passed Social Security but failed to sufficiently fund the board that was supposed to run it. Republican opponents of ObamaCare have gone further. After it passed they stalked it like Jack the ripper.\n\nIn the states, through the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court, which, uh-oh, ruled it constitutional. In last year\u2019s election, when they lost again. But quit? Never. For Republicans, this has become their Alamo.\n\nIn July, less than three months before scheduled launch, the speaker of the House, Republican John Boehner, drew one more line in the sand.\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER:: ObamaCare is bad for America. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure that it never happens.\n\nBILL MOYERS: And yet, the darn thing survived, despite the administration\u2019s own serious very mistakes. As Rovner reported, Obama\u2019s people naively figured Republican states couldn\u2019t resist all that cash coming down from the federal government and would decide to create their own insurance exchanges and expand their Medicaid programs.\n\nNot so. Republicans, it seems, have their principles, and health care for poor people is not one of them. Ideology trumped money.\n\nRepublicans aside, ObamaCare had its own built-in problem, born of original sin. And some of us have to resist the temptation to say, \u201cWe told you so!\u201d Four years ago we said the public option in health care, a kind of Medicare for all, would be easier to launch and simpler to operate than the Rube Goldberg contraption that came to be known as ObamaCare. Rube Goldberg, for those of you under a certain age, was the fellow who designed machines that made simple tasks much more complicated.\n\nBack in 2009, when Obama first became president, polls showed the public option was a popular idea. Lots of Americans were fed up with paying bloated premiums to giant insurance companies that charged us for their plutocratic salaries and excessive profit margins. We wanted an alternative. And once upon a time, so did candidate Barack Obama.\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA:: Now, if I were designing a healthcare system from scratch, I would probably move more in the direction of a single payer plan.\n\nBILL MOYERS: But as President, Obama buckled when conservative Senate Democrats, yes, Democrats, threatened to join Republicans in a filibuster if his plan included a public option.\n\nSEN. BLANCHE LINCOLN:: --that I\u2019m prepared to move against moving to the next stage of consideration as long as a government run public option is included.\n\nBILL MOYERS: The biggest pill among those corporate Democrats was industry lapdog Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. At one point Baucus even had advocates thrown out of his hearings:\n\nSEN. MAX BAUCUS:: I\u2019m sorry. There will be order. Can we have a recess until order can be restored.\n\nADVOCATE:: --want a single payer system. Why do you insist on spending more money when the single payer will give it to us at the price we\u2019re spending now?\n\nBILL MOYERS: Still, ObamaCare made its way through the gauntlet of mercenary senators, predatory lobbyists, and greedy corporations to become law.\n\nRube Goldberg would have been a very happy man. His principle, why do something simple when it can always be made harder, carried the day. And by the time it became law the Affordable Care Act was a monstrosity of complexity.\n\nSure enough, on opening day, what the Republicans couldn\u2019t accomplish happened anyway. Screens froze. Error messages flew. Data was corrupted. The system broke down, and ObamaCare stalled at the starting gate.\n\nSupporters gaped at the wreckage of their best-laid plans, opponents gloated, and Republicans, of course, called hearings, which any opposition party would have done. But you must note the irony here, the party that had thrown roadblock after roadblock wherever they could and had just shut the government down to stop health care reform, now loudly complained that government wasn\u2019t working and people couldn\u2019t get, you guessed it, health care reform.\n\nREP. DAVID McKINLEY:: Apologize. [\u2026] Apologize [\u2026] An apology.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Ok, Representative McKinley, you got it. But wouldn\u2019t a little humility would be in order here? Democracy is imperfect, and we need to work with what we\u2019ve got. And what we\u2019ve got is the Affordable Care Act. We also need to remember that at the outset, big ventures often go awry. Not just in the public sector. Remember when Apple introduced the iPhone4 in June of 2010?\n\nSTEVE JOBS:: We\u2019re having a little problem here.\n\nBILL MOYERS: Steve Jobs couldn\u2019t get it to connect to the internet. Embarrassing, but they worked it out. When Facebook went public last year a \u201ctechnical error\u201d in NASDAQ\u2019s system delayed the start of trading, resulting in a loss to market makers of half a billion dollars.\n\nAnd those of you old enough to know who Rube Goldberg was may recall the rollout of the Edsel, a Ford motor company automobile so awful its name still is synonymous with a costly flop.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not talk about Lehman brothers, Bear Stearns, AIG, JPMorgan Chase. The crash of \u201908. Beside those calamities, ObamaCare\u2019s computer problems pale.\n\nOh, yes, mistakes are made by big corporations and big government. And although I was for something else, something simpler and easier to manage, I\u2019m betting this will get fixed.\n\nAs for those strident partisan voices crowing over ObamaCare\u2019s first bad round, ask yourself if those weren\u2019t some of the same voices cheering on the invasion of Iraq and promising victory would be swift and easy. Ten years. Trillions of dollars. And all those lost and wrecked lives.
