In the process, she said, she developed familial relationships not only with her MOW co-workers, but with clients to whom she delivers hot lunches twice a week.\n\nThis is not at all unusual, according to Lisa Gilliland, who worked as Meals on Wheels assistant director for 16 years before being promoted to executive director one year ago.\n\nQuite often, noted Gilliland, volunteers delivering meals may be a client\u2019s only human contact.\n\nWhat many in the general public fail to realize, says Gilliland, is that Lubbock\u2019s Meals on Wheels receives no funding whatsoever by United Way or any government agencies. Rather, MOW depends on individual and business donations and on fundraisers.\n\nLubbock\u2019s Meals on Wheel debuted more than four decades ago, in 1971, with a small group of board members, staff and volunteers delivering weekday meals to 29 recipients.\n\nToday, more than 1,200 volunteers help Lubbock\u2019s Meals on Wheels serve more than 700 weekday meals on 53 routes. In addition, 180 weekend meals are delivered in advance to those who have no access via friends or family members.\n\nGilliland added that many studies show people fare better residing in their own homes rather than in hospitals or nursing facilities. Meals on Wheels, she said, focuses on helping \u201cthe homebound, elderly and disabled,\u201d with recipients ranging in age from 21 to a person \u201cwho is 105 years old and living alone at home.\u201d\n\nSchmidt, who is better known to co-workers and clients as \u201cConny,\u201d said, \u201cWhen people in Lubbock were immediately so friendly in helping us get settled, I wanted to do something to give back to the community. We moved here two years ago, and 18 months ago I called Meals on Wheels and volunteered.\u201d\n\nSimilar programs exist in Germany, said Schmidt, the difference being that sometimes volunteers are thought to have \u201ctoo much time on their hands.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWhereas here, when people see you are a volunteer, they say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s great.\u2019 You feel appreciated.\u201d\n\nShe delivers meals on Mondays and Fridays. Gilliland and her assistant director, Mary Gerlach, added that Schmidt also helps prepare weekend meal sacks and volunteers for fundraisers.\n\n\u201cTo just deliver the meals takes about an hour,\u201d says the volunteer. \u201cIt takes me a little longer. I like to talk to the people a bit. Often, you are the only person they will see all day, and the smiles on their faces show you are bringing a great pleasure to them.\u201d\n\nMeals on Wheels is not just about the meat and two servings of fruit or vegetables. Schmidt loves delivering flowers that \u201cbrighten their weekends.\u201d\n\nOne of her favorite things to do is deliver cakes on her clients\u2019 birthdays. \u201cThen I sing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 twice,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce in English and once in German.\u201d\n\nClients appear equally happy. Tuesday was Barbara Berry\u2019s 55th birthday, and she said MOW treats her like family.\n\nShe left a nursing home and began dialysis on March 8, 2013. She already had lost her vision.\n\n\u201cI have always been very independent,\u201d said Berry. \u201cMOW made it that much easier for me. I could not have made it without them. And it\u2019s not just the food. Spiritually, they make me smile. I like the flowers and inspirational quotes.\u201d\n\nShe spends most of each day \u201clistening to TV or talking on the phone,\u201d and looks forward to each visit from MOW.\n\n\u201cEven if I have a bad dialysis day, they will say something positive and try to cheer me up.\u201d\n\nBerry and James Weideman, 61, said they had no trouble being accepted by MOW.\n\nWeideman explained that he broke his neck in a fall, which \u201ccaused further back and mobility problems.\u201d\n\nReturning home made him more relaxed and reduced his stress, he said, adding that people convinced him to call MOW because his bachelor ways would not result in nutritious, balanced meals.\n\nHis food arrives within a 15-minute range each day, but Weideman added, \u201cI suppose one of my great joys is someone taking the time to talk to me. I don\u2019t have many visitors.\u201d\n\nMeals on Wheels also recognizes that pets are \u201cvaluable companions\u201d and delivers pet food every two weeks for 165 dogs and 98 cats.\n\nEverything from flowers and bakery items to pet food and reading material is donated.\n\nMeanwhile, Schmidt concluded that volunteering for Meals on Wheels \u201cis the best decision I ever made.\u201d\n\nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8712\n\nFollow William on Twitter\n\n@AJ_WilliamKerns", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, William Kerns", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Meals on Wheels also supplies pet food, flowers, birthday cakes, magazines", "title": "Meals on Wheels, volunteers, recipients enjoy family relationship", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2014-11-29/meals-wheels-volunteers-recipients-enjoy-family-relationship", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/13928444.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Cornelia Schmidt became a Meals on Wheels volunteer shortly after moving with her husband from Germany to Lubbock in 2013.
