The network aired Obama\u2019s picks for the men\u2019s tournament on Wednesday, and will show his women\u2019s picks on Thursday. \u201cBaracketology,\u201d as ESPN has named the exercise, is, for the President\u2019s admirers, another example of Obama\u2019s deft use of popular culture to connect with his fellow-citizens and advance policy goals. Last year, for instance, he encouraged young people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. On Wednesday, he talked about a White House initiative, It\u2019s On Us, to bring attention to the problem of sexual assaults on college campuses.\n\nFor his critics, meanwhile, this annual event is evidence of Obama\u2019s disregard for his more serious duties. Last year at this time, Fox News ran the banner \u201c OBAMA PICKS NCAA BRACKET WHILE PUTIN DECLARES CRIMEA AS PART OF RUSSIA \u201d\u2014the idea being that the President\u2019s ten minutes on ESPN were an example of Nero fiddling (in this case, with his five-twelve upset picks) while Rome burned. This year, on Twitter, there has been more of the same, with people wondering how the President has time for brackets but can\u2019t disarm Iran, defeat ISIS , etc. (Liberals, meanwhile, have complained that his picks are too conservative\u2014too few upsets, with the heavy favorite, Kentucky, pegged to win it all.) All this, of course, is familiar bunk: partisan pundits are often torn between claiming that an opposition President is doing too much work or else too little, depending on the issue. Obama\u2019s interest in sports has been, to the right, what George W. Bush\u2019s brush-clearing was to the left\u2014annoying mostly because of the qualities of the person who is doing it.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s status as a genuine, \u201cSportsCenter\u201d-watching fan has been one of the defining characteristics of his public persona. When he fills out his bracket, he offers enough commentary about a team or particular player to remind viewers that he knows what he\u2019s talking about\u2014ready, this year, to praise both the greatness of Kentucky and the defensive toughness of the mostly unknown University at Buffalo (Obama\u2019s upset special). Coming from the Fan-in-Chief, Obama\u2019s comments on sports during his years in the White House have carried special weight. When another famous sports fan, Richard Nixon, was President, he used to call the coach of the Washington Redskins, badgering him with unsolicited, and mostly unheeded, advice. But, when Obama talks about sports, people listen. He is credited, at least in part, with pushing college football to adopt a playoff system, and last year hosted a summit on concussions at which he said that schools needed to do more to protect their players.\n\nLast March, Obama used his bracket segment to comment on the wider state of college sports. After being asked by ESPN\u2019s Andy Katz about the large number of so-called one-and-done players, who leave college after their freshman year for the pros, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge young people, if they\u2019ve got an opportunity to look after their family, to go ahead and get an N.B.A. contract and then go back to school, hopefully, and get their degree.\u201d He continued, \u201cBut, for a lot of the average kids who are not going to be able to get a pro career, are those schools making sure that they\u2019re actually getting a good education, that they\u2019re actually getting a degree, that, if they get injured, their scholarships stick with them? Those are the kinds of things that I\u2019d like to see the N.C.A.A. address.\u201d\n\nObama was not calling for radical reform of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s amateur model; he didn\u2019t say, as many others have argued, that men\u2019s basketball players, for instance, should be treated as employees and paid some fair share of the millions of dollars that March Madness generates every year. But it was notable that, during what is essentially a celebration of college sports, he took a moment to be critical of its administration. Largely, he was calling for reforms that had already been under discussion. In January, a consortium of schools that is made up of the five major athletic conferences (the A.C.C., the Big 12, the Big Ten, the S.E.C., and the PAC -12), acting independently of the N.C.A.A., voted to allow its members to supplement the value of athletic scholarships with a \u201ccost of attendance\u201d stipend. It also passed a rule guaranteeing athletic scholarships for four years, regardless of a student\u2019s athletic performance. (These rules, for now, only cover the five major conferences, and do not extend to many of the smaller schools in this year\u2019s tournament.)\n\nYet, despite this incremental progress, the past year has been a troubling and fractious one for college sports. Last year\u2019s men\u2019s championship team, the University of Connecticut, was coming off a postseason ban because of years of single-digit graduation rates; its star player, Shabazz Napier, told reporters that he often didn\u2019t have enough money while in school to pay for food. Syracuse is currently serving a self-imposed postseason ban for its own academic improprieties. The N.C.A.A. is currently investigating twenty schools, including the University of North Carolina (this year\u2019s No. 4 seed in the West), for academic misconduct, which calls into question the very value of the athletic scholarships that the N.C.A.A. touts as, essentially, priceless. And, in August, a federal judge named Claudia Wilken challenged the entire amateur model, ruling that the N.C.A.A. had been artificially restraining trade by capping what schools could pay their student athletes in revenue sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. Oral arguments in the N.C.A.A.\u2019s appeal began this week.\n\nWhen Obama told Andy Katz this week, \u201cI am in favor of the N.C.A.A. changing the rules,\u201d it seemed, after such a year, that he was about to announce further demands for reform. But it turned out that the President wasn\u2019t talking about academic priorities or economic fairness. He was talking about the shot clock. College games, he argued, should be more like those in the pros, with a shorter short clock and, therefore, more possessions and more offense. He\u2019s right, but this, in political terms, is a decidedly small ask.\n\nPerhaps, however, it is unrealistic to have expected much more. March Madness is, for better and worse, one of the things that passes for common culture in America. Sometimes even the President of the United States just wants to be a fan and fill out a bracket.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "Barack Obama filled out his college-basketball tournament brackets, but had little to say about a troubling year for the N.C.A.A.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Coming from the Fan-in-Chief, Obama\u2019s comments on sports during his years in the White House have carried special weight.", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Bracket - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Crouch-Obama-2015-Bracket-1200-630.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-03-19T13:02:28-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-state-of-the-bracket", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Coming from the Fan-in-Chief, Obama\u2019s comments on sports during his years in the White House have carried special weight.", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Bracket - The New Yorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Crouch-Obama-2015-Bracket-1200-630.jpg", "creator": "@iancrouch", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3014082\",\"title_alt\":\"The State of the Bracket\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/03\\/Crouch-Obama-2015-Bracket-728-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "article": {"section": "The Sporting Scene", "tag": "Sports", "published_time": "2015-03-18T18:29:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-19T13:02:28-04:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3014082, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Bracketology, College Basketball, March Madness, National Collegiate Athletic Association (N.C.A.A.), Sports"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff6e\"", "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s status as a genuine, \u201cSportsCenter\u201d-watching fan has been one of the defining characteristics of his public persona.\nThe network aired Obama\u2019s picks for the men\u2019s tournament on Wednesday, and will show his women\u2019s picks on Thursday.\nIt also passed a rule guaranteeing athletic scholarships for four years, regardless of a student\u2019s athletic performance.\nThis week, in what has become one of his semi-official annual duties as President, Barack Obama filled out his college-basketball brackets in taped segments for ESPN.\nSometimes even the President of the United States just wants to be a fan and fill out a bracket."}
