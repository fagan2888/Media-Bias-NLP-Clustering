GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Cuba could be a spring training destination once more.

Major League Baseball is considering playing future spring exhibition games on the island nation and baseball hotbed, which used to routinely host American teams in the days before Fidel Castro came to power.

Baseball players’ association president Tony Clark said Saturday there have been “ongoing” discussions about playing in Cuba, which recently renewed diplomatic ties with the United States. Clark said there were conversations about Cuba hosting games this spring, but there wasn’t enough time to finalize details.

“We weren’t able to put those pieces in play this go-around,” Clark said following his annual union meeting with the Cleveland Indians. “It is conceivable somewhere down the road that there may be a spring training game played in Cuba, but it’s hard to tell when at this point in time.”

The Baltimore Orioles played a spring exhibition in Havana against the Cuban national team in 1999, ending a 40-year gap since the last visit by a major league team.

Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and ’50s. The Cincinnati Reds had a Triple-A affiliate on the island, the Havana Sugar Kings.

Cuba and the U.S. have a long-time connection through baseball. Several Cuban-born players, including former stars Luis Tiant, Jose Canseco and Orlando “El Duque” Hernandez, as well as current players such as Yasiel Puig, Yoenis Cespedes and Jose Abreu, have thrived on MLB teams. Last season, 19 Cuban-born players were on major league rosters.
