Still, if the weather\u2019s bad \u201cand somebody absolutely has to be seen,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get over to their house and take a look at them.\u201d\n\n(Robi Bowman of Stevens Community Medical Center)\n\nB\u00f6sl, 66, is part of a vanishing breed\u2014the small-town physician who treats children, parents, and grandparents from the same family and knows all his patients by name.\n\nEvery weekday morning, B\u00f6sl wakes up at 5 a.m. and drives 20 miles to the nearest hospital to do his morning rounds. Then he makes the long drive back home and treats patients all day, sometimes into the evening hours. It\u2019s a grueling routine, but B\u00f6sl, a highly decorated Vietnam war veteran, says he feels a deep commitment to the residents of Starbuck, a tiny Minnesota town (population: 1,302) nestled against Lake Minnewaska.\n\nB\u00f6sl has been the only doctor in town since 1982, and in 2005, when the local hospital shut down, he took out a loan on his home and invested his life savings to build a modern clinic to ensure Starbuck\u2019s residents would still have local care.\n\nThanks to his selfless dedication to his community, B\u00f6sl has been named StaffCare\u2019s 2013 Country Doctor of the Year, an award that recognizes the \u201cspirit, skill, and dedication of America\u2019s rural medical practitioners\u201d in communities of 30,000 or less.\n\nDr. B\u00f6sl spoke with Parade.com about the most rewarding parts of his job, what it\u2019s like treating close friends and family (he delivered three of his own grandchildren), and the future of country physicians in America.\n\nYou invested your life\u2019s savings to build your clinic. Why was it so important to you to have a local clinic in Starbuck?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those emotional things. It was a decision made through my gut\u2026[I said], if we don\u2019t have a clinic in town here, there\u2019s a lot of Medicare patients here and a lot of them do have difficulty getting out, especially in winter time. They don\u2019t want to go to the big city with 3,000 people in it; they\u2019d just as soon get care locally\u2026Could I have retired and gone golfing instead or something? Could I have just gone to any number of communities? Sure I could have, but it was just kind of an emotional commitment to the community to continue to have health care here.\u201d\n\nGeneral practitioners are in decline around the country as more doctors enter more lucrative specialized fields. At any point, were you tempted to go that route instead of staying local?\n\n\u201cSuper specialization tends to be more financially lucrative but professionally, it wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative. I was not motivated by dollars as much as some of those higher moral things about helping society. Also\u2026I think mental challenges of family medicine are just so much more than in any other profession\u2026and I think some physicians are kind of scared off by that. I know one orthopedist in the area who was a family doc for three years and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t know it all. I\u2019m just not smart enough to know all this.\u2019 So he went back and did an orthopedic residency. I never really thought about that\u2026in the end I decided I needed to make my major focus taking care of patients.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the most rewarding part of your job?\n\n\u201cThe most rewarding part is just helping patients to a better level of health. If someone has pneumonia, I give them antibiotics\u2026But if they have pneumonia and I know it\u2019s related to the fact that they\u2019re a smoker or that they\u2019re overweight, I\u2019m going to try to address the lifestyle changes that can decrease their risk of illness in the future. Sometimes it\u2019s just small steps.\u201d\n\n(Robi Bowman of Stevens Community Medical Center)\n\nIs it true you once had five generations of patients admitted to the hospital at the same time?\n\n\u201cI had mom who delivered a baby, and then the baby\u2019s grandma was in the hospital with heart problems. The baby\u2019s great-grandma was in with a respiratory problem, and then the great-great-grandma was in with some heart problems. She was in her 90s.\u201d\n\nIs it ever a challenge to separate personal relationships with patients from their treatment?\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t felt it that way\u2026That\u2019s always been one of the concerns of medicine, that if you\u2019re too close to somebody, that it might affect your thinking. Personally, I took out the tonsils of two of my kids, and I actually delivered three of my grandkids. I have such a close relationship with so many of my patients. I mean, they\u2019re people I see on the street every day, or I play basketball with them or I golf with them. I think if anything, [because of] that close personal relationship, I get to know who they are as an individual, what their values are, and I try to tailor how I treat them with who they are as an individual.\u201d\n\nSince you began practicing in Starbuck, have the town\u2019s demographics changed?\n\n\u201cWhen I first went into practice, I was delivering 20 or more babies a year, even in a small community. Now, that\u2019s more like four or five. It has just become a more Medicare-populated community, and a lot of that has to do with changes in agriculture. Thirty years ago, everybody used to have a 160-acre farm, and they\u2019d milk the cows. Now, I can drive 20 miles to the hospital and not see a Holstein cow. The farms have become more soybean and corn farms, and instead of 160 acres, it\u2019s more like 5,000 or 10,000 acres. So in a rural area, or just outside town, the population has really thinned out.\u201d\n\n(Robi Bowman of Stevens Community Medical Center)\n\nLooking down the road a few decades, where do you see the future of the rural doctor in the U.S.?\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still a great demand. The population here is aging. Often there are many chronic problems and they do need to be seen more frequently. Getting medical students into family medicine is very challenging, and some people aren\u2019t up to that challenge. The ultimate income a physician has is perhaps less. But I think above and beyond all that, the frustrating parts of medicine are worse in family medicine. Insurance companies are looking over your shoulder to see if the doctor is doing everything right. \u2018Are you treating diabetes like you\u2019re supposed to, are you telling them to quit smoking?\u2019 In family medicine, a typical doc may see 20 patients in a day and unfortunately, up to half of those, you\u2019re going to hear from insurance companies about, you know, \u2018Why did you pick this pill, why didn\u2019t you pick a cheaper pill?\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking of insurance, has the Affordable Care Act been a hot topic in your community recently?\n\n\u201cIt has\u2026In a lot of ways, it probably doesn\u2019t affect my practice a lot because there are a lot of people already on Medicare or medical assistance, Medicaid. [But] there\u2019s one family in particular I\u2019m thinking of in which both parents are self-employed and they have applied for Obamacare. They\u2019re going pay less than $200 a month for a family of five for some pretty good insurance. So for them, it\u2019s going to work out really well.\u201d\n\nAnything to add about being named Country Doctor of the Year?\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve done a good job, but really I could not have done it without my wife\u2014my wife is also a nurse\u2014and without the support of the staff of the clinic and the hospital, and without the community support. The community is a very caring community. There\u2019s a lot of serving, let\u2019s put it that way, where community members really do all they can to make life better for other people. And in that kind of environment, I\u2019ve been really fortunate. It\u2019s been really easy to dedicate the hours I do to everybody\u2019s health care.\u201d\n\nIf the president invited you to the White House because of this award\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026we could talk about [Obamacare]. But\u2026I think I\u2019d be more interested in just playing him one-on-one in basketball. Because even though I\u2019m 20 years older, I think I could still beat him!\u201d\n\nPhotos: A Day in the Life of a Country Doctor", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "doctors, health care, medicine, Rural America", "author": "Lindsay Lowe", "og": {"url": "http://parade.com/246747/linzlowe/country-doctor-of-the-year-robert-bsl-i-was-not-motivated-by-dollars/", "site_name": "Parade", "image": "http://static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/dr-bosl-small-town-doc-ftr.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Country Doctor of the Year Robert B\u00f6sl: 'I Was Not Motivated by Dollars'"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Robert B\u00f6sl doesn\u2019t make as many house calls as he used to.
