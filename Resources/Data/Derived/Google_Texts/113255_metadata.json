I viewed him as an example of a skillful young pol who, through adept political maneuvering, was heading straight for the top.\n\nLately, young Marco has shown himself to be the Incredible Shrinking Presidential Candidate. His so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d stance on immigration created ideological purity problems for him with his base, so he double-crossed his own legislation to get himself back in their good graces. Lately, he\u2019s taken to gay bashing with the social conservatives \u2014 pretty tone-deaf, considering the general public has already moved on regarding this topic.\n\nClearly, Marco\u2019s flailing. If you want proof, let\u2019s examine his latest attack on Obamacare. He\u2019s introducing a bill in the Senate to require background checks on ACA \u201cnavigators,\u201d the idea being that they can\u2019t be trusted with the ID stats of the would-be health insurance customers they\u2019re supposed to help \u2014 that is, if these customers could even log on to the system, but that\u2019s a separate issue.\n\nHere\u2019s why Marco\u2019s latest initiative is a cynical move: The Florida Legislature, in one of its several pieces of legislation designed to make it as difficult as possible for Obamacare to succeed, already passed a law requiring background checks for navigators.\n\nSince it\u2019s no longer an issue in his home state, this means that Marco is either introducing his bill out of the kindness of his heart for states that don\u2019t already have the requirement, or he\u2019s just polishing his cred with the craz\u2014 excuse me, the most committed 2016 Republican presidential primary voters.\n\nHere\u2019s Marco\u2019s problem: No matter how much pandering he may do between now and then, primary voters still have noses \u2014 and they can smell a rank opportunist coming all the way from Miami.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Marco Rubio, Rubio, Obamacare, ACA, navigators, background checks, senate, Florida, senator, Republican, Florida legislature, Chan Lowe", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "I used to have a lot more respect for Marco Rubio.
