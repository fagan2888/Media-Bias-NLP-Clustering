Dan Schmidt said he\u2019s giving up his state-paid health insurance because the state provides no health coverage for its working poor.\n\n\u201cI have state taxpayer-funded health insurance, because I am a state legislator,\u201d said Schmidt, a Democrat and physician from Moscow. \u201cI get that benefit, and this Legislature can\u2019t give that benefit to 78,000 Idahoans who can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said expanding Idaho\u2019s Medicaid program would cover that \u201cgap\u201d group. It\u2019s a step that 32 states have taken under the Affordable Care Act, but one Idaho and 18 other states have resisted because of their dislike of the plan they call Obamacare. In Idaho, expanding Medicaid would save state taxpayers tens of millions of dollars without increasing the federal taxes they\u2019re already paying.\n\nThe House Health and Welfare Committee announced Thursday that it will consider a new proposal to address the gap population on Monday.\n\nThe House committee voted to pull two proposed bills from its agenda and consider the issue again Monday. One would have launched a study committee; the other a \u201chealth care data collection grant program\u201d to provide a block grant of, say, $5 million to Idaho\u2019s community health centers next year to enhance services to people in the gap population and collect data on how many are out there.\n\nRep. Kelley Packer, R-McCammon, urged the committee, \u201cLet\u2019s quit throwing money at non-solutions, let\u2019s quit studying this \u2026 (and) hopefully do the right thing on Monday.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said he and his wife don\u2019t have any other medical coverage. He called the state plan he was giving up \u201cvery, very generous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to go buy (insurance),\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that I get the taxpayers of Idaho to buy me health insurance, and we\u2019re not willing to look at that problem for our other citizens who don\u2019t have that benefit. To me, that\u2019s something we should be doing.\u201d\n\nSchmidt introduced legislation this year to enact the \u201cHealthy Idaho\u201d plan, which was developed by a task force appointed by Gov. Butch Otter. It would accept millions in federal Medicaid expansion funds, and use them to cover more low-income residents, and to buy private insurance for those who have slightly higher incomes but still make too little to afford insurance. The bill got a hearing in the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, but no vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love it if they\u2019ve got some proposals that will solve this problem,\u201d Schmidt added. \u201cTo me, our state has a problem \u2013 we have a lot of low-income folks working minimum-wage jobs, tough for them to get health insurance. We can solve this problem and save the taxpayer a bunch of money, and shame on us for not solving it.\u201d\n\nGOP members of the House committee said Thursday morning that they don\u2019t want to let Idaho\u2019s legislative session end without doing something for the Idahoans in the coverage gap.\n\n\u201cI think we all want to get something accomplished,\u201d said Rep. Eric Redman, R-Athol.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
