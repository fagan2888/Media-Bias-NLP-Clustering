Unsurprisingly, the organization refused to cooperate with the film\u2019s directors. Sheila Nevins, president of HBO Documentary Films told the Hollywood Reporter that the network had 160 lawyers look at the film due to fears of backlash from the church (which some consider a cult). Her concern is well-founded given that Scientology has always used fear tactics to squash critics.\n\nThe Church\u2019s modus operandi stems from a policy called \u201cfair game,\u201d which states: An enemy of Scientology, referred to as a suppressive person (SP), \u201cmay be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\u201d\n\nBack in the day before the Internet publicized the secrets of Planet Xenu, Scientology relied on lawsuits to intimidate its detractors. Between 1991 and 1996, John Travolta\u2019s religion filed more than 50 lawsuits against the Cult Awareness Network (CAN),eventually forcing it into bankruptcy. The Church then bought its name and assets in bankruptcy proceedings and used CAN as the title of an unrelated organization.\n\nThese tactics trickle down from L. Ron Hubbard. In a 1966 policy letter, the author and founder of Scientology instructed his followers on the proper procedure for handling investigations.\n\n1. Spot who is attacking us.\n\n2. Start investigating them promptly for FELONIES or worse using own professionals, not outside agencies.\n\n3. Double curve our reply by saying we welcome an investigation of them.\n\n4. Start feeding lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence on the attackers to the press.\n\n5. Don\u2019t ever tamely submit to an investigation of us. Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way.\n\nVicki Aznaran, a former church leader, stated in an affidavit that: \u201cthroughout my presidency of RTC, fair game actions against enemies were commonplace. In addition to the litigation tactics described below, fair game activities included burglaries, assaults, disruptions of enemies\u2019 businesses, spying, harassive [sic] investigations, abuse of confidential communications in parishioner files and so on.\u201d\n\nAs Aznaran\u2019s testimony suggests, the organization routinely uses legal action and its immense financial resources to harass and cause professional ruin. We can only imagine what its reaction will be to HBO\u2019s Going Clear. Until then, here is a brief history of some of the shocking fear tactics the church has used against its critics.\n\n1. Scientology vs. South Park\n\nIn the classic 2005 South Park episode \u201cTrapped in a Closet,\u201d creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker take on Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and the entire philosophy behind the Planet Xenu cult. The South Park creators became targets of Corporate Scientology\u2019s OSA Operations as they attempted to squash the episode and ruin the creative duo. The results of their investigation, which involved extensive surveillance of Stone and Parker, were leaked to the Village Voice. Through informants, private investigators, and public records, the organization searched for \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in the pair\u2019s personal and business lives.\n\nScientologist Isaac Hayes, who played the character Chef on the show, promptly quit over the controversy. In his parting statement, Hayes said, \u201cThere is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices.\u201d\n\nIn true South Park fashion, Matt and Trey responded by brutally killing off Hayes\u2019 character.\n\n2. Scientology vs. Los Angeles Times\n\nIn 1990, Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos wrote a groundbreaking series on Scientology for the Los Angeles Times . After the series appeared, the church struck back. The Sea Org-ers purchased space on 120 billboards and 1,000 bus placards around Los Angeles, publishing ads featuring the journalists\u2019 bylines, the newspaper\u2019s name, and context-free quotes from their articles that made it seem as if their series was actually endorsing Scientology.\n\nOn a personal front, private investigators were hired by the church to obtain Sappell and Welkos\u2019 financial records, phone records, and other data. Welkos received an envelope at his home from a mortuary; inside was a brochure trumpeting the benefits of arranging your funeral before you die that read, \u201cInvestigate the pre-arrangement program at our memorial park now. You\u2019ll be glad you did, and so will your family.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawsuits, smear campaigns and death threats are just a few of the tactics its members have been known to employ", "title": "6 insane ways the Church of Scientology has tried to silence its critics", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lawsuits, smear campaigns and death threats are just a few of the tactics its members have been known to employ", "title": "6 insane ways the Church of Scientology has tried to silence its critics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/15/6_insane_ways_the_church_of_scientology_has_tried_to_silence_its_critics_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_175398272.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawsuits, smear campaigns and death threats are just a few of the tactics its members have been known to employ", "title": "6 insane ways the Church of Scientology has tried to silence its critics", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_175398272.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Harmon Leon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Celebrity, Church of Scientology, going clear, Hollywood, Religion, Scientology, South Park, Tom Cruise", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Celebrity, Church of Scientology, going clear, Hollywood, Religion, Scientology, South Park, Tom Cruise, Entertainment News, NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe HBO documentary Going Clear, an investigation inside the Church of Scientology, premieres on March 29.\nThe South Park creators became targets of Corporate Scientology\u2019s OSA Operations as they attempted to squash the episode and ruin the creative duo.\nUntil then, here is a brief history of some of the shocking fear tactics the church has used against its critics.\nHer concern is well-founded given that Scientology has always used fear tactics to squash critics.\nScientology vs. Los Angeles TimesIn 1990, Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos wrote a groundbreaking series on Scientology for the Los Angeles Times ."}
