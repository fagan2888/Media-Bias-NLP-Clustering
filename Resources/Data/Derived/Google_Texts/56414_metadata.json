Bobby Jindal\u2019s name is not first on most people\u2019s list of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, but maybe we should at least start paying attention to him. If one\u2019s political enemies are any indication of potential strength, Jindal of Louisiana may be a more formidable force than some people realize.\n\nDuring a visit to Washington Monday, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank couldn\u2019t wait to attack Jindal and his record. Why bother with someone he and others consider a lightweight from a small Southern state, unless there is more there than the elites think?\n\nIn an interview with me, Jindal gave long and rapid-fire answers. The governor, ineligible for re-election due to term limits, seemed in a hurry. He said he\u2019d decide in \u201ctwo to three months\u201d whether to run for president.\n\nIn January 2009, when I interviewed Jindal in his office in Baton Rouge, just days before President Obama\u2019s inauguration, the governor told me Republicans must decide what they are for before picking a presidential candidate. How\u2019s that going?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing better,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have more work to do.\u201d He thinks Republicans should stop attacking Obamacare and start emphasizing what they would replace it with. He also faults members of his party for running against Obamacare in the last election and then \u201cthrowing in the towel and saying, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t really repeal tax increases; you can\u2019t really undo an entitlement program.\u2019\u201d\n\nJindal wants Republicans to get away from defining themselves as anti-Obama and the party of \u201cno\u201d and start showing people \u201cwe can be principled, conservative, not just a cheaper version of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nWhat about Hillary Clinton? Can she be defeated if she runs?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says a confident Jindal, as if he were coaching a team against a superior opponent. \u201cAs Republicans we don\u2019t need to obsess about our opponents, we don\u2019t need to define ourselves in opposition to our opponents. Let (Democrats) look backward; we need to look forward.\u201d\n\nHe says voters want the hard truth told to them, which immediately brings to mind the oft-quoted Jack Nicholson line from \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d: \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d In the age that obsesses with cultural embarrassments like the Kardashian family, the truth \u2014 if we can agree on what that is \u2014 may be the last thing people want to hear. But Jindal\u2019s sentiment is a noble one.\n\nI ask him about the potential candidacy of former former-Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, and Jindal adopts Reagan\u2019s \u201c11th Commandment\u201d admonition never to criticize a fellow Republican: \u201cAnybody who is thinking about running doesn\u2019t need to define himself against particular candidates. We need to say what we are for.\u201d While Jindal says he \u201chas a lot of respect\u201d for Bush, who once championed Common Core federal education standards. Jindal, however, opposes it. He adds he doesn\u2019t want to see \u201cthe establishment, the party donors, trying to clear the field for anybody. An open debate is good for the voters.\u201d\n\nOn foreign policy, he and former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) have written a paper on the subject. Among other things, he wants to arm the Kurds in their fight against ISIS in Iraq and demonstrate to our allies America\u2019s resolve to support them in any fight against the Islamic State, support he thinks is lacking under the Obama administration. He would also send arms to the Ukrainian military now fighting Russian troops.\n\nOn social issues, Jindal, a Roman Catholic, says: \u201cI\u2019m not changing my position on marriage or protecting human life. I know it\u2019s fashionable for a lot of politicians to change their minds\u2026\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what the polls say on this. I\u2019m not evolving with the polls.\u201d\n\nJindal is a long shot for president and even vice president, but he brings enthusiasm, a positive outlook and a decent record as governor and that\u2019s not a bad start for any presidential candidate.\n\nCal Thomas is a syndicated columnist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor Jindal of Louisiana may be a more formidable force than some people realize.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Governor Jindal of Louisiana may be a more formidable force than some people realize.", "title": "CAL THOMAS: Bobby Jindal for president?", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/11/cal-thomas-bobby-jindal-president/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/09/jindal-educationjpeg-04500.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/09/jindal-educationjpeg-04500.jpg", "description": "Governor Jindal of Louisiana may be a more formidable force than some people realize.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "CAL THOMAS: Bobby Jindal for president?"}, "Author": "Cal Thomas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Bobby Jindal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdee3\"", "article_summary": "During a visit to Washington Monday, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank couldn\u2019t wait to attack Jindal and his record.\nJeb Bush of Florida, and Jindal adopts Reagan\u2019s \u201c11th Commandment\u201d admonition never to criticize a fellow Republican: \u201cAnybody who is thinking about running doesn\u2019t need to define himself against particular candidates.\nIf one\u2019s political enemies are any indication of potential strength, Jindal of Louisiana may be a more formidable force than some people realize.\nOn social issues, Jindal, a Roman Catholic, says: \u201cI\u2019m not changing my position on marriage or protecting human life.\n\u201cAs Republicans we don\u2019t need to obsess about our opponents, we don\u2019t need to define ourselves in opposition to our opponents."}
