For the past two years, headlines have heralded Narcan — the seemingly miracle antidote used to revive thousands of heroin overdose victims across New Jersey.

Camden County residents interested in learning about the drug are invited to register for free training sessions coming up this July and August. Those who successfully complete the training will receive a free naloxone kit.

Credentialed addiction counselors and licensed nurses will lead the hands-on training sessions of small groups in a confidential setting. Trainings will be limited to 20 participants on a pre-registration basis and are open to the public.

Dates and locations are as follows:

- Tuesday, July 14:

St. Charles Borromeo Parish

176 Stagecoach Road, Sicklerville

- Tuesday, July 21:

Center For Family Services Living Proof Recovery Center, second floor

108 Somerdale Road, Voorhees

Information regarding treatment options will also be available at the meeting.

The Overdose Prevention Act allows doctors to prescribe Narcan — the brand name variant of naloxone — to those "in a position to help someone else during an overdose of heroin or other opioids," according to information from organziers.

Further, the act eliminates civil and criminal liability to anyone who administers naloxone.

To register, call Urban Treatment Associates, Inc at (856) 225-0505.
