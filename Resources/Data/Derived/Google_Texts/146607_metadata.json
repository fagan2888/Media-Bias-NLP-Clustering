Elena Parent (D-Atlanta) said.\n\nWiseman is now an advocate for clean air. She is like the proverbial canary in the coal mine because on a code orange day, she is the first to feel the effects of air pollution.\n\nHer asthma got so bad she could not participate in any sports like running or swimming. She has a five year-old cousin who was diagnosed with asthma at birth.\n\nIt is known that carbon pollution drives warmer temperatures and climate change, while enhancing conditions for dangerous ground level ozone formation and particle pollution, or smog, that can cause asthma attacks, breathing problems, and premature deaths.\n\n\u201cMore than eighty percent of the current health burden occurs in children under the age of five years, causing decreased lung function, which can be permanent\u2026 Asthma is still the number one reason for admission to inpatient service and emergency room at Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta,\u201d Laura Turner Seydel, Chair of Mothers and Others for Clean Air, said.\n\n\u201cIn our fight for clean air, we promote expanding the use of renewable energy, energy conservation, energy efficiency, and advancing cleaner and more efficient transportation choices, like mass transit,\u201d Turner said.\n\nMothers and Others for Clean Air and their parent organization, the American Lung Association; and other national organizations that include the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Associations, National Association of County Health Officials, and others have all joined together to stand firm against polluters who want to block the CPP.\n\nJohn Noel, a former Georgia House Representative and President of Energy Plus Environment, supports the CPP.\n\nHe has traveled to Germany and Asia and has seen how other countries don\u2019t waste energy, the way many in the U.S. waste energy.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s climate action plan will help make America great again and energy efficient. But there is one company that does not like it,\u201d Noel said, pointing over his shoulder in the direction of Georgia Power.\n\n\u201cPeople say this is a war on coal; so what? You mean the war to clean up the air so Mikayla\u2019s asthma gets better, or the war to stop cooking the planet? You mean that war? Bring it on,\u201d Noel said.\n\nNoel suggests thinking smarter and more efficiently, like having smart controls that turn off things just a little during peak load hours or when you are out of the house.\n\n\u201cWe have an energy policy based on dirty fuel that is based on 18th century technology. That is an economy that is gone and is not coming back. We need a policy that represents the new economy that is clean and serves us in the 21th century. Renewables are better for our health, our economy, and national security,\u201d State Rep. Scott Holcomb (D-Atlanta) said.\n\nOther countries are taking action to address climate change, as Holcomb observed during his time overseas.\n\n\u201cYet, we have political leaders who deny it [climate change]. We need to get rid of them and get thoughtful people moving this country forward,\u201d Holcomb said.\n\n\u201cSo much work and money has been put in deepening the port in Savannah and rising sea levels will imperil that investment for our state. On that basis alone, we should be moving forward on the CPP to keep the sea levels where they are and not imperil our Southeastern port system in the United States,\u201d Parent said to the crowd.\n\n\u201cThere has been some action to pass a resolution to delay the EPA\u2019s action and to bolster the economy we currently have based on dirty energy and pollution that harms us all. I call on my colleagues to see the benefits for Georgia with our growing solar markets and our ports and move forward,\u201d Parent said.\n\n\u201cI want to give a shout out to my colleagues in the General Assembly who passed HB 57. HB 57 takes some of the shackles off of further growth of the solar market in Georgia. That is an industry that is poised to grow and that means jobs,\u201d Parent said.\n\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2015/04/02/georgia-legislature-approves-solar-power-financing-bill/\n\n\u201cWe are in need of environmental justice. We fear nothing because we are the advocates of social change that are called to justice to restore the communities,\u201d Rev. William E. Flippin, Jr., Third Vice President, Georgia Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said.\n\nDevastating health effects from air pollution and environmental toxins disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color.\n\n\u201cWe are at Liberty Plaza to seek freedom. Freedom from human-caused extreme weather, freedom from polluted environments, dirty water, coal fired plants, fracking caused earthquakes in Kansas and Oklahoma. Everybody has a right to clean air, clean water and a pollution free environment, that\u2019s a civil right,\u201d Rev. Gerald Durley, Ret. Senior Pastor, Providence Missionary Baptist Church, said.\n\n\u201cThank you President Obama, thank you Pope Francis, thank you Environmental Protection Agency\u2026 the moral voice of the people will be heard, we will not be silenced,\u201d Rev. Durley said, as he ended the rally with loud applause of agreement.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Everybody has a right to clean air, clean water and a pollution free environment, that\u2019s a civil right,\u201d Rev.\n\u201cIn our fight for clean air, we promote expanding the use of renewable energy, energy conservation, energy efficiency, and advancing cleaner and more efficient transportation choices, like mass transit,\u201d Turner said.\nWiseman is now an advocate for clean air.\nShe is like the proverbial canary in the coal mine because on a code orange day, she is the first to feel the effects of air pollution.\nThe CPP established the first national standards to limit carbon pollution from power plants and encourages clean renewables like solar and wind."}
