The initiative would put at risk up to $1 billion annually in federal funding to schools, and may put at risk an additional $3.5 billion annually in funding to state and local government entities, according to a new analysis conducted by the Williams Institute.\n\n\n\nThe study analyzes the potential fiscal impact on Washington as a result of conflicts between Initiative 1515 and seven federal laws: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Executive Order 13672, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act, the Violence Against Women Act, the Affordable Care Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Housing Act of 1949. Funding provided through the laws supports schools, workforce development programs, law enforcement, health care programs, housing assistance, and programs for survivors of violence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe non-discrimination requirements in these federal laws protect transgender people from discrimination, including by allowing them to use restrooms and other facilities that correspond to their gender identity,\u201d said Amira Hasenbush, Jim Kepner Law and Policy Fellow at the Williams Institute. \u201cFederal agencies that enforce these laws are authorized to suspend or terminate funds if recipients violate the non-discrimination requirements.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition, Washington will incur the costs of administrative enforcement actions and litigation arising from the law.\n\n\n\nThe potential fiscal impact of the law includes:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Loss of federal educational funding of up to $1 billion annually to K-12 schools, and up to $3.3 billion annually to public colleges and universities as a result of Title IX violations;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Loss of federal contracts to state and local government entities of an estimated $80 million to $130 million annually as a result of Executive Order 13672 violations;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Loss of federal funding to support workforce development programs of up to $65 million annually;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Loss of federal grants authorized by the Violence Against Women Act of an estimated $2.5 million or more annually;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Loss of federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a result of Affordable Care Act violations;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Loss of federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a result of Affordable Care Act violations;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Costs incurred as a result of litigation and federal administrative enforcement under Title IX, Executive Order 13672, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the Violence Against Women Act, the Affordable Care Act, Title VII, and the Housing Act.\n\n\n\nClick here for the full report.
