Examiner\n\nMore than half of the children in southern Chinatown experienced tooth decay in 2013-14, down from 64 percent in 2011-12.\n\nTooth decay rates among kindergarteners have decreased nearly threefold over the past seven years in every San Francisco ZIP code \u2014 except one that includes part of Chinatown.\n\nCity health officials and community service providers are pushing a plan to close the gap.\n\nZIP code 94108, which includes the southern portion of Chinatown, had 53 percent of kindergarteners living there report they experienced tooth decay during the 2013-14 school year, the highest percentage in The City, according to data from the San Francisco Unified School District\u2019s Kindergarten Oral Health Screening Program, analyzed by the Department of Public Health. In addition, the northern portion of the neighborhood, included in ZIP code 94133, had the fourth highest level of tooth decay at 45 percent. The citywide average for the 2013-14 period was 30 percent.\n\nStill, the tooth decay rate in southern Chinatown is down from a seven-year high of 64 percent in 2011-12, likely because an increasing number of people in the Chinese community are utilizing DentiCal, said Lisa Chung, an associate clinical professor at UC San Francisco\u2019s School of Dentistry.\n\nHowever, the percentage in southern Chinatown hasn\u2019t improved since the data was first tracked in 2007-08, when tooth decay was 52 percent. The percentage decreased in every other San Francisco ZIP code, with more than a 10 percent dip in the Mission, Sunset and Inner Richmond.\n\nTo address the disparity, the San Francisco Children\u2019s Oral Health Collaborative \u2014 made up of city, community, university and school district members and medical and dental providers \u2014 recently kicked off a series of community stakeholder meetings in Chinatown to inform, raise awareness and gather feedback on children\u2019s oral health.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest effort from a three-year strategic plan, the collaborative kicked off in November to drive down cavity rates citywide, particularly among ethnic groups affected disproportionately.\n\n\u201cParticularly in new immigrant families, Chinese may carry over their traditional beliefs and cultural practices, which might include seeking care only when needed, which is often too late, and overlooking the importance of preventive care,\u201d Chung said. \u201cOne example is not considering baby teeth as important.\u201d\n\nBut Yong Heng Situ and Mei Hong Situ, who immigrated from Kaiping, China and live in Potrero Hill, said difficulty accessing a dentist \u2014 not a lack of education \u2014 has contributed to the 10 cavities their 7-year-old daughter, Doris, has had. Last week, as a dentist at North East Medical Services, a nonprofit community health center on Stockton Street, applied sealant to protect Doris\u2019 teeth, her mother Mei Hong Situ explained that would have her daughter rinse her mouth with saltwater when she had a toothache.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what Chinese people do so it doesn\u2019t hurt too much,\u201d Mei Hong Situ said in Cantonese. \u201cWhen we know it\u2019s a problem, then we come to the dentist, but sometimes it takes a month to get an appointment.\u201d Doris\u2019 father, Yong Heng Situ, added that they chose North East Medical Services because it is the cleanest health center serving the Cantonese-speaking population, but that they often can\u2019t book an appointment earlier than one month out.\n\n\u201cThe longer it takes, the more the decay builds up,\u201d he said in Cantonese. The Affordable Care Act providing more dental access to children, combined with DentiCal returning for adults last May, \u201chas put a lot more stress and demand on clinics that accept DentiCal, which are limited,\u201d Chung said. The collaborative\u2019s access team is working on how health centers might provide preventive dental care at sites frequented by children and families, like Head Start preschools. They\u2019re also looking at how those centers can bill and be reimbursed for the work at nontraditional sites outside of a dental office. The actual services would begin no sooner than the fall.\n\nAn integration team is also working with the San Francisco Health Network to develop and implement protective fluoride varnish procedures at all the primary care clinics in the network. The service is slated to begin at the Chinatown Public Health Center early next year.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "Tooth decay rates among kindergarteners have decreased nearly threefold over the past seven years in every San Francisco ZIP code \u2014 except one that includes...", "title": "Tooth decay still high among Chinatown kindergartners | Neighborhoods | San Francisco | San Francisco Examiner", "og": {"site_name": "The San Francisco Examiner", "description": "Tooth decay rates among kindergarteners have decreased nearly threefold over the past seven years in every San Francisco ZIP code \u2014 except one that includes...", "title": "Tooth decay still high among Chinatown kindergartners", "url": "http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/tooth-decay-still-high-among-chinatown-kindergartners/Content?oid=2930108", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media1.fdncms.com/sfexaminer/imager/more-than-half-of-the-children-in-southern/u/slideshow/2930109/front_dental0515.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media1.fdncms.com/sfexaminer/imager/more-than-half-of-the-children-in-southern/u/slideshow/2930109/front_dental0515.jpg"}, "title": "Tooth decay still high among Chinatown kindergartners", "description": "Tooth decay rates among kindergarteners have decreased nearly threefold over the past seven years in every San Francisco ZIP code \u2014 except one that includes...", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JessicaGKwong"}, "oid": 2930108, "fb": {"app_id": 429095550477057}, "keywords": "David Campos, housing, evictions, San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Airbnb, short term rentals, housing crisis, Breaking News, Bay Area", "thumbnail": "http://media1.fdncms.com/sfexaminer/imager/more-than-half-of-the-children-in-southern/u/slideshow/2930109/front_dental0515.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "david campos, housing, evictions, san francisco board of supervisors, airbnb, short term rentals, housing crisis, breaking news, bay area"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7ed\"", "article_summary": "ExaminerMore than half of the children in southern Chinatown experienced tooth decay in 2013-14, down from 64 percent in 2011-12.\nHowever, the percentage in southern Chinatown hasn\u2019t improved since the data was first tracked in 2007-08, when tooth decay was 52 percent.\nIn addition, the northern portion of the neighborhood, included in ZIP code 94133, had the fourth highest level of tooth decay at 45 percent.\nTooth decay rates among kindergarteners have decreased nearly threefold over the past seven years in every San Francisco ZIP code \u2014 except one that includes part of Chinatown.\nThe percentage decreased in every other San Francisco ZIP code, with more than a 10 percent dip in the Mission, Sunset and Inner Richmond."}
