Both the Weston Democratic Town Committee and Weston Republican Town Committee were invited to submit a

commentary of up to 500 words for the Oct. 30 edition of The Weston Forum discussing their party’s slate and its advantages.

Please remember to vote, Tuesday, Nov. 4. And, exercise one of your most valued rights!

The gubernatorial race is going to be close, so by voting you’ll ensure the candidate of your choice gets elected, not someone else’s.

Our current Democratic administration, headed by Malloy and Wyman, have made a great deal of progress undoing the problems created by prior GOP administrations, to give us a better Connecticut.

We can’t allow those moves forward to be reversed by electing those who desire to do just that.

We will be back in a deficit position, robbing Peter to pay Paul.

We will no longer have the strongest gun law to protect our children.

We will not have a new, higher minimum wage — first in the U.S.

We will not have a GMO law.

We will not have a gay marriage law.

We will not be supporting early childhood education.

We will not have the U.S. model for the Affordable Care Act.

We will not have the ability to fund our pension program.

We will no longer have a rainy day fund.

We will no longer be building our own “Silicon Valley” for the biotech industry.

We will no longer be creating jobs.

These are only a few laws you would no longer have …

Gov. Malloy never promised that he would not raise taxes, as his opponent continues to insist upon.

As President Clinton did when facing the largest deficit the U.S. had ever had, he asked us to all tighten our belts; he cut some “pork” and he raised taxes. But afterwards, we had no deficit; in fact, we had a surplus.

This is exactly the same position in which Gov. Malloy found himself. But, like Clinton, he needs four more years to give Connecticut the considerable economic growth and expansion it deserves.
