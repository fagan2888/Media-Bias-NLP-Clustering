Former Obama chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel lost part of his right middle finger when an infection developed after he cut it on a meat slicer and delayed seeking medical attention. According to Emanuel, that is an example of why Americans should #GetCovered by Obamacare, or something:

@BarackObama, the Twitter account run by Organizing for Action, passed along Emanuel’s tweet:

Always to the point. MT @ChicagosMayor: Because #LifeHappens. #GetCoveredNow. Deadline is 3/31 pic.twitter.com/lWFpTtCdWs — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) March 19, 2014

It’s somehow fitting given the fact that they are pitching a law that’s figuratively costing America an arm and a leg.
