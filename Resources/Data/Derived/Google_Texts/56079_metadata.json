The stage set even splits in two at one point, when Peter Pan shows the Darling children how to fly.\n\nIt turns out that \u201cflying\u201d can take a lot out of a person, as Allison Williams said that the strenuous activity involved in learning to move and act convincingly when strapped into a harness meant she could enjoy a diet of \u201ceverything sinful and it\u2019s never enough to keep me fueled,\u201d according to Williams.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Williams called flying in a harness \u201ca total rush.\u201d However, one drawback that she mentioned is that you can \u201cget saddle sore\u201d being in the harness for too long.\n\nAllison Williams, 26, has stated that she has wanted to play Peter Pan from the time she was just a little girl. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Williams had Fallon show a photo of her as a girl dressed up as Pan.\n\nOne of the many cool facts behind the making of Peter Pan Live! is that Allison Williams dedicated the production to the late Robin Williams. He starred as an adult version of Peter in the movie, Hook, trying to reclaim his stolen children from Captain Hook (1991).\n\nTinkerbell will be a small puppet within a light, controlled virtually. She will be controlled \u201cvirtually like a marionette,\u201d said one of the people behind the creation of Tinkerbell on the show.\n\nThe musical production will be narrated by an adult version of Wendy Darling, played by Minnie Driver. Peter, in the musical, wants the younger Wendy (Taylor Louderman) to act as a sort of surrogate mother to the Lost Boys of Never Never Land, telling them stories and treating them tenderly.\n\nChristopher Walken will be playing the notorious villain, Captain Hook. He has had plenty of previous Broadway experience and has played more than his share of villains in past movie roles. He has already been called \u201cthe dancing-est Captain Hook ever,\u201d as he will be dancing quite a lot in the production. The Making of Peter Pan Live! show on NBC showed Walken practicing his sword-fighting skills, singing, dancing, and talking about how Captain Hook got his hand replaced by a hook when a crocodile bit it off.\n\nThere was even an extra song added to Peter Pan Live! called Vengeance that Christopher Walken will sing. Of Christopher Walken, Allison Williams called him \u201cdeeply cool,\u201d and she also said that Walken was \u201cbetter at acting than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Christopher Walken will be on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon later tonight.\n\nNana the dog will be played by an actual dog, Brody. He was trained to respond to certain words, and the scenes involving his training were interesting to watch. In the 1959 Mary Martin Broadway version of Peter Pan, Nana was played by a person dressed up in a shaggy dog costume.\n\nOn December 4, Peter Pan Live! will be on NBC, and it promises to be a Must See TV experience for people of all ages. Also, NBC has an updated sitcom in the planning stages based on the story of Peter Pan.\n\nHow does Peter Pan fly? Well, it takes a little faith, some fairy dust\u2026and a harness and diet of donuts and bagels, apparently. The Making of Peter Pan Live! on NBC was fascinating, and showed a lot of secrets behind the production of Peter Pan Live!. Be sure to watch the live musical production when it airs on NBC on December 4.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nSources:\n\nEntertainment Tonight\n\nDigital Spy UK\n\nBroadway World\n\nHook IMDb\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "On the MAKING OF PETER PAN LIVE! on NBC on Wednesday, November 26, several secrets behind the production of Peter Pan Live! were revealed, like how Peter (Allison Williams) flies, how the dog who p\u2026", "title": "How Does Peter Pan Fly?", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2014/11/how-does-peter-pan-fly/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NUP_166285_1006-e1417057917778.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-27T03:12:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-27T03:14:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dimarkco.chandler"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NUP_166285_1006-e1417057917778.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NRSTGeeks"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_Entertainment": "Peter Pan, Making of Peter Pan, Peter Pan Live, NBC, How Does Peter Pan Fly?, Allison Williams, Christopher Walken"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde5c\"", "article_summary": "The stage set even splits in two at one point, when Peter Pan shows the Darling children how to fly.\nHow does Peter Pan fly?\nThere was even an extra song added to Peter Pan Live!\nThe Making of Peter Pan Live!\nOn December 4, Peter Pan Live!"}
