The deal followed a $6.8 billion merger on Thursday between smaller insurers Health Net and Centene and comes after Cigna and Anthem have acknowledged talking about a merger that could value the combined company at as much as $85 billion. Analysts think industry leader UnitedHealth Group could be on the prowl by next year for targets, including Molina Healthcare or Well Care Health Plans, strong niche players in Medicare and Medicaid markets.\n\nThe deals will boost acquirers' profits sharply, Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. She estimates that Anthem would get $1.6 billion in annual synergies by 2018 from buying Cigna, and Aetna could get $1.25 billion in 2018 savings from merging with Humana. Even after debt payments that could reach $1.3 billion a year on Anthem/Cigna, the surviving company would make a profit of $19.28 a share that year, 36 percent higher than existing estimates for Anthem of $14.15. Profits next year will be 11 percent higher if that merger happens, as cost-cutting gets under way, she estimates.\n\nRead MoreHealth-care takeover targets\n\n\n\n\"The Big Five will be a Big Three,\" said Gupte, who estimated public companies led by Anthem/Cigna, Aetna/Humana and United would command about a third of the U.S. health-care market, with regional players and government programs covering most of the rest.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The Aetna and Humana tie-up promises to impact consumers, hospitals and doctors as the companies look for ways to cut costs and boost profits.", "author": "Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The Aetna and Humana tie-up promises to impact consumers, hospitals and doctors as the companies look for ways to cut costs.", "title": "The $37B merger that can affect your health", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/06/obamacare-sparks-health-insurance-megamergers.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/25/102789130-Untitled-2.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Aetna and Humana tie-up promises to impact consumers, hospitals and doctors as the companies look for ways to cut costs.", "title": "Obamacare sparks health insurance megamergers", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/06/obamacare-sparks-health-insurance-megamergers.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/25/102789130-Untitled-2.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@timmullaney", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Sectornomics Health Care, Sectornomics, Special Reports, Obamacare, Aetna Inc, Humana Inc, Cigna Corp, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-07-06T10:30:15-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Sectornomics Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T11:56:55-0400", "tag": "Cigna Corp"}, "pageNodeId": 102811310, "news_keywords": "Aetna, Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, insurance mergers, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Profits next year will be 11 percent higher if that merger happens, as cost-cutting gets under way, she estimates.\nAetna paid a 23 percent premium to acquire Louisville-based Humana, the smallest of the Big Five.\nThe deal followed a $6.8 billion merger on Thursday between smaller insurers Health Net and Centene and comes after Cigna and Anthem have acknowledged talking about a merger that could value the combined company at as much as $85 billion.\nAnalysts think industry leader UnitedHealth Group could be on the prowl by next year for targets, including Molina Healthcare or Well Care Health Plans, strong niche players in Medicare and Medicaid markets.\nShe estimates that Anthem would get $1.6 billion in annual synergies by 2018 from buying Cigna, and Aetna could get $1.25 billion in 2018 savings from merging with Humana."}
