It\u2019s easier to use energy from cooked food than raw, so pre-modern humans who dabbled in roasting had the energy surplus they needed to develop better brains, not to mention the time to sit around and think deep thoughts with them.\n\nAccording to a study in the Quarterly Review of Biology, cooked meat and veggies shouldn\u2019t get all the credit. Without carbohydrates, it argues, the switch to cooked food wouldn\u2019t have packed nearly as big of a punch.\n\nFor starters, scientists generally believe that meat and cooking were totally integral to human evolution. To survive on a plant-based diet, especially a raw one, without the aid of modern conveniences like grocery stores and refrigeration, a human would have to spend pretty much all his or her time finding food.\n\nSo it\u2019s not news that cooking is important in an evolutionary sense. But based on this study, those set on a \u201cpaleo\u201d diet might want to make sure they\u2019re not cutting out too many carbs.\n\nThe researchers, led by Karen Hardy of the University of York and the Autonomous University of Barcelona, basically argue that the human brain relies heavily on glucose and that a lack of carbs makes it hard to keep your brain satisfied. That\u2019s true: When your body\u2019s glucose stores are low, your brain starts to look for energy from other sources. The results are less than ideal.\n\nThe researchers also point out that humans have around three times as many copies of the gene used to make the enzyme that turns carbs into simple sugars \u2014 salivary amylase \u2014 as other primates do. Based on genetic analysis, they say, this adaptation cropped up around 1 million years ago.\n\nThe spread of cooking is thought to have started around 2 million years ago, or perhaps a bit later. It would make sense, the researchers argue, if the genetic adaptation that made us efficient carb eaters cropped up after a few generations of cooking. Infants whose mothers had more access to glucose from cooked carbs would have had higher survival rates, and carbs may have played a part in the boost in brain size seen about 800,000 years ago.\n\nThe hypothesis doesn\u2019t sound too wild, though researchers will certainly have to do more work putting together the archaeological and genetic evidence. But it\u2019s worth considering as you decide what \u201cunnatural\u201d foods to cut from your diet \u2014 if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into.\n\nAll that being said, it\u2019s important to remember that a roasted potato is very different from, say, a giant bowl of pasta. One may have led us to bigger brains, but the other is probably leading us to bigger bellies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/09/1003411963-FL_SAR_HFNUTRI01.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Infants whose mothers had more access to glucose from cooked carbs would have had higher survival rates, and carbs may have played a part in the boost in brain size seen about 800,000 years ago.\nThe researchers, led by Karen Hardy of the University of York and the Autonomous University of Barcelona, basically argue that the human brain relies heavily on glucose and that a lack of carbs makes it hard to keep your brain satisfied.\nThat\u2019s true: When your body\u2019s glucose stores are low, your brain starts to look for energy from other sources.\nWithout carbohydrates, it argues, the switch to cooked food wouldn\u2019t have packed nearly as big of a punch.\nThe hypothesis doesn\u2019t sound too wild, though researchers will certainly have to do more work putting together the archaeological and genetic evidence."}
