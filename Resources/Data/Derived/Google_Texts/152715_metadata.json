But in recent years, the state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care \u2014 which oversees health insurance \u2014 has approved a handful of plans that exclude coverage for \u201celective\u201d abortions. That is, abortions that aren\u2019t necessary to protect the health of the mother.\n\nThose insurance-plan approvals occurred quietly, with little public attention. Until last year, when officials at two Catholic universities, Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, told faculty and staff that the schools would now only cover abortions that are \u201cmedically necessary\u201d for the mother\u2019s health. State officials had approved those insurance plans.\n\nThe decision surprised and angered hundreds of Santa Clara faculty members, who tried and failed earlier this year to get the school\u2019s Board of Trustees to reverse the decision. And it also appeared to reverse decades of legal precedent in California. Now, officials from the Department of Managed Health Care say they\u2019re going back and reviewing the policy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe question is, are abortions chosen by a woman with the approval of her doctor medically necessary?\u201d said Bob Egelko, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter who\u2019s been following the story. \u201cUntil pretty recently it was assumed by insurers that they were.\u201d\n\nAnti-abortion groups, such as the Life Legal Defense Foundation, maintain that abortions by choice are not necessary.\n\n\u2018California law has treated all abortions chosen by the woman as within her rights and \u2026 until now.\u2019\n\nCalifornia is known for having strong reproductive rights protections. In 1972, the state Supreme Court struck down a law that allowed abortions only to prevent serious physical harm to a woman, not abortions chosen for any other reason.\n\n\u201cThe court said that standard is vague and violates women\u2019s rights,\u201d Egelko said. \u201cSo ever since then California law has treated all abortions chosen by the woman as within her rights and \u2026 as medically necessary. It\u2019s pretty much been taken for granted up until now.\u201d\n\nAnd a 1975 state law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Services Plan Act, required health plans to cover all medically necessary procedures.\n\nWhen Anthem Blue Cross applied in 2008 to offer a plan for religious institutions that excluded \u201celective\u201d abortions, however, the state approved it. Officials approved a Kaiser Permanente plan with a similar exclusion in 2012; that plan is available to any employer with an objection to abortion, religious or not.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really explain themselves,\u201d Egelko said of state regulators.\n\nCalifornia Lawyer magazine, which first reported on the universities\u2019 changes in June, spells out the legal complexity of the matter:\n\nDespite the public perception of clear state constitutional and statutory protections for abortion in California, private insurance law has a muddier history. \u2026 Members of group health plans elsewhere in California may soon find themselves as surprised as [Santa Clara University faculty] to learn how weak protections for access to abortion have become under the state\u2019s health insurance regulators. Knox-Keene spells out the basic health services that insurers must provide to meet medical standards of care. Significantly, the statute contains no religious exception for eliminating abortion access.\n\nSanta Clara University\u2019s new plan doesn\u2019t go into effect until next year. Loyola\u2019s is already in effect, but there\u2019s a provision for employees to pay extra for abortion coverage through a private plan.\n\nMeanwhile, nationwide, more than 100 universities and other nonprofit institutions are suing the Obama administration over a birth control conflict that MSNBC called \u201cthe next Hobby Lobby.\u201d In short, the federal government created an opt-out form that religious institutions can sign to certify their opposition to contraception; then their insurers directly cover contraceptive costs, taking the employer out of the equation. The employers stay that still results in contraception and thus impinges on their religious liberty, so they\u2019re suing.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when California officials will announce whether they\u2019ll allow the plans limiting abortion coverage to go on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not clear when California officials will announce whether they'll allow the plans limiting abortion coverage to go on.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"State Reconsiders Letting Catholic Universities Limit Abortion Coverage\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/12\\/california-reconsiders-letting-catholic-universities-limit-abortion-coverage\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-12 10:00:53\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-15 05:15:02\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20668,\"author_id\":\"8586\",\"author_name\":\"Grace Rubenstein\",\"author_display_name\":\"Grace Rubenstein\",\"tags\":[\"Abortion\",\"health insurance\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/31868593_c758da9bbf_z-e1412295722294.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "It's not clear when California officials will announce whether they'll allow the plans limiting abortion coverage to go on.", "title": "State Reconsiders Letting Catholic Universities Limit Abortion Coverage", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/12/california-reconsiders-letting-catholic-universities-limit-abortion-coverage/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/31868593_c758da9bbf_z.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "abortion,health insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By Grace Rubenstein and Mina KimState officials are reviewing whether they made the right call when they approved health plans that limit abortion coverage.\nIt\u2019s not clear when California officials will announce whether they\u2019ll allow the plans limiting abortion coverage to go on.\nCalifornia law has strongly protected abortion rights for decades.\nState officials had approved those insurance plans.\nIt\u2019s pretty much been taken for granted up until now.\u201dAnd a 1975 state law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Services Plan Act, required health plans to cover all medically necessary procedures."}
