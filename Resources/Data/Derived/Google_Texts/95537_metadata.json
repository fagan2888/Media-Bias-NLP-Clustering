President Obama has been vying for federal action on early education since his 2013 State of the Union address when he called on Congress to expand access to high quality preschool to all American kids. He made a similar call in 2014 and has repeatedly requested funding for his 10-year, $75 billion program that would boost early ed options for low and middle income 4 year olds. Yet, while early education is largely a non-partisan issue, Congress can\u2019t agree on how best to approach it.\n\nCurrently, less than a third of 4-year-olds are enrolled in a state funded preschool program, according to the National Institute of Early Education Research. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development says the U.S. ranks 28th out of 38 countries in 4-year-old preschool enrollment.\n\nOn a press call Tuesday, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan called providing access to quality early education \u201cthe most important single step we can take as a nation to secure a bright future for our nation\u2019s children.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration is also joining with companies, philanthropists and business owners who have made commitments to early education totaling $333 million through the launch of a new campaign called Invest in Us. The campaign, developed in partnership with the early learning advocacy group First Five Years Fund, is aimed at getting more private sector folks investing in early education.\n\nSo far, money has come from Lego, Disney and the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cInvest in Us partners believe that achieving the promise of a better nation can only be accomplished when we all contribute toward building programs that build strong children starting at birth,\u201d said Kris Perry, executive director of First Five Years Fund on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The White House will announce more than $1 billion in grants from private and public sources for early education Wednesday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The White House will announce more than $1 billion in grants from private and public sources for early education Wednesday.", "title": "White House Announces $1 Billion in Early Education Funding", "url": "http://time.com/3626983/white-house-education-grants/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/ap350530211014.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/ap350530211014.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "White House Announces $1 Billion in Early Education Funding", "description": "The White House will announce more than $1 billion in grants from private and public sources for early education Wednesday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "education, white house", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "White House, education, Obama, early ed, preschool head start, head start program"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9fb\"", "article_summary": "Wednesday is set to be a $1 billion day for early education, with the White House announcing major investments in expanding education access for America\u2019s youngest.\nThe campaign, developed in partnership with the early learning advocacy group First Five Years Fund, is aimed at getting more private sector folks investing in early education.\nYet, while early education is largely a non-partisan issue, Congress can\u2019t agree on how best to approach it.\nCurrently, less than a third of 4-year-olds are enrolled in a state funded preschool program, according to the National Institute of Early Education Research.\nSenior administration officials said Wednesday early education has long been a priority of the President\u2019s, given the impact a strong start has on a kid\u2019s educational outcomes."}
