Brink's expects to incur a charge of $16 million to $22 million against third-quarter GAAP earnings. The expected charge is related to asset impairments, severance and other costs associated with the expected cessation of service to Rabobank on July 1, 2015. The restructuring plan includes the potential closure of three branches and a workforce reduction of approximately 600 employees.\n\nIn 2013, the Netherlands operations generated approximately $120 million of revenue at an operating margin rate that was slightly above the company average. Upon completion of restructuring activities, the remaining business is expected to generate annual revenue of approximately $40 million, primarily from retail customers.\n\nIn 2011, the country's three largest banks -- Rabobank, ING Bank and ABN AMRO -- with the support of the central bank of the Netherlands, founded a collaborative entity known as Geldservice Nederland B.V. (GSN). GSN has provided money processing services for the three banks since 2011. Brink's currently provides all ATM managed services to Rabobank. In July 2015, GSN will provide these services to Rabobank.\n\nBrink's challenged the validity of the GSN entity, based on antitrust regulations. The challenge was unsuccessful.\n\nThe potential loss of business in the Netherlands was considered prior to the company's July 24 disclosure of its goal to achieve a non-GAAP segment margin rate of 8% by the end of 2016, and the goal remains unchanged. Brink's will provide additional details on the restructuring plan on its third-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled for October 30.\n\nAbout The Brink's Company\n\nThe Brink's Company (NYSE: BCO) is the world's premier provider of secure transportation and cash management services.
