That gap means the amount of wasteful spending is probably much higher.\n\nThe new study is like a greatest hits compilation. It recounts the most egregious examples, many of which grabbed headlines over the years, of how Washington threw good money after bad. It includes:\n\n$8 million to end Afghanistan\u2019s drug trade, which by most accounts is flourishing today as never before\n\n$2 billion for roads that the Afghan government is unlikely to maintain due to lack of funds and security concerns\n\n$1 billion for unrealized criminal justice reform efforts\n\nWhile those initiatives can be laid at the feet of several government agencies, the report notes that the Defense Department is solely responsible for multiple boondoggles, such as $936 million for various aircraft that can\u2019t be maintained and another $486 million for cargo planes that can\u2019t fly.\n\nRelated: What's Inside the Pentagon\u2019s $800 Million Afghanistan \u2018Slush Fund\u2019?\n\nThe Pentagon also shelled out $470 million on the Afghan Police. The study also notes the $43 million gas station that has roiled Capitol Hill in recent weeks.\n\nThe timing of the report couldn\u2019t be better for SIGAR. John F. Sopko, chief of the watchdog office is slated to appear before a Senate Armed Services Committee subpanel shortly after lawmakers return from their holiday break.\n\nThe January 20 hearing was ostensibly to scrutinize the work by the Pentagon\u2019s Task Force for Business and Stability Operations, which spent between $700 million and $800 million on economic redevelopment in Afghanistan on projects, like absurdly pricey gas station, as well as $150 million on villas and private security for the group\u2019s staffers.\n\nRelated: Is State Dept. Trying to Muzzle Afghanistan Watchdog?\n\nBut Senators will likely use the ProPublica report as a way to press Brian McKeon, principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, about the task force\u2019s work. The group disbanded earlier this year. Pentagon officials have argued, rather absurdly, that there is no one in the sprawling department today with any knowledge of the task force, including how it spent its money.\n\nThe new price assessment also gives SIGAR supporters like Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) fresh arguments for keeping the watchdog office around even though the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan formally ended last year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.", "title": "Six Years and $17 Billion Wasted in Afghanistan with Nothing to Show for It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Six-Years-and-17-Billion-Wasted-Afghanistan-Nothing-Show-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09262014_Afghantistan_Police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Six-Years-and-17-Billion-Wasted-Afghanistan-Nothing-Show-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09262014_Afghantistan_Police.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Is U.S.'s $109.8 Billion Afghan Rebuild Turning a Corner?\nThe watchdog office formed in 2008 -- seven years after American military forces entered Afghanistan -- only scratched the surface of the estimated $110 billion effort to rebuild the country.\nRelated: What's Inside the Pentagon\u2019s $800 Million Afghanistan \u2018Slush Fund\u2019?\nTrying to Muzzle Afghanistan Watchdog?\nJohn F.
