Mike Huckabee is setting up a constitutional showdown if he wins the presidency.\n\nIn a Saturday interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Channel 2 Action News after he spoke at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta, Huckabee said the answer to the \u201cjudicial tyranny\u201d of the U.S. Supreme Court is reasserting the power of the executive against it.\n\n\u201cThe main thing the president can do is when he takes the oath to uphold the Constitution, he would actually do it. And what that means is you invoke the Fifth and 14th Amendment. The Fifth Amendment says you have due process that\u2019s entitled to you before you\u2019re deprived of life and liberty.\n\n\u201cThe 14th Amendment says that everything to an individual is subject to equal protection under the law. We have not provided either of those constitutional rights to unborn children. The only way that we cannot do it is if we do not consider them persons. So do we consider unborn children to be persons or blobs of unanimated, or maybe animated, protoplasm.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really the determining factor, because once we determine that they are persons \u2014 and as president I believe they are \u2014 then we have a constitutional obligation to protect them.\u201d\n\n+ HYOSUB SHIN / AJC Former Arkansas Gov.
