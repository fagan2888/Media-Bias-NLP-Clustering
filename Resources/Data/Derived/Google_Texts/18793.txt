WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (KRQE) – Dozens staged a protest outside White Sands Missile Range demanding answers to health problems they say were caused by radiation.

According to Santa Fe New Mexican the group is seeking recognition and compensation for decades of illnesses and deaths they believe have been caused by radiation from the atomic bomb blast.

People in surrounding counties say drinking water, local crops and livestock have all been contaminated by the radiation.

A study of the Manhattan Project records by the CDC adds to residents’ concerns.

It says residents were not warned of the detonation – were never evacuated or advised to take precautions regarding radiated food and water sources.
