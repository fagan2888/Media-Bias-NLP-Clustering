Peter Shumlin, longtime proponent of the government health care plan, finally realized its phenomenal costs and associated tax increases and reluctantly announced he could no longer support it.\n\n\u201cThe potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state\u2019s economy,\u201d said Shumlin at a press conference. He was referring to the projected doubling of all taxes in Vermont to fund it.\n\nHe can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned. Conservatives in the Vermont legislature \u2014 the few that there are \u2014 repeatedly warned of the unaffordability of the proposed gigantic program, laying out in black and white the fiscal impossibility of providing \u201cfree\u201d health care to all.\n\nShumlin and Vermont Democrats had charged ahead, however, led by Shumlin\u2019s special counsel for health care reform, Anya Rader-Wallack, who famously stated, \u201cWe can move full speed ahead with what we need without knowing where the money\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nJonathan Gruber, genius and Affordable Care Act creator, helped design \u201cGreen Mountain Care\u201d and promised billions in savings over the next decade. What could go wrong?\n\nThankfully for Vermont taxpayers, much of the potential damage was averted as leaders realized their folly and aborted their mission to liberal health care utopia before too much \u201ceconomic disruption.\u201d Federal taxpayers, however, had already shelled out $45 million in planning grants.\n\nMaine Democrats who either haven\u2019t heard of the Vermont implosion or don\u2019t care are still not ready to give up on the vision of a single-payer plan for Maine. They have submitted several bills this year proposing as much \u2014 just as they have in every Maine Legislature over the past 15 years. Rader-Wallack would approve.\n\nThey do this despite the fact that all of their previous single-payer bills failed, even when the Democrats held large legislative majorities and the governor\u2019s office. With Republicans in control of the Senate and the governor\u2019s office, these new single-payer bills don\u2019t have even a dim ray of hope.\n\nCombine that with the news that Vermont, the bluest of blue states, just had a fiscal epiphany and came to the same conclusion that conservatives reached long ago \u2014 that single-payer is unaffordable \u2014 and even a left-wing visionary should see that these bills are a waste of time.\n\nIt takes true dedication to the left\u2019s ideology for these legislators to \u201cmove full speed ahead\u201d on these obviously doomed bills, against all odds, despite common sense, despite actuarial and fiscal warnings, failed previous experiments (see Dirigo Health) and a public fed up with the disaster of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nAnd it takes a lot of money \u2014 in this case, taxpayer money.\n\nThese dead-on-arrival bills will first have to be drafted \u2014 that\u2019s hours of legal analyst time actually writing the text of these proposed laws. That\u2019s not free.\n\nThey will then be sent to the Insurance and Financial Services committee where public hearings will be scheduled, advertised and held. Work sessions will come next for the committee to discuss, amend and vote on the bills. Again, not free.\n\nAnd all of the sponsors of these bills \u2014 Reps. Heidi Brooks, Gina Melaragno and Ralph Tucker as well as former Insurance and Financial Services chair Sen. Geoffrey Gratwick of Bangor \u2014 actually serve on the Insurance and Financial Services committee, assuring the bills will make it through the committee process and on to the House or Senate floors.\n\nThere they will be printed, debated, amended, debated more and, ultimately, after a series of votes, they will fail. Again, all taking legislative time and taxpayer money.\n\nSo why do it?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to give up on a dream \u2014 or the dreams of your supporters. And there\u2019s no need to if the costs associated with the dream are paid for by others \u2014 the taxpayers.\n\nThese legislators can fulfill their campaign promises and keep the dream alive regardless of the rationale or cost.\n\nWe can expect a great show of support from the usual far left suspects such as the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, Consumers for Affordable Health Care, the MEA, AFL-CIO, and more. They will testify at the public hearings and they demonstrate actively in the State House when the bills reach the House and Senate floors.\n\nBut it won\u2019t affect the outcome \u2014 these bills are dead on arrival.\n\nSingle-payer health care was \u201cstudied\u201d ad nauseum, planned for years and finally died in blue Vermont. Its epitaph should read, \u201cIf it couldn\u2019t happen here, it can\u2019t happen anywhere.\u201d\n\nMaine Democrats need to understand that thought and let it sink in.\n\nJonathan McKane is a former four-term Republican state representative from Newcastle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An iconic liberal dream quietly died in Vermont recently.
