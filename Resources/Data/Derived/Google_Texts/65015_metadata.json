Wins three gold medals at the Paralympics in Beijing in 2008.\n\n- In what was hailed as a significant turning point for disabled athletes, Pistorius successfully won the right to race against able-bodied athletes at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\n- Pistorius arrested and charged with murder after firing four shots at his model and law graduate girlfriend Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door at his luxury Pretoria apartment.\n\n- High court judge Masipa convicts Pistorius of culpable homicide in September 2014 after sensational seven-month trial. Also convicts him of firing a pistol under the table of a packed restaurant but cleared of the illegal possession of ammunition and firing a pistol out of the sun-roof of a car.\n\n- Pistorius starts his five-year jail sentence on Oct 21, 2014.\n\n- State lawyers file an appeal against both the culpable homicide verdict and five-year jail sentence in early November and Pistorius' lawyers oppose the motion.\n\n- Prosecutors win their bid in December after Masipa rules that she \"cannot say the prospect of success at the Supreme Court is remote\".\n\n- On August 19, 2015, South African Justice Minister Michael Masutha blocks Pistorius' release on parole due in two days, saying decision to free him was made without the right legal basis.\n\n- Pistorius released to house arrest on Oct. 19 to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest at his uncle Arnold's home in a wealthy suburb of the capital Pretoria.\n\n- Supreme Sourt of Appeal overturns Masipa's ruling and finds Pistorius was guilty of murder.\n\n(Reporting by Joe Brock; Editing by James Macharia)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Judge Thokozile Masipa, who originally found Pistorius guilty of South Africa's equiva", "title": "Factbox: The trial of 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/03/Factbox-trial-Blade-Runner-Oscar-Pistorius", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/safrica-pistorius_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/03/Factbox-trial-Blade-Runner-Oscar-Pistorius", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/safrica-pistorius_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Judge Thokozile Masipa, who originally found Pistorius guilty of South Africa's equiva", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "- State lawyers file an appeal against both the culpable homicide verdict and five-year jail sentence in early November and Pistorius' lawyers oppose the motion.\n- High court judge Masipa convicts Pistorius of culpable homicide in September 2014 after sensational seven-month trial.\n- Running on carbon fiber prosthetic blades which earn him the nickname \"Blade Runner\", Pistorius becomes a Paralympic gold medallist over 200m in Athens in 2004.\n- Pistorius released to house arrest on Oct. 19 to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest at his uncle Arnold's home in a wealthy suburb of the capital Pretoria.\nA timeline of the life and trial of Pistorius shown below:- Born on November 22, 1986 in Johannesburg."}
