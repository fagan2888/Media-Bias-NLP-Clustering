College, said Amish groups are granted an exemption from the ACA\u2019s requirement to purchase health insurance based on their exemption from paying into Social Security.\n\n\u201cThe government gave them that exemption because they said, \u2018We take care of our older people; we don\u2019t want the government to do that,\u2019 \u201d Burdge said.\n\nFor those not exempt from Social Security, the ACA grants an exemption to anyone who is \u201ca member of a recognized health-care sharing ministry,\u201d according to healthcare.gov.\n\nKevin Ensz, office manager at Christian Health Aid, the health-care sharing ministry of the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite, said membership has grown by about 10 percent since the ACA went into effect in 2010.\n\n\u201cAll in all, there continues to be a slow growth,\u201d Ensz said, noting that membership is limited to members of CGCM-affiliated congregations, commonly known as Holdeman Mennonites.\n\nThe decision to participate in CHA is left up to each household. Shares are paid on a monthly basis and pooled into a central treasury, from which approved medical expenses are covered. Each household\u2019s monthly share amount is determined by the number of people in the household and their ages, according to the program\u2019s guidelines.\n\nEnsz estimated about half of the CGCM\u2019s members were part of CHA, and said more office staff have been added recently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Conservative Amish and Mennonite Medical Resharing Pool, based in Middlebury, Ind., requires groups of at least 10 people who are \u201cactive members or active participants of a Conservative or Amish Mennonite church\u201d to form their own plan in order to join the pool, according to the program\u2019s bylaws. Shares are paid quarterly by each plan depending on how many members each plan has. Amounts vary based on what medical needs are approved for coverage each quarter.\n\nMike Martin, public relations representative for the pool, said his organization has seen \u201ca significant increase\u201d in membership for the past four years, but he doesn\u2019t attribute all of it to the ACA.\n\n\u201cThere are many unaffiliated Mennonite churches that have pitched in for years to help families with medical crises,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIn the past several years, many of those churches have seen the benefit of being part of a larger base.\u201d\n\nMartin said the reason so many Americans don\u2019t have health insurance is because they can\u2019t afford it, and he criticized the government\u2019s policy of financially penalizing people who can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no surprise to me that Christian health-care sharing ministries are expanding by leaps and bounds, because they are more affordable than commercial health insurance policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Servants of the poor\u2019\n\nEven more conservative church groups have traditionally shared medical needs without formal sharing ministries, according to Burdge. The details vary among different groups, but the basic idea of sharing is the same.\n\nHe said groups like the Groffdale Old Order Mennonite Conference have an organized system of health-care funding administered by deacons, who are \u201ctraditionally servants of the poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an assumption that each family will handle whatever medical expenses they can,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cThen the deacon will have some funds to help with that. Beyond that, for very large bills there\u2019s actually a larger fund that is administered by a deacon in the conference.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, he called the Amish method of health-care sharing \u201ca little less organized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey get it taken care of, but they have a number of different strategies,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the family members, including the extended family, contribute what they can, they may publish a notice in their church community newsletter asking for contributions to a fund they set up at the bank. They also may choose to have benefit sales \u2014 which the Old Order Mennonites don\u2019t do, Burdge said \u2014 and to simply collect an offering from their congregation or from multiple congregations.\n\nAmish and Older Order Mennonites will negotiate with hospitals for lower pricing when they can, he said.\n\nBurdge said the difference is mainly in polity, describing the Old Order Mennonites as more structured and the Amish as more congregational with no official larger structures except those temporarily formed on an as-needed basis.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the Mennonite heritage that our parents and ancestors have taught us \u2014 the concept of sharing with each other,\u201d Martin said. \u201c \u2018Bear ye one another\u2019s burdens as fulfills the law of Christ.\u2019 That is our motto.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mennonite World Review", "description": "Health-care sharing has become an attractive option for many people since the Affordable Care Act came into effect in the U.S., but it\u2019s an arrangement many conservative Anabaptists have had \u2026", "title": "More drawn to sharing cost of health care", "url": "http://mennoworld.org/2016/01/18/feature/more-drawn-to-sharing-cost-of-health-care/", "image": "http://mennoworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blog-logo-web.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-18T13:00:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T16:38:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i1.wp.com/mennoworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/old-order-bikes-001-e1452794666729.jpg?resize=350%2C359&w=240", "site": "@MennoWorld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@MennoWorld"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i1.wp.com/mennoworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cropped-MWR-logo.jpg?fit=270%2C270", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4"}, "article_summary": "For those not exempt from Social Security, the ACA grants an exemption to anyone who is \u201ca member of a recognized health-care sharing ministry,\u201d according to healthcare.gov.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no surprise to me that Christian health-care sharing ministries are expanding by leaps and bounds, because they are more affordable than commercial health insurance policies,\u201d he said.\nWhether it\u2019s a formal health-care sharing ministry or multiple congregations pooling resources to meet a specific need, the practice of mutual aid for medical expenses replaces both commercial and government health insurance.\n\u2018Servants of the poor\u2019Even more conservative church groups have traditionally shared medical needs without formal sharing ministries, according to Burdge.\nKevin Ensz, office manager at Christian Health Aid, the health-care sharing ministry of the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite, said membership has grown by about 10 percent since the ACA went into effect in 2010."}
