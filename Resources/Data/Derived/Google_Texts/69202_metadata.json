You\u2019ve asked about everything from the economy, to immigration reform, to the Affordable Care Act... and even suggestions on baby names.\n\nAfter President Obama addresses the nation on Tuesday, January 20, he\u2019s once again turning to YouTube to discuss the policies laid out in the speech and answer your questions. This continues efforts by the President and his administration to speak directly to the American people online, and we're always looking for new ways to do just that.\n\nThat's why, this year, we\u2019re trying something a little different:\n\nWe\u2019re inviting a handful of YouTube creators to the White House to talk with the President in person, and you can watch it all live on Thursday, January 22. YouTube creators Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank Green will interview President Obama about the issues care they most about and what they\u2019re hearing from their audiences.\n\nWhat do you want the creators to ask the President? Follow the White House on YouTube, then use #YouTubeAsksObama on your social media channels -- some of your questions may be asked during the interview.\n\nMake sure you tune in to our enhanced State of the Union on January 20 at 9 p.m. ET. Start asking your questions now, and then watch the YouTube interview live at 5p.m. ET on Thursday, January 22 to find out if your questions were asked.\n\nThe State of the Union 2015: Everything You Need to Know", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"creator": "@WhiteHouse", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/01/15/state-younion-youtube-creators-interview-president-obama-live-white-house", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "width": 240, "height": 240}, "title": "State of the YOUnion: YouTube Creators Interview President Obama Live from the White House", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "After President Obama addresses the nation on Tuesday, January 20, he\u2019s turning to YouTube to discuss the policies laid out in the speech and answer your questions.", "title": "State of the YOUnion: YouTube Creators Interview President Obama Live from the White House", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/01/15/state-younion-youtube-creators-interview-president-obama-live-white-house", "image": {"width": 240, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/twitter_cards_blog.jpg", "height": 240}, "updated_time": "2015-08-13T11:32:27-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-15T11:30:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-13T11:32:27-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee8c\"", "article_summary": "Watch President Obama's Interview with YouTube creators live on Thursday, January 22 at 5:00 p.m.\nYouTube creators Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank Green will interview President Obama about the issues care they most about and what they\u2019re hearing from their audiences.\nStart asking your questions now, and then watch the YouTube interview live at 5p.m.\nEvery year since 2010, we\u2019ve invited people around the country to ask President Obama their questions after his State of the Union address.\nFollow the White House on YouTube, then use #YouTubeAsksObama on your social media channels -- some of your questions may be asked during the interview."}
