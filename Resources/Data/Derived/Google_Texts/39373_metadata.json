Gov. Phil Scott\n\nJanuary 8, 2015\n\nContact:\n\nRachel Feldman\n\nChief of Staff, Lt. Governor Phil Scott\n\n(802) 828-2226\n\nhttp://ltgov.vermont.gov\n\nLt. Governor Phil Scott delivered the following remarks Thursday morning after taking the Oath of Office for his third term as Vermont\u2019s Lieutenant Governor:\n\nGood morning. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all had a pretty easy, relaxing day so far.\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the people of Vermont for their confidence in me and electing me to a third term as Vermont\u2019s Lieutenant Governor\u2026and an eighth term serving in Montpelier.\n\nFourteen years ago I was a new face in this building and this chamber. I sat right there in seat 28\u2026and I assure you, I had no idea when I first sat down in that seat that I would be standing before you today in this role.\n\nI\u2019d now like to take a moment to officially welcome our four \u201cfreshman\u201d Senators: Balint, Campion, Collamore, and Degree. Some of you aren\u2019t exactly \u201cnew\u201d faces to us, but we welcome you in your new capacity. A few words on your new home: if you get lost, remember, you\u2019re now going to the GREEN room, not the red one\u2026this is the room where we start on time and electronic devices are not welcome here\u2026and by the way\u2026.I\u2019ve been known to smash cell phones with this gavel. True story.\n\nI also want to thank my family and extended family for their unwavering support. My extended family would be my many, many friends who are too numerous to mention\u2026but you know who you are and I am eternally grateful for each and every one of you\u2026and what you have done for me.\n\nAnd thank you to my family here today: my Brother Kevin, my sister in law Donna, my niece, cousins, one of my daughters (Erica), my wife Diana (thank you for putting up with a somewhat unique\u2026or what some would call crazy\u2026life) and last but not least my Mom\u2026who probably came the greatest distance \u2013 all the way from Florida \u2014 and who has influenced my life more than I have probably ever realized\u2026because growing up in Barre she kept the lives of my brothers and me pretty normal even though it was probably anything but\u2026\n\nMy Mom grew up on the Cate Farm in Plainfield, so that sense of Yankee Independence is ingrained in her soul.\n\nIn fact, when she flew in on Monday, I started to feel pretty guilty at around 7 o\u2019clock\u2026I thought \u2026a good son would be at the airport to pick his mother up. So I sent her a text \u2013 yes, Senator Mazza, my mom texts\u2026saying it\u2019s already in the single digits\u2026it\u2019s dark\u2026I don\u2019t want you wandering around looking for your car alone\u2026etc \u2013 She called me back and said she\u2019d already gotten a rental car, arranged someone to take her to the car, and was waiting for her luggage. I then suggested she might want to slow down a little coming through Bolton Flats being that she hasn\u2019t driven in these conditions in a while\u2026.and she seemed a bit insulted.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to remember my mom just got rid of her 8-cylinder Chevy Impala SS and downsized to a 4-cylinder Turbo.\n\nShe\u2019s a smart lady. Valedictorian of her class at Plainfield High\u2026but we don\u2019t need to go into the details of how many students actually graduated nor what year that was..\u2026\n\nSome of you have heard the story about our mom and dad\u2026but I don\u2019t tire of telling it\u2026and I have the podium.\n\nMy father was from Washington, Vermont. He fought in World War II and was seriously injured in the D-Day Invasion in France. He spent two years at Walter Reed Medical Center before returning home to Vermont. But when he returned, he came back as a double-amputee. That didn\u2019t stop him from making the most of his life \u2013 working right next door for the State Highway Department and building a camp in Elmore. The only thing he really had trouble with was getting his groceries from the Elmore General Store, because these were the days before the Americans with Disabilities Act, and there were only steps. So he would call in his grocery order, and a young woman who was attending Johnson State College and living in Elmore with her sister would bring them down the steps to him. That turned out to be my mom.\n\nAt 33 she became a widow and a single mom with three boys\u2026three fairly active boys\u2026 and I realize today how very fortunate we were to have a mom who was as dedicated as she was to keeping our life as normal as possible.\n\nSo thank you, Mom, for not only being the person you are but for giving me the guidance when needed \u2013 and also the flexibility that allowed me to become the person I am today.\n\nAs I was writing these remarks, I went back to what I said when I first took my oath in 2011\u2026and again in 2013\u2026and I realized something: I could stand up here today and deliver the same remarks I gave then and \u2013 with the exception of a few names \u2013 they\u2019d be just as relevant. And today I will be repeating what I said then\u2026and that means one of two things:\n\nOne \u2013 Nobody is listening to me or two \u2013 we haven\u2019t yet solved the problems I laid out.\n\nIf this past election taught us anything, it appears the majority of Vermonters feel disconnected from us. Fewer than 43 percent of registered voters actually cast a ballot. For far too many, it is no longer BECOMING unaffordable to live in Vermont \u2013 it IS unaffordable\u2026.many grew up here\u2026.. they want to stay here \u2013 but they just don\u2019t know how \u2014 and they are looking to us for relief.\n\nI am hopeful we can help\u2026\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t\u2026.. It\u2019s a new session and we have a clean slate\u2026.. The first step is to be sure we put Vermonters first and our own personal and political agendas second. The elections are over. We must now transition from being politicians to becoming public servants. Vermonters\u2019 expectations are high \u2013 they want us to work together. It doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t disagree or debate the issues. We\u2019re not here to rubber stamp initiatives\u2026we are here because Vermonters put their trust in each and every one of us\u2026and we are here to give them hope.\n\nWe can no longer kick this can down the road\u2026and we have to face some harsh realities. However, since the election, it seems we are reaching some areas of agreement on what those realities are:\n\nMany Vermonters are working two to three jobs, struggling to pay their property taxes, put heating fuel in the tanks, and food on the table. The affordability issue we face in Vermont isn\u2019t just about the ever-rising burden of taxation on working Vermonters \u2013 it\u2019s about real Vermonters who are making less and less every year.\n\nIn the long run I believe the only responsible way to ensure we all get what we want is to grow the economy. This will undoubtedly require new approaches \u2013 and new public policy \u2013 across virtually every area of state government.\n\nThe underlying challenge of every policy question we face in Vermont \u2013 from social services to education to the environment \u2013 is having an economy and workforce strong enough to support the necessary investments in these areas.\n\nOur economic policies \u2013 for individuals and for businesses and their employees \u2013 are not firing on all cylinders. We are competing in a world that operates and updates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We MUST be innovative and keep up with the times; I think it\u2019s fair to say in many instances that we\u2019re using 20th century economic policies to try to attract 21st century jobs.\n\nWe need to be better partners with Vermont businesses \u2026.they need some certainty for planning purposes\u2026.like what taxes and fees they\u2019re facing \u2013 and know we in Montpelier want to help them grow and prosper so that we can prosper as well.\n\nVermonters deserve affordable health care \u2013 quality health care \u2013 and a fully functional health care exchange.\n\nSo \u2026\u2026where do we go from here?\n\nWhat I\u2019m asking is this: At the beginning of the day, before we start our work, remind ourselves that we are members of a team of 625,000 people. You are a team of 30 in whom Vermonters have bestowed their trust.\n\nWe have to acknowledge that egos will always exist in this building \u2026.I know it\u2019s hard to believe\u2026\u2026and there will always be \u201cpolitics\u201d in the equation\u2026but while I know we cannot change all of the behavior\u2026because emotions come into play\u2026.. I also believe we can do better.\n\nWe can learn to listen to each other\u2026at least a little bit better. We can learn to find areas of agreement\u2026.at least a little more often. I don\u2019t have a seat in this Chamber \u2013 but I have a lot of chairs in my office \u2013 and if you reach a stalemate, or need a place to hash things out, or want to vet ideas \u2013 come in.\n\nSo in order for all of us to pull in the same direction, I urge each and every one of you to simply view every bill through the lens of: \u201cWill this help our economy? Will this improve efficiencies and reduce costs?\u201d If the answer to those questions is \u201cyes,\u201d then put it on the front burner. If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d then maybe it goes on the back burner\u2026or maybe even in the fridge.\n\nSo as we enter the Biennium, I ask you to listen to Vermonters. And not just listen, but really hear what they\u2019re saying.\n\nAs I\u2019ve learned in my 56 years of life\u2026.40 years of racing\u2026.30 years in business and 14 years in political life\u2026.: Nobody wins alone\u2026it takes a team\u2026and success is so much sweeter when we celebrate TOGETHER.\n\nDo well by your family. Do well by your friends. Do well by your neighbors.\n\nMy door is always open and you are always welcome. I, along with my entire staff\u2026which means my Chief of Staff Rachel and our two unpaid interns, Hayden and Tony, look forward to working with you to make this a productive and positive session\u2026together.\n\nThank you.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "inaugural address, lieutenant governor, phil scott, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Lt.
