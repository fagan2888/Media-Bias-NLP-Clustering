His campaign has been built, in large part, on demonstrably false claims about the current state of reality that appeal to his base of old, angry, white voters, combined with grandiose promises about a future reality that only he can deliver.\n\nBut in an interview broadcast on New Hampshire television station NH1 Tuesday, the billionaire former reality television star and serial fabulist briefly broke character by telling his supporters that in the real world, maximalist negotiating positions not only don\u2019t get you what you want, but typically get you nothing at all.\n\nRelated: Pushback Against Trump from Mainstream Media Grows\n\nTrump, in a conversation with NH1 political director Paul Steinhauser, was asked about his plan to overhaul the U.S. tax code \u2013 a bloated legislative mess that virtually every member of Congress agrees must be rewritten.\n\nNot surprisingly, Trump said nobody else in the race has a proposal that can possibly solve the country\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cIf you look at some of the plans, they\u2019re going to be terrible plans. Nobody thinks they\u2019re going to work,\u201d he said. Unlike his own plan, of course, on which he said, \u201cI have gotten such wonderful reviews from so many people that I respect.\"\n\nTo his credit, Trump\u2019s proposal is actually more detailed than those of some of his opponents, though it has come in for its share of both criticism and praise. But on Tuesday, the real estate mogul took the sort of real-world stance on the issue that is infrequently seen in Washington: He said, out loud, that he is willing to negotiate.\n\nRelated: Another Hole in a Trump Story Uncovered\n\n\u201cOne thing also I have to say,\u201d he said to Steinhauser, \u201cYou\u2019re going to put this plan in front of lots of different people. It\u2019s going to go through lots of scrutiny. There\u2019s room to negotiate. I\u2019m a negotiator. There\u2019s room to negotiate.\n\n\u201cOther people don\u2019t have any room to negotiate. But there\u2019s always going to be room to negotiate. When I put something forward, I always have to leave something on the table, and we have things on the table. We can give up certain things.\u201d\n\nIn the rest of the Tuesday night interview, Trump said many things and made many remarkable (okay, unbelievable) claims.\n\nThe United States is the most highly taxed nation in the world? Sorry, not even close.\n\nThere are third world countries with better education systems than the U.S.? Well, no.\n\nTwenty-five percent of the population is jobless, but is considered \u201cemployed?\u201d Whaaat?\n\nRelated: Trump Is Learning a Tough, Reality-Based Lesson from Black Pastors\n\nNot a single one of those outright false statements will hurt him with his supporters. But going on the record as willing to compromise on taxes? Well, who knows what, if anything, will ultimately bring Donald Trump down. But if there\u2019s anything at all, a willingness to negotiate with Democrats on tax policy might be it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Current Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has made his so-far", "title": "Did Donald Trump Just Reveal a Potentially Fatal Flaw?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Did-Donald-Trump-Just-Reveal-Potentially-Fatal-Flaw", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08172015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Did-Donald-Trump-Just-Reveal-Potentially-Fatal-Flaw", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08172015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Current Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has made his so-far", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s room to negotiate.\nNot surprisingly, Trump said nobody else in the race has a proposal that can possibly solve the country\u2019s problems.\nWell, who knows what, if anything, will ultimately bring Donald Trump down.\nWe can give up certain things.\u201dIn the rest of the Tuesday night interview, Trump said many things and made many remarkable (okay, unbelievable) claims.\nBut if there\u2019s anything at all, a willingness to negotiate with Democrats on tax policy might be it."}
