His arrest came as part of an investigation stemming back to August 2013.\n\nAccording to a police report, a detective with the Stillwater Police Department, who was also a member of the Oklahoma Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force, used a file sharing program to directly connect with Powell's computer on multiple occasions.\n\nOver the course of the investigation the detective was able to download a number of video files depicting explicit acts of child pornography directly from Powell's computer.\n\nInvestigators issued a court order to AT&T for internet subscriber information, where it was determined the IP address was in fact Powell's.\n\nAround 7 a.m. on Friday investigators served a warrant at Powell's home in Edmond. Police then say Powell was Mirandized and, after being questioned, admitted to using the internet to download child pornography.\n\nPolice say Powell also admitted that he knew he was sharing parts of the videos while he was downloading the files. He is facing one count of distributing child pornography, one count of possessing child pornography, and one count for violating the Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An Edmond man was arrested on Friday for possessing and distributing child pornography.", "author": "Matthew Nuttle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25545676/edmond-man-arrested-for-possessing-distributing-child-pornography", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25545676_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Edmond man was arrested on Friday for possessing and distributing child pornography.", "title": "Edmond Man Arrested For Possessing, Distributing Child Pornography"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25545676_SA.jpg", "description": "An Edmond man was arrested on Friday for possessing and distributing child pornography.", "card": "summary", "title": "Edmond Man Arrested For Possessing, Distributing Child Pornography"}, "wnreadableurl": "edmond-man-arrested-for-possessing-distributing-child-pornography", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/05/17", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "edmond,child pornography,crime,computer crimes,matthew nuttle,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS29", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "edmond,child pornography,crime,computer crimes,matthew nuttle,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd03d3\"", "article_summary": "He is facing one count of distributing child pornography, one count of possessing child pornography, and one count for violating the Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act.\nAn Edmond man was arrested on Friday for possessing and distributing child pornography.\nHis arrest came as part of an investigation stemming back to August 2013.\nPolice then say Powell was Mirandized and, after being questioned, admitted to using the internet to download child pornography.\nOver the course of the investigation the detective was able to download a number of video files depicting explicit acts of child pornography directly from Powell's computer."}
