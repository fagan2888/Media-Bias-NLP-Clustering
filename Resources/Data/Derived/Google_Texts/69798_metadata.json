But a new study has found that strengthening the parent-child relationship may help the children stay healthy at least a little more. By intervening, the children showed signs of reduced inflammation.\n\nFrom birth, children from poorer families face struggles \u2014 these problems are usually caused by the mother\u2019s stress. Whereas 6.5 percent of mothers who have had some college education are likely to give birth to a low-weight child, nine percent of mothers with less than a high school education give birth to low-weight children, according to The Future of Children. Later on, the stresses that come along with raising a child in an impoverished community take their toll on the parents through depression, which results in often harsher parenting styles.\n\nIn turn, children\u2019s brain development becomes stunted, leading to poorer school performance. As they do worse in school, they become more stressed than they should be, putting them at a future risk of other health problems like heart disease and diabetes. Their risk for these diseases then increases, as they become more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs.\n\n\u201cMany health problems in both childhood and adulthood involve excessive inflammation,\u201d said Gregory Miller, professor of psychology at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, in a press release. \u201cThe process has a role in diabetes, heart disease, allergies, and some cancers.\u201d\n\nA study from last year found that people who experienced life under poor socioeconomic conditions in childhood were more likely to catch a cold as an adult. They found this was because their upbringing resulted in the shortening of a protector of chromosomes, called telomeres. These structures, which are also markers of how long we\u2019ll live and which diseases we develop, tend to erode when exposed to inflammation, an immune response to normally harmful stimuli.\n\nMiller and his colleagues from Northwestern University were interested in seeing how strengthening the mother-child bond through intervention benefited the children\u2019s levels of inflammation. So, the researchers gathered information on families living in small, rural areas of Georgia, 90 percent of whom were from low-income backgrounds. Each mother and her 11-year-old child went through a seven-week training program, in which they were taught techniques for improving parenting and communication skills between each other, as well as better ways to help the child deal with stress, racism, and peer pressure regarding sex, drugs, and alcohol.\n\nEight years later, when the children became 19, the researchers took blood samples to measure inflammation. As they had hoped, participants who underwent the training program showed lower levels of inflammation when compared to the control group, setting them up for a healthier adulthood. \u201cWe also found that the training was most successful in reducing inflammation in families who came from the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe study is also novel in its focus on families who are at high risk for health problems relative to other Americans.\u201d\n\nIndeed, blacks and Hispanics are among the poorest in the country. They are also the most at risk for developing heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer \u2014 some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. If a strategy like Miller\u2019s can be implemented in a larger capacity, many of these people can be saved.\n\nSource: Miller G, Brody G, Yu T, Chen E.
