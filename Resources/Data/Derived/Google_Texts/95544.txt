Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) officials say a Lynn Haven man is dead after he was struck by a vehicle early Sunday morning on the Hathaway Bridge.

Officials say Jerry Malachi Jones of Lynn Haven was driving a scooter in the middle lane, heading eastbound on the Hathaway Bridge, when a driver, Kenneth Lee Mawhard, of Pensacola hit Jones.

FHP says after Mawhard hit the back of Jones' scooter, Mawhard left the scene and headed to a bar over in Panama City.

The bar was closing, so Mawhard left, but a server from the bar followed him back over the bridge into Panama City Beach. The server from the bar, called FHP and officials caught up with Mawhard and stated he was very intoxicated.

A number of witnesses tell FHP officials they saw Mawhard hit Jones while he was on the scooter. However, Mawhard is telling officials he was a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the crash.

FHP arrested Mawhard and charged him with DUI manslaughter and leaving the scene of a crash.

He has been booked in the Bay County Jail. We will bring you more information when it becomes available.
