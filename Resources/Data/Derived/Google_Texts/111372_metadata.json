That's around 130 million people. It turns out that some of them are members of the New York Times editorial board, which last week declared that \"the federal government should repeal the ban on marijuana.\"\n\nGiven its timing, the paper's endorsement of legalization is more an indicator of public opinion than a brave stand aimed at changing it. Andrew Rosenthal, editorial page editor at the Times, told MSNBC's Chris Hayes that the new position was not controversial among the paper's 18 editorial writers and that when he raised the subject with the publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, \"He said, 'Fine.' I think he'd probably been there before I was. I think I was there before we did it.\" Better late than never, I guess, although I confess that seeing a New York Times editorial in favor of legalizing marijuana briefly made me wonder if I've been wrong about the issue all these years.\n\nIn their gratitude for the belated support of a venerable journalistic institution, antiprohibitionists should not overlook the extent to which the Times has aided and abetted the war on marijuana over the years. That shameful history provides a window on the origins of this bizarre crusade and a lesson in the hazards of failing to question authority.\n\nIn an essay published by the Times on Tuesday, part of a series fleshing out the case for legalization, editorial writer Brent Staples exposes the ugly roots of marijuana prohibition:\n\nThe federal law that makes possession of marijuana a crime has its origins in legislation that was passed in an atmosphere of hysteria during the 1930s and that was firmly rooted in prejudices against Mexican immigrants and African-Americans, who were associated with marijuana use at the time. This racially freighted history lives on in current federal policy, which is so driven by myth and propaganda that it is almost impervious to reason.\n\nUnfortunately, Staples overlooks the role the Times itself played in building that atmosphere of hysteria and disseminating the propaganda that supposedly justified the ban on marijuana. He mentions \"sensationalistic newspaper articles\" that tied marijuana to \"murder and mayhem\" and \"depicted pushers hovering by the schoolhouse door turning children into 'addicts.'\" He does not mention that such stories appeared in The New York Times.\n\nIn February 1925, as states were beginning to ban marijuana, the Times reported that a 27-year-old Mexican named Escrado Valle, \"crazed from smoking marihuana,\" \"ran amuck today in a local hospital and killed six persons before he could be subdued.\" Later that year it announced that the Mexican government had banned marijuana \"To Stamp Out Drug Plant Which Crazes Its Addicts.\" In 1927 the Times picked up on the theme of marijuana-crazed Mexicans again, reporting that \"a widow and her four children have been driven insane by eating the Marihuana plant.\" The paper cited \"doctors\" who \"say that there is no hope of saving the children's lives and that the mother will be insane for the rest of her life.\" Yet according to the story, the family accidentally ate fresh cannabis plants, which are not psychoactive.\n\nStories like these helped pave the way for prohibition by portraying cannabis, which had been widely used in American patent medicines, as an exotic, madness-inducing, potentially deadly drug favored by brown-skinned foreigners. Another important element of the pot panic: This insidious plant supposedly was invading schoolyards across America. In 1934, three years before Congress approved the Marihuana Tax Act (a de facto ban), the Times reported that Harry J. Anslinger, who was instrumental in stirring up cannaphobia as head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), \"is investigating the use by school children in Cleveland and other areas of marihuana, a mild narcotic reported to change the qualities of valor and courage to fear and even insanity.\"\n\nThe claim that cannabis replaces courage with fear seems inconsistent with the marijuana-induced mass murder that the Times had reported a decade before. It also seems inconsistent with the FBN's claim that \"prolonged use of Marihuana frequently develops a delirious rage which sometimes leads to high crimes such as assault and murder,\" which is why \"Marihuana has been called 'the killer drug.'\"\n\nIn 1937, the year that Congress banned marijuana, the Times referred matter-of-factly to \"the devastating effects of the marihuana weed\" in a story about an educational program aimed at \"bringing home to young people not already acquainted with marihuana the reasons for its general designation as 'the killer drug.'\" A few months later the Times identified marijuana as \"the new narcotic menace to youth\" in an article that relied heavily on an anti-pot agitator who \"characterized marihuana as the 'most pernicious' of drugs\" and \"said it produced in smokers of the weed a temporary sense of complete irresponsibility which led to sex crimes and other 'horrible' acts of violence.\"\n\nDid people actually believe these terrifying tales? Apparently they did. In 1938 the Times reported on a murder trial in which one of the defendants \"contended she was a victim of marihuana madness.\"\n\nWhat a relief, after all that fear mongering, to come across a 1938 New York Times review of Robert P. Walton's book Marihuana: America's New Drug Problem. \"Over the last year,\" the review begins, \"the growing abuse of marihuana has been sensationally publicized in newspapers, magazines and on the screen.\" Finally, a voice of reason.\n\nOr maybe not. The author of the review, Frederick T. Merrill, claims \"the hashish vice\u2026has assumed alarming proportions in this country.\" He adds that \"depravity has been and still is the only motive for [marijuana's] habitual use, and its effects are particularly anti-social.\" Merrill\u2014who four years later published Japan and the Opium Menace, a book that Foreign Affairs called \"a factual study of one of Japan's most dangerous weapons\"\u2014assures anyone skeptical of Anslinger's claims about marijuana-related violence that science is on Anslinger's side: \"The reason why marijuana and crime are so closely linked is more understandable in view of the unpredictable reactions to varying quantities of the drug.\"\n\nAs late as 1941, the Times was still lending credence to the idea that marijuana makes men murder. \"Seaman Arraigned for Murder at Sea,\" the headline over a news story published that year announced. \"Marihuana Smoker Accused as Federal Court Gets First Case of Kind in 7 Years; Stabbing Charged to Him; He Imagined, After Several Cigarettes, That Crew Men Were 'Out to Get Him.'\"\n\nIn fact, the Times continues to run such stories from time to time, albeit under less sensational headlines. A May 31, 2014, article headlined \"After 5 Months of Sales, Colorado Sees Downside of a Legal High\" included this sentence: \"There is the Denver man who, hours after buying a package of marijuana-infused Karma Kandy from one of Colorado's new recreational marijuana shops, began raving about the end of the world and then pulled a handgun from the family safe and killed his wife, the authorities say.\"\n\nTo be clear: I am not saying that didn't happen; I am merely questioning the implication that marijuana made him do it. As with Escrado Valle, the man who reportedly ran amuck in a Mexican hospital back in 1925, the story is probably a bit more complicated than that.\n\nUncritically regurgitating anti-drug horror stories has practical implications, and they are not pretty. In a 1951 story headlined \"Fight Against Narcotics Waged by U.S. and U.N.,\" the Times reported that \"Congress will be called upon shortly to consider a bill which experts believe will go further toward stamping out the narcotics evil in this country than anything since the Harrison Narcotics Act.\" It was referring to the Boggs Act, which established mandatory minimum sentences for federal crimes involving marijuana and other illegal drugs. According to Harry Anslinger, the enhanced penalties, precursors to the draconian sentences that in recent years have drawn bipartisan criticism, were necessary to win the \"battle with the drug traffic.\"\n\nAlmost two decades later, the Times still thought \"the penalties for those who prey on the innocent by peddling drugs can hardly be too severe,\" although it simultaneously urged \"a distinction between soft and hard drugs.\" That 1969 editorial is part of a collection assembled by the Times to illustrate its \"evolving\" position on marijuana.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Highlights from the anti-pot files of The New York Times", "title": "'Mexican, Crazed by Marihuana, Runs Amuck With Butcher Knife'", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/08/04/mexican-crazed-by-marihuana-runs-amuck-w", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jsullum/2014_08/Andrew-Rosenthal-on-MSNBC-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to\na&nbsp;recent\npoll&nbsp;by the Pew Research Center, 54 percent of American\nadults support marijuana legalization.
