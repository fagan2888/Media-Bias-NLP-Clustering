He can play all 18 holes at the country club now, safe in the knowledge that he\u2019s distracting voters from all the scandals, mismanagement and foreign and domestic policies that are the legacy of his administration.\n\nA midlevel bureaucrat at Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry mocks the United States for the \u201cburning internal problems\u201d in Ferguson, Mo. The barbarians of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, sometimes called the Islamic State and usually known as ISIS, behead an American journalist, a believing Christian named James Foley, and continue to slaughter Christians throughout Iraq. Mr. Obama\u2019s tepid campaign of \u201ctargeted airstrikes\u201d take out a pickup truck here and a checkpoint shack there, but strikes no fear in the savage heart. All the ISIS brutes take away is that this American president traded five hardened al Qaeda terrorists for one U.S. Army deserter.\n\nEveryone in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico is aware of his weakness. They know that if they sneak over the border, Mr. Obama will give them \u201cpapers,\u201d and they can stay and even become citizens without the hassle of waiting in line or learning the English language and absorbing American values. These newly minted residents will join the 110 million Americans already on some form of government assistance. They can sign up for Obamaphones, Obamacare and whatever other gifts the White House can think up.\n\nThe endless stream of handouts has plunged the nation $17.7 trillion in debt. By the end of his term, Mr. Obama will be responsible for nearly $10 trillion in red ink, more than all 43 of his predecessors combined could spend. Mr. Obama is spending all the economy\u2019s money so there\u2019s little left for the private sector that creates the wealth.\n\nUnderemployment grows apace, economic growth is tepid at best. A Money magazine survey finds that two of every three Americans earning under $100,000 \u2014 the middle class that Mr. Obama is always talking about \u2014 is scared to death about the future.\n\nCalm will return to Missouri long before November, and that\u2019s the real bad news for the White House. The Real Clear Politics polling average finds that 65 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. This will have consequences on Election Day.\n\nThe news for the White House seems all bad. The Chicago Cubs, down 20 games in the National League Central Division standings, stand a better chance of winning the World Series than Nancy Pelosi has of returning as speaker of the House. Harry Reid has a considerably better chance of keeping control of the Senate, but polling averages today show voters in Arkansas, Iowa, North Carolina, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota and West Virginia inclined to send Republicans to take seats now held by Democrats. Sen. Mitch McConnell only needs six of those seven races to go his way and he can move into Mr. Reid\u2019s office. (Mr. McConnell is ahead in his own race as well).\n\nAlaska Republicans decided Tuesday that former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan will challenge Mark Begich, the incumbent, to represent Alaska in the Senate. Mr. Sullivan, a smart conservative, can focus now on showing how Mr. Begich eagerly represents Mr. Obama\u2019s values, not Alaska\u2019s.\n\nNothing is certain in politics, and Republicans have a well-known gift for retreat and blowing a lead, but the choice of tested candidates like Mr. Sullivan is reassuring to the party. If Mr. Obama wants to keep the Senate in his party\u2019s hands, he should put down his driver and putter and think about how to strengthen the economy and make the world quit laughing at us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trouble in the St. Louis suburbs has rescued President Obama's vacation.
