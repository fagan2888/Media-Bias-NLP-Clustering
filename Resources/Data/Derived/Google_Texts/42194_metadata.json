But when he reached Knoxville, Tenn. he thought about giving up. \u201cMy feet are swollen. My ankles are swollen. My knees have been killing me since ten feet in. My shoulders are on fire,\u201d Williams said.

He suffers from PTSD, anxiety, depression, hearing loss and pain throughout his body. For more than a decade, the VA has claimed his symptoms are not due to his deployment.\n\nHe arrived in D.C. on Aug. 14 and has been spending his days, from 8 a.m\u20134 p.m. sitting in the Veterans Affairs Benefit Administration office.\n\nJason Miller, outreach director of the office, said he was surprised Williams walked all that way and promised he would get Williams the help he needs.\n\n\u201cI feel like I can win this battle for all of us,\u201d Williams told WUSA9.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Washington D.C.", "geoLat": "38.807", "description": "Amari Williams set out on foot for Washington DC from his Killeen, Texas on July 27.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aggrego.SunTimes.National", "locale": "en_US", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@SunTimesDC"}, "og": {"site_name": "Washington D.C.", "description": "Amari Williams set out on foot for Washington DC from his Killeen, Texas on July 27.", "title": "Army veteran treks from Texas to DC seeking VA justice", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2015/08/CM4KzZmUkAE8sqv.jpg?o=eyJ3aWR0aCI6MCwiaGVpZ2h0IjowLCJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNX0%3D&s=QJeBGcgT%2F9i4lUNTswYPM%2Fyu19o%3D", "updated_time": "2015-08-21T13:19:34+00:00", "url": "http://dc.suntimes.com/dc-news/7/82/229446/army-veteran-texas-to-dc-for-va-care/", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "gmt_offset": "-4", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=930568317", "article": {"section": "Washington D.C.
