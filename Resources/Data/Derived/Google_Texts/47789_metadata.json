Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nSpotted slideshow: Donald Trump at the Jacksonville Landing\n\nTrump said Bush is in the midst of a \u201cfailing campaign\u201d that had to cut staff salaries by 40 percent.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who wants to run the country and he can\u2019t even run his own campaign,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said Rubio is trailing in the polls, \u201csweats like a dog\u201d and showed a lack of loyalty to Bush by running for president at the same time as Bush.\n\n\u201cSo those two guys are fighting like crazy, and I\u2019m laughing, watching them fighting,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump took the stage to the pounding chorus of Twisted Sister\u2019s rock song \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d while wearing his campaign\u2019s red baseball cap with the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nOutside the Landing, a group of about 20 people protested Trump by waving hand-made signs such as \u201cHate Speech Isn\u2019t Presidential,\u201d \u201cA Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Racism\u201d and \u201cWe Don\u2019t Need a Whining Buffoon for President.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just standing in solidarity against Donald Trump,\u201d said Jacksonville resident Dannelle Howden. \u201cHe\u2019s everything America doesn\u2019t stand for.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s speech, a group on the nearby Main Street bridge\u2019s pedestrian walkway unfurled a sign that said \u201cDump the Trump.\u201d\n\nInside the Landing, Trump and the crowd fed off each other in what Trump called a \u201clovefest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is happening all over,\u201d Trump said of the turnout. \u201cNo matter where I go, it\u2019s a message. It\u2019s a movement. This is more than just Donald Trump shows up, he speaks, he leaves. We\u2019re going to do something that is so unbelievable. The whole world is talking about us.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s only direct references to Jacksonville came shortly after taking the stage.\n\n\u201cI had a casino boat built here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt did great. We sold it, made a lot of money, so I love Jacksonville.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t mention the recently announced addition of Jacksonville-based political consultant Susie Wiles as Florida co-chair for his campaign. Wiles managed Rick Scott\u2019s campaign when he won the race for governor in 2010.\n\nIn terms of a Florida connection, Trump spent the most time recounting the hardball negotiating tactics he used in a South Florida deal for the purchase of a Miami resort now known as Trump National Doral. As both sides convened to close what would have been a $170 million sale, Trump told the sellers\u2019 representatives they had defrauded him with their descriptions of the property and he would only pay $100 million. When the other side balked, Trump said he walked out of the room, and the other side then called him back ready to negotiate a lower price.\n\nTrump said Secretary of State John Kerry would have gotten a better deal with Iran over that country\u2019s nuclear program if Kerry had the \u201cbrains to walk out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he do the same thing I did at Doral?\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said he will renegotiate the Iran deal, rewrite trade agreements, repeal and replace Obamacare, stop illegal immigration and get the Mexican government to pay \u201c100 percent\u201d of the cost for building about 1,000 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump said other candidates have told him the Mexican government would never pay for construction of the wall, but they \u201cknow nothing about negotiations \u2014 zero.\u201d He then launched into the story of the Doral purchase as an example of how he would convince other countries to meet his terms in foreign policy and on trade deals that he said shortchange the United States.\n\n\u201cI can take anybody in this massive audience and I can say where do you originally come from \u2014 your parents, your grandparents \u2014 and they\u2019ll give me a name and I\u2019ll say that country is ripping us off,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEverybody is ripping us off. Every country is ripping us off. So we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore.\u201d\n\nTrump spent a big chunk of his speech talking about polls, which he called his \u201cfavorite subject.\u201d He reeled off a list of national and state polls that show him in the lead. The exceptions are two Iowa polls that put him in second place behind Ben Carson. Trump said he doesn\u2019t believe those polls.\n\nWhen Trump blasted \u201cdishonest media\u201d that he said don\u2019t want to see him win, the crowd joined him with a chorus of boos. At one point, Trump tossed aside a copy of the Wall Street Journal after criticizing its coverage.\n\nThe midday sun on a cloudless sky took its toll on several people who had fainting spells. Trump stopped his speech at one point to make sure a woman was all right.\n\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d he said. \u201cTell her I love her the best. I love the women that faint when I speak.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance drew people from outside Northeast Florida.\n\nWhite Springs resident Arlene Slavik, who made the 70-mile drive to Jacksonville, said after the speech that Trump\u2019s business background is just what the country needs. She said she likes how Trump\u2019s message is based on building the wall to stop illegal immigration, focusing on rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure and creating trade policies \u201cthat bring jobs back to America.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other politician has really addressed it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may say it and give you lip service, but when it comes down to it, they don\u2019t do anything. Give the businessman a try. We have nothing to lose. We really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDino Rentos, who drove from Orlando, said his support for Trump isn\u2019t just about the positions Trump takes on issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his attitude,\u201d Rentos said. \u201cWe need someone who is willing to get in there and throw some elbows in Washington. It\u2019s broken.\u201d\n\nBut Howden, who was part of the anti-Trump protest, said she doubts Trump will get the Republican nomination or have any lasting impact on the nation\u2019s politics.\n\n\u201cHe has no policy positions really,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get the Mexicans to build the wall.\u201d\n\nDavid Bauerlein: (904) 359-4581", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of supporters chanting \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump\u201d and \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d cheered presidential candidate Donald Trump throughout his 80-minute speech Saturday to a crowd crammed into The Jacksonville Landing\u2019s courtyard.Coming on the heels of Trump\u2019s campaign stop Friday in Miami, Jacksonville is the second Florida city visited by Trump as polls show him leading two other candidates who are rooted in state politics \u2014 former Gov.
