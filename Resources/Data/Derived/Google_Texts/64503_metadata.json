Here\u2019s what some AP writers are seeing:\n\n____\n\nALEXANDER WANG, HEAVY METAL AND KANYE TOO\n\nAs Alexander Wang took his victory jog up and down the runway after his packed show on Saturday, he ran by a set of special guests and blew them some kisses: the Kanye West family, including Mom, Dad and little North.\n\nIt was two days after West\u2019s own high-profile show featuring his collaboration with Adidas, and he was relaxed and smiling as he sat between wife Kim Kardashian and singer Nicki Minaj. North, too, very hip in all black for a Saturday night out, was relaxed and happy, after fussing during Dad\u2019s show. Clearly it\u2019s much less stressful when someone else\u2019s designs are being scrutinized.\n\nAs for those designs: Wang offered his usual highly conceptual show, focusing on a theme of heavy metal - both in music, and in clothes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a musical component to my collections, and we loved the idea of AC/DC and Kiss and Led Zeppelin,\u201d he said in a backstage interview. \u201cAnd then we were extracting the idea of metal both in a literal sense, and how do we apply it to clothing - whether it\u2019s fabric or metal trimming or hardware, and also the mood of metal and the attitude.\u201d\n\nWhat this all meant was black - lots and lots of it, almost exclusively - and studs or chains on almost every garment, whether sleek pantsuits or long skirts or heavy black boots.\n\nThere was also a nod to Victorian codes of dressing - articulated waists and corsetry - and, of course, some sheer chainmail. Because, noted Wang: \u201cHow can you have a metal collection without chainmail? But we wanted it to feel really slinky, so we finished the hems of skirts like T-shirts and gave some velvet to it, for sensuality.\u201d\n\nWang said that fall and winter clothes don\u2019t necessarily make him think black, black, black; Last winter, for example, he presented a colorful collection of heat-activated garments. But he said that people always ask for clothes they see in his collections to be made in black. \u201cSo this time we said, why don\u2019t we start the collection in all black?\u201d\n\nSo everyone still wants black? \u201cAt least our customer does,\u201d he said.\n\nIn keeping with the heaviness of the theme, models had appropriately scowls and hair in their eyes. And speaking of the models, one of them had a special connection to the front row: none other than Kendall Jenner, half-sister of Kim Kardashian.\n\n-Jocelyn Noveck\n\n____\n\nCOCO ROCHA\u2019S BABY BUMP\n\nCoco Rocha\u2019s baby bump has caught up with the limelight and the proud supermodel mama couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\nThe redheaded beauty was backstage Saturday at Christian Siriano\u2019s New York Fashion Week show, posing for cameras and chatting about her spring arrival - a girl!\n\nNo names yet, but five or six are on the table.\n\n\u201cI hope that I\u2019ll be the type that once I see her I\u2019ll know, but I haven\u2019t been able to hone down on one. It\u2019s hard when you haven\u2019t met a human being and then you think that\u2019s going to be the name for the rest of her life,\u201d said Rocha, dressed in a tight high-neck, black-and-white print Siriano dress - her bump on display.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding. I\u2019m so excited. It took a while for the bump to show so now that it\u2019s showing it\u2019s been fun,\u201d a beaming Rocha said.\n\nSiriano sent out an African jungle-inspired collection of florals and animal prints, including a muted tiger stripe cashmere coat, against a welcome backdrop of potted green foliage. He sweated out the snowy weather with a nervous smile after making contact with clients and buyers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s snowing and it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day and it\u2019s later, so it\u2019s a challenge for people to get in,\u201d he said of his afternoon show in an industrial space downtown, away from the hustle of the Lincoln Center tents.\n\nAmong his backstage guests were Brad Goreski, the celebrity stylist and fresh face with Kathy Griffin on \u201cFashion Police\u201d as the E! show regroups after the passing of stalwart Joan Rivers. With Joan\u2019s daughter Melissa Rivers still behind the camera, how is he settling in?\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s been so welcoming,\u201d Goreski said. \u201cWe\u2019re having the best time and, you know, Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana (Rancic) and Kathy and myself are just getting naughtier and naughtier as the weeks go on.\u201d\n\nSo who does he have his eye on to shine at the Academy Awards?\n\n\u201cI have very high hopes for Emma Stone. She\u2019s been my favorite this year so far at every awards show and I feel like the Oscars are going to be no exception.\u201d\n\n-Leanne Italie\n\n____\n\nRIHANNA\u2019S GOT IT IN THE BAG\n\nRihanna won\u2019t let Kanye West take the style spotlight at New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe Grammy Award winner introduced a new one-off bag she designed for Fendi at the brand\u2019s first store opening in New York on Friday.\n\nShe praised West\u2019s Yeezy Boost sneakers, rolled at the day before at a runway show that included Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and a crying North West in the front row.\n\n\u201cI think it was amazing. I love that he takes risks. I love that he pushes boundaries and it was very Kanye,\u201d she said of his effort.\n\nRihanna\u2019s Fendi baguette bag is part of a larger project in which five different women try their hand at accessory-designing for charity.\n\nThe five baguette purses will be displayed in Fendi\u2019s new flagship store until 13 March and will be up for auction. Proceeds will benefit five charities chosen by the five designers.\n\n-Cristina Jaleru\n\n____\n\nFollow AP Fashion at twitter.com/AP_Fashion", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Associated Press is all over New York Fashion Week, from its runway fashions to celebrity-packed events.
