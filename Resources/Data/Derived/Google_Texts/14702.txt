If there’s one thing Heather Brownell wants everyone to know, it’s that just because others may live in Hamilton Co. doesn’t mean they’re privileged.

“There is a big misnomer that people in Hamilton County are fine,” Brownell, the executive director of the Heart and Soul Clinic of Westfield, said. “You still have people who are homeless, and you have people who don’t know how to navigate the system and get health care and dental needs.”

Heart and Soul Clinic, 202 Penn St., aims to provide free health and dental care to those who are uninsured or underinsured. The Tea and Fashion show, set for 2 to 4 p.m. April 24 at East Street Studios, 18880 N. East St., helps the clinic raise money to provide the free care.

“Now what we are also seeing is a group of individuals called the underinsured, and those are groups that can’t be on Medicaid but can’t afford to pay the policy,” Brownell said. “There is still a need for healthcare, the Affordable Care Act didn’t solve all the problems with the healthcare system.”

Heart and Soul is open on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month for free health care, and the dental clinic was recently launched as well, open on the first Saturday of each month. The dental clinic is estimated to cost approximately $38,000 to run each year, and Brownell said the Tea and Fashion show is the biggest fundraiser for the clinic.

A silent auction, fashion show with items from Francesca’s and Union Street Flowers and Gifts, shopping and catering with tea, punch and finger foods like mini scones and sandwiches will be available at the event. The shopping is new this year, and will have local apparel and accessories for sale. Brownell suggested that those who attend wishing to shop arrive at 1:30 p.m. or earlier.

Tickets cost $50 for individuals or $350 for a sponsored table of eight. The deadline to purchase tickets is April 22.

To purchase tickets, visit the Heart and Soul Clinic or call 317-804-5782.
