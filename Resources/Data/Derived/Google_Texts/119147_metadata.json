Not only have three Democrats already launched their 2016 congressional campaigns, but two of them have already raised big bucks in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nMonica Vernon, a Democrat City Council member from Cedar Rapids, announced her candidacy in January. Vernon failed to capture the Democratic nomination for Congress in the First District in 2014, but was selected by Jack Hatch to be his Lt. Governor nominee for his race for Governor. Despite her inability to win the Democrat nomination in 2014, Vernon proved that she was an astute fundraiser. Vernon raised nearly $800,000 for her congressional primary campaign but finished second with only 23 percent of the vote. Vernon spent $130 per vote in her failed congressional campaign in 2014.\n\nVernon raised $190,513.30 in the first quarter of 2015 and loaned her campaign another $110,000. Vernon has $289,976.43 cash-on-hand for her 2016 congressional campaign. Ravi Patel, an entrepreneur who moved from the Second Congressional District to the First District in order to run against Blum, raised a stunning $539,658.05 in the first three months of 2015 and has $498,140.83 in the bank.\n\nPatel\u2019s initial fundraising number is even more staggering since it doesn\u2019t include any loans from the candidate himself. To put Patel\u2019s fundraising haul in perspective, it is more than double what Democrat Swati Dandekar raised in her initial fundraising period in 2014 in the First District race. In fact, Patel\u2019s $539,658 even dwarfs the nearly $400,000 that Mark Jacobs raised during his initial fundraising quarter in the 2014 Republican U.S. Senate primary not counting the personal money Jacobs put in the race. Like Jacobs, most of the money Patel raised is from outside of the state.\n\nThe third Democrat candidate, Gary Kroeger, a former cast member of Saturday Night Live who lives in Cedar Falls, announced his candidacy earlier this month and thus does not have to file a fundraising disclosure until June.\n\nThe eventual Democrat nominee will face first-term Republican Congressman Rod Blum in the general election. Blum raised $119,543.04 in his initial fundraising period as an incumbent. The total includes $4,000 from former Congressman Tom Latham\u2019s leadership PAC, $5,000 from Senator Joni Ernst\u2019s leadership PAC, and $5,000 from Jobs Growth, and Freedom PAC, Texas Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s leadership PAC. Blum also received $1,500 from Congressman Daniel Webster, who he cast his vote in favor of as Speaker of the House instead of John Boehner.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Blum understands that his re-election is not a given. In the first quarter of 2015, Blum, a Dubuque businessman, loaned his campaign $500,000. At the end of March, Blum reported having $644,373.01 in his campaign account. Blum also loaned his campaign $100,000 last September, and thus now has personal debt of $600,000 by his congressional campaign.\n\nBlum won his congressional seat in 2014 by defeating State Representative Pat Murphy by 6,617 votes. Congressman Bruce Braley, who ran for the open U.S. Senate seat in 2014 and lost to Joni Ernst by 94,000 votes, previously held the seat. Iowa\u2019s First Congressional District has a Democrat registered voter advantage. As of April, there are 21,245 more registered Democrat voters than registered Republicans in this district. The Democrat advantage in the First is confined to just three counties \u2013 Black Hawk, Dubuque, and Linn. In 2014, In 2012, President Obama beat Mitt Romney by 54,832 votes in the First Congressional District.\n\nBlum\u2019s ability to front his re-election campaign significant funds means that his 2016 campaign will be a top-notch operation. Senator Chuck Grassley, who is up for re-election in 2016, should also provide Blum some political cover even in a presidential cycle. Grassley\u2019s polling numbers are stellar, and the First Congressional District contains Grassley\u2019s home turf.\n\nEven though the money being raised by Vernon and Patel is impressive, a competitive Democrat primary could once again help Blum. Democrats in 2014 raised scads of money in the primary, but they had to spend every dime they raised. Furthermore, the 2014 Democrat nominee wasn\u2019t the candidate who ran the best campaign or had the most money. Pat Murphy won the Democrat primary because he was the most liberal candidate and had the closest relationship to organized labor.\n\nThe First District race will likely be one of the top targets for the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016. Watching to see what the unions and Democrat leaders do in this primary will be interesting. Blum will have his work cut out for him, but he\u2019s proven to be an excellent campaigner and his financial commitment to his re-election campaign already indicates that he\u2019s taking it seriously.\n\nA quick look at the other incumbent\u2019s financial reports.\n\nCongressman Dave Loebsack\n\nIowa\u2019s Second Congressional District\n\n$197,025.50 raised.\n\n$139,025.00 was from Political Action Committees.\n\n$62,936.2 spent.\n\n$168,811.55 cash on hand.\n\nNote: Loebsack is never flashy in the fundraising department, but slow and steady will win you a lot of races.\n\nCongressman David Young\n\nIowa\u2019s Third Congressional District\n\n$333,290.00 raised.\n\n$106,890.00 was from Political Action Committees.\n\n$37,503.39 spent.\n\n$351,623.61 cash on hand.\n\nNote: Young still owes himself $250,000 from his 2014 campaign. Young\u2019s fundraising ability as an incumbent should not come as a surprise to anyone. The biggest obstacle for Young was getting elected, I actually think he will be very difficult to unseat. That goes for primary and general elections.\n\nCongressman Steve King\n\nIowa\u2019s Forth Congressional District\n\n$45,293.41 raised.\n\n$9,000 was from Political Action Committees.\n\n$83,452.83 spent.\n\n$95,791.33 cash on hand.\n\nNote: For as much attention as King warrants in advance of the caucuses, he has yet to find a way to help himself raise money for his campaign committee. King received massive amounts of attention for his January presidential event, the Iowa Freedom Summit, yet it didn\u2019t really benefit him personally. Making things even worse is King\u2019s high burn rate. It\u2019s a good thing that King represents the most conservative District in the state.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3833\"", "article_summary": "The First District race will likely be one of the top targets for the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016.\nVernon raised nearly $800,000 for her congressional primary campaign but finished second with only 23 percent of the vote.\nWhile presidential politics has captivated political onlookers in Iowa this spring, the campaign in Iowa\u2019s First Congressional District also got off to a quick start.\nIn 2014, In 2012, President Obama beat Mitt Romney by 54,832 votes in the First Congressional District.\nBlum also loaned his campaign $100,000 last September, and thus now has personal debt of $600,000 by his congressional campaign."}
