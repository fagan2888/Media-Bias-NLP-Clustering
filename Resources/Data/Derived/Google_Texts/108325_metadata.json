The sport, however, creates pause. Six-time all-star Matt Holliday underwent an emergency appendectomy after a three-hit performance in the Cardinals\u2019 opening-day loss in 2011.\n\nHolliday returned after missing eight days, avoiding a disabled list stay when a month-long absence was predicted after the procedure. Holliday was 31 when his appendix was removed, eight years older than Ball. While Ball\u2019s age should help the running back\u2019s recovery, Holliday said, football presents a different challenge.\n\n\u201cI played quickly. And I was ready after a week ,\u201d said Holliday, whose Cardinals gave him a few extra days as a concession to the season\u2019s length. \u201cBut I am sure the chance of getting a helmet to the gut changes the dynamic a bit.\u201d\n\nA workout and nutrition fanatic, Holliday, a former high school quarterback, pushed to return. He once used suitcases as barbells while playing in Panama when no gym was available, so motivation was never a problem. The pain presented an issue. Thirty years ago, an appendectomy sidelined players indefinitely. Three tiny incisions remind Holliday of his operation, a testament to the advances in medicine.\n\nBut surgery remains surgery, leading to the loss of weight and strength.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part was just getting over the soreness of the invasiveness of the procedure,\u201d Holliday said.\n\nBall sat out Thursday \u2014 Ronnie Hillman started \u2014 and will miss the Broncos\u2019 second preseason game Aug. 17 at San Francisco. Ideally, he will play in the third exhibition game, but missing the preseason hasn\u2019t been ruled out if more rest is needed to have Ball available for the season opener Sept. 7.\n\nTroy E.
