The current boom in new home construction could be the basis for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. As The Wall Street Journal\u2019s John Carney reports, U.S. housing starts in July rose 0.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.21 million, hitting their highest levels since October 2007. Starts on single-family homes, which exclude apartments, were up 12.8%.\n\nNew home construction acts as a bellwether to employment, as changes in housing starts tend to predict the direction of the unemployment rate some 12 to 18 months later. The strong link between the two may be one of the most powerful economic indicators. Even seemingly unrelated industries, such as legal services, tend to benefit from surges in construction. Strong demand for homes could also ameliorate some of the squeeze that rising interest rates could put on mortgage lending.\n\nCFO JOURNAL TODAY\n\nMost U.S. companies could pass new EU auditor-fees sniff test. The majority of U.S. companies would breeze through recent European rules limiting the amount of money a company\u2019s auditor can collect on additional client services, were the policy to be imposed over here, writes CFO Journal\u2019s Maxwell Murphy.

Companies are relying more on internal auditors for defense against cybersecurity breaches, but many who aspire to be internal auditors lack that skill set.

Six out of 10 internal auditors surveyed said they have a background in accounting.\n\nCourt decision could affect conflict minerals audits. A federal appeals court upheld an earlier decision Tuesday on part of a Dodd-Frank Act regulation requiring public companies to disclose whether their products contain conflict minerals. The court previously said requiring the labeling violates free speech under the First Amendment, writes CFO Journal\u2019s Emily Chasan. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the decision, which could affect how companies prepare for audits of their conflict mineral reports next year. Companies are struggling to get results in their efforts to find \u201cconflict minerals\u201d \u2013 tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold\u2013 blamed for fueling violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in their supply chain.\n\nWachtell Lipton sees merits of ditching quarterly reports.
