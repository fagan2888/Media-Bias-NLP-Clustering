Saturday, Aug. 9 8 a.m. clean-up \"Tails to the rail!\" Grant Ary, of Fremont County 4-H Horse Council, shouted as he called each senior division western showmanship contestant into the arena Saturday morning at Pathfinder Park. \"And keep smiling!\" Each girl did as they silently squared their horse up at the end of the arena and waited their moment with the event's judge, Sandi Thurston. The event may be one of the quietest, but the girls prove that a lot of communication goes into succeeding. \"Western showmanship is all about the connection you have with your horse,\" said senior division competitor Morgan Weaver, 18. She and her horse, Skippy, have been competing in the event for 14 years and ended their 4-H career with a first place in the senior division Saturday morning. The judge looks for how well the competitor and the horse communicate. As Thurston would walk around Skippy for inspection, Morgan Weaver would switch sides without skipping a beat. \"It's almost like she's horse whispering,\" laughed Julie Weaver, Morgan's mom. Morgan Weaver said she felt safe with Skippy, they've been working, and winning, together for a long time, and 4-H was the start of it all. \"4-H was the best thing I could have done,\" she said. It prepared her for the three-day event, which is often described as the equestrian triathlon, with the American Evening Association. The three-day eventing consists of dressage on the first day, cross-country on the second day and jumping on the third day. \"You have to have a really good bond with your horse to do all of that,\" Julie Weaver said. \"Or else the horse or the rider or both could get seriously hurt. 4-H was a huge foundation for that.\" Morgan Weaver is 10th in the nation for three-day eventing \u2014 a testimony to the relationship she has with Skippy. Western showmanship is an event that lasts the entirety of a contestant's 4-H career, Thurston said. So, the bond is inevitable. Kind of like Thurston's bond with 4-H. \"I'm true-blue 4-H,\" Thurston said. She competed when she was a kid and has been judging western showmanship since the 1970s. \"I want them (the competitors) to walk away feeling good about their projects,\" she said. The competition can be nerve wrecking, she admitted, but she tries to make the competitors feel relaxed in the arena. \"I always smile and say good morning,\" she said. For first-time competitor Karlie Aragon, 8, the nervousness barely was apparent behind her ear-to-ear smile. Though, she did throw a nod when asked if she was. Her horse, Stretch, is seasoned for the event at 23-years-old. Karlie's sister and mom have showed him, too. \"Tails to the rail!\" Ary shouted one more time. \"And don't stop smiling!\" The last minute advice wasn't a problem for Karlie. Karlie was the only novice competitor for the day. So, she won first place, but the real win, her mom said, was the confidence Karlie has gained in her first year of 4-H working with Stretch, other competitors and instructors. The benefits 4-H has are great, Thurston said. Sometimes it's the bond; sometimes it's the confidence.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26225906/horse-whisperers-4-hers-compete-during-western-showmanship", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0727/20140727__28DRFAIRw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Kara Mason  \n \n  Special to the Daily Record", "description": "\"Tails to the rail!\" Grant Ary, of Fremont County 4-H Horse Council, shouted as he called each senior division western showmanship contestant into the arena Saturday morning at Pathfinder Park. \"And keep smiling!\"\n\nEach girl did as they silently squared their horse up at the end of the arena and waited their moment with the event's judge, Sandi Thurston.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26225906:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-27T12:27:46-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26225906/horse-whisperers-4-hers-compete-during-western-showmanship", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0727/20140727__28DRFAIRw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\"Tails to the rail!\" Grant Ary, of Fremont County 4-H Horse Council, shouted as he called each senior division western showmanship contestant into the arena Saturday morning at Pathfinder Park. \"And keep smiling!\"\n\nEach girl did as they silently squared their horse up at the end of the arena and waited their moment with the event's judge, Sandi Thurston.", "title": "Horse Whisperers: 4-Hers compete during western showmanship event at Pathfinder Park"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "\"Tails to the rail!\" Grant Ary, of Fremont County 4-H Horse Council, shouted as he called each senior division western showmanship contestant into the arena Saturday morning at Pathfinder Park. \"And keep smiling!\"\n\nEach girl did as they silently squared their horse up at the end of the arena and waited their moment with the event's judge, Sandi Thurston.", "title": "Horse Whisperers: 4-Hers compete during western showmanship event at Pathfinder Park", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26225906/horse-whisperers-4-hers-compete-during-western-showmanship", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0727/20140727__28DRFAIRw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-27T12:27:46-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Horse Whisperers: 4-Hers compete during western showmanship event at Pathfinder Park", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0727/20140727__28DRFAIRw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2014-07-27T12:29:52-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-27T12:27:20-0600", "byline": "By Kara Mason", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-07-27T12:31:10-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca668\"", "article_summary": "Print Email Font Resize Font Resize Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic Horse Whisperers: 4-Hers compete during western showmanship event at Pathfinder ParkKarlie Aragon, 8, with her horse, Stretch, compete in the Saturday in the 4-H Western Showmanship competition at Pathfinder Park in Florence.\n9 a.m. 4-H interview judging begins for all 4-H projects to include Clothing & Heritage Arts at the 4-H Building.\n(Kara Mason/ Daily Record) Morgan Weaver competes with Skippy on Saturday during the 4-H Western Showmanship competition at Pathfinder Park.\n4-H Building closes.\nTuesday 7 a.m. Open, Golden Age, Homemade Wine and Novice Youth entries will be accepted at the 4-H Building."}
