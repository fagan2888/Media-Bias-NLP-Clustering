On Valentine\u2019s Day, they celebrated their second wedding anniversary \u2014 at a USA weightlifting event.\n\nThis week, the Benningtons will open \u201cSeaward Crossfit,\u201d a new Crossfit gym on Boulevard of the Arts.\n\nThe gym came together incrementally, just like their relationship. Local athletes painted the walls green and blue a couple of weekends ago. Barbells and bumper plates arrived a few days later. Next, a logo \u2014 a glaring octupus with curling tentacles \u2014 debuted on Facebook.\n\nThe couple chose Sarasota for their venture because it\u2019s Chuck Bennington\u2019s hometown, and close to family. A Sarasota High graduate, Chuck Bennington, 28, found Crossfit online while serving in the U.S. Air Force. Vanessa Bennington, 34, began the workouts while attending graduate school in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nNow, Chuck Bennington travels across the globe to teach Crossfit Gymnastics certification courses. Vanessa Bennington keeps up with workouts while working as a nurse practitioner.\n\nBecause Crossfit has become among the most popular workouts in the U.S. in the past decade, the Benningtons acknowledge that the success of their gym relies on creating a place that can simultaneously cater to both experienced athletes and novices.\n\nSince its founding in 2000, Crossfit has grown to include more than 7,000 affiliated gyms. Members participate in \u201cWODs\u201d (Workouts of the Day). The program champions building overall fitness, as opposed to specializing in specific disciplines through a range of workouts that might include repetitively deadlifting a barbell, flipping massive tires or completing handstand push-ups.\n\nCrossfit has received criticism, as well, for being overly competitive and for causing workout-related injuries. Proponents counter that the Crossfit program itself is sound; individual trainers may not be.\n\nAt Seaward Crossfit, novices will complete a \u201cFoundations\u201d class, mastering basics before advancing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily feel like your average layperson should be brought right into a Crossfit gym,\u201d Vanessa Bennington says.\n\nSuccess will stem from safety over competitiveness, especially for beginners, the Benningtons say.\n\nIt\u2019s a philosophy, combined with individualized attention, a unique camraderie and guided classes, that patrons have shown they are willing to pay for. Classes at Crossfit gyms \u2014 including Seaward Crossfit \u2014 typically charge between $10 to $30, the same price that the average fitness gym charges for monthly memberships.\n\n\u201cYou need to be technically efficient,\u201d Chuck Bennington adds. \u201cYou need to know why you are doing something.\u201d\n\nNeither Vanessa or Chuck Bennington played sports as children.\n\nChuck Bennington didn\u2019t start working out until he joined the military. In high school, Vanessa Bennington suffered from eating disorders and an unhealthy obsession with exercise. It wasn\u2019t until she started doing Crossfit \u2014 and earning certifications as an instructor \u2014 that she began to re-evaluate what it means to be physically fit.\n\n\u201cThey valued how you performed,\u201d Vanessa Bennington said. \u201cI started to say, \u201cI\u2019m strong. I\u2019m good at this. It made me feel like an athlete, which I had never felt like.\u201d\n\nChuck Bennington flew to Texas from Sarasota to meet his future wife in 2009, months after they began chatting online on a Crossfit forum.\n\nWithin six months, he moved and begun working at a GSX Crossfit gym, where Vanessa Bennington trained.\n\nFrom the beginning, the couple talked about opening their own gym, even after Vanessa Bennington pursued a nursing career and Chuck Bennington was promoted to GSX\u2019s director of operations, and traveled the globe to teach Crossfit Gymnastics certification courses.\n\nAfter they married in 2012, they felt ready for a change. Last year, they moved to Sarasota, and recruited two friends from Texas to join them in Seaward. Chantel Zandi and Dale Wilson, formerly of GSX Crossfit, agreed to join the new gym as coaches, along with intern Samm Kayne.\n\n\u201cI think it was about us being able to create something on our own,\u201d Zandi, 28, says.\n\nWilson, 22, agrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crew of like-minded invidivuals who value being better at what we do and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the new team finished laying down mats and setting up barbells for a free community class on Saturday. The gym is open officially for business on March 10.\n\nWhen Chuck Bennington first flew to see the woman he loved six years ago, he says he didn\u2019t expect to find out something else.\n\n\u201cI loved teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cI never expected that in a million years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/03/wpDCROSSFIT.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dec\"", "article_summary": "This week, the Benningtons will open \u201cSeaward Crossfit,\u201d a new Crossfit gym on Boulevard of the Arts.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily feel like your average layperson should be brought right into a Crossfit gym,\u201d Vanessa Bennington says.\nClasses at Crossfit gyms \u2014 including Seaward Crossfit \u2014 typically charge between $10 to $30, the same price that the average fitness gym charges for monthly memberships.\nWithin six months, he moved and begun working at a GSX Crossfit gym, where Vanessa Bennington trained.\nThe couple met six years ago on a Crossfit program messageboard, and had their first date at a trainer certification course."}
