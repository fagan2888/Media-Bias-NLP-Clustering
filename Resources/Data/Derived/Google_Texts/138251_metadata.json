That's the daytime show in which four lovely ladies and \"one lucky guy\" chew over the news of the moment like a pitbull on a raw steak.\n\nThe topic is the Senate torture report and the guy is Jesse Watters, the Fox News contributor best known for his reports on The O'Reilly Factor. Watters pronounces that he doesn't even want to know what's in the report because \"people do nasty things in the dark.\" And besides, what is it that Bill Clinton used to say? Oh yeah: There's nothing new here:\n\n\u201cThey Senate Democrats, they\u2019re just trying to get one last shot in at Bush before they go into the minority!\u201d the correspondent opined. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t even interview any of the CIA interrogators to do the report.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like how Rolling Stone does their reporting, they only get one side,\u201d he added, referring to a controversial report about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. \u201cYou know, the Democrats didn\u2019t care about transparency when they were destroying hard drives at the IRS.\u201d\n\nWatters' whinging is outdone by Outnumbered and Five co-host Andrea Tantaros, who pulls out all the patriotic stops short of singing the national anthem:\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is awesome, we are awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had this discussion. We\u2019ve closed the book on it, and we\u2019ve stopped doing it. And the reason they want to have this discussion is not to show how awesome we are. This administration wants to have this discussion to show us how we\u2019re not awesome.\u201d\n\nThe lone voice of reason and skepticism toward unchecked government power? That would be The Independent's Kennedy, who pushes back on the pro-torture, pro-opaque members of the panel. She's the real patriot in my book.\n\nThe whole segment is worth watching but the fireworks begin around 2.14.\n\nRelated: \"After torture report, our moral authority as a nation is gone.\"\n\nAnd hell, it's awards season, so take a minute to enjoy \"Which President Bombed Iraq Best?\":", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Via Raw Story comes this pretty amazing colloquy from a couple of days back on Fox News Channel's Outnumbered.
