While many of Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments Tuesday before Congress were greeted by loud applause from lawmakers, one former lawmaker was also singing his praises on Facebook.

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin took to social media to simultaneously bash President Barack Obama while also offering up her support for Netanyahu and urging others to support him.

“All of the Obama administration’s many failures in the Middle East – from the descent of Libya into a terrorist playground to the rise of ISIS – pale in comparison to the farce unfolding in Iran,” Palin writes. “The Obama administration is negotiating with the Iranian regime as it builds a nuclear bomb right under our noses.”

She goes on to say “America has to wake up.”

“We swore ‘never again’ would we allow anyone to try to wipe out the Jewish people or commit mass genocide like we saw during World War II, and yet we’re allowing a regime that promises genocide to acquire nukes,” she writes.

Obama was not impressed with Netanyahu’s speech, saying the prime minister didn’t offer up any “viable alternatives” to the nuclear negotiations with Iran.
