He also said it's important to consider in conversations the town's infrastructure needs, including the town hall and library.\n\nIn his tenure, Nickerson said he initiated a feasibility study for sewers in Saunders Point, worked on the issue of the Oswegatchie Hills, and helped secure a state grant to bring restrooms to Cini Park. He pointed to economic development in town, from a lease being signed for Costco at Gateway Commons to small businesses and restaurants.\n\n\"There's investment being made in our town at every level,\" he said.\n\nCarpenteri said that in his time on three town boards, he has learned about the town and seen it change and grow. While he said he is happy with the overall direction of the town, he thinks it's time to slow down and listen to what town residents want in terms of its growth.\n\n\"I'm pleased, but I think we need to watch what's going on with the growth,\" he said.\n\nNickerson said his leadership style is to empower others, lead by example and communicate with people.\n\nCarpenteri said he's a believer in listening to what residents' want for the town and dealing with each issue as it arises.\n\nIn addition to the first selectman's race, six candidates are vying for five seats on the Board of Selectmen.\n\nThe race features Democrats Bill Henderson, Daniel Cunningham, and Rose Ann Hardy and Republicans Kevin Seery, Marc Salerno and Holly Cheeseman.\n\nCheeseman, a selectwoman since 2011 and the executive director of the Children's Museum of Southeastern Connecticut, said an issue facing the town is funding the services brought about by changing demographics, including the renovation and consolidation of the elementary schools and programs for seniors.\n\nTo save money, she said the town should pursue creative ideas and efficiencies, including working together with the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments. She said purchasing cooperatives with neighboring towns and the school board will add up to savings.\n\nCunningham, a Niantic attorney, said the administration will be tasked with ensuring the Gateway Commons developers complete plans for the commercial component. The board will also have to strike a balance for Niantic, he said.\n\n\"I think the biggest challenge that we're going to be facing is managing and keeping the small town charm and atmosphere and still making it accessible for those who want to visit Niantic,\" he said. \"We have to try to balance those concerns.\"\n\nHardy, an East Lyme High School teacher with three decades on the board, said it is important to retain the town's uniqueness, including by keeping small buildings on Main Street, having developments that set aside a portion of land for open space, and supporting farms on the town's historically rural north side.\n\nShe also said aquifer protection in town is a priority.\n\nHenderson, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1298, said he is in favor of controlling growth and maintaining the small town atmosphere in East Lyme. He said he disagreed with a recent decision to approve an additional 120 units at Gateway Commons.\n\n\"We're losing that local quality that we've had in the town,\" he said.\n\nSalerno, an engineer who has served as a selectman since January and as the former Zoning Commission chairman, said it will be important for the board to balance needs, such as aging infrastructure, with fiscal responsibility.\n\n\"With increases in the grand list, we can't just spend it,\" he said. \"We need to make sure we balance it for future generations.\"\n\nDeputy First Selectman Seery, a retired state trooper, said continuing to monitor spending, keeping taxes affordable and working on the elementary schools project are priorities.\n\nSeery said it will be important for the town to hold information sessions on the elementary schools proposal. He said the Board of Selectmen will need to make sure the plan is well-presented, well thought out and includes all the necessary information, such as its impact on taxes, before moving it to referendum to let the voters decide.\n\nk.drelich@theday.com\n\nTwitter: @KimberlyDrelich", "article_metadata": {"description": "East Lyme \u2014\u00a0First Selectman Mark Nickerson, a Republican,\u00a0and Democratic challenger Steve Carpenteri, a Board of Finance member, are", "og": {"site_name": "The Day", "description": "East Lyme \u2014\u00a0First Selectman Mark Nickerson, a Republican,\u00a0and Democratic challenger Steve Carpenteri, a Board of Finance member, are", "title": "Nickerson and Carpenteri vie for first selectman in East Lyme", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20151025/NWS01/151029477", "image": "http://www.theday.com/Assets/images/facebook/day_logo_291.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "East Lyme \u2014\u00a0First Selectman Mark Nickerson, a Republican,\u00a0and Democratic challenger Steve Carpenteri, a Board of Finance member, are", "title": "Nickerson and Carpenteri vie for first selectman in East Lyme", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20151025/NWS01/151029477", "image": "http://www.theday.com/Assets/images/facebook/dayD_300x300.png", "site": "@thedayct", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Nickerson and Carpenteri vie for first selectman in East Lyme, Local News, East Lyme CT,The Day,2015 Elections", "article": {"published_time": 20151025175330, "modified_time": 201510261844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Nickerson and Carpenteri vie for first selectman in East Lyme, Local News, East Lyme CT,The Day,2015 Elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1a7\"", "article_summary": "East Lyme \u2014 First Selectman Mark Nickerson, a Republican, and Democratic challenger Steve Carpenteri, a Board of Finance member, are facing off in the Nov. 3 election.\nHenderson, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1298, said he is in favor of controlling growth and maintaining the small town atmosphere in East Lyme.\nCarpenteri said the top issues facing the town are the elementary schools project and Gateway Commons.\nDeputy First Selectman Seery, a retired state trooper, said continuing to monitor spending, keeping taxes affordable and working on the elementary schools project are priorities.\nSeery said it will be important for the town to hold information sessions on the elementary schools proposal."}
