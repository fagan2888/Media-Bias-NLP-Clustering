REUTERS/Andrew Cullen\n\n4394378\n\nSeldom has so much good news been portrayed so negatively. Oil prices continue to fall in the U.S. and around the world, but near everyone in the media is grumpy about it. The headlines today are among the silliest I\u2019ve seen: Energy-company stocks are declining, oil deflation is an economic threat, the Fed might raise rates much later than expected, OPEC is dissolving, shale companies are going bankrupt, Russia is going bankrupt(!), and on and on.\n\nWell, most of this is just humbug. Lower oil prices are unambiguously positive.\n\nFirst, U.S. oil production has nearly doubled in recent years to 9 million barrels a day, and the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) expects U.S. supply to rise by more than 1 million barrels a day next year. And it is this supply increase that is driving down prices. Saudi Arabia and OPEC have essentially thrown in the towel, surrendering to the inevitability of lower prices from exploding U.S. energy production.\n\nThis is not only a triumph of U.S. energy independence, it is a victory for the workings of the free market. Greater supply, not government cartels, is driving down prices.\n\nAnd the latest oil-price drop of nearly $8 a barrel makes the economic outlook even rosier. Apart from the declining share prices of some oil producers, virtually every other aspect of the world economy benefits, including most world stock markets. (By the way, the IEA reports that most production in the Bakken formation, one of the main drivers of shale-oil output, remains profitable at or below $42 a barrel.) And here in the U.S., the oil-price drop is a huge tax cut that will primarily help the middle class.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer \u2014 who is still licking his wounds from the huge Democratic midterm losses in the Senate \u2014 is out there attacking Obamacare as the wrong policy to halt the decline of middle-class incomes. What he\u2019d like to see is new big-government policies (wait, wasn\u2019t Obamacare a big-government policy?), including tax favors for targeted segments of the economy, presumably to bolster the middle class.\n\nBut guess what? We just had a free-market tax cut that will boost middle-class incomes and just about everything else.\n\nThe American energy revolution, combined with the market forces of supply and demand, is delivering something on the order of a $125 billion tax cut. Not only have wholesale oil prices dropped from about $100 a barrel to $66, but gasoline prices have fallen from near $4 a gallon to $2.78 at the week\u2019s close.\n\nThat\u2019s a tax cut. With no big-government spending hikes.\n\nWhile very few Democrats, including President Obama, supported the entrepreneurial, innovative dynamism of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, they\u2019ve lately tried to take credit for the oil and gas shale revolution. No one\u2019s buying it. AEI\u2019s Mark Perry actually wonders why the Democrats aren\u2019t scheduling hearings in the lame-duck Congress to blame oil-industry manipulators and evil speculators for the drop in oil prices.\n\nOf course, the far-left Democratic enviros aren\u2019t sitting still. The EPA is now taking aim at the entire U.S. energy industry with its newly proposed smog rules \u2014 probably the most expensive regulations in history \u2014 even though the fracking revolution is producing much cleaner energy than ever before.\n\nSo what we have is a clean-energy revolution, and it\u2019s lighting a much-needed fire under the economy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Larry Kudlow", "description": "And a big tax cut.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Seldom has so much good news been portrayed so negatively.
