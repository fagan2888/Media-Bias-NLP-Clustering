The Food and Drug Administration is now insisting that every one of the chain\u2019s 5,000 stores post menu boards on the wall with calorie counts. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy and it doesn\u2019t help consumers,\u201d Doyle says, because \u201c90 percent of Domino\u2019s orders arrive by phone or Internet and are for delivery, so fewer than one of 10 customers will ever see these signs.\u201d The signs will cost about $2,000 at every store, and each change of menu will require new ones. That is about $10 million of extraneous costs nationwide for Domino\u2019s. Thank you, Washington.\n\nOther than that, Doyle is having a good day when I visit him at the Domino\u2019s world-wide headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich. And a very good year, with sales up 12 percent in the past quarter alone.\n\nThe headquarters are a few miles up the road from where the original Domino\u2019s Pizza opened in 1960. Doyle, who is 51, is tall, stocky, affable and appropriately a Michigan man through and through, having grown up in Midland and earned a degree at the University of Michigan. In his five years as CEO, annual sales have climbed to $9 billion from about $2 billion. Some 250,000 workers wear a Domino\u2019s uniform and sell roughly one billion pizzas each year. During the Super Bowl, Domino\u2019s was taking a dizzying 1,400 orders a minute.\n\nMaking pizzas may not be the sexiest business\u2014though it\u2019s a $125 billion world-wide market. But while investors obsess over finding the next Facebook, the share price of Domino\u2019s has soared from $13 in 2010 to just over $100 today. It has been among the top performing stocks in the Fortune 100.\n\nDoyle has helped take the company global, with stores operating in 80 nations and expansion plans throughout Asia. In sales, Domino\u2019s is now the No. 1 restaurant chain in India. Sub-Saharan Africa is also among the company\u2019s fastest-growing markets, with a billion people and a growing middle class. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered Africans love pizza,\u201d he says. \u201cThey order them on their mobile phones.\u201d\n\nThings weren\u2019t always flying so high in Ann Arbor. Doyle became CEO after two of the company\u2019s worst years, and sales were still sliding. One of his first decisions was to take an unorthodox approach: \u201cWe held a series of focus groups with consumers and we discovered that people hated the pizza. So we ran these TV ads featuring Americans complaining about how bad Domino\u2019s pizza tasted.\u201d Then Doyle appeared on screen with an apology and promise: \u201cWe hear you America. Sometimes you know you\u2019ve got to make a change. Please give us another try.\u201d\n\nHe adds with a laugh that the one thing in his career that impressed his children was when they were in a New York restaurant and comedian Amy Poehler spotted him and shouted, \u201cHey, you\u2019re the pizza guy.\u201d\n\nIn the three months following those ads, Domino\u2019s had its fastest rise in sales in company history. \u201cI think consumers really appreciated that we were direct and honest with them,\u201d he explains. That ad campaign is now considered a textbook crisis-management story, with its lesson in honesty as a best commercial policy.\n\nDomino\u2019s is also riding the digital revolution. \u201cIn a lot of ways we\u2019re really a technology company,\u201d Doyle says. \u201cWe\u2019ve adapted the art of pizza-making to the digital age. Globally, we\u2019re already at a run rate of about $4 billion of digital sales.\u201d He adds that digital drives sales by making ordering easier and more efficient, and saves money on bad orders because customers \u201ctake their own orders so they make fewer mistakes.\u201d\n\nHis goal is to have every iPhone in the world equipped with a Domino\u2019s app, and the company is working with Ford Motor Co. on a voice-activated technology that will let motorists order a large thin-crust pepperoni with onions while driving home from work.\n\nThe atmosphere at company headquarters feels more like Silicon Valley than a fast-food company. Most employees here are computer programmers and technicians monitoring in real time what people are ordering, how long it is taking to fill an order, and the online complaints and comments that stream in. Their mission is to streamline the pizza-making process from the time the order arrives to when the pie is handed off at the customer\u2019s front door. If the goal is delivery in 30 minutes or less, every innovation that shaves 10 or 15 seconds is a major money saver when you\u2019re selling a billion pies a year. Although the Domino\u2019s menu also includes such things as sandwiches, pasta and chicken wings, 80 percent of its sales are pizzas.\n\nDoyle is unconditionally bullish on the U.S. economy. \u201cThe big story since the recession is that American households and businesses have become lean and efficient and have paid down debts. Consumers finally have money and they are starting to spend it,\u201d he says.\n\nMeanwhile, as the head of one of the nation\u2019s biggest employers, Doyle sees the effects of what he calls a \u201ctightening of the labor market\u201d firsthand. \u201cFrankly, right now, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to hire. We have shortages of truck drivers and delivery people.\u201d\n\nSuch real-world experience makes Domino\u2019s a barometer of sorts. \u201cMy take is that the official statistics are underestimating the strength of the labor market. Look, it has been a long, slow recovery. We\u2019re now six years into it and we\u2019ve finally reached the point where there seems to be more demand for labor than there is trained supply.\u201d For job seekers \u201cthat is great news, right?\u201d\n\nAs for those who fret that only the rich are getting richer and upward mobility isn\u2019t possible, Doyle says they should pay more attention to what happens at Domino\u2019s. \u201cOver 90 percent of our 900 franchisees started as an hourly worker in the store,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of them started as delivery drivers at minimum wage. They work their way up. They become a manager. Then they come in, they apply to buy a store.\u201d So from earning $7 or $8 an hour, they now earn $80,000 to $100,000 by operating a franchise. Many have become millionaires. \u201cThis is absolutely a story of upward mobility in America.\u201d\n\nIf he were economic adviser to the president, what reforms would he recommend to accelerate growth and hiring? Without hesitation he says: \u201cSimplify the corporate tax. It\u2019s a killer. We pay 38 percent at Domino\u2019s.\u201d He\u2019s including state and local taxes, but that\u2019s a huge burden, especially given that many large corporations pay below 10 percent. \u201cJust get rid of all the loopholes\u2014and make it fair with a broad base and lower rates.\u201d Then he adds, only half-kidding: \u201cNo one in Washington ever woke up and said \u2018let\u2019s have a loophole for pizza makers.\u2019\u201d Sounds like he needs a lobbyist.\n\nOne of Doyle\u2019s biggest worries is that the Domino\u2019s franchise-owner model\u2014which is also used by thousands of other retail and restaurant stores\u2014has come under assault from trial lawyers, unions and the National Labor Relations Board. These groups want to treat a Domino\u2019s or Popeyes franchise store and the parent company as \u201cjoint employers.\u201d This would mean a locally owned store with a few dozen staff would still have to comply with, for instance, the ObamaCare rules that only apply to firms with more than 50 workers. Seattle passed a minimum-wage law last year that treats franchise restaurants as big businesses that must pay a super-minimum-wage that phases up to $15 an hour.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got 20 million people today employed in the franchise industry in the U.S. Part of why small business owners want to be in a franchise is because they\u2019re getting support from each other, and they\u2019re getting support and ideas from a company. Franchise stores have dramatically higher success rates than people who are just doing it all on their own,\u201d Doyle says. \u201cWhy destroy a model that is almost uniquely American and has been a tremendous success for 50 or 60 years? This would be horribly detrimental.\u201d\n\nDoyle is optimistic about the world economy and how the digital revolution will continue to lift living standards for billions in the coming decade. Even in sub-Saharan Africa per capita incomes are growing at 5 percent annually. \u201cI\u2019m a free trader. I just believe in my core that free markets, technology, innovation, cheap energy and globalization will be triumphant and will make people better off.\u201d They will also, not coincidentally, make people order more pizzas on their smartphones.\n\nOriginally published in The Wall Street Journal", "article_metadata": {"description": "How do you list calories for 34 million pizza variations?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How do you list calories for 34 million pizza variations?", "title": "What the Domino's CEO Would Change on Taxes, Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150320_DominoCEO.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-20T17:46:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xbEcFw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How do you list calories for 34 million pizza variations?", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150320_DominoCEO.jpg"}, "title": "What the Domino's CEO Would Change on Taxes, Obamacare", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs", "published_time": "2015-03-22T03:01:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T17:46:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Domino's, Patrick Doyle, Affordable Care Act, menu labeling law, franchise, growth stock"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecd1\"", "article_summary": "The headquarters are a few miles up the road from where the original Domino\u2019s Pizza opened in 1960.\nAlthough the Domino\u2019s menu also includes such things as sandwiches, pasta and chicken wings, 80 percent of its sales are pizzas.\nIn sales, Domino\u2019s is now the No.\n\u201cIn a lot of ways we\u2019re really a technology company,\u201d Doyle says.\nIn his five years as CEO, annual sales have climbed to $9 billion from about $2 billion."}
