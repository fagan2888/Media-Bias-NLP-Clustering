However, the filing of the suit the morning after Obama unveiled his major executive actions on immigration was clearly intended to underscore GOP lawmakers\u2019 desire to paint the president as a chief executive intent on overstepping his legal bounds.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cTime after time, the president has chosen to ignore the will of the American people and rewrite federal law on his own without a vote of Congress. That\u2019s not the way our system of government was designed to work,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. \u201cIf this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well. The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama is not named as a defendant; the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, names as defendants Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and their departments.\n\nThe White House dismissed the lawsuit Friday as meritless and as a waste of money.\n\n\u201cInstead of passing legislation to help expand the middle class and grow the economy, Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars pursuing a lawsuit that is without any sound legal basis,\u201d White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said.\n\nThe new lawsuit claims that two specific aspects of implementation of the Obamacare law violated the terms of the legislation.\n\nFirst, the suit complains about repeated delays of the employer mandate, which was supposed to kick in in January of this year. The administration delayed the requirement until next year for some employers and until 2016 for others.\n\nSecond, the litigation challenges payments to insurance companies under a cost-sharing provision that the suit argues was never authorized by law. Such \u201coffset\u201d payments amounted to $3 billion in 2014 and could total $175 billion over 10 years, the House claims.\n\n\u201cThe administration is instead unlawfully and unconstitutionally using funds from a separate Treasury Department account \u2014 authorized for other purposes \u2014 to pay insurance companies and thereby unilaterally altering the structure of the health care law,\u201d Boehner\u2019s office said.\n\nThe suit was filed for the House by George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. The liberal critic of Obama\u2019s alleged executive overreach is the third attorney to handle the matter for the House. It was assigned to Judge Rosemary Collyer, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush.\n\nTwo conservative litigators, David Rivkin of BakerHostetler and Bill Burck of Quinn Emanuel, were retained to handle the case earlier in the year. However, House aides say both backed out after being pressured by other clients to drop the litigation.\n\nDemocrats have widely dismissed the lawsuit as a political stunt. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused the Republicans of playing into the interests of \u201cimpeachment-hungry extremists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, this lawsuit is a bald-faced attempt to achieve what Republicans have been unable to achieve through the political process. The legislative branch cannot sue simply because they disagree with the way a law passed by a different Congress has been implemented,\u201d the California Democrat said. \u201cIt is clear, as one leading legal scholar put it, that this lawsuit is \u2018an embarrassing loser.\u2019\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s office posted Turley\u2019s contract online Friday. The constitutional law expert is receiving $500 an hour to represent the House but the contract tops out at $350,000.\n\nThe contract also bars Turley from discussing the case with the media, though law students from George Washington University can work on the lawsuit.\n\nThe contract ends on Jan. 3, 2015, or when the U.S. District Court rules on the lawsuit.\n\nJake Sherman contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The filing of the suit the morning after Obama unveiled his major executive actions on immigration was clearly intended to underscore GOP lawmakers\u2019 desire to paint the president as a chief executive intent on overstepping his legal bounds.", "title": "House files Obamacare lawsuit", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/house-files-obamacare-lawsuit-113089.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/21/141121_john_boehner3_msm_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Obamacare,Republicans,John Boehner,Courts", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The filing of the suit the morning after Obama unveiled his major executive actions on immigration was clearly intended to underscore GOP lawmakers\u2019 desire to paint the president as a chief executive intent on overstepping his legal bounds.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO House files Obamacare lawsuitThe House of Representatives filed a long-awaited lawsuit Friday, alleging that the Obama administration ignored key aspects of its health care reform law when implementing the sweeping new government program.\nThe new lawsuit claims that two specific aspects of implementation of the Obamacare law violated the terms of the legislation.\nThe White House dismissed the lawsuit Friday as meritless and as a waste of money.\nThat\u2019s not the way our system of government was designed to work,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement.\nThe constitutional law expert is receiving $500 an hour to represent the House but the contract tops out at $350,000."}
