(Wikipedia / Ingfbruno)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s beginning to look a lot like 1995, with Congress again bringing the country perilously close to a government shutdown. Despite the House Republicans\u2019 quixotic attempt to tie the funding of basic services to the repeal of Obamacare, Karl Rove himself calling such a tactic \u201cill-conceived,\u201d and, finally, last week\u2019s pointless exhibition of endurance by Ted Cruz\u2019s bladder, it appears the Republican Party is about to crown itself with the highly dubious distinction of having once again dragged the US government to a new low of impotence, paralysis and dysfunction. Ad Policy\n\nThat is not an accidental consequence of \u201cdivided government\u2026unable to settle its differences,\u201d as one reporter suggested, noting the 1995 parallel. Rather, dramatizing the supposed precariousness of public services by forcing their arbitrary cessation makes it easier for conservatives to argue that the market alone should determine the proper distribution of wealth, goods, and services in American society. There is no smaller government than none at all. As the radical political philosopher Sheldon Wolin argued in a remarkable 1996 essay in The Nation, \u201cDemocracy and the Counterrevolution,\u201d the effort \u201cto stop or reconstitute government in order to extract sweeping policy concessions amounts to an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d Wolin\u2019s brilliant essay reminds us how shutdowns and austerity economics fit within the broader Republican philosophy of governance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014and how that philosophy is antithetical to the defining principle of democracy: rule by the people.\n\n* * *\n\nLast winter\u2019s government shutdown, contrary to media reports, was not about innocent bystanders\u2014government workers, recipients of benefits or tourists\u2014however genuine their hardships. It was about the broad scheme of power in the nation. Under what was dismissed as posturing, serious political changes were being tested. If we ask, \u201cWhat kind of authority could justify disrupting and holding an allegedly democratic system hostage in the name of \u2018a balanced budget in seven years\u2019 and then attempt to dictate the precise kind and amount of government services that are to be permitted to resume?\u201d the answer is not: \u201cThe authority of officials elected to run the government.\u201d Deliberately paralyzing an elected government is far different from the ordinary partisanship that attends appropriations.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/capitol_hill_cc_fb_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Katrina vanden Heuvel", "description": "In a brilliant 1996 essay, political theorist Sheldon Wolin connected austerity economics to a broader Republican philosophy of governance--or lack thereof.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "In a brilliant 1996 essay, political theorist Sheldon Wolin connected austerity economics to a broader Republican philosophy of governance--or lack thereof.", "title": "This Week in \u2018Nation\u2019 History: Government Shutdown as Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/week-nation-history-government-shutdown-coup-detat/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/capitol_hill_cc_fb_0.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 225}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:51:59+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a brilliant 1996 essay, political theorist Sheldon Wolin connected austerity economics to a broader Republican philosophy of governance--or lack thereof.", "title": "This Week in \u2018Nation\u2019 History: Government Shutdown as Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/week-nation-history-government-shutdown-coup-detat/", "image": {"height": 225, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/capitol_hill_cc_fb_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/capitol_hill_cc_fb_0.jpg", "width": 300}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 28th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "This Week in \u2018Nation\u2019 History: Government Shutdown as Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat", "keywords": "Republicans, History, gingrich, congress, 1995, Shutdown, Healthcare, Obama, ACA, Clinton, The nineties, redonkulous, Wolin", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 108442, "sailthru.tags": "Congress,Economic Policy,Blog,From the Archive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "Wolin", "published_time": "2013-09-28T14:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:51:59+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/rkreitner/"}, "sailthru.description": "In a brilliant 1996 essay, political theorist Sheldon Wolin connected austerity economics to a broader Republican philosophy of governance--or lack thereof.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/capitol_hill_cc_fb_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07c9\"", "article_summary": "(Wikipedia / Ingfbruno)It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like 1995, with Congress again bringing the country perilously close to a government shutdown.\n* * *Last winter\u2019s government shutdown, contrary to media reports, was not about innocent bystanders\u2014government workers, recipients of benefits or tourists\u2014however genuine their hardships.\nAd PolicyThat is not an accidental consequence of \u201cdivided government\u2026unable to settle its differences,\u201d as one reporter suggested, noting the 1995 parallel.\nIt was about the broad scheme of power in the nation.\nUnder what was dismissed as posturing, serious political changes were being tested."}
