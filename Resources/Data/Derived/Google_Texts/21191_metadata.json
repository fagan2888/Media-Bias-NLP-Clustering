Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat charged with rounding up votes for the deal. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got four presidential candidates all trying to break into Fox\u2019s top 10. The possibilities are endless.\u201d\n\nFor all the millions of dollars pumped into the campaigns for and against the deal, the dire warnings on both sides and the threats of political repercussion, this August has not been a caldron akin to the recess of 2009, when Democrats were pummeled in town-hall meetings over the Affordable Care Act. Even the defection of the Senate\u2019s No. 3 Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, did not fundamentally change an issue that has largely broken along party lines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNumerically, the agreement between Iran and six world powers to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions is on the cusp of being safe. Republican leaders in the House and Senate have promised votes by mid-September on a resolution to scuttle the deal, which Mr. Obama would then veto.\n\nAbout 150 House Democrats signed a letter this spring tentatively backing the accord \u2014 just over the number needed to sustain a promised veto of a congressional resolution to disapprove the deal. So far, there have been no defections from that group and a handful of new supporters.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the Senate, the recent declarations of support by Democrats from Republican-leaning states \u2014 like Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 have substantially reduced the possibility that opponents will be able to muster 67 votes in the Senate to override a veto \u2014 if the resolution remains a simple up or down vote on the Iran deal.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150824192035, "twitter": {"description": "The party\u2019s leaders are still
