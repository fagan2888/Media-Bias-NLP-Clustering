At this year\u2019s E3, the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo happening this week in Los Angeles, Microsoft announced the next version of its blockbuster Halo series, and remastered versions of Halos 1-4 for the Xbox One.\n\nEven though, by most accounts, the PS4 has been winning the \u201cconsole war,\u201d Sony doesn\u2019t quite have a title to match. Microsoft has bungled so many aspects of the Xbox One console and launch that the PS4 has been able to coast into the lead without offering titles that generate genuine excitement. That can\u2019t last, though, and Sony knows it. It simply can\u2019t ignore the chief issue that threatens the long-term success of its platform: that distinct lack of interesting exclusive titles.\n\nRelated: Video Game Changers: 21 Titles That Rocked the Industry\n\nTo address that, Sony announced blockbusters, or potential blockbusters, like Bungie\u2019s Destiny or Uncharted 4. But even as corporate chieftains wrinkle their foreheads and brainstorm new, uninspired AAA titles, the PS4 team is also trying to draw gamers from the PC market and buff up its library of games by cozying up to indie developers behind more whimsical, creative, artistic and even experimental titles. The PS4 team loaned out dev kits, which usually come with a $2,500 price tag, to independent developers for free last May. More recently, Sony paid the bill for indie exhibitors at this year\u2019s Tokyo Game Show.\n\nThose titles can really matter. Gamers are being increasingly entranced by the slew of imaginative, challenging games that are quickly flooding the market, thanks in part to programs like the Humble Indie Bundle and Steam\u2019s Greenlight, a talent contest for indie games with the prize being promotion on the Steam platform. And going off the PS4\u2019s launch calendar, which just announced 12 new indie games in development, with plenty more waiting in the wings, it seems that this strategy is finally starting to pay off.\n\nIndie game developer The Chinese Room released its surreal hit Dear Esther in 2012. Heavily praised for its expansive scenery, abstract storyline, and quality writing, it has quickly become one of the go-to points of evidence for the argument that video games are art.\n\nThe Chinese Room\u2019s spiritual successor to Dear Esther, Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture, will sadly be a little less accessible. Bankrolled by Sony Computer Entertainment\u2019s Santa Monica studio, this sequel will be limited to the PS4, with no intention of being released for the PC or any other platforms.\n\nRelated: Why Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One Has Already Lost to Sony\u2019s PS4\n\nThe Chinese Room isn\u2019t the only indie developer on Sony\u2019s dance card, though. Jonathan Blow, the one-man creator of the award-winning Braid is releasing his next game on the PS4 and PC, but not the Xbox One. The same goes with the 8-bit reboot of The Binding of Isaac, a twisted, dark, action game from Edmund McMillan.\n\nMost notable, perhaps, is the indie game Rime, which was initially designed with the Xbox in mind. The developers ran into a conflict between their vision of a single player story-driven adventure, and Microsoft\u2019s publishing policies, which focused heavily on multiplayer gaming. Sony, naturally, swooped in, and Rime is now set for release as a PS4 exclusive in the near future.\n\nWhile this strategy has certainly given Sony a leg up on the Xbox in the indie sector, it still remains to be seen if it\u2019s enough to lure dedicated gamers away from the hallowed mecca of indie gaming: the PC.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Any gamer worth his or her salt will remember the early days of the PlayStation 3, whe", "title": "E3 2014: Sony Looks to Strike Indie Gaming Gold", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/10/E3-2014-Sony-Looks-Strike-Indie-Gaming-Gold", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06102014_Sony_e3_Expo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/10/E3-2014-Sony-Looks-Strike-Indie-Gaming-Gold", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06102014_Sony_e3_Expo.jpg", "creator": "@lumbology", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Any gamer worth his or her salt will remember the early days of the PlayStation 3, whe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4f3\"", "article_summary": "Sony, naturally, swooped in, and Rime is now set for release as a PS4 exclusive in the near future.\nIt simply can\u2019t ignore the chief issue that threatens the long-term success of its platform: that distinct lack of interesting exclusive titles.\nIndie game developer The Chinese Room released its surreal hit Dear Esther in 2012.\nMost notable, perhaps, is the indie game Rime, which was initially designed with the Xbox in mind.\nEven though, by most accounts, the PS4 has been winning the \u201cconsole war,\u201d Sony doesn\u2019t quite have a title to match."}
