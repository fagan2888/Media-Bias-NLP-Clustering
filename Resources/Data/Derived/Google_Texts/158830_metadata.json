But the consumer impact is just one part of the health care law\u2019s overall impact on a complex network of hospitals, insurance companies and other stakeholders, each focused on a critical area of health care. Here are their stories:\n\nCondition kept doctor\n\nfrom insurance plans\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, Dr. Tanisha Richmond said she couldn\u2019t buy health insurance \u2014 at any price.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a diabetic, and because of my pre-existing condition I just couldn\u2019t buy a policy,\u201d said Dr. Richmond, who is self-employed and runs a podiatry practice at the Charles R. Drew Health Center on West Third Street. \u201cI was turned down numerous times, so I just paid cash for my medication, doctors visits and lab tests. As a diabetic, you have to have blood work about every three months, so the costs can add up quickly.\u201d\n\nThe health care law outlawed discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, opening the door to health coverage for thousands of previously uninsured Ohioans.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the law passed (in 2010), I was able to buy a policy,\u201d the 32-year-old foot-and-ankle specialist said. \u201cAt the time, I was paying close to $700 a month (in premiums). After the health insurance marketplace opened last year, I cut my premiums in half.\u201d\n\nShe now pays $340 a month for a policy from Medical Mutual of Ohio that carries a $5,000 deductible.\n\nUnlike 85 percent of who signed up for marketplace coverage this year, Dr. Richmond\u2019s income was too high to qualify for federal tax credit subsidies that could have reduced her premium and deductible even further.\n\nStill, she said: \u201cI\u2019m very satisfied with my coverage now. I had to change doctors because the doctor I had been seeing wasn\u2019t in my network under my new policy, but I found a doctor right away, so it never interrupted the continuity of my care.\u201d\n\nStudies show that about 70 percent of marketplace plans offer fewer physicians and hospitals than employer-based plans, which cover about 60 percent of Americans under age 65.\n\nBut that\u2019s changing, according to Dr. Richmond, who said even doctors who initially rejected the health care law are beginning to join her in accepting marketplace plans because of the financial incentives.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are beginning to realize that many of us with marketplace coverage are sick or have undiagnosed conditions because we went without health care for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re patients that are going to need a lot of care. We\u2019re not going to be patients they might see once or twice a year. We\u2019re going to be patients they see at least once a month, if not more, for years.\u201d\n\nSigning up\n\n\u2018saved my life\u2019\n\nSherry Samartini of Englewood lost the health coverage she had through her employer when she was laid off from an engineering job in Cincinnati in 2009.\n\nSamartini, 45, said she remained uninsured while she went back to school to earn a certificate as a medical assistant because she couldn\u2019t afford coverage on her own.\n\nShe now works as a medical office manager for a small practice that doesn\u2019t offer insurance, but because of the tax subsidies offered through the health care marketplace she was able to buy a health plan from downtown Dayton-based CareSource for $60 a month.\n\nSigning up for health coverage in the marketplace \u201cbasically, saved my life,\u201d Samartini said.\n\n\u201cI went to the doctor in January soon after I got my insurance card, and my doctor told me she heard a heart murmur,\u201d she said. \u201cThey sent me for testing and discovered I had a bad heart valve that would have to replace. I had no idea I had this condition because I didn\u2019t have health insurance for so long.\u201d\n\nSamartini\u2019s health plan has a $250 deductible and co-pays for office visits, prescriptions and lab tests are as little as $5.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no excuse for people not to have insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was something I needed to do, so I just made up my mind to come up with the means to do it. If I can afford, I think most working people can.\u201d\n\nInsurance save man\n\nthousands for healthcare\n\nCharles McClinon of Roselawn \u2014 a suburb of Cincinnati \u2014 said he hasn\u2019t been able to hold down a job for at least the past five years because of epileptic seizures that had been growing in frequency and intensity until he finally had surgery this past summer.\n\nIn July, McClinon, 51, had a vagus nerve stimulator inserted near his collarbone to send mild pulses of electrical energy to his brain to control his seizures. He has visited his doctor every week since undergoing the surgery to gradually increase the stimulation and and monitor his progress.\n\nMcClinon estimates his medical bills would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if he were not among the more than 300,000 Ohioans deemed newly eligible for Medicaid this year under expanded eligibility requirements established by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already accumulated more than $30,000 in medical bills just from going to the doctor on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI never would have been able to afford the surgery, much less the follow-up treatments, if I didn\u2019t have Medicaid. I applied for disability and was rejected, so I would have been on my own without the health care law.\u201d\n\nHospitals deal with\n\ndecreasing reimbursements\n\nChange, what change?\n\nThat\u2019s essentially how Kettering Health Network executives responded when asked whether the Affordable Care Act had fundamentally transformed the way they do business.\n\nThe health care law has pushed hospitals away from the traditional fee-for-service payment system, in which doctors and hospitals generally are paid for each test and procedure they perform.\n\nHospitals are now rewarded for limiting the volume of patients that are re-admitted and avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures. But the approach is nothing new at Kettering hospitals, which are operated by Seventh-day Adventists who believe in a holistic approach to healing.\n\n\u201cOur dedicated focus to comprehensive quality and safety outcomes has really positioned us to be very successful in the new health care environment without really changing our focus because well-being has always been our focus,\u201d said Terri Day, president of Kettering Health Network.\n\nStill, health reform has forced Kettering to deal with decreasing reimbursements as their costs continue to climb.\n\nMedicare payments to hospitals were cut by 2 percent last year as a result of spending reductions \u2014 known as sequestration \u2014 required by the Budget Control Act.\n\nThe Medicare cuts were supposed to be offset by an increased number of patients insured by Medicaid and private health plans under the health reform law.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services projects hospitals nationwide will save $5.7 billion this year from serving fewer uninsured patients.\n\nBut the jury is still out in terms of the financial impact on hospitals, said Todd Anderson, chief financial officer at Kettering\u2019s Grandview Medical Center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen charity care go down, and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a Medicaid increase,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell in terms of quantifying that impact.\u201d\n\nSelling health insurance like its chief competitor, Premier Health, would be one way for Kettering to increase patient volume and shore up revenues.\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s a trend right now,\u201d Day said. But \u201cat this point in time we\u2019ve chosen a path to partner and collaborate with the existing insurance plans in our market.\u201d\n\nBut Kettering officials haven\u2019t ruled out the possibility of starting their own health plan.\n\n\u201cI think right now as things continue to develop\u2026.you have to continue to be flexible,\u201d Day added.\n\nNext enrollment\n\nexpected to be easier\n\nA major player in the health insurance marketplaces in the past year has been CareSource and company officials said they are preparing for the next enrollment.\n\nThe annual open enrollment period starts again in just two months, and Scott Streator, vice president of CareSource\u2019s health insurance marketplace product line, said CareSource has taken steps to avoid the technical issues that may have curbed enrollment in the early going last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a sizable investment in IT,\u201d Streator said. \u201cWe have a very sophisticated tool that integrates directly with the federal government website. A consumer can go to our website (caresource.com), start the enrollment process and be redirected to the federal website to find out about their eligibility. Then they come back directly to us, choose a plan and enroll.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the IT upgrades, the company is expanding its downtown operations to accommodate the surge of new business from Ohio\u2019s marketplace as well as new markets in Indiana and Kentucky, where CareSource will begin selling marketplace plans next year.\n\nThe company is in the process of moving 200 workers from its downtown headquarters to a nearby building at 220 East Monument Ave. to support marketplace enrollment.\n\nThe move will free up space for additional hiring downtown, where CareSource plans to grow its payroll to 1,950 from 1,400 as a direct result of opportunities created by the health care reform law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The impact the Affordable Care Act has had on the previously uninsured and low and middle income families cannot be understated as millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Ohioans have gained access to health coverage for the first time through the health insurance marketplace launched last year.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/obamacare-brings-dramatic-changes-for-uninsured-ho/nhXGL/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/de/42/DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "The impact the Affordable Care Act has had on the previously uninsured and low and middle income families cannot be understated as millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Ohioans have gained access to health coverage for the first time through the health insurance marketplace launched last year.", "title": "Obamacare brings dramatic changes for uninsured, hospitals,..."}, "twitter": {"description": "The impact the Affordable Care Act has had on the previously uninsured and low and middle income families cannot be understated as millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Ohioans have gained access to health coverage for the first time through the health insurance marketplace launched last year.", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare brings dramatic changes for uninsured, hospitals, insurers"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/obamacare-brings-dramatic-changes-for-uninsured-ho/nhXGL/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2633324/news/news/local/obamacare-brings-dramatic-changes-for-uninsured-ho/nhXGL/", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI"}, "article_summary": "But the approach is nothing new at Kettering hospitals, which are operated by Seventh-day Adventists who believe in a holistic approach to healing.\nThe health care law has pushed hospitals away from the traditional fee-for-service payment system, in which doctors and hospitals generally are paid for each test and procedure they perform.\nBut the consumer impact is just one part of the health care law\u2019s overall impact on a complex network of hospitals, insurance companies and other stakeholders, each focused on a critical area of health care.\nI applied for disability and was rejected, so I would have been on my own without the health care law.\u201dHospitals deal withdecreasing reimbursementsChange, what change?\nThe Medicare cuts were supposed to be offset by an increased number of patients insured by Medicaid and private health plans under the health reform law."}
