Here\u2019s an ad from the Club for Growth\u2019s million-dollar anti-Trump campaign back in September. Here\u2019s Rand Paul in August. Here\u2019s a pair of mocking ads from Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign in September and October . Here\u2019s a savage ad from the Kasich campaign in November. Everybody\u2019s been talking about the National Review special issue in January denouncing Trump. The Miss America contestant from Alabama made many of the same points when she was interviewed in the pageant in the fall of 2015.\n\nOne question has been asked over and over about the 2016 Republican contest: Where is the cavalry? When does the fabled Republican establishment use its vast reserves of cash to fill the airwaves with negative ads against Donald Trump? This was how Mitt Romney overwhelmed Gingrich\u2019s brief surge in 2012. Trump is surely an even more vulnerable target than Gingrich, right?\n\nIf\u2014as the polls suggest\u2014Donald Trump wins the Republican contests in Iowa and New Hampshire; if, 14 days from now, he\u2019s heading on to contests in Nevada and South Carolina as the overwhelming favorite; then the leaders of the Republican party will have cause to remember Aesop\u2019s fable.\n\n\u201cCome, my boy, don\u2019t be so greedy. Be content with half the amount, and you'll be able to get your hand out without difficulty.\u201d\n\nA boy put his hand into a jar of filberts and grasped as many as his fist could possibly hold. But when he tried to pull it out again, he found he couldn\u2019t do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to allow of the passage of so large a handful. Unwilling to lose his nuts but unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears.\n\nFor a very long time, the voting base of the Republican Party has been signaling desperate economic and cultural distress.\n\nWhoever emerges as the last man standing among the governors and senators may yet try just this approach.\n\nFinally: Calling Trump out for having \u201cNew York values\u201d when you mean \u201cthrice-married, coarse, and libertine\u201d is telling people what they already know. If you want to persuade his voters that his \u201cNew York values\u201d are a problem for them, put his alleged dealings with the Mafia on the table.\n\n(One of the Donald\u2019s foredoomed rivals, Ted Cruz, actually just cut an ad along these lines. But of course it\u2019s too late for that to work.)\n\nLikewise, don\u2019t get mired in philosophical arguments about big government and crony capitalism. Find the people hurt by Trump\u2019s attempts to exploit eminent domain : The widow whose boarding house he wanted to demolish to make room for a limo parking lot, the small businessmen whose livelihoods he wanted to redevelop out of existence.\n\nOr just take a camera crew around Atlantic City, and slap Trump\u2019s name on what you find.\n\nSo don\u2019t tell people that he doesn\u2019t know the difference between Kurds and the Quds Force. (They don\u2019t either!) Tell people that he isn\u2019t the incredible self-made genius that he plays on TV. Tell them about all the money he inherited from his daddy. Tell them about the bailouts that saved him from ruin. Tell them about all his cratered companies. Then find people who suffered from those fiascos\u2014workers laid off following his bankruptcies, homeowners who bought through Trump Mortgage , people who ponied up for sham degrees from Trump University .\n\nTo attack him effectively, you have to go after the things that people like about him. You have to flip his brand.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible to imagine more ingenious lines of attack. In a January 24 column , Ross Douthat of The New York Times volunteered a brutal possible ad.\n\nA poll published on Tuesday in The Washington Post sounds the klaxon again:\n\nThe Republican electorate is in a sour mood as its members prepare to begin the process of picking a presidential nominee. Almost 9 in 10 say the country is seriously off on the wrong track, and more than 8 in 10 are dissatisfied with the way the federal government works, including nearly 4 in 10 who say they\u2019re angry about it. Two-thirds worry about maintaining their current living standard, more than 6 in 10 say people with similar values are losing influence in American life, and about half say the nation\u2019s best days are behind it. Half also say immigrants mainly weaken American society, compared with 55 percent of the overall population who say immigrants strengthen America.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s response to this dilemma is protectionism, immigration restriction, and a big helping of his own often-claimed superhuman toughness and competence. It\u2019s maybe not a very adequate answer, but it\u2019s an answer. What\u2019s Marco Rubio\u2019s answer? What\u2019s Jeb Bush\u2019s? What\u2019s Chris Christie\u2019s?\n\nListen to Marco Rubio describe his priorities for his first day in office. They include repealing Environmental Protection Agency rules, repealing the Common Core, and canceling the Iran deal.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s first priorities are ordering the Justice Department to investigate Planned Parenthood, ordering the IRS to stop persecuting religious liberty, canceling the Iran deal, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s first priorities include repealing Obamacare, lifting regulatory burdens on businesses, and eliminating gun restrictions. He\u2019ll also end the president\u2019s orders authorizing illegal aliens to remain in the country, insisting that this aim can only be achieved by legislation. Only the last of this series bears very closely on the anxieties discerned in the Post poll\u2014and even that last is only provisional. It remains Jeb Bush\u2019s intention to do by legislation what he objects to President Obama doing by executive order.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for the party\u2019s elites to let go of some of their cherished inward-facing policy priorities.\n\nFor most of their existence, the two political parties have been condemned by reformers as cold-blooded machines for the gaining of power, disdainful of principle and ideals. The Republican Party in 2016 presents a contrasting spectacle: a party so powerfully committed to ideas that it can no longer recognize that those ideas have ceased to resonate beyond its own shrinking coteries of activists and intellectuals. Party elites have been broadcasting for months that Donald Trump is not a consistent conservative\u2014and it has not made any difference at all. Balked and baffled, they\u2019ve convinced themselves that the secret is to say it louder.\n\nAnd maybe that will work. Maybe if they keep slamming away about ethanol and eminent domain and how Trump described himself as pro-choice in a 2000 interview, maybe at last that will break through.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s time for the party\u2019s elites to let go of some of their cherished inward-facing policy priorities, as the boy released some of the nuts from his grasp. Instead, they might try actually addressing the fears and anxieties of the American middle class: jobs, wages, retirement security. Negative advertising has been aired without success. Perhaps a positive program would do better?
