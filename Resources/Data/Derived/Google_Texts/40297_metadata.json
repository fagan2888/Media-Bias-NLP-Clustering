In his columns and blog, \"The Right Stuff,\" southpaw Jackson provides insight into the evolving human condition from a distinctly conservative point of view.\n\nThe Democrat half of the contest for Florida\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat just gets better and better, as indicated by today\u2019s lively missive from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nIt seems, at last, Alan Grayson, the blunderbuss congressman from Orlando, has embarrassed Democrats beyond their tolerance levels. Accordingly, Reid wants him to resign from the race. (In fact, that\u2019s been Reid\u2019s position for a couple of weeks.) This, of course, would essentially cede the nomination to former Republican squish Patrick Murphy, who represents Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast east of Lake Okeechobee.\n\nWrites Reid:\n\nWe need strong leaders in the Senate \u2014 middle class champions dedicated to working hard and getting things done. People just like Patrick Murphy.\n\nWhat we DON\u2019T need is a disgraceful hedge fund manager masquerading as a \u201cprogressive.\u201d\n\nReports indicate that Alan Grayson may have used his position as a congressman to unethically promote his Cayman Islands hedge fund. Grayson claims to be a \u201cprogressive,\u201d but it seems he has no moral compass.\n\nOh, NOW they notice. But remember: They hit the mute button when he was maliciously maligning congressional Republicans during the stampede to approve Obamacare.\n\nThese deeply troubling allegations should disqualify anyone from a seat in the U.S. Senate. Alan Grayson should drop out of the U.S. Senate race immediately.\n\nSo now mere allegations are enough to chase someone from a campaign. Really? Politico\u2019s Marc Caputo calls bull hockey on that:\n\nReid\u2019s interest in Florida is about elections, not ethics. Here\u2019s how we know: Reid is a Murphy supporter and he has maintained an icy silence amid the federal criminal indictment of Sen. Bob Menendez for alleged corruption involving a Florida donor, Dr. Salomon Melgen. So in Reid World, Menendez\u2019s case isn\u2019t worth talking about, but Grayson\u2019s is. And while Grayson doesn\u2019t belong in the Senate, to Reid, Menendez belonged in a powerful Senate committee post.\n\nThough Menendez first came under clear federal scrutiny in January 2013, Reid kept Menendez as Foreign Relations chairman \u2014 a position critics accuse him of abusing. After Democrats lost the Senate majority, Menendez remained the committee\u2019s ranking member until his indictment in April 2015. That was about a year after Reid himself was interviewed by the feds in Menendez\u2019s criminal case. So Reid knew at least some of what authorities were looking at. And so did some of Reid\u2019s aides. They ran the super PAC tied to the alleged corruption scheme listed in the indictment against Florida\u2019s third Senator. None of this is to say that Grayson or Menendez are guilty or innocent. But one alleged transgression is clearly more serious than the other, yet the more serious case prompted none of Reid\u2019s calls for virtue in congress.\n\nFor his part, Grayson rebuked Reid as \u201ca human cash register\u201d and \u201ceverybody\u2019s lobbyist\u2019s best friend.\u201d Is this great, or what?\n\nAs Caputo notes, Grayson may have committed no wrongdoing. An ongoing House Ethics Committee investigation that will wrap up in April. What\u2019s the rush? Makes you wonder why, while he\u2019s at it, Reid isn\u2019t also demanding Grayson resign from the House. After all, he\u2019s described his actions as \u201cdisgraceful to the halls of Congress.\u201d And all he\u2019s opposed to is Grayson seeking a promotion?\n\nEvidently: \u201cI\u2019m calling on Alan Grayson to drop out. Sign on to join me.\u201d (To quote Chris Christie in another context: There it is. Sign on. Get nine months of pleas for campaign donations.)\n\nGrayson presents a problem for establishment Democrats who are lining up for Murphy (whose lining up might be influenced by donations from Murphy\u2019s parents). Early polling shows Grayson\u2019s guns-a-blazing appeal to unbridled progressivism putting him ahead of the reliable liberal, but it\u2019s an open question whether his feel-the-Bern message can generate a majority in the general election. Particularly if the GOP nominee winds up being Indian Shores\u2019 eminently moderate, pleasant and reasonable Rep. David Jolly, who has a substantial early edge in a crowded, if largely unknown, Republican field.\n\nEvidently, tossing the dice on Grayson is not a gamble the paid-for senator from Las Vegas is eager to make.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 15:53:04 -0400", "Description": "The Democrat half of the contest for Florida\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat just gets better and better, as indicated by today\u2019s lively missive from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "The Democrat half of the contest for Florida\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat just gets better and better, as indicated by today\u2019s lively missive from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.", "title": "Harry Reid to Alan Grayson: Die quickly", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/blogs/the-right-stuff/harry-reid-to-alan-grayson-die-quickly-20160223/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2016-02-23T15:53:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Harry Reid to Alan Grayson: Die quickly"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2016-02-23T15:53:04Z-04", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T15:53:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It seems, at last, Alan Grayson, the blunderbuss congressman from Orlando, has embarrassed Democrats beyond their tolerance levels.\nAnd while Grayson doesn\u2019t belong in the Senate, to Reid, Menendez belonged in a powerful Senate committee post.\nEvidently: \u201cI\u2019m calling on Alan Grayson to drop out.\nAlan Grayson should drop out of the U.S. Senate race immediately.\n(In fact, that\u2019s been Reid\u2019s position for a couple of weeks.)"}
