Industry analysts estimate marketers waste millions of dollars a year buying Internet ads that aren\u2019t delivered to real humans, but rather to hijacked computers known as \u201cbots.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, relatively little was known about the extent of the issue. But now, companies promising to help fix the problem are conducting detailed studies designed to reveal much more about fraudulent \u201cbot\u201d traffic.\n\nMeasurement specialist comScore, for example, released a research report on Thursday exploring \u201cthe value of a digital ad.\u201d The company said it analyzed hundreds of digital ad campaigns for the report, and found the levels of non-human traffic can vary greatly between ad campaigns and between publisher sites. That suggests some corners of the Internet are far more susceptible to bots than others.\n\nAccording to the study, a relatively small number of ad campaigns actually accounted for the majority of ads served to non-human traffic. About one-fifth of the campaigns measured accounted for three-quarters of the fraudulent impressions recorded, comScore said.\n\nOn the publisher side, comScore reported large differences in non-human traffic rates between publisher sites, too. Half of the publishers tracked had less than 1% of non-human traffic running through them, comScore said; 85% of the sites had less than 5% bot traffic.\n\n\u201cIt is only in the lowest-performing 15 percent of publishers where non-human traffic is a sizable problem greatly in need of substantive mitigation efforts,\u201d the report said.\n\nNon-human traffic is also more likely to be an issue with inventory purchased through ad networks or exchanges, the report added. That\u2019s bad news for publishers that aren\u2019t peddling fake traffic, because it drives down the value of their ad space.\n\n\u201cIn the end, many publishers have clean inventory but the few who do not and stream in high volumes of non-human impressions can bring down the value of an entire ad buy. The challenge for marketers is determining how to avoid buying high [non-human traffic] inventory in the first place,\u201d the report said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Online measurement company comScore analysed hundreds of digital ad campaigns, and found the levels of non-human traffic can vary greatly between ad campaigns and between publisher sites.", "title": "How Rampant is Online Ad Fraud?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/05/how-rampant-is-online-ad-fraud/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GN579_robotd_P_20150120195521.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "How Rampant is Online Ad Fraud?", "description": "Online measurement company comScore analysed hundreds of digital ad campaigns, and found the levels of non-human traffic can vary greatly between ad campaigns and between publisher sites.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Jack Marshall", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "Online measurement company comScore analysed hundreds of digital ad campaigns, and found the levels of non-human traffic can vary greatly between ad campaigns and between publisher sites.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-02-05T14:09:01-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/05/how-rampant-is-online-ad-fraud/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-2709", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Online measurement company comScore analysed hundreds of digital ad campaigns, and found the levels of non-human traffic can vary greatly between ad campaigns and between publisher sites.", "title": "How Rampant is Online Ad Fraud?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/05/how-rampant-is-online-ad-fraud/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GN579_robotd_P_20150120195521.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-2709", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-02-04T23:09:18-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde882\"", "article_summary": "According to the study, a relatively small number of ad campaigns actually accounted for the majority of ads served to non-human traffic.\nNon-human traffic is also more likely to be an issue with inventory purchased through ad networks or exchanges, the report added.\nOn the publisher side, comScore reported large differences in non-human traffic rates between publisher sites, too.\nThe challenge for marketers is determining how to avoid buying high [non-human traffic] inventory in the first place,\u201d the report said.\nThat\u2019s bad news for publishers that aren\u2019t peddling fake traffic, because it drives down the value of their ad space."}
