Murray-Special for the A)\n\nLAKEWOOD - The $6.2 million that residents were asked to pay to save courtesy busing for some 10,000 school children is millions more than is needed to cover the cost for the rest of the school year -- a fact that has angered some in the community, with one former official saying the district \"lied to\" residents.\n\nBut the revelations that the actual cost is only $3.5 million also means a deal is possible -- one where the Township Committee would provide the school district with $2.5 million in surplus funds, $1.5 million above its previous commitment -- in order to avert the busing crisis this year. The district would absorb the other $1 million in costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we are considering,\u201d Township Committeeman Meir Lichtenstein confirmed Sunday, saying that no deal had yet been reached.\n\nBut the proposed terms of the deal, and the actual cost of what was needed to pay for courtesy busing this year, has raised a host of questions about why taxpayers were asked to pay $6.2 million in the Jan. 26 referendum if the number was that much less. Many here believed that $6.2 million was the amount needed to cover the cost of courtesy busing through the end of the year -- not the amount needed to cover busing for an entire year.\n\nRead more: Parents pack busing meeting, looking for answers\n\nIn emails obtained by the Asbury Park Press, Michael Azzara, the district\u2019s state-appointed monitor, says the larger amount was used for \u201cstrategic and legal reasons.\u201d He confirmed the $6.2 million represents courtesy busing costs for the entire year, not the next 3\u00bd months.\n\n\u201cFor a number of strategic and legal reasons, we felt raising the full $6.2 million cost of courtesy busing locally was in the best interests of the district's financial condition,\u201d Azzara states in an email to Lichtenstein dated Feb. 11.\n\nThe decision was made with an eye toward seeking additional funds from the New Jersey Department of Education to help close the district's projected $12.4 million deficit, Azzara says. As a condition of providing emergency aid, the state would insist that the district first reallocate funds set aside for non-mandated services, including courtesy busing, to narrow the gap, Azzara explains.\n\n\u201cIf the referendum had passed, it would have cut the deficit in half and allowed us to argue that courtesy busing was fully and expressly funded locally and not available for reallocation. This would have given us a stronger argument to request state assistance,\u201d Azzara states in one of the emails. As it turned out, nearly 99 percent of those who voted rejected the proposal.\n\nRead more: 99 percent say 'no' to $6.2M referendum\n\nWhether the results would have been different had the referendum sought a much smaller levy remains an open question.\n\n\"The public was 100% convinced that the $6.2 million was an additional amount needed to complete the year - NOT the total for the year,\" Rabbi Moshe Zev Weisberg, the head of the Igud Hamasdos, said in an email to the Press Sunday. The group represents the interests of Lakewood\u2019s nearly 100 private Orthodox Jewish yeshivas.\n\nIn an interview Sunday, Azzara stood by the explanation he gave to Lichtenstein in the emails and denied having misled the public about the amount the district needed.\n\n\"I don't think in the presentations we ever said we needed 6.2 to get through the end of the year. We said if we didn't get the $6.2 million we were going to end it,\" Azzara said.\n\n\"Obviously, these are complicated things,\" he added. \"People are going to have their own interpretations.\"\n\nPressure mounting\n\nAzzara's email proposal last week came after former school board attorney Michael I. Inzelbuch vowed to file suit to stop the district from cancelling all courtesy or non-mandated busing after Feb. 26. Inzelbuch said he represents at least 20 local children and four private bus companies affected by the pending service cut.\n\nRead more: Courtesy busing deal reached in Lakewood\n\nThrough an open public records request last week, Inzelbuch received copies of the same emails as the Press obtained. On Sunday, he accused district officials of deliberately misleading the public, which Azzara denies.\n\n\u201cIt was never 6.2 (million),\u201d Inzelbuch said. \u201cWe were lied to.\u201d\n\nRead more: Inzelbuch back in the spotlight\n\nThe district is under additional pressure from the the Igud. The group announced last week that if courtesy busing is cut, their schools will no longer tier or stagger their schools\u2019 start and dismissal times - a move that would completely unravel a complicated cost-savings plan negotiated in August. More than 7,100 yeshiva students and roughly 2,700 public school children are set to lose their busing at the end of the month.\n\nBuy Photo Former Lakewood school board attorney Michael I.

Weisberg called it \"another band-aid deal to keep school buses on the road, our children safe and Lakewood\u2019s roads moving for another few months.\" The broader problem of insufficient state funding for the district remains unresolved, he added.\n\n\"Isn\u2019t it time to stop this torture and draw a roadmap moving forward?\" he said in an email.\n\nShannon Mullen: 732-643-4278; smullen4@gannettnj.com\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Some 2,000 people packed a special school board meeting in Lakewood hoping to hear how the town plans to help them cope with the cancellation of courtesy busing for 10,000 Lakewood schoolchildren.
