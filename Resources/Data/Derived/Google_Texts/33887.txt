NEW YORK (AP) - CBS is the latest player in daily fantasy sports, bringing back its SportsLine.com site as a hub for data-driven projections, analysis and single-day fantasy sports.

The new daily fantasy game launched Monday by CBS Interactive is different from typical salary-cap games offered by the biggest daily fantasy operators, Fanduel and DraftKings. Yahoo also started a daily fantasy game in July.

Instead of trying to score the most points with a roster built from a budget, fantasy players try to pick the best player from each of several smaller lists. The site now features daily fantasy baseball, with plans to offer football and other sports.

The site is built on a new data model used to project games and individual stats built by Stephen Oh, a data scientist who founded sports forecasting company AccuScore. The site uses the model to compare predictions with Las Vegas sports books.
