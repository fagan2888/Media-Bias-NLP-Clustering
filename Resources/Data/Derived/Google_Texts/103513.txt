Roughly one in three adults between 50 and 75 years old are skipping out on their colorectal cancer checkups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"There are more than 20 million adults in this country who haven't had any recommended screening for colorectal cancer and who may therefore get cancer and die from a preventable tragedy," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement. "Screening for colorectal cancer is effective and can save your life."

According to the CDC, adults 50 years old and older should be tested with one or in combination of the following screening tests:

Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) done annually

Flexible sigmoidoscopy, done every five years, with FOBT/FIT done every three years

Colonoscopy done every 10 years

Based on data from the CDC's 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, researchers determined that, at 76 percent, Massachusetts had the highest percentage of adults up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening. Among those adults countrywide who were screened as recommended, 62 percent did so via a colonoscopy.

According to the CDC, colorectal cancer is the second most deadly cancer among men and women in the United States after lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates that nearly 102,500 will be diagnosed with colon cancer and more than 40,000 will rectal cancer in 2013, with some 50,800 combined deaths occurring during this same time period.

Screening can help to prevent colorectal cancer by identifying precancerous polyps that can be removed before they become cancerous, as well as help detect cancer at an early stage when treatment is highly effective.

By recommending test options and matching patients with the test they are most comfortable, physicians can help increase testing rates, the CDC reported. Increased coverage via the Affordable Care Act is also expected increase screening among Americans.
