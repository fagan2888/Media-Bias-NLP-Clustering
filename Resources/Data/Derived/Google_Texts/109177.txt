Today, the career company Glassdoor released its report on 2014’s Highest Rated CEOs. The company calls itself “the world’s most transparent career community” and it boasts more than 6 million company reviews.

This year the best CEO report was broken down into two: One was for the 50 companies with over 1,000 employees, and another for the top 25 CEOs for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees. The top CEOs are based on Glassdoor reviews submitted by their employees between Feb. 1, 2013, and Jan. 31, 2014. These ratings represnt the feelings of employees who post reviews on Glassdoor — sample size for each company may vary.
