For years, we’ve been hearing about a Full House reunion in the works. At first, it was an April Fools’ joke, and then once Candace Cameron Bure went on Dancing with the Stars and voiced her excitement it seemed like the real deal. Now we can confirm via TV Line that a reunion series called Fuller House might be heading to Netflix.

According to TV Line, Netflix is very close to ordering a 13-episode series that would star Candace Cameron Bure and Andrea Barber as BFFs D.J. and Kimmy.

For the Full House reunion guest appearances are being mulled over, and it’s said that Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, and John Stamos are all being looked at to reprise their roles as Danny Tanner, Jesse Katsopolis, and Joey Gladstone.

This isn’t the first time we’ve heard a Tanner-girls centered Full House show. Months ago, TV Guide reported that Warner Bros and the original producers of Full House were talking about a resurrection of sorts.

This talk about a revival seemed kismet considering another 90s favorite Boy Meets World had successfully launched a Disney spin-off Girl Meets World. Since discussion of a Full House spin-off, Girl Meets World has scored a second season, and has seen many of its original characters return and pop up in the series.

Although representatives of Netflix and Warner Bros. refused to comment on TV Line’s report, fans are already very excited about the potential of seeing some of their favorite characters back again.

It’s unknown whether the Olsen twins will reprise their role as Michelle Tanner, but it’s unlikely since they have virtually left the acting world for fashion.

As for middle daughter Stephanie Tanner played by Jodie Sweetin, it’s up in the air whether or not she will appear on the show. Odds are looking better for Sweetin than they are the Olsen twins. Sweetin has met up with the Full House cast mates during their many reunions, where the Olsen Twins have been absent.
