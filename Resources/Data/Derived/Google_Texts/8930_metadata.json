This is a name that got started when there was a picture I took that was meant to be ironic of me in these sunglasses and listening to a rap song, making sort of a funny hand signal.\"\n\nShkreli first made headlines as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, when he hiked up the price of a potentially life-saving AIDS drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill.\n\nThe feds arrested him on unrelated charges late last year. Prosecutors say he improperly took cash from his first drug company, Retrophin, to pay off investors in some of his hedge funds.\n\nAlso last year, he emerged as the buyer who paid $2 million for a rare copy of an album from the rap group the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nHe said all the negative publicity surrounding the drug price hike and his image triggered the arrest.\n\nShkreli accused his critics of \"looking for someone to hate and if I fit that mold I almost feel I'm serving some sort of utility for them to feel that hate for me.\"\n\nHe's out on bail and continues to live-stream with his followers.\n\nClick for more from Fox 5.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/CRIME,/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast/New York", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-18 11:44:49 EST",
