HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange, as of Saturday had about 8.84 million people who had selected insurance plans for 2016, officials said Wednesday. That was an increase of 153,631 net customers, or more than double the tally seen in the prior seven-day period.

HealthCare.gov serves residents of 38 states.

With at least another 2.7 million or so people signed up for health plans sold by exchanges run by their own states and the District of Columbia, the national tally is now at least 11.5 million.

The current tally exceeds the 10 million national enrollment target that federal officials have set for the end of 2016. But it remains to be seen how many customers will drop coverage from Obamacare plans during the course of the year as they obtain insurance elsewhere, no longer find the plans affordable, or drop Obamacare for other reasons.
