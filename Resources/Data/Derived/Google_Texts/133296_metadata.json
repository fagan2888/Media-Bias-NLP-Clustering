The ruling by U.S. District judge Claudia Wilken in the Ed O\u2019Bannon lawsuit allows for trust funds to be established for major college football and men\u2019s basketball players, who can cash in, after their eligibility expires, on a portion of the proceeds generated by the use of their images and likenesses.\n\nIt appears that public opinion matches the judge's decision. In March, the Reason-Rupe poll asked 1,003 Americans:\n\nWhen a college or company sells a jersey with a college football or basketball player\u2019s number on it, or sells a video game with a player\u2019s likeness in it, do you think that player should receive some of the money from the sale of his likeness or jersey, or should that not be allowed?\n\nShould be allowed................................ 64%\n\nShould not be allowed.......................... 32%\n\nDon\u2019t Know............................................. 4%\n\nRefused.................................................. 1%\n\nUSA Today's Nina Mandell notes how attitudes about the NCAA are changing, \"Through the trial, Ed O\u2019Bannon and his fellow plaintiffs became heroes who took on an organization that many felt had treated them unfairly. In a matter of only a few years, the narrative swung from athletes being thought of as spoiled jocks to a group of kids who were being unfairly taken advantage of.\"\n\nThe ruling is the latest decision in a string of lawsuits pending against the NCAA and threatens to weaken the institutional power of the collegiate athletic organization.\n\nIn late July, the NCAA agreed to earmark $75 million toward concussion research as part of a settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by former football players who felt that the association mismanaged head injuries.\n\nAnd in March, the Chicago regional office of the National Labor Relations Board ruled that football players at Northwestern University had the right to unionize.\n\nNationwide telephone poll conducted March 26-30, 2014 interviewed 1,003 adults on both mobile (503) and landline (500) phones, with a margin of error +/- 3.6%.
