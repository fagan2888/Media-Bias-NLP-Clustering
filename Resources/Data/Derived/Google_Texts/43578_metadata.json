Stephen Fincher from Tennessee expressed his support on Twitter for the reauthorization. He cited the impact of the Ex-Im in Tennessee concerning job growth.\n\n\u201cIn #TN, more than 100 companies have worked w/ #ExImBank, combined, they have created more than 8,300 jobs for hardworking #Tennesseans #TN08,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nAdditionally, Fincher tweeted that Ex-Im has \u201csupported\u201d more than 1.3 million U.S. jobs in the past six years and that the agency facilitates lowering the national deficit.\n\nReforming and reauthorizing the #ExImBank will create good-paying #jobs for #Americans across our great nation #ExIm4jobs \u2014 Stephen Fincher (@RepFincherTN08) June 3, 2015\n\nHensarling, along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders, oppose reauthorizing the charter.\n\nHensarling said on Wednesday the bank was a form of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d and that big banks primarily profit off Ex-Im. Specifically, he cited that JPMorgan Chase & Co. has received more than $5.1 billion from Ex-Im.\n\n\u201cTo support more robust economic growth, economic justice and equal opportunity for all, it is time to wind down Ex-Im,\u201d Hensarling said.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., said to Fred Hochberg, the chairman and president of Ex-Im, that the bank harms American families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people you are hurting,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nResponding to Hochberg, who says Ex-Im is self-sustaining, Garrett shot back: \u201cIf that\u2019s true, you don\u2019t need to be here at all.\u201d\n\nGarrett historically has opposed reauthorizing the charter.\n\n\u201cEx-Im has transformed the role of government from a disinterested referee that guarantees a free and open marketplace into a biased actor that tilts the scales in favor of its friends in businesses,\u201d Garrett said in a press release in May 2015. \u201cWe have the opportunity to save capitalism from cronyism and to fulfill a promise to the American people to work for them instead of a select few with special connections in Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile Ex-Im claims 90 percent of its 2014 transactions supported small businesses, data from The Heritage Foundation and George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center shows that 20 percent of total Ex-Im authorizations go to small businesses.\n\nCongress reauthorized Ex-Im\u2019s charter in 2012, which increased the agency\u2019s exposure limit from $100 billion to $140 billion. Only Congress has the authority to reauthorize the bank\u2019s charter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The future of the Export-Import Bank is causing a divide among House Republicans.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The future of the Export-Import Bank is causing a divide among House Republicans.", "title": "House Republicans Split Over Ex-Im Bank's Future", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Hensarling.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-05T17:10:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GmyLaK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The future of the Export-Import Bank is causing a divide among House Republicans.", "title": "House Republicans Split Over Ex-Im Bank's Future", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Hensarling.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-06-04T12:31:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T17:10:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, Jeb Hensarling, House Financial Services Committee, JP Morgan Chase, cronyism"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c83\"", "article_summary": "With Ex-Im\u2019s charter set to expire June 30, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling acknowledged Wednesday that House Republicans are having a \u201cprincipled debate\u201d concerning the bank\u2019s future.\nThe future of the Export-Import Bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans to foreign countries and companies to pay for U.S. products, is causing a divide among House Republicans.\n\u201cTo support more robust economic growth, economic justice and equal opportunity for all, it is time to wind down Ex-Im,\u201d Hensarling said.\nHensarling said on Wednesday the bank was a form of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d and that big banks primarily profit off Ex-Im.\nMeanwhile, Rep.
