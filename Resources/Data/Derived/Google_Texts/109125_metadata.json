For one, more and more women have taken on new responsibilities outside the home by joining the paid workforce. While women made up only about one-third of the workforce in 1969, women today make up almost half of all workers in the United States. Women are also stepping up to lead the country; a record number of women ran for public office in 2012, and a record-high percentage of women are serving in Congress. In addition to making progress on issues of economics and leadership, women have made progress on health issues, which impact women\u2019s personal well-being, as well as their economic security. Over the past few years, women have been able to end gender discrimination by big insurance companies and gain free contraception coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDespite women\u2019s advancements, however, substantial inequalities remain. Although an increasing number of women are either the sole breadwinner for their family or share the role with their partners, women in the United States are paid only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. The pay gap is even larger for women of color. On average, African American women make 64 cents for every dollar that white men make. While 2012 was a watershed year for women in terms of getting elected to public office, women still comprise only 18.1 percent of Congress, despite making up more than half of the U.S. population. They also face challenges on health issues, as 2012 saw continued conservative efforts to erode women\u2019s ability to make their own decisions about their health and well-being.\n\nA deeper examination shows that disparities for women also exist among states. Women in Vermont, for example, make on average close to 85 cents for every dollar a man makes, while women in Wyoming make only 64 cents\u2014more than 25 percent less than women in Vermont. On leadership, 15 states have no female elected leaders in the House of Representatives or the Senate. Lastly, while less than 10 percent of women in Vermont, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Massachusetts are uninsured, nearly 25 percent of women in Texas do not have health insurance.\n\nHow women are faring across the states\n\nIn this report, we examine both the progress made and the challenges remaining for women across the country. We do so by reviewing three categories that are critical to women\u2019s overall well-being: economics, leadership, and health. Within each of those three categories, we analyze multiple factors\u201436 factors overall. In selecting the factors, we were unable to include every metric available but strove to include a broad array of factors that would help illustrate the multitude of issues facing women. We also included data on women of color in order to show the challenges that different communities face.\n\nFactors examined Economic security factors Overall wage gap for women\n\nWage gap for African American women\n\nWage gap for Hispanic American women\n\nPercentage of total female population that would be impacted by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour\n\nOverall poverty rate for women and girls\n\nPoverty rate for African American women and girls\n\nPoverty rate for Hispanic American women and girls\n\nPoverty rate for Asian American women and girls\n\nPoverty rate for Native American women and girls\n\nPaid family leave laws\n\nTemporary disability insurance\n\nPaid sick leave\n\nAccess to early childhood education\n\nSpending on early childhood education Leadership factors Women in Congress\n\nWomen in elected executive statewide office\n\nWomen in state legislature\n\nMinority women elected to Congress, executive statewide office, and state legislature\n\nOverall management gap\n\nManagement gap for African American women\n\nManagement gap for Hispanic American women\n\nManagement gap for Asian American women\n\nManagement gap for Native American women Health factors Overall percentage of women uninsured\n\nPercentage of African American women uninsured\n\nPercentage of Hispanic American women uninsured\n\nState position on Medicaid expansion\n\nDefunding Planned Parenthood and other providers\u2019 preventative health services\n\nPercentage of contraceptive needs met\n\nStates with forced ultrasound provisions\n\nUnconstitutional bans on abortion\n\nRestrictive counseling and waiting-period restrictions\n\nTargeted regulation of abortion provider, or TRAP, laws\n\nMaternal mortality rate\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\nRate of availability of obstetrician-gynecologists, or OB-GYNs\n\nWe ranked each state on all 36 factors and then arrived at overall rankings in the categories of economics, leadership, and health by taking the averages of how states ranked on the factors within those categories. We then gave each state an overall national ranking, taken from an average of how the states rank across the three categories.\n\nOur analysis determined that on matters of economics, leadership, and health, women, on average, fare the best in Maryland and the worst in Louisiana. More than 22 percent of women in Louisiana are in poverty, compared to 11 percent of women in Maryland. Additionally, taking in all of the leadership factors considered, Maryland ranks first in the nation in terms of women reaching leadership positions in the public and private sector. Meanwhile, Louisiana receives a D- on overall leadership factors.\n\nTable 1 in the PDF details how all 50 states rank on issues of economics, leadership, and health for women based on the 36 factors examined in this report.
