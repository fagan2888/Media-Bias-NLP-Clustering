We do feel people actually want to live healthier but they either don't see it's a problem for them, they don't know how to do something about it, or they think 'it's someone else's issue, not mine'.\"\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nIn particular, the imagery used of the \"spare tyre\" around the middle is one that Stubbs said many people can relate to.\n\n\"What the message really is with the 'grabbable gut' is that if you do have that visceral fat or grabbable gut, it's sitting around your organs, and your heart and kidney and liver, and it's actually doing damage right now to those organs,\" he said.\n\nStubbs said that the winter months in Canberra can be tough to encourage people to get moving, but this time of year is when people start to feel more motivated.\n\n\"If we can encourage as many Canberrans to start thinking about eating better and getting more active and getting into these habits now, during winter it won't be a problem for them.\"\n\nThe Live Lighter campaign comprises of television, radio and print advertisements, and refers the public through to a website with free resources.\n\n\"There's top tips, a meal planner and lots of case studies. It's a resource that's there for people to go and find out what works for them, and to develop a bit of a strategy to make some small changes,\" said Stubbs.\n\n\"Because even just small changes to the way you eat and how active you are can have a big impact on reducing your chances of getting heart disease, cancers and diabetes as well.\"\n\nThe three television commercials, radio commercial and print advertising, will run for a couple of months before the initial review, and directs the public to free, online resources.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ACT News, Diet & Fitness", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The Live Lighter campaign will take people inside the human body to show the internal dangers of being overweight.", "title": "Live Lighter campaigns to lose grabbable guts", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/live-lighter-campaigns-to-lose-grabbable-guts-20141019-118cr0.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/i/e/5/g/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.118cr0.png/1413746973270.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LifestyleAU", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/i/e/5/g/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.118cr0.png/1413746973270.jpg"}, "description": "The Live Lighter campaign will take people inside the human body to show the internal dangers of being overweight.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Live Lighter campaigns to lose grabbable guts"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Live Lighter campaign will take people inside the human body to show the internal dangers of being overweight."}, "article_summary": "The Live Lighter campaign comprises of television, radio and print advertisements, and refers the public through to a website with free resources.\nBased on anti-smoking campaigns, the advertisements show graphic, internal images of \"toxic fat\" surrounding vital organs, and warn of the links between a \"grabbable gut\" and chronic diseases.\n\"Because even just small changes to the way you eat and how active you are can have a big impact on reducing your chances of getting heart disease, cancers and diabetes as well.\"\nHeart Foundation ACT chief executive Tony Stubbs said while the campaign was graphic, it was necessary to get the message through to the public.\n\"What the message really is with the 'grabbable gut' is that if you do have that visceral fat or grabbable gut, it's sitting around your organs, and your heart and kidney and liver, and it's actually doing damage right now to those organs,\" he said."}
