Failing to do so foregoes money that Virginia taxpayers have paid into and denies health insurance to 400,000 Virginians, Arthur said.\n\n\"Virginians currently are paying federal taxes for Medicaid expansion and getting nothing in return,\" she said.\n\nShe is a New Jersey native who graduated from Washington and Lee Law School. Arthur practiced family law and worked for the Legal Aid Society of the Roanoke Valley, according to a release that accompanied her campaign kickoff. She has lived in the 24th District for 39 years.\n\nEqual pay for women, a higher minimum wage and expansion of high-speed Internet to rural communities are other goals for Arthur.\n\nHouse of Delegates candidates Angela Lynn and Ellen Arthur on the steps of the Augusta County Circuit Courthouse during the April 2 kickoff for Arthur's campaign.
