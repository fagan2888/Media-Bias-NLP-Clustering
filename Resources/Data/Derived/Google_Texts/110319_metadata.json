Randy Neugebauer Randy NeugebauerOvernight Finance: GOP's budget 'SWAT' team | What to watch at IRS impeachment hearing | Sanders bucks Dem leaders on Puerto Rico bill Overnight Cybersecurity: Clinton email hacker to plead guilty Financial industry spars with retailers over data breach bill MORE (R-Texas), has faced fierce pushback from retailers, which warn it would be overly burdensome to some smaller businesses while allowing other companies \u2014 like third-party vendors and financial institutions \u2014 to escape regulation altogether.\n\n\u201cPolitically speaking, we think the way to get a bill through Congress is not to have committees pick winners and losers, but recognize that everyone suffers data breaches and everyone should have the same obligations,\u201d said Paul Martino, senior policy counsel at the National Retail Federation.\n\nUnder the language of the bill, third-party service providers are required to notify a company in the event of a breach, but are only required to contact customers directly if it has been agreed in writing that they are responsible for notification.\n\nRetailers say this unfairly shields them from the reputational damage and other costs associated with a breach.\n\nThe legislation would place financial institutions under the same breach notification requirements as other companies, but exempt them from certain data security requirements.\n\nFinancial services companies say they are already required to meet stiffer security mandates under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a sweeping reform law passed in 1999.\n\nThe Financial Services Roundtable lauded Neugebauer\u2019s bill Wednesday, claiming it would close a loophole that \u201cleaves consumers\u2019 important personal and payment information potentially exposed during a financial transaction at a retailer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically we looked for where the holes were, in data security and in the notification process,\u201d Neugebauer told The Hill.\n\nCritics of the bill have expressed concerns that codifying cybersecurity requirements is counterproductive.\n\nRetailers spend the year preparing for the annual holiday assault \u2014 bolstering encryption, strengthening infrastructure and verifying the security of their third-party vendors \u2014 but security experts say the landscape changes constantly.\n\nMalware infections on Cyber Monday spiked 76 percent this year, compared to a 40 percent increase in 2014, according to research from the security firm Enigma Software.\n\n\u201cAddressing modern cybercrime ... often will require retailers and other industries to be nimble and creative in order to tackle evolving threats,\u201d said Jennifer Safavian, executive vice president for government affairs at RILA. \u201cPermanently codifying new standards will hinder efforts by retailers and other industries to adapt to an evolving threat landscape.\u201d\n\nNeugebauer maintains that the Data Security Act is technology-neutral to \u201cleave plenty of room for the industry to be innovative.\u201d\n\nIn general, many retailers support uniform notification requirements as a way to improve industry cybersecurity. Companies will want to avoid the brand damage associated with a breach, they say, and will bolster their networks accordingly.\n\n\u201cBreach notification becomes a market-based incentive to improve data security,\u201d Martino said.\n\nA competing bill from the Energy and Commerce Committee has a little more traction among retailers, but has been bogged down by a partisan scuffle over whether the law would preempt existent state data security regulations.\n\nPut forward by Reps. Marsha Blackburn Marsha Blackburn178 Dems demand end to Planned Parenthood probe Carson: 'I would not want to be on the ticket or in the Cabinet\u2019 Sunday shows preview: Sanders opens up about battle with Clinton MORE (R-Tenn.) and Peter Welch Peter WelchOvernight Defense: Senate panel approves 2B defense bill Lawmakers push for ISIS war measure in defense bill Lawmakers urge Obama not to send shoulder-fired missiles to Syria MORE (D-Vt.), the measure would require companies to maintain reasonable security practices and inform customers within 30 days if their data might have been stolen during a breach.\n\nOne amendment, put forward by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) and approved by the committee, earned retailer support by requiring third-party vendors to make notice of their own breaches.\n\nLike the Data Security Act, the notification requirement would be enacted on a national level, something retailers support because of the certainty that a single standard offers.\n\nBut Democrats argue that the legislation, while saving companies the hassle of following separate state laws, would do away with stronger consumer protections at the state level.\n\nThe dispute has kept the bill from reaching a floor vote.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) expressed similar concerns about the Financial Services bill, but her amendment allowing 12 states with existing laws to be exempted was voted down.\n\nBill supporters say that the security provisions in Neugebauer\u2019s bill are tougher than most state regulations.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the strongest bill that is out there,\u201d Neugebauer said. \u201cMassachusetts would be the only state that maybe has standards\n\nthat are higher than we have [in the bill].\u201d\n\nAs high-profile breaches continue to make headlines, data security bills have cluttered both chambers this year. In the Senate, there are at least four offerings, including a companion to the Data Security Act. Sen. Mark Warner Mark WarnerClinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick Lawmaker bemoans tax 'buzzsaw' for on-demand economy workers Reid throws wrench into Clinton vice presidential picks MORE (D-Va.) is also reportedly circulating a discussion draft that appears to have strong retailer support.\n\nIn the House, Neugebauer\u2019s bill also competes with legislation from Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), as well as a new proposal from Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), unveiled on Tuesday.\n\nNeugebauer told The Hill that he has initiated conversations with the Energy and Commerce Committee with an eye toward combining the two offerings into a single bill supported by both committees. He expressed confidence that his bill \u2014 which passed committee vote with broad bipartisan support \u2014 has a shot at seeing the floor.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve set a template for what a bipartisan bill can look like,\u201d Neugebauer told The Hill. \u201cWe think we have something we can run with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Industry braces itself for an onslaught of holiday season hacking attacks.", "description": "Industry braces itself for an onslaught of holiday season hacking attacks.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Industry braces itself for an onslaught of holiday season hacking attacks.", "title": "Retailers pan cyber bills as holiday assault looms", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/262738-retailers-pan-cyber-bills-as-holiday-assault-looms", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/debitcard_target_121913getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/262738-retailers-pan-cyber-bills-as-holiday-assault-looms", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-10T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Garrett Evans", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Marsha Blackburn, Randy Neugebauer, Peter Welch, Mark Warner,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-10T06:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/262738-retailers-pan-cyber-bills-as-holiday-assault-looms", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Industry braces itself for an onslaught of holiday season hacking attacks.", "card": "summary", "title": "Retailers pan cyber bills as holiday assault looms"}, "dcterms.title": "Retailers pan cyber bills as holiday assault looms"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28e2\"", "article_summary": "Retailers say this unfairly shields them from the reputational damage and other costs associated with a breach.\nIn the Senate, there are at least four offerings, including a companion to the Data Security Act.\nThe legislation would place financial institutions under the same breach notification requirements as other companies, but exempt them from certain data security requirements.\nFinancial services companies say they are already required to meet stiffer security mandates under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a sweeping reform law passed in 1999.\nRetailers spend the year preparing for the annual holiday assault \u2014 bolstering encryption, strengthening infrastructure and verifying the security of their third-party vendors \u2014 but security experts say the landscape changes constantly."}
