Senator Alexander released a statement saying, “Marco Rubio is the conservative candidate who can inspire us, win the election, and lead our country. The stakes are high. If our nominee does not win, Hillary Clinton’s justices will control the Supreme Court for 30 years and we’ll be stuck with Obamacare forever.”

He went on to add, “I have watched Marco up close. I have seen him take the lead in passing new laws to impose tough new sanctions on Hezbollah terrorists, and to get rid of incompetent managers who weren’t doing their jobs to help veterans. He has proposed good new ideas for giving students more options for college. I am convinced he would be a strong and effective president of the United States.”

Senator Alexander was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2013. He has previously served as the U.S. Secretary of Education during the George H.W. Bush Administration from 1991-1993.

He was also Governor of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987.
