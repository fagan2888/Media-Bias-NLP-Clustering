A South Carolina family was surprised and overjoyed when their soldier son, who they believed to be overseas, unexpectedly jumped into a family photo.

The Johns were posing on Liberty Bridge at Falls Park in Greenville, S.C., when Jared Johns, a member of the U.S. Army who had been stationed in Germany, came up behind them.

Father Kevin Johns was directing the photo—and the surprise.

“I think we’re missing someone,” Kevin said as his family looked around in confusion.

Just then, Jared ran up behind them, attempting to photobomb the picture and asking, “Mind if I hop in this picture with y’all?”

Jared’s mother Kathy Bowling immediately started screaming, and greeted her son with a long hug.

“Best surprise ever!” yelled Jared’s sister, who proudly explained to spectators, “That’s my brother! He came back from overseas!”
