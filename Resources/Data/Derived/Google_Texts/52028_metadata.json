And this was his second stint in a Democratic White House; he was President Bill Clinton\u2019s senior health policy adviser from the mid-1990s to early 2001. He then became a consultant, forming Jennings Policy Strategies.\n\nThe Obama White House approached him in the summer because of his far-reaching network in the world of health care and his command of policy intricacies. Starting in July, he worked closely with the insurance industry and other groups involved in the implementation of the 2010 health-care law designed to usher in broad changes to the U.S. system.\n\nOn Thursday, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough commented on the departure, saying, \u201cWe are all focused on reducing health-care costs and implementing the Affordable Care Act. Nobody did so with more intellect, fortitude and heart than Chris Jennings.\u201d\n\nJennings said: \u201cIt has been an honor to help ensure that the promise of affordable, quality health care embodied in this historic law becomes the reality for all Americans. This is the cause of my professional life.\u201d He said that he has not decided whether he will reopen his own consultancy but that he \u201cwill always serve in some capacity in this issue.\u201d\n\nThe White House has continued to juggle personnel on health care, recently bringing in a former Microsoft executive, Kurt DelBene, to oversee improvements in the online marketplace, HealthCare.gov, and Phil Schiliro, a former chief legislative liaison, to oversee policy aspects of the law\u2019s implementation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Jennings leaves after six months, citing personal health concerns.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Chris Jennings leaves after six months, citing personal health concerns.", "title": "White House adviser on Obamacare steps down after 6 months", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/chris-jennings-white-house-adviser-on-health-care-steps-down/2014/01/23/bb1539e4-846b-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/chris-jennings-white-house-adviser-on-health-care-steps-down/2014/01/23/bb1539e4-846b-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, chris jennings, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "bb1539e4-846b-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health, chris jennings, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd87b\"", "article_summary": "And this was his second stint in a Democratic White House; he was President Bill Clinton\u2019s senior health policy adviser from the mid-1990s to early 2001.\nJennings is a veteran of many of Washington\u2019s political and policy debates involving health care in the past three decades.\nThe Obama White House approached him in the summer because of his far-reaching network in the world of health care and his command of policy intricacies.\nOn Thursday, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough commented on the departure, saying, \u201cWe are all focused on reducing health-care costs and implementing the Affordable Care Act.\nChris Jennings, the White House\u2019s coordinator of health reform, has resigned six months after he was recruited to try to iron out the implementation of major aspects of the Affordable Care Act."}
