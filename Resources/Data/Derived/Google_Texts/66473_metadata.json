Programming will be operational this summer, she said.\n\nAn increased need expressed by patients prompted Family First to pursue the funding, Englerth said. The demand for support exceeded the health center's capacity and the capacity at a community level, she said.\n\n\"By adding these resources we believe that we can better meet the needs of our patients and so do our part to bring resources to the table to meet this growing community problem,\" Englerth said.\n\nAbout the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funding\n\nThe federal agency awarded $94 million to 271 health centers in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The money is generated from Affordable Care Act funding and is expected to help awardees hire approximately 800 providers to treat nearly 124,000 new patients, the release said.\n\nHealth centers in Pennsylvania will receive $1.78 million.
