So, in an amicable split in September 2014, Grathwohl took his clients and left Group Associates and became area vice president with Gallagher Benefit Services Inc. in Bingham Farms.\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't easy because Kent and I worked together for 25 years,\" said Zick, president of the company. \"It was a painful decision. Kent and I have a lot of respect for each other. It was almost like a divorce on very friendly terms. We continue to share accounts and work together.\"\n\n\n\nGrathwohl said his brokerage work selling life and health policies at Gallagher is similar to his former job at Group Associates.\n\n\n\n\"We weren't able to deliver enough lives to (fuel) the administrative (technology) engine\" at Group Associates because \"(outside) brokers were not willing to put business with him,\" Grathwohl said.\n\n\n\nZick said Group Associates was one of the first benefit companies to take advantage of online information technology in the late 1980s.\n\n\n\n\"We worked with a lot of carriers, and over the years our services increased and added capability of enrolling employees online,\" he said. \"As time went on, technology became more sophisticated, and we realized we could do far more.\"\n\n\n\nBut Zick said the conflict developed between brokerage services and administrative services because other insurance brokers didn't want to do business with Group Associates because they feared \"we could replace them as broker\" to their clients.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "After nearly 30 years as an insurance brokerage, technology services and benefit consulting business, the Bingham Farms-based company has refocused its business model to become a technology solutions subsidiary to a Chicago health tech firm.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "After nearly 30 years as an insurance brokerage, technology services and benefit consulting business, the Bingham Farms-based company has refocused its business model to become a technology solutions subsidiary to a Chicago health tech firm.", "title": "Group Associates reformats after split, acquisition", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160124/NEWS/301249992/group-associates-reformats-after-split-acquisition", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20160124/NEWS/301249992/V1/0/David_Zick_and_Kent_Grathwohl.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "theme-color": "#b51218", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Mergers and acquisitions", "published_time": "2016-01-24T08:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-25T12:48:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "Group Associates reformats after split, acquisitionFor nearly 30 years, David Zick ran Bingham Farms-based Group Associates Inc. as an insurance brokerage, technology services and benefit consulting firm with his business partner Kent Grathwohl.\nSo, in an amicable split in September 2014, Grathwohl took his clients and left Group Associates and became area vice president with Gallagher Benefit Services Inc. in Bingham Farms.\nGrathwohl said his brokerage work selling life and health policies at Gallagher is similar to his former job at Group Associates.\nZick said Group Associates was one of the first benefit companies to take advantage of online information technology in the late 1980s.\n\"We weren't able to deliver enough lives to (fuel) the administrative (technology) engine\" at Group Associates because \"(outside) brokers were not willing to put business with him,\" Grathwohl said."}
