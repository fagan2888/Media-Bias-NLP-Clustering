Kennedy, as helping Republicans to recapture a majority in the Senate, where Democrats currently hold 53 seats and Republicans 45.\n\nBrown was defeated in his Massachusetts 2012 reelection bid by Democrat Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAn American Research Group poll of 533 registered New Hampshire voters released after Brown on March 14 said he had begun exploring a run showed Shaheen leading the challenger, with 50 percent of respondents supporting the incumbent and 38 percent backing Brown.
