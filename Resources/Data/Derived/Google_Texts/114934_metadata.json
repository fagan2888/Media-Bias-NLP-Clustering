We will not tolerate such practices and will continue to be vigilant in our pursuit of companies who wrong consumers in this market.\u201d\n\nThe agency says the problems began with the telemarketers who were charged with selling the credit protection programs. Customers were told that if they purchased the product, Bank of America would cancel a portion of their debt in the event of certain adverse events, such as involuntary unemployment or disability.\n\nThe problem is that the telemarketers misstated the details of the program in the scripts read to consumers and that in some cases, the telemarketers didn\u2019t bother with the script at all. That failure resulted in misleading sales pitches and leaving out important information.\n\nThe agency contends that the bank\u2019s representatives misled customers about a number of things, including whether or not the first month of coverage was free, and exactly what protection was being provided. Other customers were signed up for the product despite being given the impression that they had only agreed to receive more information about it.\n\nRelated: Rough Week for an Agency Targeted by the GOP\n\nWith regard to other \u201ccredit protection\u201d products, the CFPB found that Bank of America had billed customers for services that they did not receive, sometimes causing them to exceed their credit limits and incur fees and increased interest charges.\n\nOn top of reimbursing customers $727 million, the agreement requires the bank to pay a $20 million civil penalty to the CFPB. The bank will also face a $25 million civil penalty payable to its primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nThe bank acknowledged the agreement in a press release Wednesday, noting, \u201cBank of America stopped marketing identity theft protection products in December 2011 and credit card debt cancellation products in August of 2012.\u201d The bank\u2019s release reported a slightly higher amount of money that will be repaid to customers, putting the figure at $738 million.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau determined that Bank of America was selling \u201cadd-ons\u201d to credit card accounts but providing little or no value in return.
