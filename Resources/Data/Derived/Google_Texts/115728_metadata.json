Rick Scott a thumbs-up for delivering on jobs and education.\n\nMr. Bush served as Florida governor from 1999 to 2007 and is rumored to be a leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nIn a 30-second TV spot, Mr. Bush implies that Republican-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist is battling Mr. Scott only to get his old job back. Mr. Crist served as governor from 2007 to 2011.\n\n\u201cIn my experience as governor, I found that there are two kinds of politicians,\u201d Mr. Bush says. \u201cThose that are driven by personal ambition and those that deliver results. Rick Scott delivers results.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush says Mr. Scott cut unemployment in half and presided over an economy that created 600,000 jobs.\n\nMr. Crist, meanwhile, says Mr. Scott has not done enough to insure nearly 800,000 Floridians who could benefit from Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nMr. Scott supported the expansion last year, but did not lobby for it and the measure died in the Republican-controlled legislature.\n\nMr. Crist says he will consider an executive order to expand the program to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican Party of Florida released a campaign ad Tuesday in which Jeb Bush gives Florida Gov.
