Brown\u2019s streak ended there. After Miami\u2019s Knowshon Moreno took the Week 1 lead, Murray has been the NFL\u2019s leading rusher by a wide margin since Week 2. His 785 yards are 243 better than next-best Le\u2019Veon Bell of Pittsburgh.\n\nBackground: Murray grew up in Las Vegas, where he played against Broncos safety Quinton Carter. In his first game as a freshman at Oklahoma, Murray ran for four touchdowns in the first half. But after an injury-prone four years with the Sooners, Murray wasn\u2019t selected by Dallas until the third round of the 2011 draft. Backs drafted ahead of him include Mark Ingram, Ryan Williams, Shane Vereen, Mikel Leshoure and Daniel Thomas.\n\nKlis\u2019 take: Murray\u2019s potentially historic season \u2014 he\u2019s on pace for 2,093 yards rushing, 12 shy of Eric Dickerson\u2019s 30-year-old league record \u2014 began on draft day when the Cowboys overruled owner Jerry Jones by making the boring selection of guard Zack Martin instead of the entertaining choice of Johnny Football. Football games are won up front. Johnny Manziel would have enhanced the circus, but not contributed as Tony Romo\u2019s backup QB. Martin starts alongside center Tyler Fredrickson, the Cowboys\u2019 first-round draft pick in 2013. And left tackle Tyron Smith was their first-round pick in 2011 \u2014 the year Murray was taken in the third. Prioritizing brawn over glitz has put Murray in position for a special season.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cowboys,DeMarco Murray,NFL", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "DeMarco Murray has joined the legendary Jim Brown as the only NFL running backs to rush for at least 100 yards in the first six games of a season.", "title": "DeMarco Murray: Spotlight on the Dallas Cowboys running back", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/10/18/demarco-murray-spotlight-dallas-cowboys-running-back/30367/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/DeMarco-Murray.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "DeMarco Murray has joined the legendary Jim Brown as the only NFL running backs to rush for at least 100 yards in the first six games of a season.", "title": "DeMarco Murray: Spotlight on the Dallas Cowboys running back", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/10/18/demarco-murray-spotlight-dallas-cowboys-running-back/30367/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/DeMarco-Murray.jpg", "creator": "@mikeklis", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "DeMarco Murray has joined the legendary Jim Brown as the only NFL running backs to rush for at least 100 yards in the first six games of a season."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb57\"", "article_summary": "Martin starts alongside center Tyler Fredrickson, the Cowboys\u2019 first-round draft pick in 2013.\nSpotlight on \u2026DeMarco Murray, RB, CowboysWhen: 2:25 p.m. Sunday when Dallas (5-1) hosts the New York Giants (3-3) in an NFC East game.\nFootball games are won up front.\nBut after an injury-prone four years with the Sooners, Murray wasn\u2019t selected by Dallas until the third round of the 2011 draft.\nAnd left tackle Tyron Smith was their first-round pick in 2011 \u2014 the year Murray was taken in the third."}
