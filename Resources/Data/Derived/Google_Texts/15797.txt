NOTTOWAY COUNTY, Va. — A Virginia teen is getting national attention after a photo of him helping an older man went viral.

Teresa Adams was driving home when her son, Tommy, told her to stop the car.

“Tommy said ‘Mamma stop the car,'” Teresa Adams recalled. “I got scared and asked ‘What’s wrong?'”

"There’s an older man with a walker shoveling snow — I’ll help him out,” Tommy told his mother.

Teresa told WTVR the man seemed surprised when her son asked him for the snow shovel.

“I told him to get back into his car because it was cold,” the teen said.

The proud mother snapped a photo of her son's good deed and shared it on WTVR's Facebook page.

"Other people who saw him in the snow should have had the decency to stop," the teen said.

The older man was grateful for the help.

“He said ‘God bless you, the world needs more people like you,'” Tommy recalled.
