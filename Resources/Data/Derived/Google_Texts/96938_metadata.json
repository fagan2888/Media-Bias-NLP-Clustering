Now the side benefits of oil are spilling over onto South Dakota college campuses. Young scholars looking to be part of the archeology pipeline.\n\nNorth Dakota oil is energizing students at Augustana College.\n\n\"I think it's great, it's an opportunity that we'll have when we leave here,\" Augustana senior Jason Bassett said.\n\nArcheologists are in high demand to survey oil fields before the drilling can begin.\n\n\"It kicks into place part of the environmental laws that require archaeology to be done and so I think that there's been maybe a 4 or 5-fold increase in the number of archeologists up in North Dakota in just the last several months,\" Augustana Principal Archeologist Adrien Hannus said.\n\nAugustana anthropology and archaeology students are excited by their job prospects, plus in the rising prominence of their field of study.\n\n\"Just in talking to people on the street, everybody seems to know what archaeology is these days, a couple of years ago, people didn't know. I get asked if I was going to build buildings because they thought architecture, because that's all they know,\" Bassett said.\n\nHannus says the North Dakota oil fields offer a potential \"mixed bag\" of archaeological finds -- mostly artifacts from ancient encampments that date back thousands of years.\n\n\"You've got the possibility of at least 10,000 years of pre-history, so what you would have is either kill sites where some ancient animals were killed or butchered, you could have campsites sometimes even associated with kill sites,\" Hannus said.\n\nStudents are concerned that oil companies might be too eager to drill at the expense of the prehistoric artifacts underground.\n\n\"If they try to do it too quickly, we can lose some things, but if the archaeologists can get in there right away, I think we have the potential to discover quite a few new sites,\" Augustana senior Bradie Schulz said.\n\n\n\nIf drilling sites are deemed historically significant, the oil companies might have to relocate their wells, perhaps hundred feet from their original target. Such a move could place archaeologists and oil companies at cross-purposes.\n\n\"Because they want to get on with their project and we're trying to slow them down to preserve what's there. But I think if there's a good working relationship, things can turn out all right,\" Schulz said.\n\n\"The public image of this is that archaeologists go out, lay down in front of the bulldozers and ruin multi-million dollar endeavors and that is just not the way it works,\" Hannus said.\n\nHannus says the process of salvaging the artifacts can delay the projects but not stop them in their tracks. That allows plenty of room for archaeologists to unearth new discoveries before oil companies start drilling.\n\n\"You protect the archaeology but then people like myself get jobs and then the roads get built an so every body's working so it's great for everybody,\" Bassett said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the number of historic sites in North Dakota went from 846 in 2009 to more than 26,000 in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "We&#39;ve seen how the North Dakota oil boom has created thousands of new jobs ranging from rig workers to road builders to truckers.
