Not by a long shot.\n\nWhen the games get close, the Nuggets have been at their best, and Saturday night\u2019s 104-101 over the Detroit Pistons at the Pepsi Center was no different.\n\nThe Nuggets are 8-3 in games decided by three points or less this season. So almost half of their victories have come under these cirumstances. When the pressure is turned up, the Nuggets have made the plays.\n\nLike these four, all in the closing seconds against the Pistons:\n\n\u2013 Danilo Gallinari nailing a long jump shot with 23.8 seconds to play, putting the Nuggets up 102-101 at the time.\n\n\u2013 The Nuggets forcing two missed layups on the ensuing Pistons possession, then getting the rebound.\n\n\u2013 Nikola Jokic nearly blocking the Pistons\u2019 last-gasp layup attempt by Reggie Jackson with 3.9 seconds to play.\n\n\u2013 Emmanuel Mudiay hitting two free throws with 0.3 seconds to go to push the lead to the final margin.\n\nWhy have the Nuggets been so good in these situations?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great coaching,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, smiling. \u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d\n\nDanilo Gallinari couldn\u2019t put a finger on it.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWhatever it is, the Nuggets wouldn\u2019t mind bottling it up and repeating it the rest of the season. Malone readily admits his team isn\u2019t the kind that is going to get blowouts, so being able to navigate the turbulent waters of close games is a must.\n\nGetting to closing time on Saturday night was a roller coaster ride.\n\nThe first order of business was figuring out a strategy against, the biggest, baddest inside force in the NBA \u2014 Detroit behemoth Andre Drummond.\n\nTo do it, they simply small-balled the 6-foot-11, 280-pound Drummond out of the game.\n\nFoul trouble did the trick early on. Drummond played two minutes before picking up two fouls. Still, early in his absence, Detroit played like a well-oiled machine. The Pistons had 22 of their first 41 points in the paint, largely without Drummond. They dominated the boards early, 24-9, also without Drummond on the court.\n\nSo there was considerable work to do for the Nuggets.\n\nThe first course of action was getting Drummond away from the basket, making him guard Nuggets rookie center Nikola Jokic, who took \u2014 and made \u2014 jump shots to make it happen. It was part of a big third quarter.\n\nThat third quarter was one of the best the Nuggets have put together this season, and it began with the starters. Emmanuel Mudiay made his first five shots of the third, and he and Jokic combined to score 19 of the Nuggets\u2019 first 26 points in the period.\n\nGuard Gary Harris got in the act, too, making all three of his shots en route to seven points in the third. The Nuggets, who trailed 54-45 at halftime, hit the Pistons with a 20-8 start in third, outscored the Pistons 39-20 overall and turned that deficit into a 10-point lead going into the fourth.\n\n\u201cWe just got stops and we started running,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the best half court team, so we\u2019ve got to get stops. But when it\u2019s a running game we\u2019re one of the best in the league because we\u2019re so young, so athletic.\u201d\n\nBut the reserves couldn\u2019t hold it.\n\nIt took the Pistons 4 \u00bd minutes to erase the entire lead, and they outscored the Nuggets 18-5 before Malone was forced to put starters back in the game a little earlier than normal.\n\nThe Pistons\u2019 run became 20-5 before the Nuggets had four starters back in, and then Jokic\u2019s insertion into the game with just under seven minutes meant all five were back \u2014 but with a lot of time to burn to get to the finish line.\n\nAron Baynes hit a layup with 48.3 seconds to play to put the Pistons up 101-100.\n\nBut the Nuggets weren\u2019t done. On the next possession, Danilo Gallinari got the ball, faced up Pistons defender Marcus Morris and hit a step-back jumper as the shot clock ran out, and with 23.8 seconds to play to put the Nuggets up 102-101.\n\n\u201cWhen I caught the ball I saw there was like four seconds on the clock,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cI thought I had to make a move. It was not easy, I was in a tough spot, but it went in.\u201d\n\nGallinari led the Nuggets with 30 points. Mudiay had one of his best games of the season, scoring 18 points, adding four assists and four rebounds.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets find way to grind out win", "title": "Denver Nuggets find way to grind out win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/denver-nuggets-find-way-to-grind-out-win/", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__BN20160124_CC6_BNSP24BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg", "height": 653}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__BN20160124_CC6_BNSP24BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T22:28:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T02:10:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Yet executing at winning time has largely not been a problem for the young Nuggets this season.\nIt was not easy, I was in a tough spot, but it went in.\u201dGallinari led the Nuggets with 30 points.\nThat third quarter was one of the best the Nuggets have put together this season, and it began with the starters.\nThe Nuggets are 8-3 in games decided by three points or less this season.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dWhatever it is, the Nuggets wouldn\u2019t mind bottling it up and repeating it the rest of the season."}
