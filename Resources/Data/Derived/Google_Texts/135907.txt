Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) won his primary election on Tuesday, securing the Republican nomination to defend his seat in the House, the Associated Press reports.

The incumbent representative was expected to win his primary challenge from Republican Jeremy Ryan, who is of no relation to the congressman. The challenger, known as "Segway Jeremy Ryan" after being arrested at the state Capitol in 2011, where he had been riding a Segway as part of a labor protest. Jeremy Ryan does not live in Wisconsin's 1st District, but reportedly would have moved there had he won.

Rep. Paul Ryan has widely been viewed as a potential Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election. If Ryan wins his re-election in November, he may have to interrupt his term in the House to hit the campaign trail. The congressman ran unsuccessfully as the party's vice presidential candidate in 2012.

Ryan is seeking a ninth term in the House, where he currently serves as chairman of the House Budget Committee. He will face the Democratic nominee in November's general election.
