Bush was a nice, affable fellow who would pursue moderate, bipartisan policies,\u201d he wrote, perhaps a critique of fellow columnist Frank Bruni, who covered the Bush campaign for the Times that year.\n\nBut between the lines, Krugman also seemed to be arguing with progressives who might prefer a candidate who has been more outspoken on issues of fair trade, income inequality, Wall Street and the minimum wage.\n\nKrugman\u2019s take: A Democrat will preserve entitlements and Obamacare. A Republican won\u2019t. Post-Great Recession reforms are safe under a Democrat but not a Republican. Climate change will be addressed by a Democrat and ignored by Republicans.\n\nHe writes:\n\nAs we head into 2016, each party is quite unified on major policy issues \u2014 and these unified positions are very far from each other. The huge, substantive gulf between the parties will be reflected in the policy positions of whomever they nominate, and will almost surely be reflected in the actual policies adopted by whoever wins.\n\nSome of his assertions are curious. After all, President Obama has searched eagerly for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on entitlement reform. He\u2019s been oddly inactive on climate change until recently. Krugman doesn\u2019t touch on Clinton\u2019s sometimes-McCain-esque instincts on foreign policy at all. And this line \u2014 \u201cMeanwhile, the influence of big money on Democrats has at least eroded a bit, now that Wall Street, furious over regulations and modest tax hikes, has deserted the party en masse\u201d \u2014 seems strangely hopeful or naive, especially as Clinton reportedly seeks to raise $2.5 billion for her race.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It\u2019s hard to see how anyone who has been paying attention could be undecided even now,\" he writes", "title": "Paul Krugman: Whether Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren, the difference between Democrats and GOP is stark", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"It\u2019s hard to see how anyone who has been paying attention could be undecided even now,\" he writes", "title": "Paul Krugman: Whether Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren, the difference between Democrats and GOP is stark", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/13/paul_krugman_whether_hillary_clinton_or_elizabeth_warren_the_difference_between_democrats_and_gop_is_stark/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/krugman_moyers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It\u2019s hard to see how anyone who has been paying attention could be undecided even now,\" he writes", "title": "Paul Krugman: Whether Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren, the difference between Democrats and GOP is stark", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/krugman_moyers.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Salon Staff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, New York Times, Paul Krugman, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3ea\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, New York Times, Paul Krugman, Republican Party, Business News, Politics NewsHillary Clinton just got into the race yesterday, but New York Times columnist Paul Krugman\u2019s piece today is already attacking those who would argue there\u2019s not enough difference between the two parties.\nKrugman doesn\u2019t touch on Clinton\u2019s sometimes-McCain-esque instincts on foreign policy at all.\nSounding frustrated and admitting that he is \u201cdreading the next 18 months,\u201d Krugman aimed his ire at those in the media who cover campaigns as a personality contest.\nHe writes:As we head into 2016, each party is quite unified on major policy issues \u2014 and these unified positions are very far from each other.\nPost-Great Recession reforms are safe under a Democrat but not a Republican."}
