Not necessarily physically, though I wasn\u2019t in great shape there, either. But the biggest problem is that I was suicidal and only somewhat willing to believe that my near-constant depression was related to the vats of cocaine I was regularly shoveling up my nose. Still, I was determined to do whatever I possibly could to change.\n\nI was also a little boy-crazy. This was nothing new; I\u2019d been like that, in part, since my first kindergarten crush. The only time in my life when I hadn\u2019t really been like that were the few years before I got sober: My life had gotten so small that the most regular guy in my life at that point was my coke dealer Alex and trust me when I tell you that I didn\u2019t have a single sexual thought about him.\n\nBut suddenly, I was among the living again. I was in groups and meetings with a bounty of straight men and though my counselors and sponsor were telling me that I should avoid dating for the first year of my sobriety, it was advice that I nodded at and then promptly ignored. I\u2019d been holed up in my apartment with only cocaine and cats for company for years and now that I wasn\u2019t isolated anymore, they were asking me to turn off the part of myself I\u2019d been somewhat ruled by since before I ever discovered drugs and alcohol? Uh, try again.\n\nHow well did the dating go? Suffice it to say that I ended up learning why this yearlong avoidance had been recommended. The best way I can summarize what happened is that my addiction had done something to my \u201cpicker\u201d and as a result, the men I was drawn to weren\u2019t the healthiest specimens. But I was one of the lucky ones\u2014even though I dated various men and suffered rejection and remorse and all those things that can accompany less-than-healthy dating, I was able to stay the course. I don\u2019t really know why that was true for me and isn\u2019t always true for others; maybe my disease wasn\u2019t as far advanced as it could have been or the men I got involved with weren\u2019t appealing enough for me to have bottomed out after things went awry. All I know is that I have seen many women leave the program and sobriety because the pain they were experiencing as the result of romantic entanglements left them feeling like they had no other choice.\n\nStrangely, despite the fact that it\u2019s been established for quite some time that there are differences when it comes to treating men and women for addiction and that women from all-female recovery treatment groups relapse less often than women in mixed groups, rehabs have been slow to implement gender-specific treatment. Hazelden (in Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Oregon), Caron (in Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida) and Solid Landings Behavioral Group (in Costa Mesa, California) are the only major rehabs I\u2019m aware of which separate the genders for treatment. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s nothing that could make more of a difference in terms of helping women find recovery.\n\nDr. Jerry Brown, one of the country\u2019s leading advocates for gender-separated treatment and the clinical director at Sure Haven, the female treatment center under the Solid Landings umbrella, agrees with me. \u201cWhat\u2019s emerged is that treating women for addiction is often about treating trauma,\u201d he says. While trauma isn\u2019t, of course, limited to women, the fact that addicts tend to start using much earlier now than they used to\u2014Brown estimates the average age to be 13 or 14\u2014girls are, he says, \u201cmore likely now to get themselves in situations where they\u2019re abused if they are impaired by alcohol and other drugs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research suggests lack of childcare can prevent them from pursuing treatment -- and that's not their only obstacle", "title": "Is rehab harder for women?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research suggests lack of childcare can prevent them from pursuing treatment -- and that's not their only obstacle", "title": "Is rehab harder for women?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/01/recovery_is_harder_for_women_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_161642711.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research suggests lack of childcare can prevent them from pursuing treatment -- and that's not their only obstacle", "title": "Is rehab harder for women?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/shutterstock_161642711.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna David", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, addiction, AfterParty Treatment, Cocaine, Drugs, Editor's Picks, National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Recovery", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd132c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat\u2019s emerged is that treating women for addiction is often about treating trauma,\u201d he says.\nStrangely, despite the fact that it\u2019s been established for quite some time that there are differences when it comes to treating men and women for addiction and that women from all-female recovery treatment groups relapse less often than women in mixed groups, rehabs have been slow to implement gender-specific treatment.\nTopics: addiction, AfterParty Treatment, Cocaine, Drugs, Editor's Picks, National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Recovery, Life NewsWhen I went to rehab in 2000, I was dying.\nAnd as far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s nothing that could make more of a difference in terms of helping women find recovery.\nThis was nothing new; I\u2019d been like that, in part, since my first kindergarten crush."}
