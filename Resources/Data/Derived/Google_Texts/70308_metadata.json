It is too steep to land, so the 40 crewmembers are winched down singly or in pairs with packs bulging with clear plastic bags, red and yellow evidence tags, and the ropes they will use to keep each other from slipping when the black Alpine stone crumbles beneath their feet. Each investigator is linked to a local mountaineer, familiar with the terrain and with the skills to keep them safe.\n\nFew pieces are larger than a car door. Most are smaller. And with each step the recovery workers make, crucial pieces of evidence slide inexorably downward. Some slip into a mountain brook fed by the snow that has only just begun melting in the French Alps.\n\n\u201cWe have not found a single body intact,\u201d Col. Patrick Touron, one of France\u2019s leading forensic investigators, said Friday from Seyne-les-Alpes. \u201cDNA will be the determining element that will lead to identification.\u201d\n\nBetween 400 and 600 biological elements have been retrieved and five scientists are in Seyne-les-Alpes to speed the process, he said. The families who arrived during the week provided objects such as toothbrushes, which belonged to the deceased, and some gave their own DNA samples to help cross-reference the forensic information found in the remains.\n\nThe moment a piece of human remains is found, forensic scientists have been taking a DNA sample immediately, from fears it could further decompose, and update the vast \u2014 150-person-strong \u2014 DNA database pool they are compiling on-site, Touron said. Jewelry and dental information are also key to the identification process, he said.\n\nTouron noted the bodies would be returned to the families as soon as possible, but warned the process would be long.\n\nJust few kilometers (miles) away, ski stations are still full. The ground is bare where the A320 shattered, but \u201cthe pieces of wreckage are so small and shiny they appear like patches of snow on the mountainside,\u201d said Pierre-Henry Brandet, the Interior Ministry spokesman, after first flying over the debris field.\n\nTraveling by foot on the hiking paths that wind through the Alps, it\u2019s possible to reach the site in about an hour. Police all-terrain vehicles have barred the way since the Tuesday crash, guarding against the curious and macabre.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Painstaking recovery mission at treacherous Alps crash site", "author": "Lori Hinnant and Greg Keller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Painstaking recovery mission at treacherous Alps crash site", "title": "Painstaking recovery mission at treacherous Alps crash site", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/painstaking_recovery_mission_at_treacherous_alps_crash_site/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/france-plane-crash-recovery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Painstaking recovery mission at treacherous Alps crash site", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/france-plane-crash-recovery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Painstaking recovery mission at treacherous Alps crash site", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Painstaking recovery mission at treacherous Alps crash site", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd97a\"", "article_summary": "Traveling by foot on the hiking paths that wind through the Alps, it\u2019s possible to reach the site in about an hour.\nAnd with each step the recovery workers make, crucial pieces of evidence slide inexorably downward.\nSome slip into a mountain brook fed by the snow that has only just begun melting in the French Alps.\nPolice all-terrain vehicles have barred the way since the Tuesday crash, guarding against the curious and macabre.\nFrom 8:30 a.m. until 6 p.m., while the light is good, the helicopters ferry the crews into the ravine."}
