MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Milwaukee Bucks guard O.J. Mayo has been ejected in the first quarter against Minnesota and had to be forcibly removed from the court by assistant coaches.

Mayo picked up two quick technical fouls Saturday night after arguing about a non-call on a drive to the basket. After his second technical, Mayo tried to rush back onto the court after referee Eli Roe. Assistant coach Eric Hughes yanked Mayo back by the jersey. Teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo and a Bucks security official had to step in as well to try to contain the livid Mayo.

Mayo was escorted all the way off the court after trying to go back at the official.

Earlier this season, the volatile Mayo had a run-in with Kings center DeMarcus Cousins in the hallway after a game.
