He is coalescing his own American far-right political party with roots in white supremacy and neo-Nazi movements. He is copying the modus operandi of the resurgent far-right movements that are sweeping across Europe. He is becoming America\u2019s own Le Pen\u2014Marine or Jean-Marie, take your pick.\n\nFollowing the horrible terrorist attacks that befell Paris roughly two weeks ago, Marine Le Pen said \u201cFrance and the French are no longer safe,\u201d and added that \u201cno matter what the European Union says about this, it is essential that France regains control of its border, for good. Without borders, there is no protection or security possible.\u201d\n\nThis response is very much reminiscent of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. It touches upon one\u2019s physical safety being in jeopardy, but also an entire culture\u2019s way of life being under attack with nowhere to hide. Following the Paris attacks, Trump also perpetuated anti-Muslim and anti-African American propaganda by claiming that he witnessed Muslims celebrating the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and by tweeting an erroneous graphic that claimed that black Americas caused over 80 percent of white deaths by homicide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Daily Beast finds an international comparison for Donald Trump: Marine Le Pen.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Daily Beast finds an international comparison for Donald Trump: Marine Le Pen.", "title": "Daily Beast: Trump is Our LePen; Could Form Third Party - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Trump-Tilt-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/27/daily-beast-trump-is-our-lepen-could-form-third-party/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Daily Beast finds an international comparison for Donald Trump: Marine Le Pen.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Trump-Tilt-AP.jpg", "title": "Daily Beast: Trump is Our LePen; Could Form Third Party - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-11-27T05:11:15-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Daily Beast finds an international comparison for Donald Trump: Marine Le Pen.\nHe is coalescing his own American far-right political party with roots in white supremacy and neo-Nazi movements.\nWithout borders, there is no protection or security possible.\u201dThis response is very much reminiscent of Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\nHe is copying the modus operandi of the resurgent far-right movements that are sweeping across Europe.\nIt touches upon one\u2019s physical safety being in jeopardy, but also an entire culture\u2019s way of life being under attack with nowhere to hide."}
