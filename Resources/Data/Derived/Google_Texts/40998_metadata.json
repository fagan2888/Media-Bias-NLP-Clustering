CWA members have had access to good health-care benefits, but we pay for them. During these negotiations, Verizon is demanding that we pay significantly more.\n\nFor retiree benefits, CWA has offered an alternative plan that would allow retirees to switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan under the Affordable Care Act. This offer could save Verizon about $200 million during a three-year contract, but Verizon has rejected it.\n\nCWA members have made sacrifices and would like Verizon to bargain fairly. Verizon customers and the public deserve the full story about what is going on.\n\n|Dave Miller, CWA member, Local 13000/Unit 22, Warminster, daveoz3@verizon.net\n\nPublished: The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"contenttype": "Article", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "pubdate": 20160527, "title": "Letters: Verizon should provide details of union talks", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "ISSUE | VERIZON STRIKE\nProvide the details\nDuring the contract negotiations between striking members of the Communications Workers of America and Verizon, the company has made claims in television commercials and newspaper ads that do not tell the entire story; many issues are not addressed (\"Verizon, union leaders meet with Labor secretary,\" Tuesday).", "title": "Letters: Verizon should provide details of union talks", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20160523_Letters__Verizon_should_provide_details_of_union_talks.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20160523_inq_1lede23-a.JPG", "type": "article"}, "contentid": 380435051, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20160523_Letters__Verizon_should_provide_details_of_union_talks.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20160523_inq_1lede23-a.JPG", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Letters: Verizon should provide details of union talks"}, "cg": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-23T00:01:00-04:00", "editdate": "20160522T22:33:08", "searchdate": "2016-05-23", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "livedate": "20160523T24:01:00", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer", "description": "ISSUE | VERIZON STRIKE\nProvide the details\nDuring the contract negotiations between striking members of the Communications Workers of America and Verizon, the company has made claims in television commercials and newspaper ads that do not tell the entire story; many issues are not addressed (\"Verizon, union leaders meet with Labor secretary,\" Tuesday)."}, "article_summary": "Unionized Verizon workers have been on strike since April 13.\nThis offer could save Verizon about $200 million during a three-year contract, but Verizon has rejected it.\nDuring these negotiations, Verizon is demanding that we pay significantly more.\nCWA members have made sacrifices and would like Verizon to bargain fairly.\nCWA members have had access to good health-care benefits, but we pay for them."}
