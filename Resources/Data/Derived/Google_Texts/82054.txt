Charlotte, North Carolina can no longer call itself the hometown of Homeland.

Showtime and Fox 21 announced Friday that filming for season four of the popular TV drama series will begin in June, but the production moves to Cape Town, South Africa.

Reports from various film and entertainment websites indicate that season four will find Claire Danes’ Carrie Mathison returning to the Middle East, assigned to a volatile CIA station on the front line in the war on terror.

In previous seasons, the Queen City has doubled as Washington, D.C., on the show.

“We’ve been so lucky to work with one of the best crews in the business for the last three seasons in Charlotte,” executive producer Alex Gansa said in a statement, according to E! online.

“We knew going into season four that we would need to move the production overseas to tell the story of Carrie returning to the Middle East as chief of station. We are thrilled to have found a new home in Cape Town and look forward to getting season four production off the ground.”

Filming is expected to last through November as the show is set to return in the fall.

Mandy Patinkin returns as Carrie’s mentor Saul Berenson for the new episodes after he and Carrie saved the day in the third season. Rupert Friend and Nazanin Boniadi will also return for the fourth season.
