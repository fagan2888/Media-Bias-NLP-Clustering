Gwen Graham arrived on Capitol Hill a year ago, the darling of a Democratic Party that had suffered stinging losses in mid-term elections around the nation.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been the easiest year.\n\nGraham's legislative accomplishments have been modest, not surprising for a freshman member of the minority party.\n\nWorking with Republicans, she added a civics component to a broad education reauthorization bill, renewed a trust fund used to protect coastal environments, restore fisheries, and improve boating safety, and authorized research and development on an anti-tunneling defense system to protect Israel from terrorist attacks.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, the Tallahassee lawyer representing the 2nd District has angered some of her progressive supporters by siding with Republicans on several issues, including support for the Keystone XL pipeline and for increasing the weekly hours employees must work to qualify for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and opposition to President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nGraham's political future is clouded by last year's ruling by the Florida Supreme Court that Florida's congressional boundaries had to be redrawn. The court said the existing map approved by the state legislature violated a voter-approved ban on political gerrymandering. Though the ruling was not related directly to her district, her lines have been redrawn in the process.\n\nA final court decision is expected soon on an injunction to keep the current boundaries intact.\n\nIf the new map splitting Leon County is upheld, Graham faces a difficult choice between running in the newly configured \u2013 and heavily Republican \u2013 2nd District, and running in the newly configured 5th District -- stretching to Jacksonville -- against Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown.\n\nBrown, who is challenging the new map in court, is considering a run in either the new 5th District or the new 10th District if her challenge fails.\n\nGraham, the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who also served in the U.S. Senate, remains characteristically upbeat despite the uncertainty. She eagerly talks about her office's constituent work (more than 1,100 cases opened) and the friendships she's struck with other lawmakers, particularly Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that the House of Representatives is such a natural fit for me and that surprised me,\u201d she said about her first year. \u201cI thought it would be a good fit but I didn\u2019t realize how positive it was going to be.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview in her Longworth House Office Building suite Wednesday, Graham also spoke about congressional perks (she wants to curtail them), her tangles with liberals back home (she says she\u2019s kept her word to vote based on the merits of individual issues), her hopes for this year (solving the water flow for the beleaguered Apalachicola Bay is a priority), and her political future (she's undecided on details but is sure she won\u2019t challenge Brown in a primary).\n\nGraham recently discussed the past year and her hopes for 2016 in an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat:\n\nQuestion: What have you learned in your first year?\n\nAnswer: You\u2019d be surprised at the friendships (in the House), the wide breadth of ideological spectrum. I can walk up to (a member) and give a hug and say, 'I have this piece of legislation, let\u2019s talk about it.' And we can agree to disagree but you don\u2019t have to demonize one another.\n\nQ: Were you surprised at how partisan Congress can be?\n\nA. I\u2019ve been disappointed with both sides of the aisle. Watching (some) members walk on to the floor, they don\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re voting on. You have people, Democrats and Republicans, handed a \"whip\" sheet telling you how to vote. I\u2019m proud to say no one ever gives me one of those sheets.\n\nQ: Has it been difficult to get things done?\n\nA: In terms of legislation, it is a challenging process for any piece of legislation to go through the normal procedure. To be dropped in the hopper, to be voted on in the House, to make it over in the Senate to be voted on. What we\u2019ve tried to do is find other ways to get our priorities through.\n\nQ: What are your priorities for this year?\n\nA: We will continue to work on Apalachicola Bay. My goal for 2016 is to work in a bipartisan fashion... to try to find a solution to this ongoing water issue.\n\nQ: You\u2019ve taken aim at congressional perks involving air travel and car leases. Why?\n\nA: I am very frugal. I believe in using money wisely and I don\u2019t think the expense involved in flying first class is justified. One of the (other) things I\u2019m appalled about is that members can rent cars for their own personal use back in the district. And they\u2019re not renting small Fords. They\u2019re renting luxury vehicles that are $800 a month or something. I drive my own car. I pay for my own gas.\n\nQ: You disappointed progressives in your first year. Do you think you\u2019ll be disappointing them again this year?\n\nA: During the campaign, I was very consistent that I was not going to be a vote for either party, that I was going to do what I\u2019ve done which is listen to competing viewpoints on issues, look at the facts, think through the issues and make an informed decision. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\n\nQ: How much do you consult with your father about your job?\n\nA: I\u2019m very blessed because I have someone in my life that I respect so greatly that I can talk to about issues. I would not be doing my job if I didn\u2019t talk to my father. I talk to him about everything and it\u2019s part of my commitment to do my job to the best of my abilities.\n\nQ: Does he ever disagree ever with your conclusions?\n\nA: Yes. He disagreed with me on (opposing) the Iran agreement.\n\nQ: If the courts uphold the new congressional lines, will you seek re-election?\n\nA: A lot will depend on if Corrine runs because I would not primary Corrine. If she made the decision to run in District 10 then I would have to consider District 5.\n\nQ: Does that mean you wouldn\u2019t run in the newly drawn 2nd District?\n\nA: I\u2019m not naive. I recognize how tough District 2 would be. It will (be) a very, very tough decision. If I am running for office, it is my commitment to serve in that office to the best of my ability.\n\nQ: Some would like to see you run for governor or U.S. Senate. Would you?\n\nA: My dad has a saying and I believe it 100 percent: \u2018You gain the right to consider future options by the job you do today,\u2019 and I\u2019m focused on doing the best job I can as the congressional representative of Florida\u2019s 2nd District.\n\nContact Ledyard King at lking@gannett.com; Twitter: @ledgeking\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1UZcu5B", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "When she began serving a year ago, Rep.
