My grandmother tried to fatten me up with snacks of Velveeta cheese and butter.\n\nBut the more I was wheedled, cajoled and even bribed to try the many wholesome foods I rejected outright, the less likely I was to succumb. Now, after reading an insightful book, \u201cIt\u2019s Not About the Broccoli\u201d by Dina Rose, I better understand that one source of my resistance was control.\n\nI was as determined to be in charge of what went into my mouth as my parents thought they should be. Even today, in many households with young children, you\u2019re likely to hear commands, bribes and pleas like \u201cjust taste it,\u201d \u201cfinish your vegetables if you want dessert,\u201d \u201cclean your plate \u2014 the children in (name a country) are starving.\u201d (My response to that one was: \u201cSo send it to them. I don\u2019t want it!\u201d) Perhaps most damaging was the subliminal message my parents conveyed \u2014 a link between food and love that led to a 40-pound weight gain in my 20s when a big romance fizzled.\n\nEven now, you might think many U.S. children are in danger of becoming seriously undernourished. Millions of parents never leave home without a bag of snacks \u2014 candy, crackers or carrots, it really matters not. Children today are continually nibbling, whether in a stroller, car, train or plane. And food is a popular pacifier. Little wonder that many youngsters refuse to eat what\u2019s served for dinner.\n\nIn counseling parents, Rose has found that those with a \u201cnutrition mindset\u201d pay undue attention to the nutrients in each meal rather than to their children\u2019s overall eating pattern.\n\n\u201cThe more parents focus on nutrition, the worse their kids tend to eat,\u201d she said. Sweetened yogurt, which can contain as much sugar per ounce as soda, and mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese, full of fat and salt, are featured because they contain calcium; chicken nuggets get a pass for their protein content, and french fries \u2014 well, they are vegetables.\n\nThe other side of the coin can be just as damaging. Given modern concerns about sugar and fat, some health-conscious parents forbid their children to indulge in treats, even at birthday parties. I know a neighborhood boy from such a restrictive household who used to keep a stash of the candy and cookies his parents forbade in a friend\u2019s bedroom.\n\nAs Rose put it, \u201cWhen systems don\u2019t work, it\u2019s usually because the parents are either overly controlling or overly permissive.\u201d\n\nHer book has a telling subtitle: \u201cThree Habits to Teach Your Kids for a Lifetime of Healthy Eating.\u201d\n\nThough Rose calls her three critical habits \u201cproportion, variety and moderation,\u201d they are really about understanding and adapting to children\u2019s natural aversion to strangeness and how tastes develop for foods initially disliked.\n\nWhen asked to taste an unfamiliar food, she suggests giving children only a small taste \u2014 without expecting them to eat a full serving, even if they like it \u2014 and then asking them about its characteristics: what it feels like, tastes like or reminds them of. Tastings may have to be repeated many times to foster acceptance, even for adults.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make kids eat, but you can influence their decision-making,\u201d Rose said. She advocates a gradual introduction to variety in both the kinds of foods children are served and the way in which they are prepared. She suggests starting with a \u201crotation\u201d of foods a child already likes, as long as the same food in the same form is not eaten two days in a row.\n\nPortion size matters a lot, especially when introducing a new food, Rose said. Children are often intimidated by too much food on a plate, even if it is a food they like.\n\nDo your children clamor for desserts of questionable nutritional value? I recently hosted two families whose young children adored the frozen Greek yogurt desserts sold on the corner.\n\nI served a fat-free dessert with no dairy or added sweetener: frozen bananas, strawberries, mangoes and pineapple pur\u00e9ed through a $40 gadget called Yonanas.\n\nThe kids asked for more ... and more ... and more. One mother bought the device the next day", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003440624-FL_SAR_HFBRODY25.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc05\"", "article_summary": "She advocates a gradual introduction to variety in both the kinds of foods children are served and the way in which they are prepared.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make kids eat, but you can influence their decision-making,\u201d Rose said.\nPortion size matters a lot, especially when introducing a new food, Rose said.\nIn counseling parents, Rose has found that those with a \u201cnutrition mindset\u201d pay undue attention to the nutrients in each meal rather than to their children\u2019s overall eating pattern.\n\u201cThe more parents focus on nutrition, the worse their kids tend to eat,\u201d she said."}
