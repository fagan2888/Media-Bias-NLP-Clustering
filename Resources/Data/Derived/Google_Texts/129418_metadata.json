George Pataki said Monday that he is \u201cseriously\u201d considering getting into the crowded Republican race for president in 2016, and for good measure took a swipe at Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nMr. Pataki, a three-time governor, said he has the executive experience that would be a welcome change in the White House.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to have a president who has run something before taking the most important executive position in America,\u201d he said on Boston Herald Radio\u2019s \u201cMorning Meeting Show,\u201d jabbing President Obama, who became president after a brief stint in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMr. Pataki, 69, also took aim at Mrs. Warren, the liberal Massachusetts Democrat who is being urged by her party\u2019s left wing to run as an alternative to undisputed Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\u201cHer philosophy is way to the left of me and way to the left of the American people. And it\u2019s not what we need more of,\u201d Mr. Pataki said of Mrs. Warren.\n\n\u201cI also don\u2019t think that someone who has never had a day\u2019s experience running something can be expected to run the government of this country particularly well,\u201d he added.\n\nMrs. Warren has said that she isn\u2019t in the race but never forcefully shut the door on a run.\n\nMr. Pataki said he plans to travel Tuesday to New Hampshire, home of country\u2019s first presidential primary, as he tests the water for a political comeback.\n\nHe has plenty of company from Republicans eyeing the White House, including Wisconsin Gov. Scot Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former New York Gov.
