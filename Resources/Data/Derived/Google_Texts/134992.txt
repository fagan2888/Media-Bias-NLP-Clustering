The First Christian Church in Richlands held its 5th annual chili cook off, car show, and gospel festival Saturday.

It's their biggest fundraiser of the year with all proceeds going toward church functions.

Seven teams entered the chili cook off while more than 50 cars were a part of the car show. Seven gospel bands also took to the stage.

WITNs Rachael Cardin and Stacia Stong judged the chili cook off on taste, consistency, smell, color, and bite.
