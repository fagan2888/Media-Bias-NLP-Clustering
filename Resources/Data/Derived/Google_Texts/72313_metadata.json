She was brought down the mountain on a rescue sled and underwent tests in a hospital.\n\n\u201cGot caught in the soft snow today and crashed pretty hard,\u201d Vonn wrote on Facebook. \u201cX-rays showed I have a hairline fracture in my left knee and will get an MRI Monday. I will wait and see how I feel tomorrow to decide if I can race.\u201d\n\nVonn appeared on the start list for the super-G portion of Sunday\u2019s combined event, released by the International Ski Federation on Saturday evening. The event will be concluded by a slalom run.\n\nRacing in difficult weather conditions, Vonn had led winner Federica Brignone of Italy by 0.32 seconds when she came off the race line and hit a spot of soft snow just before the next gate. She lost balance and slid off course on her left hip.\n\nThe race was interrupted for about 10 minutes as Vonn, fully conscious throughout, lay on the snow surrounded by medical staff and coaches.\n\nThe incident reminded some of Vonn\u2019s crash at the super-G of the 2013 world championships, when she badly damaged her right knee after landing a jump in soft snow. That race had also been delayed by hours because of bad weather and took place in tough conditions.\n\nVonn has won nine races this season after overcoming a hampered preparation. She missed the season-opening in October after a 10-week layoff because of a broken ankle bone, a year after coming back from the injuries that kept her away from the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nChasing her fifth title, Vonn was leading the overall World Cup standings going into the race, 23 points ahead of Lara Gut.\n\nThe Swiss skier had to wait in the start gate following the incident. Gut never matched the pace of the early starters and came 1.15 behind in 16th, closing the gap with Vonn to eight points.\n\nThe American also retained her lead over Gut in the super-G discipline standings, 420-356 points.\n\nEarlier, strong winds and snowfall forced organizers to lower the start and delay the race by three hours, allowing course workers to move fresh snow off the course.\n\nWeather improved during the delay but heavy clouds moved back in again after the race began.\n\nSnowfall slowed later starters as many racers shook their heads or shrugged shoulders after finishing.\n\nFrom the elite group of the seven best-ranked super-G skiers, which start 16th to 22nd, only Viktoria Rebensburg made it into the top 10. The German came 0.82 behind in seventh.\n\nCornelia Huetter, who started 19th, was 1.70 off the pace.\n\n\u201cMore than this wasn\u2019t possible\u201d due to the snow, the Austrian said. \u201cIt would have been fairer if they\u2019d slipped out the snow again after that 10-minute break.\u201d\n\nBrignone, who wore bib No. 8, timed 57.33 seconds on the shortened Aliga course to beat Vonn\u2019s American teammate Laurenne Ross by 0.13 and Tamara Tippler of Austria by 0.37.\n\nIt was the Italian\u2019s second career victory. A giant slalom specialist, Brignone earned her maiden win in the season-opening race in October in Soelden, Austria, and Saturday\u2019s win was her first podium in a different discipline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the top 10 many times. It\u2019s like crazy, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said.\n\nAcknowledging that the conditions worsened for later starters, Brignone said: \u201cThis is skiing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe today it was me, maybe tomorrow it is somebody else who is lucky. I took advantage of my luck. The slope was really good.\u201d\n\nRoss tied her best career finish, three years after coming runner-up to Tina Maze of Slovenia in a downhill in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been coming and my skiing has been improving,\u201d Ross said. \u201cI got on the lucky side of things today and I took advantage of it.\u201d\n\nAlso for Tippler, it was a second career podium as she finished behind winner Vonn in a super-G in Lake Louise, Alberta, in December.\n\nIn her second race back from her two-month injury layoff, Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States trailed Brignone by 2.31 in 29th.\n\nThe super-G was the first ever speed event in Andorra, which hosted slalom and GS races before.\n\nA combined event, including a super-G and a slalom run, is scheduled for Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn injures left knee in crash at World Cup race", "title": "Lindsey Vonn injures left knee in crash at World Cup race", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/lindsey-vonn-injures-left-knee-in-crash-at-world-cup-race/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__2b92f10783cea80a910f6a7067006284p1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__2b92f10783cea80a910f6a7067006284p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T13:44:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:12:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chasing her fifth title, Vonn was leading the overall World Cup standings going into the race, 23 points ahead of Lara Gut.\nSOLDEU-EL TARTER, Andorra\u2014 Lindsey Vonn suffered a minor fracture in her left knee during a World Cup super-G crash in heavy snowfall Saturday but didn\u2019t rule out her start in a combined event the next day.\nThe race was interrupted for about 10 minutes as Vonn, fully conscious throughout, lay on the snow surrounded by medical staff and coaches.\n\u201cX-rays showed I have a hairline fracture in my left knee and will get an MRI Monday.\nIn her second race back from her two-month injury layoff, Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States trailed Brignone by 2.31 in 29th."}
