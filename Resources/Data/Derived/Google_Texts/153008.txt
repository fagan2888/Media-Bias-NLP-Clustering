The National Right to Life Committee today endorsed pro-life Governor Mike Rounds in his campaign for United States Senate.

“As governor, Mike Rounds was an outspoken leader in the fight to protect innocent human life in South Dakota,” said Carol Tobias, National Right to Life president. “Mike Rounds is needed in the U.S. Senate to help protect the most defenseless among us – unborn children and those who are medically dependent or disabled.”

In 2006, Rounds signed legislation that would ban virtually all abortions in the state.

“In the history of the world, the true test of a civilization is how well people treat the most vulnerable and most helpless in their society,” Rounds said.

“The sponsors and supporters of this bill believe that abortion is wrong because unborn children are the most vulnerable and most helpless persons in our society. I agree with them,” he added.
