The agreement, negotiated by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.), sets spending levels for the next two years, and passed the Senate last night after having cleared the House last week.\n\nIn an odd twist, House Republicans were more amenable to the deal than Senate Republicans \u2013 while most GOP House members backed the budget deal in a vote last week, all but nine GOP senators opposed the agreement last night.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of angles to this, including the realization that we almost certainly won\u2019t see another government shutdown for a while, but perhaps the most important question is, if lawmakers can strike a bipartisan budget deal, isn\u2019t the door now open to progress elsewhere?\n\nAfter all, for three years, many have worked under the assumption that far-right activists exercise a de facto veto power over Washington policymaking \u2013 if the Republicans\u2019 activist base disapproves of an idea, it dies, regardless of merit. But this month, GOP leaders effectively blew off the \u201cprofessional right\u201d \u2013 indeed, House Speaker John Boehner rebuked conservatives in unusually forceful terms \u2013 offering new hope that governing might still be possible.\n\nI\u2019m afraid, however, that skepticism is still warranted. As Ezra Klein explained late yesterday, the budget deal shows \u201cthere are ways in which the two parties can work together. But only when they don\u2019t have to compromise.\u201d\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said so himself at the news conference announcing the agreement. \u201cFrom the outset, we knew that if we forced each other to compromise a core principle we would get nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we decided to focus on where the common ground is.\u201d That meant no taxes. It meant no changes to Medicare, Social Security, or Medicaid. It meant letting unemployment insurance expire. It meant doing nothing about crumbling infrastructure or Obamacare. It meant leaving most of sequestration in place.\n\nIt may seem heartening when anything passes Congress with bipartisan support, but the budget deal is fairly narrow \u2013 which is ultimately why it succeeded with minimal fuss. It just didn\u2019t ask too much of either side.\n\nBut if Boehner was willing to thumb his nose at Heritage Action, the Koch brothers, FreedomWorks, et al, on the budget, and he lived to tell the tale, maybe he\u2019ll do it again? After all, there\u2019s some popular and worthwhile legislation awaiting House action \u2013 immigration reform, ENDA, etc. \u2013 and all the Speaker has to do is schedule some floor votes and let the House work its will.\n\nEven now, however, the odds are against it. The Ryan/Murray agreement worked largely because Republicans didn\u2019t have to concede much. Heck, in their private moments, many GOP lawmakers concede they don\u2019t much like the sequestration policy anyway, and they can continue to go after the Affordable Care Act in other venues.\n\nEvery other major piece of pending legislation, however, requires Republicans to accept policy provisions they actively dislike \u2013 and this is a group that believes \u201ccompromise\u201d means \u201cgetting my way.\u201d\n\nOn the budget, Boehner & Co. didn\u2019t want another shutdown, so they embraced a modest agreement. On everything else, GOP lawmakers see failure as an option.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A budget deal has now passed the House and Senate.
