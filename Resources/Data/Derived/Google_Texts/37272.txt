â€” A jury on Monday found a Fayetteville man guilty of shooting a motorcyclist to death two years ago.

Francisco Echeverria, 26, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder of Craig Spencer Morris.

Morris, 50, of Fayetteville, was found wounded near his mangled motorcycle on Bragg Boulevard near Skibo Road on Feb. 19, 2013.

Investigators said Morris and Echeverria were involved in a verbal altercation in the parking lot of Carolina Square, a plaza on Bragg Boulevard with several adult entertainment clubs, a short time before the shooting.
