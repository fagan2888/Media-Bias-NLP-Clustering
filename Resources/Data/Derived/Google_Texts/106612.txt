It’s been a difficult year for Broncos defensive linemen. Malik Jackson’s father, Jodie Jackson, died at 47 earlier this month. His funeral was Sept. 4 in New Jersey, and Malik Jackson returned to the Broncos in time to play defensive line in their season opener on Sept. 7.

On Friday, Marvin Austin Sr., the 49 year-old father of defensive tackle Marvin Austin, died from massive brain injuries he received from a vehicular accident.

“It’s crazy how life happens like that,” Austin told The Denver Post on Thursday, when his father was on life support.

Austin will fly with the Broncos on Saturday to Seattle and play in the game Sunday. He had planned on returning to North Carolina during the bye week next week to be with his father.
