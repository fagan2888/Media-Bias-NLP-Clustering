Ron Paul\u2019s (R-Texas) 2008 presidential campaign and seeks to preserve and promote liberty, waited approximately 28 months to receive tax-deductible status from the IRS. And because the group used words like \u201cConstitution\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d in their application, YAL President Jeff Frazee believes they were targeting by the agency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have seen the news about Obama\u2019s IRS scandal. Well, we were part of it,\u201d Frazee said in a press release.\n\nYAL\u2019s initial application to be recognized as a 501(c)3 was processed by the IRS more than a year ago, Frazee told Red Alert Politics in an email. The group waited for an extensive period of time without receiving any word from the tax agency, and, after contacting their assigned IRS agent, was told their application was pending.\n\nFrazee sought legal assistance to get more answers about their long-pending application, and decided to approach the Tax Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS. With the help of the organization, YAL received a determination letter in the mail announcing their application had been approved.\n\nWhile the process continued, Frazee was told to remain mum. YAL\u2019s attorneys, though, believe the group was targeted by the IRS.\n\n\u201cThis process has only increased my belief that we should abolish the IRS,\u201d Frazee said.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, received a list of conservative groups targeted by the agency, and Frazee believes YAL was on it.\n\nSince a Department of the Treasury inspector general\u2019s report found the IRS had specifically targeted conservative groups, Issa has worked to expose further information about the agency\u2019s malpractice. However, the House Oversight head has been met with resistance from the IRS and committee Democrats.\n\nIn a hearing earlier this month, former head of the IRS\u2019 tax-exempt organizations division Lois Lerner refused to testify for a second time, invoking her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nIssa adjourned the hearing abruptly, prompting a spat with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).\n\nSince Congress began investigating the IRS\u2019 targeting scandal last May, several groups have received tax-exempt status after years of waiting.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "After a long two-year wait, Young Americans for Liberty was granted tax-deductible status from the Internal Revenue Service after joining a legion of conservative organizations targeted by the agency.", "title": "Young Americans for Liberty receives tax-exempt status after...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 587, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/12/345_31306420196_6962_n-587x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/22/young-americans-for-liberty-receives-tax-exempt-status-after-two-year-delay/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "young-americans-for-liberty", "published_time": "2014-03-22T14:50:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-22T15:35:01+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "With the help of the organization, YAL received a determination letter in the mail announcing their application had been approved.\n\u201cThis process has only increased my belief that we should abolish the IRS,\u201d Frazee said.\nSince Congress began investigating the IRS\u2019 targeting scandal last May, several groups have received tax-exempt status after years of waiting.\nAnd because the group used words like \u201cConstitution\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d in their application, YAL President Jeff Frazee believes they were targeting by the agency.\nAfter a long two-year wait, Young Americans for Liberty was granted tax-deductible status from the Internal Revenue Service after joining a legion of conservative organizations targeted by the agency."}
