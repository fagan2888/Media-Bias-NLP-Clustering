The price of their betrayals is to be chewed in the mouth of Satan for eternity, constantly being ripped apart without dying.\n\nThe consequences for turning on your friends are not quite as dire in modern republics. After all, Winston Churchill changed parties twice throughout his career, later quipping that, \u201canyone can rat, but it takes a certain ingenuity to re-rat.\u201d Churchill\u2019s humor, which softens the hard edges of party betrayal, is characteristically democratic.\n\nDaniel Oppenheimer considers six American stories of changing sides in Exit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century. Oppenheimer reports on figures from the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, starting with Whittaker Chambers\u2019 espionage activities in the Soviet \u201cunderground\u201d in the 1930s and ending with Christopher Hitchens\u2019 support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In between, Oppenheimer introduces his readers to James Burnham, originally a Trotskyite; Ronald Reagan, at one time a union man; Norman Podhoretz, who began his intellectual career on the left; and David Horowitz, at one point an advocate for the Black Panthers.\n\nOppenheimer is an excellent storyteller. The pace and style of his book is leisurely yet precise. He weaves together descriptions of his subjects\u2019 lives with their writings, and has a poet\u2019s eye for how mundane experience can be transformative, as when he imagines Ronald Reagan, sitting on a train with General Electric CEO Lemuk Boulware, conducting casual conversation about the \u201cvirtue and decency of free enterprise.\u201d In Oppenheimer\u2019s hands, such a scene convinces as an important moment in Reagan\u2019s developing politics. He works similar literary wonders in sections devoted to Podhoretz and Horowitz.\n\nOppenheimer has also paid careful attention to his work as a whole. His profiles span the twentieth century and he makes sure to gesture at overlapping concerns among the actors. For instance, Norman Podhoretz had written a long essay on race relations in the late 1960s. Oppenheimer follows his profile of Podhoretz with that of David Horowitz, whose activities with and eventually against the Black Panthers illustrate Podhoretz\u2019s thesis. Likewise, an important moment in Reagan\u2019s development was reading Whittaker Chambers\u2019 Witness, a book that Oppenheimer\u2019s readers will already be familiar with.\n\nWhile Oppenheimer\u2019s book is well crafted, it fails to deliver on the author\u2019s promise that this book is \u201cabout how we come to believe at all.\u201d The stories that Oppenheimer profiles \u201care worth telling because it\u2019s during the period of political transition, when the bones of one\u2019s belief system are broken and poking out through the skin, that the contingency and complexity of belief become most visible.\u201d This may be true for Whittaker Chambers, who latched on to the messianic hopes of Marxism in his young days only to discover that the Bolshevik promise fell short, but it\u2019s certainly less true of Christopher Hitchens, who claimed (plausibly) that his support for the Iraq War was consistent with his long-held and most important principles. Though his attitude to American power certainly shifted, Hitchen\u2019s views on fascist tyrants like Saddam Hussein never did. Neither did his view of monotheistic religion, which he accused, literally until his dying day, of promoting a celestial tyrant. Oppenheimer never addresses how Chambers\u2019 and Hitchens\u2019 experience of the contingency of belief could be the same or similar.\n\nBeyond the differences in experience (not to say beliefs!) between his subjects, Oppenheimer also never addresses deeper theoretical tangles that his book points toward. The good news is that his unwillingness to play the philosopher does not compromise his virtues as a storyteller. Although Oppenheimer\u2019s readers are left to figure out the meaning of these political changes themselves, the author succeeds in presenting them with entertaining vignettes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daniel Oppenheimer considers six American stories of changing sides in Exit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "In his Inferno, Dante sets Brutus and Cassius\u2014the main conspirators in the plot to assassinate Julius Caesar\u2014alongside Judas Iscariot, traitor to Jesus, in the lowest realm of hell.
