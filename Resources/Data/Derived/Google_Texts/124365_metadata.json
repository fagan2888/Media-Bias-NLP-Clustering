Not just its attempt to provide coverage for every citizen, but it\u2019s focus on quality of care over quantity of care. These new metrics mean new opportunities for select healthcare companies.\n\nSecond, we\u2019re looking at another muddling year in the global economy. Most nations are still lowering rates and priming the pump of their economies. The U.S., after an optimistic rate hike, has now backed off because it wasn\u2019t helping the domestic economy or the global economy.\n\nThat means we\u2019re in a period of slow growth. And healthcare is great place to be in a slow growth economy because it\u2019s one sector people will continue to use, regardless of economic cycles. You can wait to buy a car, but you can\u2019t wait on a bypass operation, or a host of chronic medical conditions where long-term care is necessary.\n\nThese seven healthcare stocks are in great shape, making each stock an ideal way into these two massive trends.\n\nNext Page", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're entering a period of slow growth, not just domestically, but globally.
