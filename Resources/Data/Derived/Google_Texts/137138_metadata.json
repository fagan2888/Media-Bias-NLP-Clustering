They\u2019re terrorist turbines. Or maybe they\u2019re some sort of espionage-enabled windmills capable of sucking up our national secrets as they blow past. Or maybe they\u2019re weaponized turbines, their spinning blades poised to wreak havoc across the sparsely populated Columbia River Valley.\n\nRelated: The Greening of the Pentagon Takes a Big Step Forward\n\nThe truth is, we don\u2019t actually know why, or really even if, the turbines are dangerous. All we know is that the Obama administration says they are a national security threat and wants them gone. But it won\u2019t say why.\n\nThe administration\u2019s reticence apparently didn\u2019t sit well with the appeals court, and as a result, Tuesday\u2019s ruling promises to change the way one of the more secretive elements of the U.S. government does business.\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an executive branch body created by Congress in the 1970s to police potential national security threats from foreign investors in U.S. firms or foreign control of U.S. businesses. CFIUS (pronounced \u201cSiffyus\u201d by attorneys who deal with it on a regular basis) advised the president in 2012 that the four electricity-generating wind farms owned by Delaware-based Ralls Corp. constitute just such a national security threat.\n\nPresident Obama agreed, finding that \u201cthere is credible evidence that leads [the president] to believe that Ralls\u2026might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\u201d As a result, the administration determined that Ralls ought to be required to strip all its equipment from the four sites, down to and including the concrete pads, and sell off its remaining interests in the land.\n\nRelated: Now, Will Obama Approve the Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nThe company was informed of that decision, but only after the fact, and never got the chance to defend itself. It never even got to hear the charges it was supposed to be defending itself against.\n\nAccording to lawyers who represent companies reviewed by CFIUS this is standard practice, or at least it was before Tuesday.\n\nWhat apparently attracted attention to Ralls Corp. at CFIUS is that its two owners are Chinese nationals. Both men are connected to the Sany Group, a Chinese manufacturing concern that, among other things, builds wind turbines. The aim of Ralls Corp. is pretty straightforward: it wants to acquire windfarms in the U.S., install Sany\u2019s equipment on them, and use them as demonstration projects to drive sales of their products.\n\nIn March of 2012, Ralls purchased a handful of existing wind farms along Butter Creek, outside the small Oregon town of Hermiston. The four properties, Mule Hollow Windfarm, Pine City Windfarm, High Plateau Windfarm, and Lower Ridge Windfarm, were already permitted and had standing arrangements with the local power company to connect to and sell power back into the electrical grid. The region around Hermiston, in fact, is dotted with windfarms owned by both U.S. and foreign companies.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Energy Plan Is a Gift to Russia and China\n\nHowever, when CFIUS was alerted to Ralls\u2019 acquisition of the four sites in 2012, something about the acquisition raised a red flag, and after a short review process, the company was informed that it would need to completely divest itself of the property.\n\nUnlike many firms that have been investigated by CFIUS in recent years, though, Ralls decided to push back.\n\nThe legislation that created the CFIUS specifically says that the committee\u2019s determinations of what constitutes a threat to national security are not subject to judicial review. But in its appeal, Ralls Corp. took a slightly different tack. The company didn\u2019t challenge the finding, but the process. It claimed that the administration\u2019s refusal to share any details about why it views Ralls as a national security threat \u2014 thereby preventing the company from rebutting its arguments \u2014 was a violation of the company\u2019s constitutional right to due process.\n\nThe court agreed, remanding the case to the lower court and instructing it to direct the government to share non-classified information with the company so that it can at least make an effort to rebut or remedy the government\u2019s concerns.\n\nRelated: Solar Power Battles Heat Up as Demand Rises\n\nThe number of attorneys in the U.S. who represent companies facing CFIUS investigations is relatively small, and several contacted for this story were uncomfortable going on the record discussing the implications of the ruling. The general sense among them, though, was that while the committee\u2019s intentions are good, there are many cases where legitimate business deals are scuttled not because there is an actual security problem, but because there is a lack of communication between the participating companies and the executive branch.\n\nThe hope \u2014regardless of the fate of the Ralls Corp. challenge \u2014 is that companies that fall under the purview of CFIUS in the future have a little more information about the government\u2019s concerns.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on Tuesday", "title": "An Unprecedented Loss for the Obama Administration in Court", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/16/Unprecedented-Loss-Obama-Administration-Court", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162012_Windmills_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/16/Unprecedented-Loss-Obama-Administration-Court", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162012_Windmills_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Federal Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on Tuesday", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "All we know is that the Obama administration says they are a national security threat and wants them gone.\nBoth men are connected to the Sany Group, a Chinese manufacturing concern that, among other things, builds wind turbines.\nWhat apparently attracted attention to Ralls Corp. at CFIUS is that its two owners are Chinese nationals.\nThese aren\u2019t just any wind turbines.\nBut in its appeal, Ralls Corp. took a slightly different tack."}
