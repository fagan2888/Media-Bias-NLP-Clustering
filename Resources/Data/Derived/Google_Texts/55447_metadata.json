Susan Metzger, the assistant secretary of the Kansas Department of Agriculture, said her state, too, is concerned that the rule would raise water monitoring costs for regulators. She said states are best suited to regulate waters on their own.\n\n\u201cAllowing for states\u2019 administrative discretion without ubiquitous, counter-productive federal oversight ensures the critical waters of the state, as well as the nation, will be protected,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans have long criticized the proposed rule an unjust expansion of federal power, warning that it could give the federal government jurisdiction over everything from ditches to drainage ponds. Agriculture groups have opposed the effort as well, saying it would hurt their ability to manage their water and land.\n\nThe House passed a GOP-backed bill last week that would repeal the water rule.

The legislation would remove waterways that would be covered under the proposed rule from federal jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to have reasonable regulations to help preserve our waterways while still allowing them to be used as natural resources,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia defended the agency's rulemaking, nothing that officials held a series of public meetings on the rule in several states after the proposal came out.\n\n\"The input helped us understand the genuine concerns and interests of a wide range of stakeholders and think through options to address them,\" she said, noting an April blog post from EPA Administrator Gina MCarthy on changes the agency is considering after the meetings.\n\nDemocrats on the committee, primarily Sen.

That conclusion set up a back and forth between Whitehouse and Kansas\u2019 Metzger on the validity of removing the federal government\u2019s role as a water regulator.\n\n\u201cEven where you can foresee that waste and pollution will be washing into the waterways of Kansas, you would still say, no, that is not something that the Clean Water Act should regulate?\u201d Whitehouse asked.\n\n\u201cWe feel they are adequately protected by state regulation,\u201d Metzger responded.\n\n\u201cOk, well,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cGood luck with the Supreme Court on that.\u201d\n\n\u2014This post was updated at 2:10 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Republicans on the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee hit an Obama administration clean water rule proposal as an example of federal overreach on Tuesday as they began considering a bill that would undo it.", "description": "Republicans on the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee hit an Obama administration clean water rule proposal as an example of federal overreach on Tuesday as they began considering a bill that would undo it.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Republicans on the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee hit an Obama administration clean water rule proposal as an example of federal overreach on Tuesday as they began considering a bill that would undo it.", "title": "Republicans: States, not EPA, can regulate water", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/242511-republicans-states-not-epa-can-regulate-water", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-19T14:10:58-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-19T14:10-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/242511-republicans-states-not-epa-can-regulate-water", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-19T12:50-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, waters of the United States rule,Sheldon Whitehouse, John Barrasso,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-19T12:50:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-19T14:10:58-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/242511-republicans-states-not-epa-can-regulate-water", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Republicans on the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee hit an Obama administration clean water rule proposal as an example of federal overreach on Tuesday as they began considering a bill that would undo it.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans: States, not EPA, can regulate water"}, "dcterms.title": "Republicans: States, not EPA, can regulate water"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6d5\"", "article_summary": "The House passed a GOP-backed bill last week that would repeal the water rule.\nADVERTISEMENTOfficials from Colorado and Kansas and a handful of Republicans on the committee's fisheries, water and wildlife subcommittee said the rule is too broad and could impinge on the way their states operate.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers are currently finalizing their \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d rule, which would redefine the bodies of water that fall under the EPA's regulatory jurisdiction.\nShe said states are best suited to regulate waters on their own.\nRepublicans on a Senate Environment and Public Works panel hit an Obama administration clean water rule proposal as an example of federal overreach on Tuesday as they began considering a bill that would undo it."}
