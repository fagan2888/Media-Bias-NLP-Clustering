(AP) - A $40 million ail expansion project in Minot will not be as large as promised due to increasing costs, construction managers told Ward County commissioners on Friday.\n\nOfficials said Friday that the plan to add 200 new beds to the Ward County Jail will not fit into the $39.9 million budget.\n\nSome other aspects of the remodeling and expansion project have also been removed and turned into options to be added to the project if costs come in below current estimates, KXMC-TV reported (http://bit.ly/1Ni8IRb ).\n\nThe jail expansion was deemed necessary because the current 104-bed capacity at the jail has been inadequate to hold the increasing number of prisoners. To meet their needs, jail officials have been shipping about 30 inmates to other facilities.\n\nOriginally planned to add 200, the total capacity of the new addition will now be 144 beds, giving the jail a total capacity of 248 beds.\n\nThe plan calls for the remaining 56 beds - or 28 cells - to be roughed in with the option of completing them later.\n\nWard County Sheriff Steve Kukowski said the most important option to be added back in, if funds are available, is an improved intake area where inmates are processed on arrival.\n\nConstruction managers believe accelerating the pace of the job will bring savings in avoiding inflation and saving the cost of requiring heating in the building during construction.\n\n\u201cI mean that\u2019s real money just by compressing the schedule,\u201d said Mark Liska, a construction manager.\n\nCommissioners voted to go ahead with the first phase of the project, with construction scheduled to begin by Nov. 1.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KXMC-TV, http://www.kxnet.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A $40 million ail expansion project in Minot will not be as large as promised due to increasing costs, construction managers told Ward County commissioners on Friday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/plans-for-40-million-ward-county-jail-expansion-sc/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A $40 million ail expansion project in Minot will not be as large as promised due to increasing costs, construction managers told Ward County commissioners on Friday.", "title": "Plans for $40 million Ward County jail expansion scaled back"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A $40 million ail expansion project in Minot will not be as large as promised due to increasing costs, construction managers told Ward County commissioners on Friday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Plans for $40 million Ward County jail expansion scaled back"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Officials said Friday that the plan to add 200 new beds to the Ward County Jail will not fit into the $39.9 million budget.\nMINOT, N.D.
