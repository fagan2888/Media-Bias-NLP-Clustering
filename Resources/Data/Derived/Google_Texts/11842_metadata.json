After all that sweat you transfer onto it from talking on a hot summer day, all the things you touched on your way to work, and who knows what else, your phone ends up 7,000 different types of bacteria on it \u2014 25,000 per square inch. That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of germs. Knowing this, and hoping to renew interest in its brand, BlackBerry\u2019s latest innovation might be a bacteria-free smartphone geared toward health care workers.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO John Chen hinted at the idea earlier this week while speaking at an event held by Mackenzie Health in Ontario, Canada. The BlackBerry CEO also announced a partnership with ThoughtWire and Cisco; altogether, the devices would be linked to secure messaging and alert systems within the Mackenzie Richmond Hill unit, ABC News reported. Chen said \u201chealth care workers\u201d would \u201chave to be worried about one less thing to wipe down.\u201d\n\nSince the introduction of the iPhone and Android-based devices, BlackBerry has seen its share of the smartphone market drop dramatically. Today, iOS- and Android-based devices hold 96 percent of the market share while BlackBerry has stabilized \u2014 under Chen\u2019s lead \u2014 at just 0.5 percent. A so-called \u201cclean phone\u201d may be able to increase market share, however, there was no word on one actually being developed just yet or how it would work.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether the smartphone would be useful to doctors and nurses. For one, doctor\u2019s offices and hospitals are covered in germs already. Not only are they all over hospital surfaces, but studies have shown they call doctors\u2019 white coats and their stethoscopes home, too. In fact, doctors\u2019 stethoscopes were found to be dirtier than their own palms.\n\nOn top of that, speaking to ABC News, infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner said the innovation wouldn\u2019t be considered a \u201cgreat revolution.\u201d Only 20 to 30 percent of viruses on glass surfaces like smartphone screens transfer to a person\u2019s fingers, a 2013 study found. \u201cTo put it in perspective, smartphones are not a major source of hand contamination and a source of infection. But every little thing helps,\u201d he said.\n\nNevertheless, with little consumer interest in its products, any idea is worth pursuing.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blackberry, ceo, suggests, next, smartphone, may, be, antibacterial, geared, toward, health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "BlackBerry is considering a bacteria-free smartphone that would be used in health care settings.", "title": "BlackBerry Is Considering An Antibacterial Smartphone", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blackberry-ceo-suggests-next-smartphone-may-be-antibacterial-geared-toward-health-340306", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/28/blackberry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BlackBerry is considering a bacteria-free smartphone that would be used in health care settings.", "title": "BlackBerry Is Considering An Antibacterial Smartphone", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blackberry-ceo-suggests-next-smartphone-may-be-antibacterial-geared-toward-health-340306", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/28/blackberry.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/28/blackberry.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-06-28T15:08:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T15:09:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "BlackBerry is considering a bacteria-free smartphone that would be used in health care settings."}, "article_summary": "Knowing this, and hoping to renew interest in its brand, BlackBerry\u2019s latest innovation might be a bacteria-free smartphone geared toward health care workers.\nToday, iOS- and Android-based devices hold 96 percent of the market share while BlackBerry has stabilized \u2014 under Chen\u2019s lead \u2014 at just 0.5 percent.\nChen said \u201chealth care workers\u201d would \u201chave to be worried about one less thing to wipe down.\u201dSince the introduction of the iPhone and Android-based devices, BlackBerry has seen its share of the smartphone market drop dramatically.\nThe company\u2019s CEO John Chen hinted at the idea earlier this week while speaking at an event held by Mackenzie Health in Ontario, Canada.\nA so-called \u201cclean phone\u201d may be able to increase market share, however, there was no word on one actually being developed just yet or how it would work."}
