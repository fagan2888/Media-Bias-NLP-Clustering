BEN CARDON, (Except from op-ed in The Washington Times):\n\n\n\n... [Political correctness] is in place to ensure conformity to the prescribed expressions and lifestyles dictated by the elites.\n\nThere are rewards of acceptance and praise for members of the \u201cin crowd\u201d as they attempt to silence or destroy any who dare think for themselves or express opposing views. Similarly, the purveyors of PC seize upon a word or phrase, which they emphasize in an attempt to divert attention away from the actual issue that doesn\u2019t fit their narrative.\n\nI have stated in the past that Obamacare is the worst thing to occur in our country since slavery. Why did I make such a strong statement? Obviously, I recognize the horrors of slavery. My roots have been traced back to Africa, and I am aware of some horrendous deeds inflicted on my ancestors in this country.\n\nThe purpose of the statement was not to minimize the most evil institution in American history, but rather to draw attention to a profound shift of power from the people to the government.\n\nI think this shift is beginning to wrench the nation from one centered on the rights of individual citizens to one that accepts the right of the government to control even the most essential parts of our lives. This strikes a serious blow to the concept of freedom that gave birth to this nation.\n\nSome well-known radicals have very publicly written and stated that in order for their idea of a utopian, egalitarian society to emerge in the United States, the government must control health care, which ensures the dependency of the populace on government. Historical analysis of many countries that have gone this route demonstrates obliteration of the middle class and massive expansion of the poor, dependent class with a relatively small number of elites in control.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "03-19-14", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/CarsonCPAV.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Dr. Ben Carson: Political Correctness and the Slavery of ObamaCare\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/03\\/19\\/dr-ben-carson-political-correctness-and-slavery-obamacare\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/CarsonCPAV.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-19T11:30:15-04:00\",\"identifier\":\"62698\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "DR.
