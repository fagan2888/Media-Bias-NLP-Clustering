This provides outlets the opportunity to run through the perfectly Gwyneth remarks that the actress has made in the past about her Jewish heritage (father Bruce Paltrow was Jewish); Page Six\u2019s report reminds readers who need a refresher on their Gwyneth arcana. Paltrow described the \u201clong line of influential Eastern European rabbis\u201d that her family descended from on a genealogy reality show in 2011 \u2014 no rabbis but the best for the queen of Hollywood! \u2014 and did the same in a 2006 interview, jokingly calling herself a \u201cJewish princess.\u201d In promoting her most recent cookbook, Paltrow called herself \u201cthe original Jewish mother.\u201d\n\nPaltrow\u2019s possible conversion opens up a whole new world of possibilities for how Paltrow will promote her own image, which throughout her career she\u2019s done better than just about any actress in the game. Paltrow is half-Jewish (and not the half that traditionally grants one birthright into the Jewish faith!) and has spent her career putting that fact into conversation with her 1990s-through-early-2000s image as a materialistic ice queen and her subsequent evolution into a domestic expert. And she wasn\u2019t even practicing! As Paltrow\u2019s area of expertise has moved from cooking and homemaking into relationships and quasi-mystical wisdom (viz. \u201cconscious uncoupling,\u201d as well as her stated belief that water has feelings), it is truly exciting to imagine in what context Paltrow will cite Talmudic wisdom \u2014 an interview in Vogue? A recipe in Goop?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The actress to consciously couple with a new faith", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly planning to convert to Judaism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The actress to consciously couple with a new faith", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly planning to convert to Judaism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/05/gwyneth_paltrow_reportedly_planning_to_convert_to_judaism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/gwyneth_paltrow2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The actress to consciously couple with a new faith", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly planning to convert to Judaism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/gwyneth_paltrow2.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gwyneth Paltrow, Judaism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98a2\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Gwyneth Paltrow, Judaism, Entertainment NewsGwyneth Paltrow, the Oscar-winning actress who single-handedly popularized the phrase \u201cconscious uncoupling,\u201d has reportedly decided to consciously couple with Judaism.\nPaltrow is half-Jewish (and not the half that traditionally grants one birthright into the Jewish faith!)\n\u201cconscious uncoupling,\u201d as well as her stated belief that water has feelings), it is truly exciting to imagine in what context Paltrow will cite Talmudic wisdom \u2014 an interview in Vogue?\nThe star has for years been a devotee of Kabbalah, the mysticism popular among celebrities, but is now said to be studying up for a conversion to Judaism.\nThis provides outlets the opportunity to run through the perfectly Gwyneth remarks that the actress has made in the past about her Jewish heritage (father Bruce Paltrow was Jewish); Page Six\u2019s report reminds readers who need a refresher on their Gwyneth arcana."}
