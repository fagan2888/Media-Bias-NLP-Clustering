You can\u2019t say Republicans haven't seen it coming. They\u2019ve known for ages that Hispanics have the capacity to make or break them in 2016. Right now it\u2019s looking more like break, unless a couple of potential saviors pull off a miracle\u2014which is why former Gov. Jeb Bush went on Tuesday to Puerto Rico, not known for its early primary status.\n\nIf the GOP is to make any headway with Hispanic voters, analysts across the spectrum say two Floridians are the key. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, is enjoying a surge of attention and polling popularity after announcing his candidacy this month. Bush is not Hispanic, despite his \u201coops\u201d moment of checking off Hispanic on a voter form, but he may be an even better bet than Rubio. \u201cHe has the most potential,\u201d UCLA professor Matt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions polling, says of Bush. \u201cHistorically, he\u2019s been more moderate than Rubio has been on a host of Latino issues. And his family situation can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat family situation includes brother George W., who as president championed immigration and education reforms important to Hispanics, as well as Bush\u2019s own immediate family. \u201c I know the immigrant experience because I married a beautiful girl from Mexico. My children are bicultural and bilingual,\u201d Jeb Bush said Tuesday at Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan.\n\nThe trip to Puerto Rico was followed Wednesday by a keynote speech to the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference in Houston. In San Juan, Bush talked about statehood and rum in Spanish and English. In Texas, it was education and immigration, in Spanish and English. Boxes, checked.\n\nRubio is an eloquent speaker who can reach \u201cthese Latinos who don\u2019t really feel that the party\u2019s talking to them,\u201d says Stephen Nuno, a Northern Arizona University professor who is writing a book about Latinos and the GOP. \u201cUnfortunately for Marco Rubio, Bush can make the same speech in the same language to the same people, and he comes with a little more gravitas.\u201d\n\nA Bush aide notes that in addition to his Mexican ties, Bush spent six months in Puerto Rico running his father\u2019s 1980 campaign, and before that lived in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was a vice president and branch manager for Texas Commerce Bank. \u201cThe governor does have the ability to resonate culturally within the different groups in the Hispanic community. He understands how to communicate within the different sectors,\u201d the aide says.\n\nPuerto Ricans have a growing presence in Florida and are key to winning elections there. From Bush\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s also potentially relevant that there are nearly 34 million Mexican-Americans scattered across the country. That compares with about 2 million Cuban-Americans who are concentrated ( 70 percent) in Florida and who have enjoyed a warmer welcome\u2014residency, green cards, citizenship\u2014than other groups.\n\nStill, Rubio is now discussing his roots in a way that could resonate with the larger immigrant community. He ran into trouble a few years back when it turned out that, contrary to how he understood his family history, his parents did not come to America to escape Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 Communist revolution. They actually came earlier, to escape poverty and build better lives. As Rubio put it in announcing his presidential bid, \u201cMy father became a bartender. My mother a cashier, a maid and a Kmart stock clerk. They never made it big. But they were successful.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a classic American Dream saga that speaks directly to the aspirations of many a Mexican or Central American immigrants in places like Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Virginia, North Carolina and his own home of Florida. In other words, the states that could well decide the 2016 presidential election.\n\n***\n\nYet the primary and general election seasons are riddled with political traps\u2014some Republicans set for themselves, some laid by President Obama\u2014that could well make gains with Hispanic voters in the 2016 cycle more difficult than ever.\n\nThe problem began with GOP recalcitrance on immigration reform, despite pleas from party elders after the 2012 election to get behind comprehensive fixes that included legal status and a complicated path to citizenship for many of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. From there, the dominoes fell. The House killed a bipartisan Senate reform bill. Obama responded with a series of executive actions designed to shield millions from deportation. Republicans and conservatives filed lawsuits to stop him. Courts blocked Obama\u2019s actions. Republicans, having backed off comprehensive reform, narrowed their focus to border control and decrying Obama\u2019s executive \u201coverreach.\u201d\n\nGiven that history, get ready for a year or more of questions to GOP White House hopefuls about what they would do about all this as president: Revoke permits for undocumented young people\u2014the \u201cdreamers\u201d\u2014who already have temporary legal status under a 2012 Obama policy? Roll back the executive actions now being challenged in court, even if they eventually take effect and millions receive temporary residency permits? Would orders and actions be reversed on Day One? Day 100? The day Congress passes comprehensive reform? And what day might that be? As a famous New Yorker cartoon caption once put it, \u201cHow about never\u2014is never good for you?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just immigration. The GOP is also out of step with Hispanics on major Obama initiatives such as the Affordable Care Act and re-establishing relations with Cuba, as well as broader questions about the role of government. The chasms will put identity politics\u2014as well as campaign skills, personal connections and policy creativity\u2014to a stiff test.\n\nMitt Romney failed the test in 2012. He received a paltry 27 percent of the Hispanic vote that year. Pollster Nicole McCleskey published a series of seminal memos on Republicans and Hispanic voters the following year. She concluded that they were largely talking past each other on values and economic issues, and using unhelpful language that obscured common goals on immigration, among them an easier residency process, learning the language and no shortcuts to citizenship.\n\nEducation\u2014an issue McCleskey then called \u201cthe great equalizer\u201d\u2014today remains a potential point of connection for Republicans and Hispanics. \u201cLatinos are open-minded to conservatives on education. They are open to any approach because their schools are not good,\u201d Barreto says. But citizenship and other shared immigration goals have receded and new wedges have emerged, raising the question of whether even a Bush or a Rubio can repair relations.\n\nRepublican strategist Whit Ayres, a Rubio adviser, says the 2016 nominee will need to best Romney by 15 to 20 percentage points among Hispanics in order to win. In his new book, \u201c2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America,\u201d he writes that Romney\u2019s performance with Hispanic voters was the worst of any GOP presidential candidate in a two-person race since Watergate. He also says it was utterly predictable and tries to send his party a wakeup call: \u201cThe idea that Republicans can rip into illegal immigrants without antagonizing Hispanic voters is delusional.\u201d\n\nThat sums up why Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, though his father was born in Cuba, doesn\u2019t qualify as a party-expander. He\u2019s a ferocious critic of a path to citizenship and Obama\u2019s executive actions and he opposed Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination as attorney general because she supported \u201cthe president\u2019s illegal and unconstitutional executive amnesty.\u201d He likes to joke that the IRS should be padlocked and its nearly 90,000 employees sent to the Southern border to scare off illegal immigrants. When Cruz entered the race, the DREAM Action Coalition, which represents undocumented young people, predicted that \u201che may be the most anti-immigration candidate on stage\u201d during GOP primary debates.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The 2016 Republican nominee better hope not.", "title": "Will Hispanics Reject the GOP Once Again?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/jeb-bush-marco-rubio-2016-hispanic-vote-117483.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/29/150429_lawrence_jeb_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2016,Jeb Bush,GOP,Marco Rubio,Hispanic Voters", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "The 2016 Republican nominee better hope not.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If the GOP is to make any headway with Hispanic voters, analysts across the spectrum say two Floridians are the key.\nEducation\u2014an issue McCleskey then called \u201cthe great equalizer\u201d\u2014today remains a potential point of connection for Republicans and Hispanics.\nPollster Nicole McCleskey published a series of seminal memos on Republicans and Hispanic voters the following year.\nThey\u2019ve known for ages that Hispanics have the capacity to make or break them in 2016.\nThe GOP is also out of step with Hispanics on major Obama initiatives such as the Affordable Care Act and re-establishing relations with Cuba, as well as broader questions about the role of government."}
