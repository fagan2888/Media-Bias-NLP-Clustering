In an industry heavily reliant on spreadsheets, processes, paperwork and landline fax and telephones, PokitDok allows health information technology professionals, health systems, employer groups, insurers and the state and federal exchanges to seamlessly and securely:\n\nexchange data for health plan enrollment management\n\ndetermine a patient\u2019s eligibility for health services based on their insurance plan\n\npre-authorize specialist referrals and;\n\nsubmit claims and ascertain their status\n\nPokitDok is the first to establish a new, powerful model for exchanging data using Application Programming Interfaces, available on the PokitDok Platform and leveraging established Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) agreements with insurers that represent 75 percent of the covered American population.\n\n\"New regulations introduced by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act inject huge interoperability challenges within the technology layers of the health system,\" said Allen Byerly, CTO, Grouphub.io. \"PokitDok gives us the tools to help our customers minimize costs and prepare for HIPAA electronic compliance mandates that will be effective in 2016. Insurance brokers can start to eliminate paperwork, prevent manual errors and automate data exchange now as they, for example, adhere to new 834 file formats for benefit enrollment and maintenance.\u201d\n\nThe industry standard for electronic transmission of health information, from enrollment to claims submission, is called HIPAA ASC X12 5010. The Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 was intended to make the healthcare system in the United States more efficient by standardizing healthcare transactions like eligibility requests and health plan enrollment. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has established additional operating rules aimed at requiring standardization for health transactions. PokitDok introduces a centralized, advanced method for the transmission and reception of healthcare information that improves care coordination, prevents delays, reduces administrative costs and helps the industry conform to new governing rules, including 834 EDI transmission for Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance and 278 Pre-Authorization and Referral (aka Medical Referral and Response) Information file standards.\n\nHistorically, after consumers submit their insurance card for their medical visit, the provider\u2019s back office will call the insurance company to verify and assess coverage and eligibility. Once medical services have been provided, a claim is mailed to the insurance company seeking reimbursement and much of the process is tracked and stored on flat files. Using the PokitDok Platform, this manual process is automated through Software as a Service and can be integrated into the provider\u2019s technology network through Application Programming Interfaces. To sign up, go to platform.pokitdok.com and request an API key. To become an insurance trading partner, email X12info@PokitDok.com.\n\n\u201cBeginning with Aetna, PokitDok brought the necessary industry relationships together, coupled with a technical architecture, to solve real integration and data integrity issues faced by nearly every healthcare institution,\u201d said Lisa Maki, co-founder and CEO, PokitDok. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t have to rip and replace their IT systems to conform to legislative mandates and support higher volumes of data exchange. Because of PokitDok\u2019s trading partner relationships, data exchange can take place flawlessly, at an accelerated pace, driving costs down and helping companies adapt to the new consumer-driven healthcare system.\u201d\n\nAbout PokitDok\n\nFounded in 2011, PokitDok is a HIPAA-compliant cloud-based platform for healthcare purchases, connecting consumers directly with practitioners in a transparent, e-commerce experience.
