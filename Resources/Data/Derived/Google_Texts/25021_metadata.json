Making decisions about resuscitation and living on feeding tubes or ventilators is something everyone should do once they\u2019re mature enough to understand the choices, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just for older Americans,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cAdvance care planning is something that 22- or 23-year-old people should do because they need to let people know what they would want in a medical emergency too.\u201d\n\nSinclair says there are still a lot of details to be determined in the proposed Medicare rule, which also will undergo a public comment period.\n\nFor one thing, the level of reimbursement has not been outlined, which could limit which providers will find it worth their time. There\u2019s also the question of who would be qualified to provide the advance care planning.\n\nSinclair says right now it\u2019s the domain of physicians only, but others are qualified. The key, he says, is having standards that ensure providers are properly trained and respect patients\u2019 individual decisions rather than \u201cjust anybody with a checklist.\u201d\n\nProposals for reimbursement of end-of-life planning included in the federal Affordable Care Act became bogged down in political opposition that held out the threat of government \u201cdeath panels\u201d to quash the idea.\n\nSinclair says he doesn\u2019t think that will happen this time. Those political debates, he says, spurred people to take a more serious, nuanced look at advance care planning.\n\nSinclair says it\u2019s important to note that having a legally binding advance directive not only tells physicians which patients don\u2019t want aggressive treatment, but also makes clear which patients want to be kept alive by any means necessary.\n\n\u201cThey can really empower their own choices, whatever they are,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cSometimes I think people are afraid these are just very one-sided.\u201d\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Note: KCUR will run a series of stories Friday on end-of-life issues and the policy changes needed to give people more control over what happens to them in", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/expert-hails-medicare-proposal-reimburse-end-life-counseling", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201507/sinclair__christian_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Note: KCUR will run a series of stories Friday on end-of-life issues and the policy changes needed to give people more control over what happens to them in", "title": "Expert Hails Medicare Proposal To Reimburse End-Of-Life Counseling"}, "story_id": 421566185, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Andy Marso", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Expert Hails Medicare Proposal To Reimburse End-Of-Life Counseling"}, "nid": 75865, "datePublished": "2015-07-09", "keywords": "end of life care, Medicare, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 691, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb085\"", "article_summary": "Those political debates, he says, spurred people to take a more serious, nuanced look at advance care planning.\nIf Medicare follows through with its plan to cover advance care planning, other private insurers are likely to follow.\nThere\u2019s also the question of who would be qualified to provide the advance care planning.\nThat\u2019s important, Sinclair says, because Medicare primarily covers Americans age 65 and older.\nSome private insurance plans have started to reimburse for end-of-life planning and have found that patients who take advantage are more satisfied with their care, he says."}
