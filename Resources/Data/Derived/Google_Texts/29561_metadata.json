Marriott (Washington) intently listening to NBGH President and CEO Brian Marcotte lay out the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for healthcare in 2015\u2014and beyond.\n\nDuring his talk, Marcotte touched on the \u201cdisruption\u201d occurring in healthcare today and praised employers for the role they\u2019re playing in \u201cdriving innovation.\u201d He described those employers that are leading the way with such innovations as \u201cdisrupters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisruption\u201d is certainly as good a word as any to describe what\u2019s taking place in healthcare today.\n\nNo surprise that Marcotte \u2014 who was vice president of compensation and benefits at Honeywell for roughly 12 years before replacing Helen Darling as NBGH president and CEO last May \u2014 pointed to the Affordable Care Act as healthcare\u2019s biggest disruptive force.\n\nSix years ago, Marcotte said, \u201c[w]hen the CEO would ask the question, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just get out of healthcare?\u2019 the answer was simple [because] there was no place for people to go to purchase affordable, high-quality healthcare. Well, the answer is not as simple today.\u201d\n\nNowadays, he explained, there are several options, including staying the course, private exchanges and public exchanges. As things stand today, he said, \u201cstaying the course\u201d continues to be the most efficient way to deliver to employees affordable healthcare. As he explained it, \u201c[w]e haven\u2019t seen good and consistent data\u201d to suggest otherwise.\n\nAt the end of the day, Marcotte added, it all comes down to value and whether or not private exchanges can deliver greater value than today\u2019s self-insured model.\n\nDuring a session later in the morning, Julie Stone, North America health and group benefits leader for Towers Watson, shared, for the first time, the results of her company\u2019s just-completed 2015 Emerging Trends in Health Care Survey. Among the findings: While 17 percent of 444 employer respondents believe private exchanges provide a viable alternative for employer-sponsored coverage for active full-time employees in 2016, confidence in the approach builds to 37 percent by 2018.\n\nIn addition, the Towers Watson study found companies that have done extensive analyses of private exchanges are twice as likely to consider them a viable option in 2016 (29 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDespite this somewhat promising data, Marcotte said, employers aren\u2019t going to embrace private exchanges until they see more data suggesting it\u2019s the right move to make.\n\nEarly on in his remarks, Marcotte emphasized the need for more data, recalling an episode at Honeywell when CEO David Cote put him on the spot at a meeting to back up a statement he made with meaningful data.\n\nCEOs make their decisions based on data, Marcotte said. But with the exception of cost, he continued, the data needed to make the right healthcare decisions aren\u2019t available yet.\n\nIn his talk, Marcotte also touched on other disrupters, such as the industry consolidation that\u2019s going on in healthcare. \u201cWhen will we begin to see the synergies from the consolidation?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnother disrupter: emerging delivery models, such as accountable-care organizations. Despite an \u201cexplosion\u201d in the number of these organizations, he said, the jury is still out as to \u201cwhat to make of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployers,\u201d he said, \u201cneed to know what they\u2019re buying.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he said, they need to understand the \u201cvalue\u201d they\u2019re getting.\n\nAs he put it, if you\u2019re going to go to your CEO and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to change the plan design and encourage people to go to ACOs,\u201d that CEO is going to respond, \u201cWhy? What\u2019s the value proposition?\u201d\n\nSo be ready for that question. And, I would think, be ready with the required data to back your proposal up, because you know you\u2019re going to need it.\n\nShare on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "HRE Daily", "description": "NBGH session focuses on disruption", "title": "Being a Disruptive Force in Healthcare - HRE Daily", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://blog.hreonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/452031437-300x297.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-06T17:35:26+00:00", "url": "http://blog.hreonline.com/2015/03/06/disruptive-force-healthcare/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "benefits", "published_time": "2015-03-06T17:35:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-06T17:35:26+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "description": "NBGH session focuses on disruption", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda029\"", "article_summary": "Well, the answer is not as simple today.\u201dNowadays, he explained, there are several options, including staying the course, private exchanges and public exchanges.\nIn his talk, Marcotte also touched on other disrupters, such as the industry consolidation that\u2019s going on in healthcare.\nBut with the exception of cost, he continued, the data needed to make the right healthcare decisions aren\u2019t available yet.\nMarriott (Washington) intently listening to NBGH President and CEO Brian Marcotte lay out the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for healthcare in 2015\u2014and beyond.\nCEOs make their decisions based on data, Marcotte said."}
