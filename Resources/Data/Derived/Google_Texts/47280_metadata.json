"Topeka City Councilman Jonathan Schumm\u2019s constituents tell him about motorists who blast their car stereos so loudly the bass actually makes houses shake.\n\nSchumm, who represents southeast Topeka\u2019s District 4, said he is seeking to toughen city rules regulating people who do that.\n\nA proposal he is sponsoring along those lines is among five measures the council plans to discuss Tuesday.\n\nCity manager Jim Colson had the items put on the agenda for discussion only at that 6 p.m. meeting after council members talked July 21 about what they can do to get proposals considered for action by the city\u2019s governing body.\n\nColson responded that council members had put forth five items that were \u201cin the queue\u201d for being taken up by that body.\n\nWithout a vote, the city on July 21 put in place a process through which council members will bring any proposals they have to Colson, the city staff will research the matter and Colson will bring the proposal before the governing body \u2014 for discussion only \u2014 at the first meeting after two weeks.\n\nAly Van Dyke, the city\u2019s media relations director, said the city manager\u2019s office will track each request and work with the appropriate city departments to develop a \u201cpolicy brief\u201d for each proposal.\n\n\u201cThe brief will include background information, a review of best practices/benchmarks, financial and operational impact analysis and additional information as appropriate,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the meeting where the governing body discusses a proposal, members might decide whether they want to consider acting on it, and when, Colson said.\n\nCopies aren\u2019t yet publicly available for the five proposals to be taken up Tuesday.\n\nVan Dyke said they are:\n\n\u25a0 Schumm\u2019s proposal to change the city ordinance regarding loud noise, specifically the issue of music being heard from vehicles as they drive through neighborhoods.\u201d Schumm told The Topeka Capital-Journal the proposal would reduce the distance at which a stereo must be heard for an officer to be able to ticket the driver, and increase the penalty for second and third offenses while enabling the owner \u2014 by removing the stereo \u2014 to reduce the fine on the second or third offenses.\n\n\u25a0 Schumm\u2019s proposal to \u201cprohibit panhandling.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 A proposal by Councilman Jeff Coen that would ban nudity in public places.\n\n\u25a0 Councilwoman Elaine Schwartz\u2019s proposal to revise the city\u2019s smoking ban ordinance to also include electronic cigarettes.\n\n\u25a0 Schwartz\u2019s proposal to amend a city traffic ordinance to allow the city to impound vehicles for which the driver is unable to show evidence of liability insurance.\n\nThe council doesn\u2019t plan Tuesday to consider a proposal regarding records fees, which was taken up March 17 by its policy and finance committee, Van Dyke said.\n\nShe said former Councilman Chad Manspeaker, then chairman of that committee, successfully asked that day that consideration of the proposal be postponed until new council members were elected last April and new members of the committee appointed.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Tim Hrenchir", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Topeka City Councilman
