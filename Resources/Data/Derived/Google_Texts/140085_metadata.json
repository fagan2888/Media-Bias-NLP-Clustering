More than 60,000 Colorado residents are living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, according to 2010 U.S. Census data.\n\nAnnabel Bowlen \u2014 wife of Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, who stepped aside as the team\u2019s CEO in July due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 cut the ceremonial ribbon to start off the event. Annabel Bowlen, along with family and friends, called themselves Team Super Bowlen and collectively raised more than $68,000.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s for Pat,\u201d the team said before crossing the starting line.\n\n\u201cPeople are here today for very personal reasons. Some walk to support the cause and a vision of a world without Alzheimer\u2019s disease; others are here to support someone living with the disease or honor someone they have lost to Alzheimer\u2019s; and some people walk because they have Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Linda Mitchell, CEO of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association of Colorado, said in a news release.\n\nBeth Christie waited near the starting line for the race to begin. Christie wore a photo of a smiling woman, her grandma Ruth, pinned to her purple shirt that read, \u201cI walk for Ruth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandma died of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Christie said. \u201cShe had it for 20 years. I\u2019m here today to honor her memory.\u201d\n\nWhile registration for the walk was free, participants were encouraged to donate to the cause. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association set a $1 million fundraising goal, and officials said 80 percent was reached by Friday. Same-day registration would soon indicate whether the goal was met.\n\nBeth Ryan was prompted to attend the walk for her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hideous disease. There\u2019s no rationalization. You watch this person you love deteriorate,\u201d she said.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by disrupting loss of memory, reason, judgment, and often personality changes, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nRyan struggled caring for her mother and could not find adequate support until connecting with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and Denver\u2019s Clermont Park, a continuing care retirement community locally owned by Christian Living Communities.\n\n\u201cThe people there are so kind and caring,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nNow, she is grateful that her 89-year-old mother has the attention she needs and hopes Alzheimer\u2019s disease begins getting the attention it deserves.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, the disease is the sixth-leading cause of death in the nation.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a lot more interest in finding a cure. The disease is so poorly funded by the government,\u201d she said.\n\nCaroline Tysseland is a registered nurse at Clermont Park\u2019s Adult Day Services. Her passion for creating dialogue and awareness about Alzheimer\u2019s brought her to the walk.\n\nTysseland said she loves her job but is saddened to see an increasing number of Alzheimer\u2019s patients, some as young as 50, in need of care.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see political and social change to make a difference and find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s. It is out of control. We need to be looking for the best practices around the world to help cure this terrible disease,\u201d she said.\n\nA Walk to End Alzheimer\u2019s also took place on Saturday in Colorado Springs. Walks were held earlier in the month in Fort Morgan, Grand Junction, Greeley, Larimer County, Montrose, Pueblo, southwest Colorado and Sterling.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/literally_lizzy", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Walk to End Alzheimer\u2019s sets $1 million fundraising goal", "title": "Walk to End Alzheimer\u2019s sets $1 million fundraising goal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/20/walk-to-end-alzheimers-sets-1-million-fundraising-goal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140920__20140921_B2_CD20ALZHEIMERSp1.jpg", "height": 391}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140920__20140921_B2_CD20ALZHEIMERSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-20T12:59:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:12:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by disrupting loss of memory, reason, judgment, and often personality changes, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association set a $1 million fundraising goal, and officials said 80 percent was reached by Friday.\nMore than 60,000 Colorado residents are living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, according to 2010 U.S. Census data.\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, the disease is the sixth-leading cause of death in the nation.\nBeth Ryan was prompted to attend the walk for her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease."}
