They are licensed, closely regulated, fully equipped for all medical emergencies and required to have an emergency room (ER) physician on-duty at all times.\n\n\u25a0 Convenience \u2014 FECs provide unparalleled convenience. They are located nearby patients and wait time is consistently shorter than hospital ERs. Unlike urgent-care facilities, FECs are required to be open 24/7 to provide all levels of care.\n\n\u25a0 Cost \u2014 FECs charge equal to or less than hospital ERs for emergency care that often exceeds the hospital ER standard.\n\n\u25a0 Satisfaction \u2014 Among all urgent- and emergency-care providers, FECs receive the highest satisfaction scores from everyone involved \u2014 patients, physicians and staff.\n\nIn addition, Troutman and the organization emphasize the differences between freestanding ERs and urgent care centers, which have also become popular in recent years and can usually be found in strip malls and shopping centers.\n\n\u201cUrgent care centers are a totally different ballgame,\u201d Troutman said. \u201cUrgent cares are usually open during the day, maybe in the evening and they offer very limited services.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a CAT scan, some may have an X-ray but certainly not all of that, and often staffed by low-level providers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Texas Association of Freestanding Emergency Centers stresses the following on its website:\n\n\u201cUnlike urgent-care centers, FECs are required to operate 24/7; have ER physicians on-site at all times; provide around-the-clock lab and imaging services; and stock medications not required for urgent-care centers.\u201d\n\nSome skeptical\n\nHowever, as with other industries, not everyone is completely sold on the freestanding ERs.\n\n\u201cFreestanding emergency departments want to claim, \u2018oh, we are convenience to patients because we reduce the burden on hospital emergency departments and we can offer care at a lower cost because we are not sort of a burden when all of the costs of staffing a hospital,\u2019 \u201d said health care economist Vivian Ho.\n\n\u201cI am skeptical of that,\u201d said Ho, director of the Center for Health and Biosciences at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute of Public Policy in Houston.\n\n\u201cWhat an emergency department would do is \u2018oh, we\u2019ll bill your insurance, just come on in\u2019 and what it turns out that in many cases is that they actually are out of network,\u201d Ho explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell the patient that, they just say \u2018we will bill your insurance\u2019 and they balance bill the patient for the remainder and the patients often are stuck with a very high bill and they are allowed to charge that because they charge the facility building\u2019s fees, which is what the emergency departments do.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the freestanding ERs are usually in upper class neighborhoods which not only have residents with higher than average incomes but are also insured and usually healthier than the rest of the population, Ho and others say.\n\nState Rep. John Smithee, who in this year\u2019s session sponsored a bill that helps consumers avoid sticker shock after they or someone in the family receives emergency medical care, said it remains to be seen how the new law \u2013 which went into effect on Sept. 1 \u2013 will work on the billing practices of freestanding ERs.\n\n\u201cWhen we were going through the process with that legislation we weren\u2019t thinking particularly of the new private emergency rooms,\u201d Smithee, R-Amarillo, said in reference to the so-called \u201cbalance billing\u201d legislation that consumer advocates hailed.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know of any reason why the law would not apply to those freestanding emergency rooms,\u201d Smithee said.\n\nNonetheless, \u201cit would be prudent for patients or families of those patients, if it is not an absolute emergency, to take some effort to make sure that the facility is in their network,\u201d he recommended. \u201cBut if you still have the problem that even if the facility, the hospital or the other emergency is in network some of the treating physicians may be out of network.\u201d\n\nTroutman said he has heard those concerns but consumers shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about when they or some in their family go to a freestanding ER.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the ACA (the federal Affordable Care Act) and Texas law, whenever a patient presents to an emergency department, the insurance that that patience has, has to pay in-network rates to that facility,\u201d Troutman said. So, in some ways if that facility or a doctor is in-network or out of network \u201cis not necessarily all that important to the emergency medical business.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cit is important when you go in-patient,\u201d Troutman stressed. \u201cIf you go in-patient you\u2019ll be admitted to a hospital and if you go to an out-of-network hospital, you\u2019re going to have the entire bill.\n\n\u201cIf we do have a patient that is going to need surgery, we ask the patient\u2019s preference first, that\u2019s always most important and then we check that their insurance is going to be in-network for that.\u201d\n\nenrique.rangel@morris.com\n\n512-673-7553", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Filed online, Local News, Enrique Rangel", "og": {"url": "http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2015-09-12/freestanding-ers-seeing-quick-success-around-state-some-skeptical", "site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "type": "article", "description": "AUSTIN - Like Lubbock and a growing number of Texas cities, Amarillo now has a freestanding emergency room and three more are in the works.", "title": "Freestanding ERs seeing quick success around state, some skeptical"}, "description": "AUSTIN \u2014 Like Lubbock and a growing number of Texas cities, Amarillo now has a freestanding emergency room and three more are in the works.\u201cWhen you look at freestanding emergency rooms and hospital-based emergency rooms, they are synonymous, they are the same,\u201d said Gerad Troutman, a doctor and a business partner at ER Now, the 24/7 Amarillo facility that opened on Sept. 4Those medical facilities are proliferating in Texas because \u201cthe patients like the experience,\u201d Troutman explained. \u201cThey are in and out so they can continue doing what they need to do.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know of any reason why the law would not apply to those freestanding emergency rooms,\u201d Smithee said.\n\u201cFreestanding emergency departments (FSEDS) are on the rise,\u201d the Texas Medical Association says about the more than 160 facilities already operating in the state.\n\u201c From 1995 to 2005, the number of emergency rooms in the United States decreased from 4,176 to 3,795.\n\u25a0 Cost \u2014 FECs charge equal to or less than hospital ERs for emergency care that often exceeds the hospital ER standard.\nAUSTIN \u2014 Like Lubbock and a growing number of Texas cities, Amarillo now has a freestanding emergency room and three more are in the works."}
