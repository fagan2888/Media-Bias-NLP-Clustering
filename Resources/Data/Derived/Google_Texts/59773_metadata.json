The flagship gained about 9.6% for the year through June after fees, thanks in part to Monsanto, Humana and Tenet Healthcare\n\nHe likes children\u2019s clothing company Carter\u2019s, saying it\u2019s wrongly viewed as a typical retailer by the market when it\u2019s \u201cof much higher quality\u201d\u2014and that as consumers gain more confidence in the economy recovery, we should see some \u201cdeferred births\u201d start to happen, helping Carter\u2019s sales. Glenview started buying shares in 2013 when the price was $60, the letter said. (It was north of $79 per share in April, but closed Wednesday at $68.13.)\n\nIn some ways, the thesis on Carter\u2019s is the corollary to Glenview\u2019s views that the aging population will benefit the stock of healthcare companies, the letter said.\n\nGlenview took new stakes in National Oilwell Varco and Cadence Design Systems, and increased a position in private company Genia Technologies, which was bought by Roche in June.\n\nA larger point Robbins made in his letter, which he studded with basketball references, was that the team is more important than the individual. \u201cFor the San Antonio Spurs, no player finished in the top 25 in points per game. So how did San Antonio walk away with the big gold trophy? Team beats individual.\u201d\n\nWhile valuations aren\u2019t as attractive as they were a few years ago, Mr. Robbins said he believed in higher-than-average exposure to stocks.\n\nFactors he cited for his bullishness included companies\u2019 ability to borrow money cheaply, the willingness of boards and management to work with shareholders, controlled systemic risks and Glenview\u2019s \u201cconstructive\u201d read on the economy.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "One sign we\u2019re a few years out from the financial crisis: investors acknowledging how tough 2008 was.", "title": "In Investor Letter, Glenview Looks Back at 2008, Looks Ahead to More Babies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/17/in-investor-letter-glenview-looks-back-at-2008-looks-ahead-to-more-babies/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "In Investor Letter, Glenview Looks Back at 2008, Looks Ahead to More Babies", "description": "One sign we\u2019re a few years out from the financial crisis: investors acknowledging how tough 2008 was.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Juliet Chung", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "One sign we\u2019re a few years out from the financial crisis: investors acknowledging how tough 2008 was.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-17T12:42:30-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/17/in-investor-letter-glenview-looks-back-at-2008-looks-ahead-to-more-babies/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-24273", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "One sign we\u2019re a few years out from the financial crisis: investors acknowledging how tough 2008 was.", "title": "In Investor Letter, Glenview Looks Back at 2008, Looks Ahead to More Babies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/17/in-investor-letter-glenview-looks-back-at-2008-looks-ahead-to-more-babies/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-24273", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-17T12:43:12-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf42a\"", "article_summary": "One sign we\u2019re a few years out from the financial crisis: investors acknowledging how tough 2008 was.\nGlenview started buying shares in 2013 when the price was $60, the letter said.\nA larger point Robbins made in his letter, which he studded with basketball references, was that the team is more important than the individual.\nTeam beats individual.\u201dWhile valuations aren\u2019t as attractive as they were a few years ago, Mr. Robbins said he believed in higher-than-average exposure to stocks.\nIn some ways, the thesis on Carter\u2019s is the corollary to Glenview\u2019s views that the aging population will benefit the stock of healthcare companies, the letter said."}
