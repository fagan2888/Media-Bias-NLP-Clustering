Easy and fun! At least for a while. We laughed in incredulity; we laughed in horror. We laughed because there is some statistical possibility that one of those four men on that stage in Detroit will end up becoming president of the United States, and because the only one of them who remotely resembles a decent and normal human being is a notorious union buster and foe of reproductive choice who opposes raising the minimum wage and used to work at Lehman Brothers, the most notorious failed bank of the 2008 collapse. We did not laugh at John Kasich. We sighed and we swooned, because he would be a pretty bad president but that\u2019s no longer the relevant standard. Compared to those other guys, Kasich is Mother Teresa wrapped in puff pastry and drizzled with Oscar Wilde. He probably means well, after his own limited fashion, and he does not resemble the Lizard Man of Zanth (Trump), the birthday clown with piles of bodies in the basement (Cruz) or Little Marco, who will say anything and do anything in service of his brilliant plan to win the nomination by continually finishing third.\n\nSo the Republican Party has finally turned against Donald Trump, the monster it created, in an excess of self-righteous hypocrisy. It\u2019s a classic case of what historian Ian Kershaw once described as \u201cthe sinking ship leaving the rat.\u201d Anytime you trot out Mitt Romney to accuse someone else \u2014 literally anyone else \u2014 of being a fraud and a phony who is trying to play the American people for suckers, you have officially triggered on the Historical Irony alarm. But here\u2019s what I have to say to gleeful Democrats, eagerly looking forward to a November massacre: Laugh, fools, laugh! Because the crazy is coming for you too. When you look in the bathroom mirror, what\u2019s that mad glint in your eye? I know it\u2019s hard to see, because someone has written REDRUM across the mirror in lipstick over and over again, and the writing looks familiar somehow.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we will see a Democratic debate, in 2016 or 2024 or any other year, when the frontrunner will feel compelled to discuss his or her genital organs. (If Hillary Clinton actually makes a joke about that within the next week, and more or less lands it, I promise not to say anything mean about her for an entire month.) But a more polite version of the Republican knife fight is waiting to happen, and in some ways has already begun. The post-Bernie landscape is fraught with danger for the electoral left, and also with opportunity. You can feel both of those things in the combination of smugness and high anxiety found among Hillary Clinton supporters, who are not content to be victorious but must also seek to prove the unprovable thesis that their Potemkin political party is \u201cprogressive\u201d and that their victory points toward the future rather than the past.\n\nTo the extent that the Hillary wing of the Democratic Party believes that the war is over and they won and it\u2019s safe to retreat into the ossified institutional politics that have brought them nothing but misery and defeat and have rendered their party nearly irrelevant in most non-coastal states, they are inviting their own version of Trumpian apocalypse. For the insurgents of the Sanders wing, the question now becomes how many of them are willing to turn to the more difficult and less exciting work of rebuilding democracy from the ground up, and taking the Democratic Party back from the lawyers and technology millionaires and Hollywood executives and foreign-policy apparatchiks who have become its principal proprietors. Because presidential campaigns can be great drama, but they also serve to distract us from more important things. They are political theater more than political change.\n\nSince the rich people who bought the Democratic Party from Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband have all but destroyed it, and long ago severed it from any semblance of class-based politics and any coherent ideology beyond \u201cnot as mean as the other guys,\u201d the field is wide open. Millions of people of all ages were energized by an oddball candidate who started talking about things no one in American politics has talked about seriously for at least 50 years. \u201cSocialism\u201d suddenly isn\u2019t a bad word anymore, and that\u2019s amazing. But now what? Can those people do what activists on the right did over a period of several decades, electing school board members and county committee members and state legislators on the way toward the Reagan revolution and the Tea Party insurgency? Because those true believers on the right dug in and worked hard and changed political reality. They created the conundrum of the present, when a minority party with a wide range of extreme anti-government and xenophobic views, supported almost exclusively by white people, dominates the political agenda in 39 of the 50 states and holds an unbreakable majority in Congress.\n\nYeah, I know, let\u2019s back up for a minute. I said \u201cpost-Bernie landscape.\u201d Deal with it. I\u2019m not going all \u201cI told you so,\u201d even though I did. There really was an opening after New Hampshire, a moment when we all sensed a potential tipping point that could have happened but didn\u2019t quite. That window slammed shut in Nevada and South Carolina and across the South, and I\u2019m not buying the higher-math hypotheses about how Sanders might make inroads with African-American voters in other regions in a way he spectacularly failed to do in the South, and then might win Michigan or Ohio or Florida and push on toward a big victory in New York that flips the race upside down again. I could certainly be wrong, because wrongness is the order of the day in 2016. But I think the next few weeks are about Bernie\u2019s supporters moving through the stages of the K\u00fcbler-Ross model and coming to grips with reality, helped along ever so much by uneasy Clintonite gloating.\n\nBut here\u2019s the real point: None of that is actually the point. What happens next is far more important. If the Bernie Sanders campaign of 2016 had a purpose, and still has one, it goes far beyond Bernie Sanders. If the question was whether a septuagenarian senator from Vermont who calls himself a socialist could win the Democratic nomination or the presidential election, the answer was always exceedingly likely to be no. We were all startled to discover how possible and even plausible \u201cyes\u201d looked, for a moment there, and in that possibility we caught a glimpse of a possible future. Bernie Sanders was at best a highly imperfect messenger for such possibilities of political revolution and democratic redemption. If you were designing a candidate to be unelectable on a national scale, you could hardly do better than a crotchety old Jewish guy from Brooklyn whose political ideology has not budged since 1963 and who represents the smallest and most liberal state in the nation. (OK, I exaggerate: Wyoming actually has fewer people than Vermont, not to mention a lot fewer NPR listeners.)\n\nIndeed, the most striking aspect of the Sanders phenomenon is that he came as close as he did, given how poorly suited he was for the role. Let me say it again: Bernie Sanders was never the solution, and Hillary Clinton, much as she has done to earn the ire and mistrust of critics on the left, was never the problem. They are both symptoms or symbols, and in the short run the outcome of their symbolic collision was not in doubt. But the long run, and the collision between the forces behind Clinton and Sanders \u2014 that\u2019s an entirely different matter.\n\nAs Sanders\u2019 most \u2018roid-raged and testosterone-fueled supporters will ultimately admit, Hillary Clinton is vastly preferable as president to any possible Republican, semi-lovable Rust Belt New Ager John Kasich included. If Clinton runs against Trump or Cruz or Rubio, each of whom is a dangerous opponent in a different register, the distinctions are stark and undeniable. She represents what I recently heard Jeb Bush describe as \u201cregular-order democracy,\u201d and look where that got him. Those guys represent pitchforks and screaming and strange things on fire and the most gruesome scenes from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d You won\u2019t catch me hauling out the \u201cCoke vs. Pepsi\u201d line from the Ralph Nader era in this particular election. The 2016 choice is more like last week\u2019s Nestea from the back of the fridge versus a foul-smelling mystery beverage that might be diesel fuel or lawn chemicals or sorority-house vomit, but that someone in a Halloween mask has promised will get you really wasted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the Republicans compare dick sizes and howl at the moon, the fight for the Democratic Party is just starting", "title": "Stop laughing, Democrats!
