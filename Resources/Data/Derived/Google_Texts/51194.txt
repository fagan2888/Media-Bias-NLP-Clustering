PLANT CITY Curtis Weaver Jr., a singer who has performed at local venues, has long wanted the chance to appear on a bigger stage.

The Plant City resident recently got his chance when he auditioned for reality TV show “The Voice.”

While Weaver, 48, didn’t make the cut during his audition in New Orleans, he said it was fun just trying.

“It was a great experience and I would do it again,” he said.

Weaver said scores of singers from across the region competed for a shot at the TV show that uses such celebrities as Blake Shelton to coach its contestants.

“I’ll bet the line was probably a quarter- to a half-mile long,” Weaver said.

He auditioned in a room with about 10 other people before a producer. He said he was given around 30 seconds to sing the song he had chosen for the occasion, “Behind Closed Doors,” by Charlie Rich.

“That’s the one (song) I feel the most comfortable with,” he said.

Weaver has sung at local venues for many years including the Florida Strawberry Festival, the Hillsborough County Fair and Plant City Pioneer Heritage Day.

An employee at Lemire Pest Service, he said his dream job would be to one day sing professionally.

“I’m going to try to make a career of it and give it everything that I got,” he said.

His audition for “The Voice” was the first time he had auditioned for a reality TV singing competition, he said.

“A friend brought it to my attention a month ago so I signed up.”

Although Weaver draws inspiration from singers such as Charlie Rich, Paul Davis and Conway Twitty, he said he tries to sing from the heart with his own voice.

“I really just try for my own sound,” he said.
