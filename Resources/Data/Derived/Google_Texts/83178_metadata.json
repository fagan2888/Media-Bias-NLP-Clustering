However, the law does not require companies to provide discounts for biosimilars, which are lower-cost and nearly identical versions.\n\nUsing a hypothetical example in which a brand-name biologic costs $30,000 a year, a Part D beneficiary would pay more than $1,500 \u2014 or 39 percent more \u2014 for a biosimilar. Such higher expenses are likely to discourage use of biosimilars in the Part D program and, as a result, lower savings for Medicare overall, according to Avalere Health, a consulting firm that ran the analysis.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nThe findings emerge amid widespread anticipation that biosimilars will save money.\n\nThe medicines are expected to cost 10 percent to 30 percent, in general, less than brand-name biologics and, consequently, lower the US health care bill by $44 billion over the next several years, according to a 2014 reported from the RAND Corporation.\n\n\u201cLawmakers inadvertently created this scenario,\u201d said Caroline Pearson, an Avalere vice president. \u201cAt the time the law was being crafted, there were no biosimilars on the market, and I think they were trying to avoid burdening manufacturers with additional costs \u2026 But now, the projected savings may not be as large as we thought, at least if the policy isn\u2019t corrected.\u201d\n\nTo what extent enthusiasm for biosimilars might wane is unclear.\n\nTo date, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved just two biosimilars. Last year, the agency endorsed Zarxio, which is sold by Sandoz, for boosting white blood cell counts in chemotherapy patients. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a version of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Remicade for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other ailments. It will be marketed by Pfizer and Celltrion.\n\nAlthough the donut hole will be phased out by 2020, many more biosimilars are expected in the meantime. Last year, companies submitted marketing applications for seven more, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. And while demand will depend on a specific medicine, Pearson noted that Medicare generally accounts for a large portion of the market for many drugs.\n\nThe problem could be solved if drug makers are required to offer the same discounts for the donut hole on biosimilars, as well. Avalere estimates this would reduce federal spending by $800 million over a decade, although this would obviously increase costs for drug makers.\n\nAlternatively, Medicare could create a new tier, or level that determines the portion of drug costs paid by beneficiaries. This might reduce Medicare beneficiary costs for biosimilars below what they would pay for brand-name biologics, although federal spending would rise by $300 million over 10 years.\n\nThe landscape is complicated, though, because some brand-name drug makers, such as Pfizer and Merck, are also developing biosimilars.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got companies on both sides of the issue,\u201d said Pearson. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from some biosimilars manufacturers that they wanted to voluntarily close the coverage gap, but they can\u2019t do so because that would be considered a violation of the antikickback law \u2026 But it\u2019s hard to imagine this it won\u2019t get fixed (by Congress), given this has set up backwards incentive in the Medicare program.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Biosimilars Forum, an industry trade group, wrote us that it \u201ccontinues to be concerned about the impact of the CMS Part D policy on patient access to biosimilars that can bring cost-savings to the market. The Avalere report highlights this concern and illustrates the continued need for the reimbursement framework developed by CMS to support appropriate patient access to biosimilars.\u201d\n\nWe should note that the Pearson also explained that the Avalere analysis was limited to the Medicare Part D program, because that is the only place that has higher consumer costs for biosimilars. Under Medicare Part B, some injectable or infused drugs are administered by physicians.\n\nIn terms of cost, most Part B beneficiaries have supplemental coverage that reduces or eliminates any cost-sharing, Pearson noted. For those who do not, they pay 20 percent of the cost of the drug, which means patient costs are lower if the biosimilar is priced lower than the brand-name biologic.\n\nThis post was updated to include a comment from the Biosimilars Forum.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "biologics, drug prices, medicare", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "Some Medicare Part D beneficiaries may have to pay more for biosimilars than for brand-name biologics, an unintended consequence of Obamacare, a study finds.", "title": "Unintended twist in Obamacare may cost some Medicare patients more for biosimilars", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dollars-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-04-19T09:29:50-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/04/18/medicare-drug-prices-biologics/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "Some Medicare Part D beneficiaries may have to pay more for biosimilars than for brand-name biologics, an unintended consequence of Obamacare, a study finds.", "title": "Unintended twist in Obamacare may cost some Medicare patients more for biosimilars", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dollars-1024x576.jpg", "creator": "@Pharmalot", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Money", "tag": "Medicare", "published_time": "2016-04-18T16:04:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T09:29:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Alternatively, Medicare could create a new tier, or level that determines the portion of drug costs paid by beneficiaries.\nThe landscape is complicated, though, because some brand-name drug makers, such as Pfizer and Merck, are also developing biosimilars.\nThis might reduce Medicare beneficiary costs for biosimilars below what they would pay for brand-name biologics, although federal spending would rise by $300 million over 10 years.\nHowever, the law does not require companies to provide discounts for biosimilars, which are lower-cost and nearly identical versions.\nAn \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the Affordable Care Act may mean that Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay more for biosimilars than for costlier brand-name biologics, according to a new analysis released last week."}
