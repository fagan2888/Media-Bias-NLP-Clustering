Most can receive subsidies to help them afford their plans.\n\nLogan Green, the CEO of Lyft, called ObamaCare \u201cthe right kind of mobile benefit for people seeking flexibility as well as affordable coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to help spread the news about the ACA to drivers, so those who need it can best plan for their future,\u201d Green said in a statement.\n\nObamaCare has been a boon to companies with nontraditional workforces like Lyft, even as other businesses sharply criticize new rules that require them to offer healthcare to all employees who work more than 30 hours a week.\n\nLyft\u2019s biggest competitor in the ride-hailing business, Uber, has also publicly touted the benefits of ObamaCare for its workers.\n\nLast year, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said a shake-up of the traditional employer healthcare system was \u201chuge\u201d for companies like his.\n\n\u201cThe democratization of those types of benefits allow people to have more flexible ways to make a living,\u201d Kalanick told reporters in 2014. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be working for The Man.\u201d\n\nHealth officials are ramping up their outreach ahead of this weekend\u2019s deadline, when ObamaCare will end its third open enrollment season.\n\nSo far, about 8.9 million people have signed up through the federal exchange \u2014 higher than last year\u2019s figure of 7.7 million at the same time.\n\nNationally, more than 11.6 million have signed up \u2014 a number that puts the administration ahead of its goal for the year, though there may still be individuals who drop their coverage before paying.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all feeling good about where we are. No one\u2019s running a victory lap, but we\u2019re feeling good,\u201d Kevin Counihan, CEO of HealthCare.gov, told reporters Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lyft\u2019s biggest competitor, Uber, has also publicly touted the benefits of ObamaCare.", "description": "Lyft\u2019s biggest competitor, Uber, has also publicly touted the benefits of ObamaCare.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lyft\u2019s biggest competitor, Uber, has also publicly touted the benefits of ObamaCare.", "title": "White House taps Lyft for ObamaCare outreach", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267367-white-house-taps-car-share-company-lyft-for-obamacare-outreach", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/lyft_111315getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267367-white-house-taps-car-share-company-lyft-for-obamacare-outreach", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-28T14:41-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-28T14:41:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267367-white-house-taps-car-share-company-lyft-for-obamacare-outreach", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lyft\u2019s biggest competitor, Uber, has also publicly touted the benefits of ObamaCare.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House taps Lyft for ObamaCare outreach"}, "dcterms.title": "White House taps Lyft for ObamaCare outreach"}, "article_summary": "Lyft drivers are considered private contractors, rather than full-time employees, which means Lyft is not legally required to offer them health insurance under ObamaCare.\nThe Obama administration is partnering with Lyft as it looks to boost healthcare coverage among part-time workers, like the company\u2019s drivers-for-hire.\n\u201cWe want the millions of Americans working as freelance professionals to know that quality, affordable health coverage is available,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell wrote in a statement Thursday.\nLyft\u2019s biggest competitor in the ride-hailing business, Uber, has also publicly touted the benefits of ObamaCare for its workers.\nADVERTISEMENTAdministration officials have been ramping up outreach with 72 hours left ahead of this year's deadline."}
