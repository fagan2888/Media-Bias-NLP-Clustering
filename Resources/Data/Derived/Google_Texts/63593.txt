A woman who was killed in a three-vehicle crash that closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 4 for several hours Saturday was fleeing after being involved in another crash in the westbound lanes, deputies said.

Rita Bata Beaulieu, 54, of Celebration, was driving a 2014 Jeep Wrangler west on I-4 east of County Road 557 about 7 p.m. when she crashed into another vehicle, according to a report from the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. Beaulieu fled the scene and was seen crossing the I-4 median and entering eastbound traffic, deputies said.

She hit the driver’s side of a 2008 Mercedes, driven by Nawar Badeea Jaafar Blaibel, of Tampa, who had an adult and three small children between 1 and 4 in his vehicle, deputies said.

The collision caused Beaulieu’s Jeep to rotate and flip. As it was airborne it hit a 2012 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, driven by Ricky Lyle Rice, 56, of Jacksonville, according to the report.

The bottom of the Jeep struck the front of the pickup, leaving an impression of the complete tire tread horizontally across the front of the truck, deputies said. The pickup, which was towing a trailer with two motorcycles, spun across several lanes of traffic.

The Jeep continued tumbling across multiple lanes. The force of the impacts caused the frame to break in half from the driver’s side to the passenger side, deputies said. The driver’s seat broke and Beaulieu, who was wearing a seat belt, was ejected. She was found laying face down on the north side of the eastbound lanes and died at the scene, deputies said.

A 2014 Jeep Liberty, driven by Angel Luis Valentin, of Tampa, was struck by debris, damaging the vehicle.

Rice was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center were he was listed in critical condition. Blaibel and the three children were also taken to LRMC, where they were treated and released.

Valentin and his passenger were uninjured.

No one had been charged though the investigation is ongoing, deputies said.
