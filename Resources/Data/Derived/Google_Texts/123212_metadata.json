The talk show host was inspired by young cancer patient Braylon Beam, a 6-year-old from North Carolina who is fighting cancer and appeared on her show, and dancing. Hoping to start a fundraising movement like the popular ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, DeGeneres challenged people to upload #Just Keep Dancing videos.\n\nThe Maui dance challenge video will be uploaded online this week, organizers said. Maui dancers included Maui 4-H Livestock youths, families and Upcountry paniolo who grooved to both \u201cCha Cha Slide\u201d and \u201cElectric Slide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only gave them a one-week notice that we were going to do this, and people actually showed up and danced,\u201d organizer Kristy Stone said, adding that she was \u201cvery happy\u201d with Sunday\u2019s turnout.\n\nThe event even featured a guest appearance by Darren Lee as Elvis, who risked getting dust on his white suit to dance in the arena among the crowd.\n\nThe video might have been made for Dukes, but organizers wanted to bring awareness to cancer that affects nearly 40 children (younger than 15) in Hawaii per year, according to statistics compiled by the National Cancer Institute. About four children in Maui County are diagnosed with cancer every year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many families being affected now by cancer, and especially pediatric cancer,\u201d said organizer Shannie Akau. \u201cBut we\u2019re just glad to be able to do our part, we\u2019re just three mommies that came together to do this,\u201d she said, referencing Kekiwi and Stone.\n\nDuke\u2019s father was on duty as a firefighter at Kihei Fire Station on Sunday and was unable to attend the recording of the dance video, but he said the fact that the community has rallied for his son\u2019s cause was \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really cool, we definitely feel the love, we feel supported, my son has really touched a lot of people and I\u2019m proud of the fight that he\u2019s fighting,\u201d Joshua Dukes said by phone Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been hard moments, awkward moments, but for the most part the community has been so supportive and it brings a smile to my face.\u201d\n\nHe said Trucker was doing well last week after finishing his eighth round of chemotherapy. The boy was able to visit the beach in New York this weekend but is waiting to do another scan in a week and a half to check for signs of remaining cancer cells.\n\nThe last scan that Trucker did after a major surgery revealed signs of chemo-resistant cancer, so the young boy will be undergoing more rounds of chemotherapy while receiving T-cell transfers from his mother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult journey \u2026 a lot of bad news, but we\u2019re continuing to push on,\u201d Joshua Dukes said.\n\nHe hopes his son and wife will be able to return to Maui by December or early next year.\n\nPrayers and signs also were held during the Upcountry fair for Oahu infant Liliaokeawawa Aki Wong, a 2-month-old who is currently being treated in California for a heart defect called Truncus Arteriosus. Akau said much of the profits from sales and donations at the Upcountry fair will go toward the baby\u2019s care.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two-year-old Trucker Dukes might be receiving cancer treatments 5,000 miles away in New York, but his home community wants him to know they're dancing for him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/21/trucker-2-year-old-fighting-cancer-has-got-maui-da/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Two-year-old Trucker Dukes might be receiving cancer treatments 5,000 miles away in New York, but his home community wants him to know they\u2019re dancing for him.", "title": "Trucker, 2-year-old fighting cancer, has got Maui dancing"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two-year-old Trucker Dukes might be receiving cancer treatments 5,000 miles away in New York, but his home community wants him to know they're dancing for him.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Trucker, 2-year-old fighting cancer, has got Maui dancing"}, "Author": "EILEEN CHAO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28c5\"", "article_summary": "WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) - Two-year-old Trucker Dukes might be receiving cancer treatments 5,000 miles away in New York, but his home community wants him to know they\u2019re dancing for him.\nThe talk show host was inspired by young cancer patient Braylon Beam, a 6-year-old from North Carolina who is fighting cancer and appeared on her show, and dancing.\nThe Maui dance challenge video will be uploaded online this week, organizers said.\nMore than 80 people took to the Oskie Rice Arena during the Maui Upcountry 4H Livestock & Ag Fair to dance in support of the Maui boy who was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in November, The Maui News (http://bit.ly/1BkZmTp ) reported Sunday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many families being affected now by cancer, and especially pediatric cancer,\u201d said organizer Shannie Akau."}
