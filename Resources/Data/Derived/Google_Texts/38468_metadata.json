When the ballots were counted, AFP notched up at least one win. It helped defeat a tax hike (from 1.5 to 2.5 percent) in Gahanna, Ohio. But in Coralville, Iowa, the focus of the Times piece, Americans for Prosperity utterly failed to flip the municipal elections. Democrats held on to the mayor's office and swept the City Council races.\n\nHere's what happens when the New York Times makes your election a case study in Koch power.\n\nShortly after ballots were counted Tuesday, Lundell said he received a surprise phone call from Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cHe indicated that he was very proud of our city, that we took on the Koch brothers and successfully beat them buy such a huge margin,\u201d Lundell said. \u201cThat was another aspect of this election that was unanticipated, that after the polls closed that I\u2019d be speaking to the vice president of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAFP is probably the most business-friendly of the \"Tea Party\" groups, a sprawling organization with a state chapters structure that's good at beating ballot measures or electing deregulators. But last night, during a time of turmoil for \"Obamacare\" and horrible poll numbers for the president, did not go well for the few conservative hardliners who stuck their necks out.\n\n- In Troy, Mich., a Tea Party mayor who'd been recalled earlier in 2013 ran for City Council and lost.\n\n- A ballot measure in 11 Colorado counties, which would have started them on the (likely blocked) path to secession, was set to fail in six of them, ending the tantrum.\n\n- Most famously (and it wasn't even that famous!), the Republican primary for Alabama's open 1st Congressional District was won by former state Sen. Bradley Byrne, a perfectly right-wing former Democrat, over the woefully unqualified but Mark Levin/Roy Moore-endorsed Dean Young.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "A fun, A1 pre-election New York Times story followed David Koch's Americans for Prosperity as it dispatched volunteers (and psyched up local organizers ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "A fun, A1 pre-election New York Times story followed David Koch's Americans for Prosperity as it dispatched volunteers (and psyched up local organizers ...", "title": "David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/11/06/david_koch_s_americans_for_prosperity_loses_an_election_in_iowa.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/etc/designs/slate/images/slate_facebook_icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A fun, A1 pre-election New York Times story followed David Koch's Americans for Prosperity as it dispatched volunteers (and psyched up local organizers ...", "title": "David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/11/06/david_koch_s_americans_for_prosperity_loses_an_election_in_iowa.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/etc/designs/slate/images/slate_facebook_icon.png", "creator": "@daveweigel", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-06T11:09:24Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa", "sailthru.headline": "David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"David Koch\\u0027s Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/11/06/david_koch_s_americans_for_prosperity_loses_an_election_in_iowa.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"200131106002\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-06T11:09:24Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"David Weigel\",\n  \"tags\": []\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "David Koch's Americans for Prosperity Loses an Election in Iowa", "keywords": "david koch, americans for prosperity", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "david koch, americans for prosperity", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://facebook.com/daveweigel"}, "sailthru.description": "A fun, A1 pre-election New York Times story followed David Koch's Americans for Prosperity as it dispatched volunteers (and psyched up local organizers ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/etc/designs/slate/images/slate_facebook_icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc460\"", "article_summary": "Here's what happens when the New York Times makes your election a case study in Koch power.\nShortly after ballots were counted Tuesday, Lundell said he received a surprise phone call from Vice President Joe Biden.\nBut in Coralville, Iowa, the focus of the Times piece, Americans for Prosperity utterly failed to flip the municipal elections.\n\u201cThat was another aspect of this election that was unanticipated, that after the polls closed that I\u2019d be speaking to the vice president of the United States.\"\nA fun, A1 pre-election New York Times story followed David Koch's Americans for Prosperity as it dispatched volunteers (and psyched up local organizers) to win small victories that the national media wasn't paying attention to."}
