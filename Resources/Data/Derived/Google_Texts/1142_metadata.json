Charles Murray, CEO and chairman of Sarasota-based PPi Technologies Group, recently had to make what he called a \u201chorrific decision.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurray said the anticipated financial burdens of the Affordable Care Act led him to cut new Sarasota hires by half and scrap plans to expand his business in the U.S., in favor of new ventures in Guyana and Tobago.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a proud American,\u201d said Murray, whose international export company recently purchased a $3.75 million, 81,000-square-foot building on Northgate Boulevard in Sarasota as a manufacturing plant and headquarters. \u201cWe were looking to double our U.S. employees. But, now, we\u2019re going out of country to build our business. It makes absolutely no sense to burden everyone in the company for the health-care costs of new U.S. employees.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith health-insurance exchanges, the lynchpin of the federal health bill, set to open Oct. 1, and the employer mandate scheduled for 2015, some area businesses like Murray\u2019s are hiring fewer workers and limiting, or even eliminating, health-care benefits they already voluntarily provide for their employees \u2014 all in anticipation of higher insurance premiums and new taxes accompanying the health-law\u2019s debut.\n\n\n\nCost hikes hurt\n\n\n\nInsurance industry experts report that the health-care exchanges, a key portion of the ACA set to take effect Oct. 1, will significantly increase the cost of health-insurance premiums. These price increases will vary from state to state, with health-care experts estimating Florida\u2019s average insurance premiums will increase by around 17% under the new law.\n\n\n\nSome area businesses report that insurance providers are estimating a potential 20% to 30% hike in premiums across the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are numerous fees and costs associated with the law that will simply be passed on to the consumer,\u201d said Kathleen Hargreaves, a certified public accountant and head of Sarasota-based KB Healthcare Consultants.\n\n\n\nMurray said the cost of maintaining the current level of coverage he offers employees is projected to increase by about 25% under the new law.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t increase my prices even 10% and be competitive,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why they want to burden us with these new costs. The law was obviously written by people who have never been in business.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast year, Gov. Rick Scott rejected the option to set up a state-based online health-insurance exchange, citing cost concerns, paving the way for a federal government insurance marketplace where Florida residents and small businesses can buy insurance and learn if they qualify for federal subsidies.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the ACA claim that insurance premiums have been on the rise for decades, and the new health law has been become a scapegoat for a pre-existing problem.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently reported that health-care premiums are increasing at the slowest pace in years.\n\n\n\nMedical prices, however, are also increasing at their slowest pace in a half-century, according to Commerce Department data; a trend that helps curb rising insurance rates, but also indicates that cost burdens are shifting to patients.\n\nToo much of a good thing\n\nThe employer mandate, which is set to take effect in 2015 following a one-year delay in its implementation by the Obama Administration, requires businesses with more than 50 full-time employees (full-time is defined as a 30-hour work week) to provide health insurance for its workers.\n\n\n\nThe problem with the employer mandate, some area business owners claim, is that it penalizes employers who voluntarily provide high-cost plans exceeding the minimum standard required by law.\n\n\n\nJohn Saputo, CEO and president of Gold Coast Eagle Distributing, said he already voluntarily provides health-care benefits to his 165 employees beyond what would be required under the ACA, and he anticipates to be hit by the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d provision of the health-care law.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe travesty is that I\u2019m going to get an added tax because I\u2019m providing such a good program to my employees,\u201d Saputo said. \u201cMy people are worth it, and that\u2019s why I pay extra for them. But I don\u2019t see why my employees have to pay more for other people\u2019s insurance.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder the law, health-care plans with premiums that exceed the \u201chigh-cost threshold,\u201d more than $10,200 for individuals and more than $27,500 for families, will face a 40% \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on the overage. The intent of the tax, according to federal lawmakers, is to fund coverage for the uninsured and to discourage the overuse of medical care, which some politicians claim stems from overly generous health-care plans.\n\n\n\nOpponents of the tax argue that high-cost premiums do not always indicate higher levels of care or decreased deductibles, because other factors such as age and health conditions can raise rates.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cCadillac tax\u201d affects insurance companies, but employers like Saputo, who self-insure their employees\u2019 health care (an estimated 50% of employees are currently self-insured by their employer), will also pay the 40% tax.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a slap in the face to an employer who wants to take care of his people with a really good plan,\u201d Saputo said. \u201cAnd where do they think that money is coming from? It means I hire fewer people and invest less capital in growing my business.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough the tax doesn\u2019t take effect until 2018, a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that the tax burden will be passed on to employers in the form of higher premiums years in advance.\n\nCatch-22\n\nThe new health bill leaves business owners such as Murray and Saputo with two options to manage the law\u2019s financial burdens: Either downgrade the level of benefits they offer their employees, or hire fewer workers to limit the costs and associated fees of insuring new workers.\n\n\n\nSaputo said he is not willing to budge on the quality of benefits he offers, so he will hire fewer employees and offer more overtime to offset the financial burdens of the new law.\n\n\n\n\u201cI used to be very free with my hiring; I would normally bring people on before I needed them,\u201d Saputo said, referring to the effects of the ACA on his hiring practices. \u201cAnd, now, what I\u2019m doing is I don\u2019t hire someone until I absolutely need them. It\u2019s going to be so expensive to put on new employees that I\u2019m very hesitant to hire people.\u201d\n\n\n\nPPi Technologies purchased its new Sarasota facility to increase production of pouched beverages, including alcohol.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat building will be the largest contract packaging center for alcohol in the United States,\u201d Murray said in a recent Business Observer story. \u201cIt will be capable of producing 1 billion pouch units a year.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurray initially wanted to hire about 30 new employees for his expanded Sarasota operations, but plans to cap his new hires to about 10 to 15 to stay below the employer mandate\u2019s 50-employee threshold. Murray also said that insurance premium hikes will force him to downgrade the health plans he currently provides in favor of more affordable options.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now my employees are receiving top-class health care,\u201d said Murray, who voluntarily provides health-care benefits to his employees. \u201cBut, once this new system comes in, there is no way I can keep doing this. It will cost us thousands more.\u201d\n\n\n\nHealth-care experts worry that the increase in premiums, due to the health law\u2019s rollout, will give larger corporations that can more easily bear the increased prices a competitive advantage in vying for new employees over smaller, more cash-strapped enterprises.\n\n\n\nBut larger corporations are also bracing for higher premiums and uncertainty surrounding the law. Two national corporations with footprints in Sarasota County moved to ditch traditional health-insurance plans in favor of sending employees to the exchanges.\n\n\n\nThe drugstore giant Walgreen\u2019s Co. announced last week that it would be offering eligible employees, comprising about 160,000 personnel, payments to shop for health insurance in the private health-insurance marketplaces. Trader Joe\u2019s, a national supermarket chain, also recently announced that it would no longer cover part-time employees, but would offer them a $500 stipend to purchase insurance on their own.\n\nThe only certainty is uncertainty\n\n\u201cCongress went global and now it\u2019s trying to fill in the details,\u201d Hargreaves said, referring to the creation of the ACA. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty and, now, that\u2019s all we\u2019re left with \u2014 uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther area business-owners who have not yet taken concrete steps to brace for the impact of the ACA, said that the complexity of the health law and the partisan political debate surrounding it have created an environment of uncertainty that makes it hard to diagnose the impact on payrolls and budgets.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get the facts about what\u2019s really going on,\u201d said Marc Grimaud, owner of Caf\u00e9 Gabbiano on Siesta Key. \u201cJust getting a straight answer on how the plan is going to play out and what we\u2019ll have to pay is completely skewed based on the political leanings of who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNobody has any idea what the effects of this are going to be,\u201d Sarasota City Commissioner and restaurant owner Paul Caragiulo said, referring to the new health law. \u201cIt will fundamentally change the system, and no one can predict what will happen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know now what our options will be until everything is figured out,\u201d said Jordan Letschert, co-owner of Crunch Gym on Bee Ridge Road. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked into what the new law will mean for us, but the quotes are too widely scattered for us to make a good decision.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey conducted this year, 71% of small businesses report the new health law will make it harder to grow their businesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazingly complex piece of legislation,\u201d Hargreaves said. \u201cThe devil\u2019s in the details, and we don\u2019t have the details.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking little businesses like ours to pay huge sums of cash that we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Murray said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just the financial impact that hurts, but the impact this will have on my people and their families. They\u2019re horrified.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaputo, a retired Marine Corps colonel, said concerns about diminished benefits for his employees trump the potential damage to his business\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\n\n\u201cI could give them Obamacare, but I wouldn\u2019t do that to my employees,\u201d Saputo said, referring to insurance plans available through the federal exchanges. \u201cThey\u2019re working hard, and they deserve to not worry about losing their shirt if they get sick. It\u2019s like being an officer in the Marine Corps; it\u2019s just like taking care of my troops.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bracing for the uncertain side effects of the Affordable Care Act, area business owners are hiring less and re-evaluating the benefits they offer.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Your Observer", "description": "Bracing for the uncertain side effects of the Affordable Care Act, area business owners are hiring less and re-evaluating the benefits they offer.", "title": "Unaffordable Uncertainty: Affordable Care Act | Sarasota | Your Observer", "url": "http://www.yourobserver.com/article/unaffordable-uncertainty-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://www.yourobserver.com/sites/default/files/photo-1-29362-20130925221316.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-18T16:37:05-05:00", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-25T22:13:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T16:37:05-05:00"}, "google-site-verification": "W5qEe1V8ciPqgo7dPyNIXQ-wHbIW1dBCGQ-dzCLvNgQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc941d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRight now my employees are receiving top-class health care,\u201d said Murray, who voluntarily provides health-care benefits to his employees.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently reported that health-care premiums are increasing at the slowest pace in years.\nArea businesses report that the upcoming rollout of key measures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be a bitter pill to swallow for their bottom lines.\n\u201cI could give them Obamacare, but I wouldn\u2019t do that to my employees,\u201d Saputo said, referring to insurance plans available through the federal exchanges.\n\u201cThe travesty is that I\u2019m going to get an added tax because I\u2019m providing such a good program to my employees,\u201d Saputo said."}
