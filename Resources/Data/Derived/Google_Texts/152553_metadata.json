And New!\n\nRobbie Lawler is the new UFC welterweight champion, picking up a split decision win over Johny Hendricks in the main event of UFC 181 to claim the title.\n\nAs much as everyone is aware of the Cinderella story it has been since he\u2019s returned to the Octagon, some people don\u2019t truly appreciate the scope of Lawler\u2019s comeback. This is a guy who stopped sparring for six years, looked completely disinterested in the sport at times during his Strikeforce tenure and was beaten rather handily by guys like Renato \u201cBabalu\u201d Sobral, Tim Kennedy and Lorenz Larkin. Now he\u2019s the best welterweight in the world.\n\nMake no mistake about it \u2013 Lawler\u2019s resurgence is real. He been a beast since moving to American Top Team and returning to the 170-pound ranks and seeing him fulfill his destiny more than a decade after his first UFC run came to an end truly is the stuff Hollywood movies are made of.\n\n2. Not Sure How 49-46 Lawler Happened\n\nMMA scoring/judging has been an issue for a long, long time, but it reared its ugly head again in the main event, as Lawler picked up an inexplicable 49-46 score from judge Glenn Trowbridge. As he saw it, Hendricks won only the middle stanza of the five-round affair.\n\nWatching the bout back not once, not twice, but thrice, 49-46 Lawler doesn\u2019t make sense. You could make an easier case for 49-46 Hendricks than you can 49-46 Lawler unless we throw out all the precedent that has been set in the history of scoring fights. Sadly, that seems to happen far too often.\n\nThis is a subject that can\u2019t be covered in the restricted confines of this column (not properly, at least), so expect a larger discussion soon. What has to be said, however, is that there needs to be some serious reforms and adjustments made in MMA scoring to get everyone on the same page \u2013 or as close to being on the same page as possible \u2013 because going to the scorecards really is becoming a crap shoot and that should not be the case.\n\n3. Rory MacDonald Might Have to Wait\n\nAs much as the UFC \u201cpromised\u201d Canadian welterweight standout Rory MacDonald that he would face the winner of Saturday\u2019s main event, he might have to wait out a third bout between Hendricks and Lawler or fight once more to keep his place in line.\n\nWith each man having won a close, hard-fought battle, putting together a trilogy fight makes a lot of sense, and that\u2019s coming from the guy who dislikes when the UFC rushes rematches to the Octagon. This is different though.\n\nThese two have now gone 10 rounds in the Octagon and you could easily argue that they\u2019ve split those frames down the middle. At the absolute most, one man has a 6-4 advantage and given how tight these two bouts have been, running it back for a third time to put a cap on things now might be the right call.\n\nThat sucks for MacDonald, but with a championship rematch scheduled and this very outcome easily predicted, \u201cguaranteeing\u201d him the title shot after his win over Tarec Saffiedine in October seemed hasty to begin with.\n\n4. \u201cShowtime\u201d Retains\n\nGilbert Melendez was fighting the perfect fight against Anthony Pettis \u2013 pressing forward, clinching, forcing the lightweight champ to be defensive. When they disengaged, \u201cEl Nino\u201d was landing winging shots, dealing with Pettis\u2019 returning fire without flinching.\n\nBut then 90 seconds into the second round, Pettis connected with a stiff right hand that staggered Melendez and when the former Strikeforce champion opted to try for a takedown, \u201cShowtime\u201d connected his hands on a deep guillotine choke, rolled through it into mount and forced Melendez to tap. Just like that, the UFC lightweight champion had retained his title and made a statement in one fell swoop.\n\nPettis is the ultimate opportunist, capable of exploiting any and ever opening that is presented to him. Sometimes, he makes his own chances appear, pressing the action and forcing the opposition to make mistakes. Other times, like Saturday night, he simply takes what he\u2019s given and still finds a way to secure the finish.\n\nThat kind of talent \u2013 and it is, indeed, a talent \u2013 isn\u2019t something you can teach. Pettis\u2019 tremendous natural abilities and keen Fight IQ make him stand out amongst the pack and helped him secure his first title defence on Saturday. Now the question is whether or not more will follow?\n\n5. Clearly Defined Heavyweight Tiers\n\nCain Velasquez stands alone atop the division. For the present time, new interim champ Fabricio Werdum has a tier to himself as well, though Junior dos Santos or Stipe Miocic could join him with a win next weekend. Travis Browne isn\u2019t far off from that level either.\n\nBrendan Schaub isn\u2019t going to be joining that class any time soon, as Browne dispatched of him in relatively quick and easy fashion Saturday night, shrugging off every takedown attempt \u201cBig Brown\u201d offered before clipping him with a right uppercut and finishing him with unanswered strikes from back mount.\n\nThe middle fight in the UFC 181 fight card illustrated the clear striation that exists in the heavyweight ranks. Browne, though not quite a championship-level talent, is definitely a notch or two above Schaub, who well ahead of the middle-to-lower tier talents that fill out the ranks. We see this kind of delineation in every division, but it really stands out in the heavyweight division, where the ranks are shallow and the options are limited.\n\nBrowne looked very good against Schaub, but he\u2019s looked very good in these spots before. The key for the massive Hawaiian is to maintain that kind of success when he takes his next step up the ladder and stands in the Octagon with another fighter in the upper echelon of the heavyweight division.\n\n6. Todd Duffee: Still a Prospect to Watch\n\nAll it took was 33 seconds. Well, technically, it took 707 days and 33 seconds, but Saturday night at UFC 181, Todd Duffee reminded everyone that he is still very much a prospect worth watching in the UFC heavyweight division.\n\nAfter nearly two years away from action due his struggles with Parsonage-Turner Syndrome, Duffee stepped back into the Octagon against Anthony Hamilton and promptly laid out the Team Jackson-Winkeljohn fighter with a right hand to the temple. Quick, pinpoint and powerful, that one shot is all it took to finish the contest and cement the once-hyped physical specimen as a fighter to keep tabs on in 2015.\n\nGiven the dearth of fresh blood in the division and the decline shown by several of the established names in the weight class, Duffee has the potential to rise up the ranks rather quickly, provided he remains healthy and able to compete.\n\n7. TUF Winner Tony Ferguson Keeps Rolling\n\nBeware UFC lightweights, \u201cEl Cucuy\u201d is coming for you!\n\nAfter missing 17 months following his loss to Michael Johnson, Ferguson has returned to rattle off four consecutive victories, adding another win to his run of success Saturday night in Las Vegas by submitting Abel Trujillo in the second round. It was his third finish in those four fights and another showcase of the well-rounded skill set he brings to the cage.\n\nTrujillo landed with some power in the first and looked to have Ferguson in danger, but the 30-year-old California native steadied himself and went on the offensive to close out the frame as his opponent began to tire. That pattern continued in the second, as Ferguson dragged Trujillo to the canvas rather easily, softened him up with ground and pound and eventually locked up a rear naked choke.\n\nRangy with solid wrestling and underrated grappling, Ferguson is now on the cusp of being a contender in the loaded lightweight division. At the very least, he should find himself facing a Top 15 talent when he looks for his fifth straight win once 2015 commences.\n\n8. One Night, Two Bulldog Chokes\n\nThere might not have been two bulldog choke finishes in the UFC over the last 10 years. Niklas Backstrom had one earlier this year fighting in Germany, and the only other one I can recall is Carlos Newton using it to win the welterweight title against Pat Miletich way back at UFC 31.\n\nSaturday night, both Urijah Faber and Raquel Pennington used a version of the choke to pick up victories at UFC 181, Faber against Francisco Rivera and Pennington against late replacement Ashlee Evans-Smith. Faber\u2019s finish came following an inadvertent eye poke, while Pennington\u2019s put Evans-Smith to sleep as the horn sounded to signal the end of the first round.\n\nWhile not a hold that has been frequently seen in the Octagon, it\u2019s one that could become more prevalent going forward as the opportunity to cinch up the choke presents itself fairly often. Fighters have learned not to leave their necks out when shooting in for takedowns, but they don\u2019t often worry about it when the opposition is working to take their back from either side.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if you see a few more of these types of finishes in the future.\n\n9. CM Punk, UFC Fighter\n\nFollowing Tony Ferguson\u2019s win over Abel Trujillo, the pay-per-view broadcast shifted to a stand-up cageside interview between Joe Rogan and former WWE champion CM Punk, where it was announced that \u201cThe Straight Edge Superstar\u201d had signed a contract with the UFC.\n\nFrom an attraction standpoint, bringing in a major name in professional wrestling like Punk will bring tons of new eyeballs to the UFC. Maybe not as many as when Brock Lesnar transitioned from the squared circle to the Octagon, but a solid number, for sure.\n\nFrom a \u201cfighters with UFC contracts\u201d standpoint, it\u2019s hard to understand how 36-year-old Phil Brooks, former professional wrestler with zero fights to his credit and limited training, is on the roster, but unbeaten welterweight and former NCAA and Olympic wrestler Ben Askren is not.\n\nThese are the signings that are hard to take for purists and anyone that wants to see the sport recognized as more than just a spectacle or carnival act. Yes, Punk has profile and will bring more dollars to the table than any other first-time fighter in UFC history, but he has zero professional combat sports experience. A fighter with that kind of resume and advanced age would normally debut in a Fight Pass prelim, but Punk will be a main card fixture from Jump Street and that\u2019s hard rationalize.\n\n10. Instant Punk Effect\n\nThe impact of Punk\u2019s arrival is already being felt. Coming off an event with two championship fights, both of which stood out in their own ways, and three more finishes on the main card, the biggest story coming out of UFC 181 is the arrival of \u201cThe Second City Saint.\u201d\n\nThe UFC is happy because its dominating the headlines (and Google searches and Twitter) conversations today, but the focus should be on the fighters that turned in strong performances Saturday night in Las Vegas, not the former professional wrestler who has yet to set foot in the Octagon.\n\nFoxSports.com, the online arm of the UFC\u2019s broadcast partners, FOX Sports, has a story suggesting that former Mighty Morphin Power Ranger Jason David Frank wants to fight Punk in his UFC debut. Frank is 41-years-old, went 3-0 as an amateur and picked up a 46-second submission win in his lone pro bout four years ago.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether or not that specific fight will happen, but the fact that a former Power Ranger facing a former professional wrestler inside the UFC cage in 2015 is even being discussed as a real thing while proven, talented professional fighters can\u2019t get a sniff of coverage is a complicated reality to wrap your head around.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Province", "generator": "WordPress.com", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Vancouver Province", "fb": {"app_id": 135455519931679}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "keywords": "keyboard kimura, 10 things, 10 things we learned, 10 things we learned last night, abel trujillo, anthony pettis, brendan schaub, cm punk, gilbert melendez, johny hendricks, martial arts, mixed martial arts, raquel pennington, robbie lawler, rory macdonald, sports, todd duffee, travis browne, ufc, ufc 181, ufc recap, ufc recaps, ufc review, ufc reviews, ultimate fighting championship, urijah faber", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://blogs.theprovince.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "description": "From Robbie Lawler and Anthony Pettis to Travis Browne and CM Punk, UFC 181 provided plenty to discuss on Saturday night in Las Vegas."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0f9\"", "article_summary": "Robbie Lawler is the new UFC welterweight champion, picking up a split decision win over Johny Hendricks in the main event of UFC 181 to claim the title.\nThe middle fight in the UFC 181 fight card illustrated the clear striation that exists in the heavyweight ranks.\nWell, technically, it took 707 days and 33 seconds, but Saturday night at UFC 181, Todd Duffee reminded everyone that he is still very much a prospect worth watching in the UFC heavyweight division.\nOne Night, Two Bulldog ChokesThere might not have been two bulldog choke finishes in the UFC over the last 10 years.\nFoxSports.com, the online arm of the UFC\u2019s broadcast partners, FOX Sports, has a story suggesting that former Mighty Morphin Power Ranger Jason David Frank wants to fight Punk in his UFC debut."}
