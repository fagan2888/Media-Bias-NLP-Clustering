Mark Meadows (R-NC) that would cost Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) the Speakership of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFiorina said it\u2019s time for Boehner\u2014and his counterpart on the other side of Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2014to produce results, or they should lose their jobs. Fiorina told Breitbart News:\n\nI\u2019m frustrated. People worked incredibly hard\u2013tens of thousands of activists across the country spent their time, energy, and money to win this historic majority in the House and a majority in the Senate. Change was promised, but people don\u2019t see that change. Instead, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act still hasn\u2019t passed Congress, even though it\u2019s the right thing to do and even the politically smart thing to do. It\u2019s a leader\u2019s job to produce results. The leadership in the Senate and the House need to produce results\u2026 or they need to step aside.\n\n\u201cIf Congressional leaders can\u2019t produce results, they need to step aside,\u201d Fiorina said on the issue of Boehner\u2019s leadership position.\n\nFiorina has surged since emerging as the clear winner in last Thursday\u2019s undercard debate. As a pro-life conservative, Fiorina said she wouldn\u2019t take a government shutdown off the table in order to defund Planned Parenthood and address the abhorrent undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials allegedly selling aborted baby body parts.\n\nFiorina exclusively told Breitbart News:\n\nThese Planned Parenthood videos have horrified Americans across the country\u2013regardless of party affiliation or whether you are pro-life or pro-choice\u2013and the pressure on Congress will be enormous. This is about the moral foundation of this nation. We have to ask every Democrat how can you continue to support taxpayer funding for an organization that decides how to kill a baby to best harvest its organs?\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a political battle,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is about saving lives. We now have a majority in both houses. On this issue, I don\u2019t believe we should take any option off the table.\u201d\n\nNow, Fiorina is open to a defunding battle that could result in a government shutdown with regard to Planned Parenthood. But it\u2019s a decidedly different opinion than what she had back in 2013, when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) used the same tactic to aim to defund Obamacare\u2014something that resulted in a government shutdown at the time.\n\n\u201cEverybody could see this train wreck coming. I actually feel badly for John Boehner. I think this is Ted Cruz and President Obama\u2019s shutdown. I think Ted Cruz\u2019s tactics were wrong,\u201d Fiorina said in an interview in 2013 with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. The interview recently resurfaced on The Right Scoop blog. \u201cThere\u2019s no honor in charging a hill that you know you can\u2019t take, only casualties, although Ted Cruz maybe got name recognition and money along the way. But President Obama wanted this shutdown. And Ted Cruz played right into his hands.\u201d\n\nFiorina also, in that interview, criticized the conservative members of the House GOP conference.\n\n\u201cLook, John Boehner \u2013 the reason I said he has a very difficult task is John Boehner is trying to hold the caucus together,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet there are elements of his caucus that are much more extreme than other elements of the caucus.\u201d\n\nWhile the tactic which may result in a shutdown over an impasse between Congress and the president\u2014defunding\u2014is similar to the 2013 Cruz-Obamacare battle and the current Planned Parenthood fight that\u2019s approaching, the case can be made that the politics are different in the two cases.\n\nIn 2013, there was no GOP majority in the Senate, and the House GOP majority was smaller. Republicans now control both chambers of Congress, so if Republicans can get a bill past a filibuster in the Senate, Republicans can have a battle directly with the executive branch and President Obama. Also, defunding Obamacare\u2014the current president\u2019s signature legislation\u2014is a much more significant undertaking than defunding Planned Parenthood, which could survive without taxpayer subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina: If John Boehner, Mitch McConnell Don\u2019t Produce \u2018They Need to Step Aside\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Carly Fiorina: If John Boehner, Mitch McConnell Don\u2019t Produce \u2018They Need to Step Aside\u2019", "title": "Carly Fiorina Challenges John Boehner, Mitch McConnell", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Carly-Fiorina-L-and-John-Boehner-AP-Photos.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/11/exclusive-carly-fiorina-if-john-boehner-mitch-mcconnell-dont-produce-they-need-to-step-aside/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carly Fiorina: If John Boehner, Mitch McConnell Don\u2019t Produce \u2018They Need to Step Aside\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Carly-Fiorina-L-and-John-Boehner-AP-Photos.jpg", "title": "Carly Fiorina Challenges John Boehner, Mitch McConnell", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, House Leadership, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Planned Parenthood, Senate Leadership,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Carly Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Senate Leadership", "published_time": "2015-08-11T12:44:59-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf Congressional leaders can\u2019t produce results, they need to step aside,\u201d Fiorina said on the issue of Boehner\u2019s leadership position.\nAlso, defunding Obamacare\u2014the current president\u2019s signature legislation\u2014is a much more significant undertaking than defunding Planned Parenthood, which could survive without taxpayer subsidies.\nThe leadership in the Senate and the House need to produce results\u2026 or they need to step aside.\n\u201cLook, John Boehner \u2013 the reason I said he has a very difficult task is John Boehner is trying to hold the caucus together,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s a leader\u2019s job to produce results."}
