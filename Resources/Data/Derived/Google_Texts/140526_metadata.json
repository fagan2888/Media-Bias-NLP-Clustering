First, a few indisputable facts:\n\n1 of 148 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The best editorial cartoons of 2014 (so far) View Photos A collection of cartoons from around the country.

We continue to hope for improved employment numbers, even though we\u2019re now told the jobless rate doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Only about 3 million people have signed up for health insurance through the new marketplaces, well below expectations.\n\nBut, says the White House, things are looking good. Hope wasn\u2019t for nothing. And please keep in mind, the economy isn\u2019t a speedboat. It\u2019s a big ol\u2019 ship that takes time to turn around.\n\nNext: A Congressional Budget Office report issued this month estimates that by 2017, the workforce will be reduced by the equivalent of 2 million full-time jobs and 2.3 million by 2021 \u2014 because of Obamacare.\n\nSome people will quit their jobs because of implicit marginal tax rates that significantly reduce wages and make working not worth it. In other cases, people will quit because their subsidies go down as their income goes up.\n\nWe call this disincentivizing in the real world.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s headline-grabbing news has parted the seas in new ways. Republicans, barely disguising their glee, remind us that they told us so. And this is actually true. Democrats remind us that those 2 million aren\u2019t being forced into unemployment but have the opportunity to choose not to work. No longer will people have to stay in boring, unfulfilling jobs just because they need health insurance.\n\nAs Nancy Pelosi (hereinafter Fairy Godmother) explained to Jon Stewart, one of the goals of Obamacare was to give people \u201clife, a healthier life, liberty, the pursuit of your own happiness.\u201d Stewart replied, \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, if you want to be a writer, if you want to be a comedian, if you want to be a camera person, if you want to start a business . . .\u201d In an earlier iteration, Pelosi even suggested that Obamacare would allow people to quit their awful jobs to write poetry.\n\nWell, bust my buttons! Why didn\u2019t you say that in the first place?\n\nNot quite poetry, but I think it has potential.\n\nFreeing people not to work has never been a national goal that I can recall, though everyone acknowledges the problem of tying insurance to employment. This is why Republicans have argued, belatedly, for portable insurance.\n\nIn the meantime, what the economy needs least is a federal program that prompts lower- and middle-class workers to drop out of the workforce. This is in addition to the many who are losing their jobs involuntarily or having their hours cut by their employers who want to avoid the mandate to buy insurance or the fine for failing to do so.\n\nAgain, this is a simple matter of incentives and survival, which President Obama seems to have recognized in postponing the mandate for midsize businesses until 2016. Or perhaps he is trying to head off another health-care controversy before the midterm elections? Shucks, do you suppose?\n\nAdd to the above the CBO\u2019s report in May that 31 million people will not have health insurance in 2023.\n\nAny one of these things would be bad news. Combined, they boggle the well-ordered mind. If I may invoke our Fairy Godmother again, Pelosi was the most honest of all when she warned us that \u201cWe have to pass the bill [Obamacare] so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nToday, knowing what we know, we are left with what we used to call a million-dollar question, though it is much more expensive now: How does one defend spending $1.2 trillion for a health-care overhaul that disincentivizes people to work and that leaves us with 31 million uninsured?\n\nOne writes poetry.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare\u2019s dreary details around jobs, coverage and costs.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s dreary details around jobs, coverage and costs.", "title": "Kathleen Parker: The poetry of bad news around Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-the-poetry-of-bad-news-around-obamacare/2014/02/14/15aa9b3c-95c5-11e3-8461-8a24c7bf0653_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/14/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Congressional_Inaction_-053ee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-the-poetry-of-bad-news-around-obamacare/2014/02/14/15aa9b3c-95c5-11e3-8461-8a24c7bf0653_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker column, kathleen parker washington post, obamacare costs, obamacare coverage, obamacare jobs, obamacare poetry, obamacare pelosi,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "eomportal-uuid": "15aa9b3c-95c5-11e3-8461-8a24c7bf0653", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker column, kathleen parker washington post, obamacare costs, obamacare coverage, obamacare jobs, obamacare poetry, obamacare pelosi,"}, "article_summary": ".\u201d In an earlier iteration, Pelosi even suggested that Obamacare would allow people to quit their awful jobs to write poetry.\nSome people will quit their jobs because of implicit marginal tax rates that significantly reduce wages and make working not worth it.\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.\nIt is easy these days to imagine that one is living in a fairy tale, albeit a dreary one.\nOnly about 3 million people have signed up for health insurance through the new marketplaces, well below expectations."}
