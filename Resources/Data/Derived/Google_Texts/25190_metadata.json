If you don\u2019t have a spouse to help you out, he adds, \u201cit is really hard to become an expert at marketing, growing, selling, accounting, and all the other aspects of the business.\u201d\n\nBut for Farmer and his life and business partner Tom Hall, and for other Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) farm couples, the legal advantages of marriage often do not apply. For instance, Hall works part-time on the farm and part-time in town at a job with healthcare benefits. But because South Carolina doesn\u2019t recognize their partnership, Farmer can\u2019t share in Hall\u2019s employee medical coverage.\n\nFarmer and Hall are not alone. There may be less outright discrimination against queer folks on farms and in farming communities than existed a few decades ago, but Maya Rupert, Policy Director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), says injustice can occur subtly. \u201cThere absolutely is discrimination happening,\u201d she says. When you\u2019re openly gay in a rural area, she adds, people may be more comfortable ignoring your application for a job or denying you public housing. Since rural areas have fewer advocacy groups focused on LGBT issues, there are fewer places to go for support when those kinds of injuries happen.\n\nEnter the Rural Pride Campaign, a series of day-long summits focused on the LGBT experience in rural America sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the NCLR, and the True Colors Fund.\n\n\u201cPeople assume that if you\u2019re LGBT, you are urban and wealthy,\u201d says Rupert. \u201cBut that just isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nIn fact, almost 10 percent of all same sex couples in the U.S. live in rural areas. And those that do, according to a report by the Williams Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles, are twice as likely to live below the poverty line than same-sex couples in cities. They even tend to have lower incomes than straight rural couples. What\u2019s worse, Rupert says, the city-centered stereotype has meant that rural LGBT Americans aren\u2019t on lawmakers\u2019 radar the way their urban counterparts are.\n\n\u201cWhen people don\u2019t know a community exists, policies don\u2019t exist to protect them,\u201d says Rupert.\n\nThis year, the first Rural Pride summit was held in Greensboro, North Carolina, in early June, with more meetings scheduled across the country over the coming months. Attendees at the town hall-style gatherings have called for protection from employers who seemingly dismiss their applications and federal agencies that might ignore their public housing needs, as well as states that don\u2019t recognize their right to marry. (Twenty one states license same-sex marriage or have legalized it.) Most participants come from counties where farming is a dominant industry, even if they aren\u2019t farmers themselves.\n\nThe Rural Pride Campaign dovetails with a recent amendment to the USDA\u2019s internal code of conduct*, which now prohibits agency employees from discriminating on the basis of gender identity (i.e., how people dress, perceive themselves or otherwise expresses their gender) and political preference. Sexual identity was previously included in the law. While discrimination was generally prohibited by the agency before the amendment, the additional specificity should make it easier for complainants to receive redress.\n\nAll this could make farming and other forms of rural livelihood even more appealing for LGBT folks. Despite the fact that equality is still a work in progress, many summit attendees have said they are proud to be part of their rural communities. Rupert remembers one woman who felt more accepted in her small town than she ever did living in a city. Rural America might be more conservative, but the people who call it home have a sense of unity, too.\n\nConnecticut farmer and filmmaker, Jonah Mossberg interviewed over 30 self-proclaimed queer farmers while making the 2013 documentary Out Here. The men and women he met during the project were often drawn to agriculture outside the city because it gave them a rare sense of freedom.\n\n\u201cSo many queer people struggle to feel good about themselves. But farming makes you feel capable. You can be your freaky self, you can dress weird. As long as you work hard, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Mossberg.\n\nThat said, there is a difference between tolerance and real approval. In the film, one gay farmer describes interacting with non-queer members of his community in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of \u201cDon\u2019t ask, Don\u2019t tell. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about our sexuality. We talk about farming, because that\u2019s something we can all connect to,\u201d he says.\n\nOn a similar note, whenever Jenks Farmer presents to the local Master Gardener Association, he makes sure to show a photo of himself and Hall, standing in a field with their arms around each other.\n\n\u201cI tell people that Tom is my partner, and we have a business, a house, and a farm together. I give them words to understand us,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Rural Pride Campaign wants rural LGBT Americans to realize that they aren\u2019t alone. But the ultimate goal is to move past talk and into substantial policy improvements. The summits are a chance for policymakers to see where progress needs to happen, whether it\u2019s installing an additional bus route so rural LGBTers can travel easily to LGBT-friendly job opportunities or making it easier for rural, transgender residents to apply for subsidized health insurance though Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring rural organizations together with federal policymakers,\u201d says Rupert, who adds that in all policy work the trick isn\u2019t just in writing new laws, but in broadcasting those changes to the public. \u201cThere has been so little outreach around the federal government\u2019s LGBT policies to date. Our goal in partnering with the USDA is to help change that.\u201d\n\nYou can learn more about the Rural Pride Campaign, find a summit near you, or invite NCLR/USDA to host a summit in your town online.\n\n*It\u2019s worth noting that the amendment only covers USDA-conducted programs, like those handling rural housing loans, but does not yet include USDA-assisted programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. NCLR hopes the agency will eventually apply the rule to all of its programs.\n\nAbout the Writer\n\nKristina is a San Francisco-based writer, focused on issues in rural life and agriculture.
