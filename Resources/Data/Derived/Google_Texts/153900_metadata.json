Had the Court found that they did, then the workers would have been entitled to pay under a 1938 Supreme Court ruling that held workers must be paid for time on the job. But, Eidelson notes, workers don\u2019t have to be paid for \u201cpreliminary\u201d or \u201cpostliminary\u201d activities like commuting. Any activity \u201cintegral or indispensable\u201d to a job, however, merits pay under Supreme Court precedent.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Court found that Integrity Staffing Solutions, the Amazon contractor employing the warehouse workers, wasn\u2019t obligated to pay them for the security checks. \u201cIntegrity Staffing did not employ its workers to undergo security screenings,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote. \u201cThe screenings were not an intrinsic element of retrieving products from warehouse shelves or packaging them for shipment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Court holds that time spent in security lines doesn't count as time on the job", "title": "Supreme Court rules against pay for security checks at Amazon warehouses", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Court holds that time spent in security lines doesn't count as time on the job", "title": "Supreme Court rules against pay for security checks at Amazon warehouses", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/supreme_court_rules_against_pay_for_security_checks_at_amazon_warehouses/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/amazon_warehouse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Court holds that time spent in security lines doesn't count as time on the job", "title": "Supreme Court rules against pay for security checks at Amazon warehouses", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/amazon_warehouse.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amazon.com, Bloomberg Businessweek, Clarence Thomas, courts, Elizabeth Warren, Josh Eidelson, Labor, Supreme Court, wages", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, the Court found that Integrity Staffing Solutions, the Amazon contractor employing the warehouse workers, wasn\u2019t obligated to pay them for the security checks.\nAny activity \u201cintegral or indispensable\u201d to a job, however, merits pay under Supreme Court precedent.\n\u201cIntegrity Staffing did not employ its workers to undergo security screenings,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote.\nTopics: Amazon.com, Bloomberg Businessweek, Clarence Thomas, courts, Elizabeth Warren, Josh Eidelson, Labor, Supreme Court, wages, Business News, News, Politics NewsThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Tuesday that workers at Amazon warehouses don\u2019t need to be paid for the time they spend undergoing security screenings before they\u2019re released to go home.\nHad the Court found that they did, then the workers would have been entitled to pay under a 1938 Supreme Court ruling that held workers must be paid for time on the job."}
