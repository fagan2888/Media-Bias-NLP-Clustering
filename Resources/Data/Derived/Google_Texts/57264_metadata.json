You have chosen well.\n\nBoth in choosing Quinnipiac and in choosing a noble career path \u2014 improving lives.\n\nNow that you have chosen well, you need to be prepared to think big. Very big!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTackle the most complex problems. You will create meaningful positive change, but in a complicated environment that is sure to create unintended consequences.\n\nMy career began 45 years ago, shortly after creation of the Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 two \u201cthink big\u201d initiatives, indeed. These programs both created much needed health insurance coverage to the neediest of our population \u2014 the elderly and poor. It marked the beginning of unprecedented expansion and change in our health care delivery system. But there was also an unintended consequence \u2014 an explosion of cost. Hospitals expanded, pharmaceutical companies grew, technology exploded, compensation for healthcare professionals multiplied beyond anyone\u2019s expectations.\n\nFast forward 50 years to the Affordable Care Act (AAC), designed in part to solve a problem thought to have been solved by Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 namely coverage for the uninsured. But the AAC is designed to solve another unintended problem of Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 exponential growth in cost without corresponding improvements in outcomes.\n\nNevertheless, you should still always think big. It allows you to drive massive change benefitting millions of people while at the same time creating entirely new challenges for the next generation to tackle.\n\nMy parents\u2019 generation found a way to free us from the fear of polio \u2014 we young baby boomers were the first to be vaccinated as \u201cpolio pioneers.\u201d We\u2019ve also have made amazing progress in our ability to treat and survive both cancer and AIDS.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn. We look to your generation to continue that progress \u2014 if I were a betting man, I\u2019d wager you will free us from the dread of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I believe your generation can achieve a cure.\n\nSo think big.\n\nWhile thinking big, you also should embrace change. Our health care delivery system needs change and Quinnipiac University is at the forefront, encouraging collaboration and inter-disciplinary teamwork. No one group has the answer but working together you can improve quality, improve outcomes and improve value.\n\nLook at what has happened at Masonicare and throughout senior care, where there is now a full continuum of care for seniors in a place they call home. Home might be an independent living apartment, assisted living or a skilled nursing bed. The center of the universe is no longer the hospital, the physician, the insurance company or malpractice attorney. The center of our universe must be the patient.\n\nYou are the future of our industry, choosing service of others over service of self. If I\u2019ve learned anything it is this \u2014 take care of others and they will take care of you, and success will take care of itself.\n\nAnd while you embrace change, change is embracing you. My baby boomer generation is also graduating today \u2014 every day 10,000 of us graduate to the over-65 class. In 1950 when I was born, we outnumbered the 65-plus population by about 2.5 to one. By 2050, the world will be turned upside down and the boomers will outnumber preschoolers by 2.5 to one.\n\nYour challenge will be to view us as individuals with compassion and caring. We will need your enthusiasm and objectivity. We need you to not give in to ageism. This will indeed be change worth embracing.\n\nFinally today \u2014 care deeply. It will make the difference between having a job and having a career.\n\nI spent almost 20 years working for an acute care delivery system. Patients came and went every three to five days. I\u2019ve spent the last 16 years of my career at Masonicare where our patients and residents measure time with us in months and years.\n\nWhat a great opportunity to get to know people, get to know their life stories, get to know how to add life to their years \u2014 not just years to their life.\n\nThrough my work at Masonicare I\u2019ve gotten to know many of our residents, and, in turn, have gotten to know myself in a way I would have never imagined. Through these relationships I\u2019ve gained a greater appreciation of the supreme importance of caring for one another.\n\nI used to think my job was to improve the financial performance of Masonicare, but getting to know our residents personally changed all that. Our job is to maximize the potential of each and every person, including ourselves. This is what it means for each and every one of us to care deeply.\n\nThe Beatles understood this when they sang, \u201cAnd in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.\u201d\n\nThink big. Embrace change. Care deeply.\n\nThe rest will pretty much take care of itself.\n\nCongratulations. We\u2019re counting on you.\n\nStephen McPherson is CEO of Masonicare in Wallingford, the state\u2019s largest not-for-profit provider of senior services.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Columns, Columns news, New Haven Columns news, CT Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news.", "title": "Forum: Think big, embrace change, care deeply", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/opinion/20160514/forum-think-big-embrace-change-care-deeply", "image": {"width": "1132px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160514/NEWS/160519690/AR/0/AR-160519690.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1500px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Forum: Think big, embrace change, care deeply"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: The following is a condensed version of commencement remarks that were to be made Saturday at Quinnipiac University to students who have completed graduate degrees from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Health S", "title": "Forum: Think big, embrace change, care deeply", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/opinion/20160514/forum-think-big-embrace-change-care-deeply", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160514/NEWS/160519690/AR/0/AR-160519690.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Columns, Columns news, New Haven Columns news, CT Columns news, US Columns news, world Columns news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: The following is a condensed version of commencement remarks that were to be made Saturday at Quinnipiac University to students who have completed graduate degrees from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Health S"}, "article_summary": "And while you embrace change, change is embracing you.\nMy career began 45 years ago, shortly after creation of the Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 two \u201cthink big\u201d initiatives, indeed.\nNow that you have chosen well, you need to be prepared to think big.\nIt marked the beginning of unprecedented expansion and change in our health care delivery system.\nSo think big."}
