Being driven by an OFH official to what was soon to become the Palmer family\u2019s new subdivision, the vehicle passed by flag waving throngs lining the streets.\n\n\u201cI was told we were driving around because we were waiting for board members to show up for the interview,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cBut I did not suspect anything out of the ordinary.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnly when the OFH official announced, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re getting the home,\u201d did Palmer realize he was being granted an OFH custom mortgage free dwelling, Palmer said.\n\n\n\nBuilding homes for wounded veterans across the nation since 2005, OFH is now making a grand entrance into Wisconsin with the building of two side-by-side homes in Cranberry Creek Subdivision in Jackson, thanks to a host of local builders, suppliers, contractors and other community supporters. Latest to join the cause are Sherwin-Williams Paint Company \u2013 Milwaukee District, Water Doctors of Waukesha, Paragon Media Group, LLC in Oconomowoc, Lammscapes! in Jackson and LandMark Engineering Sciences, Inc. in Waukesha.\n\n\u201cIt was surreal. Unbelievable,\u201d Palmer said of \u201cThe Surprise,\u201d one of five \u201cpillar\u201d OFH events. \u201cMy wife, Toniek, and I both started crying tears of joy.\u201d\n\n\n\nTheir happiness was an unbelievable contrast to what the 41 year old father of four had endured since being severely injured while serving in Iraq.\n\n\u201cI only know what happened through what people told me because I blacked out. We were ambushed. I lost a guy that day. My Humvee was blown up with two 500 pound bombs underneath it. But we made it through,\u201d Palmer said.\n\nAs a result of the \u201chorrific incident,\u201d Palmer, of Tomball, Texas, struggles with degenerative disk disease, chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder and other health complications. \u201cI have to take a lot of medicines every day,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nPillar events\n\nFor each home, national OFH works with the builder and other local OFH team members to customize events so it is personalized to their build, said Molly Halliday, OFH vice president of marketing. \u201cFrom a recipient\u2019s point of view, they really don\u2019t know the pillar events have been established until the final step \u2013 the dedication.\u201d\n\nWisconsin pillar events began with \u201cTown Meeting\u201d on May 27, 2015 at Metropolitan Builders Association. OFH vice president of construction Lee Kirgan was introduced before a crowd of nearly 50 building industry representatives. To create awareness for the project, Kirgan provided an overview of OFH\u2019s mission, builds and what is needed from trades and subcontractors \u2013 from products and services to monetary contributions.\n\nNext events are \u201cThe Surprise,\u201d followed by \u201cGroundbreaking Ceremony,\u201d \u201cNotes of Love\u201d and \u201cDedication.\u201d\n\nOFH works with builders and the community to schedule the surprise. Expected local time frame is July or August 2015. \u201c Successful reveal events have ranged from those coordinated around a high traffic public event with media already onsite, such as a concert or professional sports game, to those planned organically such as a combined surprise/groundbreaking at the home site,\u201d Halliday said.\n\n\n\nThe build team meets the family for the first time at the surprise event, which is a pivotal point for the family, said Daniel Vargas, OFH vice president of family matters and community outreach. \u201cYou can actually see the change in the family starting to take place. Their stress and anxiety disappear\u2026 it\u2019s a great way to introduce them to the community while showing America still cares.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a huge part of the family\u2019s healing process. For Travis, it was a total surprise, as well as for his wife. She had become his caretaker and also takes care of the kids. Now, no matter what happens, they are always going to have a roof over their heads.\u201d\n\n\n\nPalmer said, second to a few other days, the surprise was the happiest day in his family\u2019s life.\n\n\n\nNext, OFH works with builders and sponsors to kick off construction with a groundbreaking event. Held at build sites, the event is intended to foster support of the build and family within the local community while also raising awareness for the project, Halliday said. Prominent members of the community are invited to speak. The family then joins all participating organizations in a ceremonial groundbreaking.\n\n\n\nOnce building has commenced prior to sheetrock being placed, all involved in the project are invited to write on studs, or anything to be covered. \u201cWe write notes of appreciation and encouragement for the family, forever wrapping the house in love,\u201d Kirgan said. \u201cIt has become one of our primary ceremonies. Families have come to me after they\u2019ve been in the house and said, \u2018I woke up last night and realized for the first time since I\u2019ve come back home, I have this feeling of peace and security. I can lay in bed, thinking about all the notes from all the people who care about me.\u2019 It really blows me away they don\u2019t feel safe and secure after returning from a combat mission. This has been a difficult thing for me to understand. But after 10 years of doing this, I know it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the home is complete, a dedication ceremony takes place to hand over keys to the veteran\u2019s family. \u201cThis is the culmination of many months of work for the builder and community,\u201d Halliday said. \u201cThe family now has a mortgage free, custom built home to call their own.\u201d\n\nEach home build and series of pillar events is different depending on donations and level of community involvement, Vargas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 21st century barn raising.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo inquire about sponsorships, donations or other opportunities contact 262-522-3624\n\n#ofhwi\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OFHWisconsin\n\nComing up \u2026 Part Four: The Surprise", "article_metadata": {"title": "Operation FINALLY HOME\u2019 comes to Wisconsin", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/buildinglifestyles/310103511.html", "image": {"width": 423, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/HEB-Veteran's-Home_055.jpg", "height": 293}, "type": "article", "description": "997 Former U.S. Army staff sergeant Travis Palmer was led to believe they were on their way to a follow up Operation FINALLY HOME (OFH) applicant interview.
