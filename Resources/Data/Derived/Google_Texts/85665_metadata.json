County is suddenly on the hook for millions of dollars in health care costs for some of the county's poorest patients -- not because they don't have health care, but because they do.\n\n\n\nWatch report: Could Affordable Care Act cost Sac Co. millions of dollars?\n\n\n\nThe Board of Supervisors learned this week the county will have to pay millions for mental health care for patients who now qualify for Medi-Cal, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\"This is absolutely ridiculous,\" said Supervisor Don Nottoli on Tuesday during the board's meeting. \"We're burning through $30,000 a day.\"\n\n\n\nPart of the complication lies in an older federal law that keeps counties and hospitals from being reimbursed by the federal government in cases when patients are placed at facilities with more than 16 beds.\n\n\n\nThe point of the law was to discourage agencies from automatically hospitalizing the mentally ill, said Dr. Sherri Heller, the director of the county's Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\n\"It comes from back in the 1960s and '70s, when governments used to put people in state mental hospitals and not really provide good treatment but more, just (to) get them out of sight,\" Heller said.\n\n\n\nAbout 500 people who used to be considered indigent had been getting care because psychiatric hospitals absorbed those costs.\n\n\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act has allowed those patients to qualify for Medi-Cal, which means the hospitals with which the county contracts will not bear those costs anymore, Heller said.\n\n\n\nAnd without a federal reimbursement, that will leave the county paying more than $1 million per month to care for people -- all while giving them the same services they were already getting.\n\n\n\nHeller said the county is negotiating its contracts with the hospitals, but is also trying to come up with an entirely new plan.\n\n\n\n\"The question is, how quickly we can move the resources around to provide more outpatient options, more crisis residential options,\" Heller said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 21:04:48 PST",
