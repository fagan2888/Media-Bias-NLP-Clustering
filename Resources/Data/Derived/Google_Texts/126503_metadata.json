He said Geisinger's strategies for improving population health, and reducing emergency department use and readmissions, should work in any other setting.\n\n\"Every time we've gone into one of those communities that are all different than central Pennsylvania, we've been able to show dramatic reduction in ER visits and dramatic reduction in readmission rates,\" Feinberg said. \"The stuff that's been proven in Geisinger is exportable. That's totally clear now.\"\n\nThe system also is in search of partnerships with organizations that share its values on preventive care and population health, Feinberg said, regardless of whether those partners are at the same stage of the transformation with regard to population health or value-based care.\n\nFeinberg isn't worried about Geisinger's emphasis on preventive care and unnecessary care reduction hurting its business, he told the WSJ; in fact, he said that his ultimate goal is to put the health system's hospitals out of business in favor of a healthcare landscape where the majority of care occurs in settings such as homes or schools.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the WSJ interview\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGeisinger researchers share framework for putting a learning health system into practice\n\nGeisinger's Nicholas Marko: Early EMR adoption has propelled innovation [Q&A]\n\nHealth systems move to solve data exchange problems on their own\n\nLack of standard data model poses hindrance to PCORI 'network of networks'\n\nWhy a learning health system is important for patient care\n\nONC unveils Interoperability Roadmap for public comment\n\nPCORI announces $150.7 million in Phase II funding for 'network of networks'", "article_metadata": {"description": "Geisinger Health System, a Pennsylvania physician-led hospital system\u00a0serving predominantly rural coal country, has emerged as a care-coordination model for the nation and CEO David Feinberg\u00a0told\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0he hopes the strategies will one day be so successful that the system will close its hospitals.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Geisinger Health System, a Pennsylvania physician-led hospital system\u00a0serving predominantly rural coal country, has emerged as a care-coordination model for the nation and CEO David Feinberg\u00a0told\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0he hopes the strategies will one day be so successful that the system will close its hospitals.", "title": "Why Geisinger's care coordination strategies are a model for the US", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/why-geisingers-care-coordination-strategies-are-model-us/2015-09-28", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "applicability,Care Coordination,Care Delivery,data analytics,David Feinberg,Electronic Medical Records (EMRs),Geisinger,Health Information Technology,Healthcare Data,Integrated Care,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "He said Geisinger's strategies for improving population health, and reducing emergency department use and readmissions, should work in any other setting.\nDespite its rural location, Feinberg told the WSJ that Geisinger's successes are scalable and applicable to various settings and geographical locations.\nThe system also is in search of partnerships with organizations that share its values on preventive care and population health, Feinberg said, regardless of whether those partners are at the same stage of the transformation with regard to population health or value-based care.\nGeisinger Health System, a Pennsylvania physician-led hospital system serving predominantly rural coal country, has emerged as a care coordination model for the nation, according to CEO David Feinberg, who told The Wall Street Journal he hopes the strategies will one day be so successful that the system will close its hospitals.\nFeinberg isn't worried about Geisinger's emphasis on preventive care and unnecessary care reduction hurting its business, he told the WSJ; in fact, he said that his ultimate goal is to put the health system's hospitals out of business in favor of a healthcare landscape where the majority of care occurs in settings such as homes or schools."}
