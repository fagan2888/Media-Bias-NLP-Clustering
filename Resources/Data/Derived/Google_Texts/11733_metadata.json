It\u2019s a plan, he said, that has been in the works all along, even though it still isn\u2019t reflected on the Broncos\u2019 most recent depth chart.\n\nDEPTH CHART: Position-by-position rankings of Broncos players\n\nEmmanuel Sanders will be used on punt returns, he reiterated Saturday, after the team trimmed its roster to the mandated 53 players.\n\n\u201cWe obviously think he can,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI think Omar (Bolden) has done a good job. He\u2019s missed some time with some nicks and stuff, but that\u2019s been part of the plan all along. Emmanuel has been working with (special teams coach) Joe (DeCamillis). Even with the time missed, he\u2019s still been able to go out there and continue to catch. Any way we can get him touches, and this will definitely help.\u201d\n\n2015 BRONCOS ROSTER: Full list of 53 Broncos players ahead of season opener\n\nBolden fielded three of the team\u2019s seven punt returns in the preseason. The Broncos averaged 1.7 yards per return in the four games.\n\nSanders had one punt return for 11 yards last season, and from 2010-12 with Pittsburgh, he returned 16 punts for an average of 10.9 yards apiece.\n\nBroncos 2015 depth chart shifts\n\nShortly after announcing the cuts, the Broncos released their latest depth chart, which included some notable changes.\n\nMontee Ball, who entered training camp as their No. 2 running back, fell to No. 4, behind C.J. Anderson, Ronnie Hillman and Juwan Thompson.\n\nRELATED: Montee Ball keeps job, but falls to No. 4 at RB on depth chart\n\nBall gained only 68 yards on 32 carries in the preseason.\n\n\u201cMontee is a good football player,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cHe earned the right to be on the 53.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Antonio Smith moved ahead of Vance Walker at left defensive end for the Sept. 13 opener against Baltimore. Derek Wolfe, the usual starter, is on the suspended/reserve list for the first four games while he serves his ban for a drug violation.\n\nStrong safety T.J. Ward will also miss the opener because of a one-game suspension. David Bruton is slated to start in his place against Baltimore.\n\nBen Garland a tough cut to make\n\nBen Garland, a 2010 undrafted free agent and Air Force alum, was one of the more difficult cuts to make, Elway said.\n\nRELATED: Dreams live on, others die as Broncos cut down to 53 players\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy that you\u2019d like to have your daughter marry, so anytime you let a guy like that go, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Elway said. \u201cUnfortunately there weren\u2019t enough spots, but I think that Ben will be one of those guys that is going to get an opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\nNicki Jhabvala, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders will be used as Broncos\u2019 punt returner", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders will be used as Broncos\u2019 punt returner", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/05/emmanuel-sanders-will-be-used-as-broncos-punt-returner/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150905__emmanuel-sanders-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150905__emmanuel-sanders-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T16:28:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:48:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Broncos 2015 depth chart shiftsShortly after announcing the cuts, the Broncos released their latest depth chart, which included some notable changes.\nDEPTH CHART: Position-by-position rankings of Broncos playersEmmanuel Sanders will be used on punt returns, he reiterated Saturday, after the team trimmed its roster to the mandated 53 players.\nIt\u2019s a plan, he said, that has been in the works all along, even though it still isn\u2019t reflected on the Broncos\u2019 most recent depth chart.\nAny way we can get him touches, and this will definitely help.\u201d2015 BRONCOS ROSTER: Full list of 53 Broncos players ahead of season openerBolden fielded three of the team\u2019s seven punt returns in the preseason.\nSanders had one punt return for 11 yards last season, and from 2010-12 with Pittsburgh, he returned 16 punts for an average of 10.9 yards apiece."}
