According to a recent Gallup poll, most Americans agree with former President Reagan, who said government is not a the solution, government is the problem.\n\nAn average of 16 percent of Americans in 2015 mentioned some aspect of government\u2014including President Obama, Congress, or political conflict\u2014as the country\u2019s chief problem. The economy came in second with 13 percent mentioning it, while unemployment and immigration tied for third at 8 percent.\n\nWhile government takes the top slot, that\u2019s still an answer given by fewer than one in five citizens. We can\u2019t even seem to come to a consensus about our biggest problems. Indeed, 2015 is only the second time since 2001 (2014 was the other year) that no single issue averaged 20 percent or more for the year. Rather than being focused on a single issue, there is a broad range of concerns troubling us; more than a dozen issues received 2-6 percent of the vote for worst problem.\n\n\n\nPerhaps not surprising since this is an election year, this was the first year since 2007 in which immigration was one of the top four most frequently cited problems. Gallup notes that this is likely because mentions of healthcare dropped from 10 percent in 2014 (when Obamacare was frequently in the news) to 6 percent in 2015.\n\nRounding out the top 10 were five problems, each averaging 5 percent: ethical/moral decline, race relations/racism, terrorism, the federal budget deficit or debt, and education.\n\nSix other issues received 3 percent each: poverty/hunger/homelessness, national security, gap between rich and poor, crime/violence, foreign aid, and ISIS/situation in Iraq.\n\nWhat would make the top three issue in you list of America\u2019s greatest problems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What is the worst problem facing America?
