What Ayotte supports instead is a sham Republican alternative that is backed by the strongest supporters of the NRA in Congress, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and would not actually block those on the terrorist watch list from purchasing weapons. Ayotte should be straightforward with Granite Staters about her true record of putting Washington special interests ahead of the safety of New Hampshire.\"\n\nAyotte is heading into what\u2019s expected to be a tough re-election battle.\n\nLast week, a day after the deadly San Bernardino, Calif. mass shooting, Ayotte voted against a measure that would have banned the sale of guns to those on the federal terrorism watch list.\n\nThe no-fly list is a subset of the terror watch list.\n\nIn his address to the nation Sunday night, President Obama called it insane that people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun.\n\nHe called on Congress to close the loophole.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "New Hampshire Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte says those on the no-fly list should be banned from purchasing guns.
