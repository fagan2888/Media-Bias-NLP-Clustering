But now Charles Koch wails about a 'lack of substance and civility.'\n\nCharles Koch.\n\nPhoto Credit: CBS\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of irony, which is why I enjoyed this Wall Street Journal profile of Charles Koch so much. In an interview with Patrick O\u2019Connor, Charles \u2013 evidently the more diplomatic half of the two most politically active Koch brothers \u2013 spoke somberly about the tone of the 2016 presidential race and of political discourse more generally. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly about personalities and \u2018your mother sucked rotten eggs,\u2019\u201d he lamented to O\u2019Connor.\n\nOn the one hand, I understand Charles\u2019s frustration. After all, he and his brother are looking to invest $750 million on this election. When a man, his brother, and 450 wealthy donors build a national network of umbrella organizations in order to dictate political outcomes via dark money, they expect to get the results they want.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The Koch brothers, whether they know it or not, got exactly what they paid for. If the tone of our politics has sunk to Cro-Magnon levels, it\u2019s because the process has been flooded with money and propaganda and rabid right-wingers who\u2019ve coarsened the discourse and made compromise impossible.\n\nEverything about our politics took a dark turn around the time of Obama\u2019s election in 2008, which is precisely when the Koch brothers\u2019 political machine exploded into being. As O\u2019Connor writes:\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Koch convened about a dozen like-minded conservatives in Chicago with the goal of becoming more overtly political. Those efforts took hold early in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency amid voter unease with the bank bailout signed by President George W. Bush and with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Groups financed by the Kochs and their alliance spent more than $400 million in 2012\u2026In that year\u2019s presidential election, Americans for Prosperity and two other Koch-financed groups spent a total of more than $50 million on television ads.\n\nThe \u201clack of substance and civility\u201d about which Charles complains began in earnest with the rise of the Tea Party between 2009 and 2010. To the extent that the Tea Party is a centralized movement, it is so because it has been mobilized by the groups Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works, both of which are Koch-financed. As it happens, these groups were formerly a single organization, called Citizens for a Sound Economy, which was founded in 1984 by, you guessed it, the Koch Brothers.\n\nThe Tea Party, from the very beginning, was designed for disruption, and it was a pet project of the Koch brothers (they actually created the first national website for the movement). Charles Koch says he\u2019s interested only in advancing \u201cfree-market, small-government ideals,\u201d but what he\u2019s done is manufacture a faux-populist movement that has whipped the conservative base into an anti-government frenzy.\n\nIn the process of serving his narrow and self-interested ideological ends, he allowed the worst elements of the conservative movement \u2013 the xenophobes, the nationalists, and the theocrats \u2013 to hijack the Republican Party. Initially this worked, because it sent obstructionists to Congress whose only mission was to shut the government down. But, over time, it\u2019s created a political climate in which it\u2019s nearly impossible to govern. And it\u2019s prepared the way for someone like Donald Trump (whose campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is a product of Americans for Prosperity), who exists only because he\u2019s been able to tap into the sentiments let loose by the Tea Party movement.\n\nHence the incredible irony of a Charles Koch bemoaning what\u2019s become of our political process, a process he, as much as anyone, helped engineer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Koch network gave rise to the rabid right.
