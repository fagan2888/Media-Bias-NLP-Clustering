(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State officials say a second steel rod anchoring the foundation of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge eastern span tower failed a critical strength test.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday that Caltrans officials acknowledged Wednesday that 99 percent of the rods that underwent testing passed the tests. The cause of the recent failure will need to be determined by further tests in a materials lab.\n\nCaltrans tested all 407 of the rods available for testing and two failed.\n\nCaltrans' Dan McElhinney says the problem could have been caused by threads that were stripped during installation, by corrosion from sitting in water or both, the newspaper reported. Further testing is expected in the next few days but results of those tests could take months. McElhinney says the bridge is safe and is expected to withstand a major earthquake.\n\nCopyright Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "State officials say a second steel rod anchoring the foundation of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge eastern span tower failed a critical strength test.", "title": "Caltrans Downplays Bay Bridge Steel Rod Failure", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Bay Area", "description": "State officials say a second steel rod anchoring the foundation of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge eastern span tower failed a critical strength test.", "title": "Caltrans Downplays Bay Bridge Steel Rod Failure", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Caltrans-Downplays-Bay-Bridge-Steel-Rod-Failure-305339461.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*675/Oakland+Bay+Bridge.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State officials say a second steel rod anchoring the foundation of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge eastern span tower failed a critical strength test.", "title": "Caltrans Downplays Bay Bridge Steel Rod Failure", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Caltrans-Downplays-Bay-Bridge-Steel-Rod-Failure-305339461.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*675/Oakland+Bay+Bridge.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcbayarea", "site": "@nbcbayarea", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 75829892837}, "keywords": "local news, bay area news, san franscisco news, breaking news, local news, bay area, san francisco, oakland, berkeley, san jose, sf", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCBayArea"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dda\"", "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State officials say a second steel rod anchoring the foundation of the new San Francisco Bay Bridge eastern span tower failed a critical strength test.\nPeople watch the sunset and fish as the sun sets on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge along Pier 14 on Friday, Jan. 23, 2015, in San Francisco.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday that Caltrans officials acknowledged Wednesday that 99 percent of the rods that underwent testing passed the tests.\nMcElhinney says the bridge is safe and is expected to withstand a major earthquake.\nThe cause of the recent failure will need to be determined by further tests in a materials lab."}
