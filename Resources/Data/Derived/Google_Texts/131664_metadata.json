Loretta Sanchez participated in a debate Oct. 17, a couple comments jumped out from what was largely a consensus policy lovefest.\n\nFirst, there was former state Sen. Lou Correa joining his three fellow Democratic candidates in supporting a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d approach to health care \u2013 a single-payer system administered by the government.\n\nRead the Register's original coverage of the debate.\n\nCorrea twice voted against state legislative efforts to establish a single-payer program in California. But he later defended the apparent contradiction.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that healthcare should be dealt with on a nationwide scale and not piece-mealed together, state-by-state,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have supported President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. It is far from perfect, but it represents a positive step. Please note that it took Medicare decades to reach its present form. It will take the ACA time and effort as well.\u201d\n\nCorrea also had concerns about the cost of the state proposals.\n\nI explained that response to Democratic activist Greg Diamond. Diamond countered that, among other things, a single-payer program is unlikely to become national policy in the foreseeable future and a statewide program would at least provide better and more affordable care for Californians.\n\nSpecial interests\n\nThe second comment that drew attention was in Anaheim City Councilman Jordan Brandman\u2019s closing statement, \u201cWe need a principled, proved advocate who can stand up to special interests.\u201d\n\nCritics accuse Brandman of being a lackey for business interests. In split votes, he\u2019s sided with the majority in granting tax breaks to new luxury hotels, in banning a Disney ticket tax and in approving a controversial stadium-lease negotiation for the Angels.\n\nFive PACs, which received a combined $493,000 from Disney in 2012, spent $376,000 in independent expenditures for Brandman\u2019s election to the council that year. Two of those PACs are run by entities that backed the hotel tax breaks \u2013 the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce and the O.C. Business Council.\n\n\u201cMr. Brandman has stood up WITH special interests,\u201d activist and school board member Jose Moreno wrote me.\n\nBut advocates of the hotel and Disney tax breaks have argued that they would result in more hotels in Anaheim and more building at Disneyland.\n\n\u201cOne person\u2019s supporters are another\u2019s special interests,\u201d Brandman told me later. \u201cI have always put the best interests of the city of Anaheim\u2019s residents first.\u201d\n\nIndependent expenditures\n\nLast week in this space, I wrote about the boom in independent expenditures for California legislative and statewide candidates, soaring from $9.3 million in 2002 to $78 million in 2014, according to the watchdog group Maplight.\n\nUnbridled by limits on money given directly to candidates, independent expenditures allow those with deep pockets to run campaigns parallel to those of their preferred candidates.\n\nAs I was writing that column, the state Fair Political Practices Commission was taking a modest step toward more tightly regulating the practice.\n\nWhile independent campaigns are banned from working with a candidate\u2019s campaign, questions repeatedly arise of whether two campaigns are coordinating efforts.\n\nThe FPPC\u2019s new rules may not do much to reduce the amount spent on independent expenditures, but they do give the agency more authority to punish scofflaws. Those new rules presume that improper coordination is occurring in several instances unless the parties involved can prove otherwise.\n\nIndications of improper coordination now include a candidate\u2019s relatives or former aides going to work for the independent group and the candidate helping raise funds for the independent group.\n\nContact the writer: mwisckol@ocregister.com; @MartinWisckol", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "news", "description": "Home: Congressional debate comments raise eyebrows | independent, state, interests, candidates, brandman, expenditures, anaheim, tax, special, payer", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "MARTIN WISCKOL", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "When the four declared candidates to replace outgoing Rep.
