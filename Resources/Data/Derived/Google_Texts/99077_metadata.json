It\u2019s the network\u2019s flagship evening newscast and it has earned plaudits from many folks in the industry for being straight up, or at least as straight up as you can get on a network dedicated to killing Obamacare and the like. Whatever the case, Baier himself has managed to keep his own politics hidden from at least one fan who posed a question on the host\u2019s Facebook Q&A this afternoon:\n\nLeah A. Staudt Hi Bret, I have to say you are the best in the business and unfortunately a dying breed. My questions is on what side of the political aisle do you lean?\n\nBret Baier thank you.. I truly try not to lean.. and while I have thoughts and feelings about things..(we\u2019re not robots) I try to keep them to myself.. I am a registered independent\n\nChalk up a victory for the \u201cview from nowhere,\u201d the doctrine that journalism critic Jay Rosen once described this way: \u201cIn pro journalism, American style, the View from Nowhere is a bid for trust that advertises the viewlessness of the news producer.\u201d With his articulation of this view, Baier has plenty of company among U.S. media companies.\n\nThe other upshot from the Facebook Q&A is that every Fox News host should do a Facebook Q&A right now. Here\u2019s a representative sample \u201cquestion\u201d:\n\nLori Bryant I don\u2019t have a question, but just wanted to tell you I love your show! Look forward to it everyday. Thank you!\n\nAnd:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Viewlessness in the news....", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Viewlessness in the news....", "title": "Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier on his politics: \u2018I truly try not to lean\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/02/19/fox-newss-bret-baier-on-his-politics-i-truly-try-not-to-lean/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/files/2014/02/bretbaier.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/02/19/fox-newss-bret-baier-on-his-politics-i-truly-try-not-to-lean/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Fox News, Bret Baier, Obamacare, Facebook,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Fox News, Bret Baier, Obamacare, Facebook,"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe562e\"", "article_summary": "Fox News Channel\u2019s Stephen Hayes, executive producer Doug Rohrbeck, and Bret BaierBret Baier anchors \u201cSpecial Report w/ Bret Baier\u201d on Fox News.\nThe other upshot from the Facebook Q&A is that every Fox News host should do a Facebook Q&A right now.\nBret Baier thank you..\nI truly try not to lean.. and while I have thoughts and feelings about things..(we\u2019re not robots) I try to keep them to myself..\nHere\u2019s a representative sample \u201cquestion\u201d:Lori Bryant I don\u2019t have a question, but just wanted to tell you I love your show!"}
