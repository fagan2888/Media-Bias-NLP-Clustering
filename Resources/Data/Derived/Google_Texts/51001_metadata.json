Bin Laden objected to the presence of \u201cinfidels\u201d in the land of the two holy mosques, and asked the king to allow his outfit to tackle Saddam Hussein\u2019s troops.\n\nSimilarly, ISIS knows that it will only feel secure once Saudi Arabia is part of the Caliphate, and its oil fields are under ISIS control, which is why the group has two logical next steps.\n\nFirst, to capture and secure the most important country in the Muslim world: Saudi Arabia.\n\nIf the battle for Syria and Iraq attracted tens of hundreds, (some say tens of thousands) of young Muslims, the battle for control of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, are very likely to attract many more fighters into the ranks of ISIS.\n\nRelated: 9 Ways the White House Plans to Defeat ISIS\n\nAnd second, to take on the United States -- the one remaining superpower that could stop its march on the oilfields of Saudi Arabia, and ultimately the rest of the Gulf.\n\nAfter much hesitation, it now appears that the Obama administration has come around to realizing the true danger posed by ISIS. Washington, along with some of its NATO allies, is now formulating a plan to defeat ISIS.\n\nHowever, it may be wise to point out that Washington\u2019s track record in dealing with Middle East problems has not been something to crow about. As a point of reference, one need only mention Iraq and Afghanistan -- both prime examples of how not to do things.\n\nEven if the U.S. can defeat ISIS militarily, any victory would only be temporary since eventually, U.S. troops will pull out and the remnants of ISIS would emerge from their respective hiding places, as they did after Saddam Hussein\u2019s capture and death. Indeed, a U.S. intervention -- through its massive air campaign -- will foment even greater animosity toward the West in general, and the United States, in particular. It\u2019s all d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s ISIS Strategy Risks Global Backlash\n\nThe one power that can effectively move against ISIS in a manner that would appear legitimate to other Muslims is Saudi Arabia, as Nawaf Obaid, a fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and Saud al-Sarhan, research director at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies pointed out in a joint opinion piece published Sept. 9 in The New York Times.\n\nThe authors dispute the widely believed notion that Saudi Arabia created ISIS and is funding it. \u201cSaudi Arabia is not the source of ISIS -- it\u2019s the group\u2019s primary target,\u201d they write.\n\nAs Obaid and al-Sarhan put it, \u201cThe Saudi leadership has a unique form of religious credibility and legitimacy, which will make it far more effective than other governments at delegitimizing ISIS\u2019s monstrous terrorist ideology.\u201d\n\nWhat makes IS powerful today is the fact that they laid out their military strategy based on where oil fields are located. The fact that they went after northeast Syria and northern Iraq is not coincidental by any means. Islamic State may be ruthless and brutal, but it is first and foremost a terrorist organization with an astute business plan.\n\nThe capture of oil wells in Syria and Iraq has made the group financially self-sufficient. Now it\u2019s all or nothing.\n\nThis article was originally published in OilPrice.com on September 11, 2014\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the terrorist group known as ISIS, Syria and Iraq were a good place to start their", "title": "The Saudi Oil at the End of ISIS\u2019 Reign of Terror", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/11/Saudi-Oil-End-ISIS-Reign-Terror", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/11/Saudi-Oil-End-ISIS-Reign-Terror", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_oil_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "For the terrorist group known as ISIS, Syria and Iraq were a good place to start their", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0800\"", "article_summary": "It is in that direction that the battle for control of the world\u2019s largest oil fields is currently heading.\nThe authors dispute the widely believed notion that Saudi Arabia created ISIS and is funding it.\nFirst, to capture and secure the most important country in the Muslim world: Saudi Arabia.\nSimilarly, ISIS knows that it will only feel secure once Saudi Arabia is part of the Caliphate, and its oil fields are under ISIS control, which is why the group has two logical next steps.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is not the source of ISIS -- it\u2019s the group\u2019s primary target,\u201d they write."}
