In order to receive an ATO, new information tech systems must perform a set of tests, including \u201cSecurity Control Assessments\u201d (SCA).\n\nBut according to CMS\u2019s 2014 budget request, no such security assessment took place. The Federal Healthcare Marketplace website was rolled out without full end\u00ad-to\u00ad-end testing.\n\nIndeed, the large number of new systems created because of Obamacare created a backlog of testing. CMS could not complete its required security. Failing to complete the required means no ATO, and hence a violation of federal law under FISMA.\n\nFISMA was enacted in 2002. Under FISMA, federal agencies are required: \u201cto develop, document, and implement an agency\u00ad-wide program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.\u201d\n\nCenters for Medicaid and Medicare Services is responsible for the oversight and implementation of the Federal Healthcare Marketplace website and associated systems.\n\nDocuments obtained by The Daily Caller reveal the federal violations.\n\nA CMS Information Security bulletin released in April 2013 explains that FISMA applies to\n\n\u2026all organizations (sources) which have physical or electronic access to a Federal agency\u2019s computer systems, networks, or IT infrastructure; or use information systems to generate, store, process, or exchange data with a Federal agency, or on behalf of a Federal agency, regardless of whether the data resides on a Federal Agency or a Contractor\u2019s information system. This includes services that are either fully or partially provided; including other agency hosted, outsourced, and cloud computing solutions. (Pg.1)\n\nPart of FISMA\u2019s law requires CMS to complete the ATO process.\n\nThe implementation of a Federal Government information system requires a formal Government Authorization to Operate (ATO) for infrastructure systems and/or all application systems developed, hosted and/or maintained on behalf of CMS. (Pg. 8)\n\nAnother CMS document entitled \u201cSecurity Information Review\u201d released in September 2012 reaffirms the FISMA requirement:\n\nBy law, each CMS FISMA system must obtain an ATO before it can be placed into operation. Therefore, security controls must be operational, effective, managed, and continuously monitored. (Pg. 7)\n\nCMS has published guidelines called the \u201cAuthorization to Operate Package Guide\u201d to provide instruction on how to obtain an ATO. Each ATO package must include 12 \u201cartifacts\u201d in order to be submitted for authorization. The table of 12 artifacts includes two known as the \u201cSecurity Control Assessment Plan (SCA Test Plan)\u201d and \u201cSecurity Control Assessment Report (SCA Report).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles C.
