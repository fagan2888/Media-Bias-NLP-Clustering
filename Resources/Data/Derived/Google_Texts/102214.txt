Oregon, a state that strongly supported President Barack Obama and his health care reform effort, turns out to be a hotbed for small employers intent upon getting around key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

A report funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reveals that thousands of Oregonians have purchased health insurance from brokers through association plans. By claiming their groups meet an ERISA loophole that allows them to ignore certain PPACA requirements, theyâ€™re receiving lower premiums than they likely would on the open market.
