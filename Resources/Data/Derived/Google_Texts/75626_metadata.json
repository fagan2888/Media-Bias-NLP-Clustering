Last week, \u201cupon consideration of the petition for rehearing en banc,\u201d the full Circuit on its own motion ordered the Federal Government to file a response to PLF\u2019s petition within 15 days. As PLF attorney Paul Beard observed here, \u201cAn order calling for a response to a rehearing petition is rare and, at the very least, means that some members of the Court are taking the petition seriously.\u201d\n\nIn our amicus brief, we identify a serious error made by the panel when interpreting the Origination Clause that prevented it from reaching many of the most important Origination Clause issues presented by the ACA. Let me explain.\n\nThe Origination Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 1, states that \u201c[a]ll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills..\u201d PLF contended that, once the Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius upheld the \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d solely as a tax, rather than as a penalty enforcing a mandate to buy insurance pursuant to the Commerce Clause, it raised a new constitutional objection. Because the ACA originated in the Senate, and not the House, it violated the Origination Clause. PLF also denied that the ACA was a proper \u201camendment\u201d of the House bill that was totally gutted by the Senate and replaced with the text of the ACA.\n\nBut the DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel never reached most of these issues because it ruled that the ACA was not a bill \u201cfor raising revenue\u201d and therefore the Origination Clause simply did not apply. The panel did so on the ground that the primary \u201cpurpose\u201d of the ACA was not \u201cto raise revenue,\u201d but was to induce people to buy insurance and provide affordable health care to Americans; so that its revenue raising effect was merely \u201cincidental\u201d to this purpose.\n\nOf course, the Senate obviously considered the ACA to be a bill for raising revenue as evidenced by the fact it used the \u201cshell bill\u201d maneuver of taking a House bill that it thought (inaccurately) to be a bill for raising revenue and then \u201camending\u201d it by striking out every single word of the bill, including the title, retaining only the House bill number. The panel reached the different conclusion that the Senate was wrong to think the gut-and-replace maneuver was necessary because, in the panel\u2019s view, the ACA was not a bill for raising revenue in the first place.\n\nIn our 8 page amicus brief, we focus on a most serious error in the panel\u2019s analysis that has the functional consequence of eliminating the Origination Clause from the Constitution: its mistaken reading of the text, original meaning and precedent to conclude erroneously that the ACA was not a bill for raising revenue because the principal \u201cpurpose\u201d of the shared responsibility payment in particular or the ACA as a whole was to achieve affordable health care rather than add to the coffers of the treasury.\n\nWe explain that prior references to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the statute were actually references to constitutional objects or purposes. So if the purpose of a monetary exaction was to enforce a commerce clause regulation \u2014 e.g. by a monetary fine or penalty \u2014 or would have been within the commerce power of Congress, the fact that the exaction revenue \u201cincidentally\u201d contributes money to the treasury does not make it a bill for raising revenue. BUT, if the monetary exaction is justified only as a \u201ctax\u201d under Congress\u2019s power to tax, then it necessarily must be a bill for raising revenue. In sum, \u201ca bill that imposes a tax, under the sole authority of the taxing power, is necessarily a bill for raising revenue. Only when a measure is upheld pursuant to some other constitutional power is it warranted to characterize the money it may raise as \u2018incidental\u2019 to another object or \u2018purpose.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere is a longer excerpt:\n\nWere the motive or policy goals of a bill the touchstone, no revenue measure would ever be subject to the Origination Clause. Amici\u2019s Senate colleagues surely could articulate a broader \u201cpurpose\u201d in raising whatever funds they deem required. The income tax could easily (and largely truthfully) be characterized as a bill to provide for national defense and foreign diplomacy, or to facilitate any other federal program. No tax is levied to raise money for its own sake, and all monies raised are \u201cincidental\u201d to other government goals. Under the panel\u2019s approach, the Origination Clause would be toothless. The panel decision is particularly troublesome when combined with its broad view that the taxing power may be exercised regardless of any regulatory purpose that may be beyond Congress\u2019 authority, and regardless whether the revenue purpose is secondary. This combination leads to a constitutional whipsaw whereby otherwise unconstitutional regulatory measures are deemed taxes yet are immunized from the Origination Clause, despite whatever revenue-raising function justified them as taxes for constitutional purposes. Not only is such a Catch-22 contrary to the original meaning of the Origination Clause, neither does it fit the pattern of any prior case rejecting an Origination Clause challenge. In every prior case there existed constitutional authority independent of the tax power to to enact the monetary exaction that was upheld. In each case, those money-generating provisions were simply a means of implementing a separate Congressional power. In this case, with an exclusive reliance on the taxing power, the shared responsibility penalty was constitutionally justified solely as a revenue-raising tax. Courts may not look behind the constitutional \u201cobject\u201d or purpose for this measure to any other motives that Congress may have harbored. Congress may exact money for a variety of constitutional ends, but when it attempts to achieve these ends by using its power to tax the people, such a measure is a bill for raising revenue that must originate in the House.\n\nOf course, en banc review is rarely granted by the DC Circuit, but given that it recently granted the government\u2019s motion for en banc review of the statutory interpretation case of Halbig v. Burwell presumably because of the importance of the ACA, the case for correcting a mistaken constitutional interpretation is even more important, especially as the panel\u2019s reasoning has the effect of completely gutting the Origination Clause from the Constitution in the same way the Senate gutted the House bill. Regardless of whether the ACA was a proper \u201camendment\u201d by the Senate, courts are not empowered to amend the Constitution in this way.\n\n[some typos corrected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "DC panel's decision would gut the Origination Clause from the Constitution and should be vacated.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "DC panel's decision would gut the Origination Clause from the Constitution and should be vacated.", "title": "Filed today: New brief in <i>Sissel v.
