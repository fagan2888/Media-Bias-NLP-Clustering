Jeff Sessions (R-AL) warned about the potential of U.S. immigration being included in the Trans Pacific Partnership, but House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan and the White House previously and continuously denied any immigration clause existed within the trade deal throughout their push for President Obama\u2019s fast-track trade authority obtained through Congress\u2019s passage of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) \u2013 a fact now revealed to be false.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBreitbart News previously reported, via documents from WikiLeaks, that there was an entire chapter \u2013 roughly ten pages \u2013 dedicated to foreign worker visas. Experts reviewed the documents and told Breitbart News that as currently drafted, that chapter within the trade deal could change current U.S. immigration law relating to foreign worker visas.\n\nAccording to TechDirt.com, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) issued a FOIA request into the USTR in June to obtain the chapter titles of the trade deal, which has been drafted and negotiated entirely in secret \u2013 where only members of Congress are able to read the draft in a secured room on Capitol Hill. Not even the names of the members of Congress who actually read the deal can be revealed to the public or the press.\n\nUSTR fulfilled the FOIA request September 10th, according to TechDirt.com, which has published the chapter titles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the pending TPP trade deal, there is a chapter relating to immigration titled, \u201cTemporary Entry for Business Persons.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In the pending TPP trade deal, there is a chapter relating to immigration titled, \u201cTemporary Entry for Business Persons.\u201d", "title": "Paul Ryan Wrong, Jeff Sessions Right on Immigration in Trade", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Paul-Ryan-and-Jeff-Sessions-ApplewhiteAP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/14/paul-ryan-wrong-jeff-sessions-right-on-immigration-in-trade-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the pending TPP trade deal, there is a chapter relating to immigration titled, \u201cTemporary Entry for Business Persons.\u201d", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Paul-Ryan-and-Jeff-Sessions-ApplewhiteAP.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan Wrong, Jeff Sessions Right on Immigration in Trade", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "foreign workers, immigration, Rep.
