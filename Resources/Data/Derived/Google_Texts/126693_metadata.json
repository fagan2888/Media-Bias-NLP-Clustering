When anything like that happens, it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t get time to erase and forget about. Our thoughts and prayers go to the Ward family and what happened.\n\n\u201cAnd it also goes to Tony. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s sitting there and forgetting about it.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released during the race by a spokesman, Stewart said: \u201cThere aren\u2019t words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr. It\u2019s a very emotional time for all involved, and it is the reason I\u2019ve decided not to participate in today\u2019s race at Watkins Glen. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy.\u201d\n\nRegan Smith drove Stewart\u2019s car and finished 37th after having to start from the back of the 43-car field and getting caught in a late accident.\n\nIt was the second straight time Stewart missed the race at The Glen, where he has a NASCAR-record five victories. Last year, he broke his leg in a sprint car accident in Iowa days before the Cup race and missed the rest of the season.\n\nAllmendinger\u2019s life changed two years ago in the hours before the July race at Daytona International Speedway. NASCAR officials had just kicked him out of the track, suspending Allmendinger indefinitely for failing a random drug test.\n\nThe failed drug test sidelined him for more than three months and cost him his job with Penske Racing. It also spurred much soul searching, and after a handful of one-off Cup rides he eventually landed a full-time Cup ride last August with JTG Daugherty Racing.\n\nTo break through the way Allmendinger did only added to the lore of this race, which has been decided four straight times by fender-banging dashes to the checkered flag. Ambrose won two of those and Kyle Busch the other.\n\nAn expert road racer from his days in open-wheel, Allmendinger beat the best in Ambrose, who has been dominant in NASCAR\u2019s top two series at The Glen, also winning four straight Nationwide events.\n\nAmbrose was going for a weekend sweep after capturing the Zippo 200 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for AJ,\u201d said Ambrose, who drove for JTG Daugherty before Allmendinger.\n\nThe victory made JTG Daugherty Racing eligible for the Chase for the Sprint Cup title, and Allmendinger isn\u2019t planning on stopping there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge to be in the Chase,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to just say, \u2018Just be there.\u2019 We want to make some noise. To be able to say we\u2019re a Chase team, we\u2019re working hard and trying to get it back. When it comes to the Chase with the new format, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get hot early. You don\u2019t have to be amazing for 10 races.\u201d\n\nAllmendinger held off Ambrose through the first two turns on the final restart and opened a lead after both cars bumped and won going away.\n\n\u201cI try to get better every day. I\u2019m still not where I want to be,\u201d Allmendinger said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go back and change the process. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about this.\u201d\n\nThere were three restarts in the decisive closing laps.\n\nAllmendinger got the jump on Ambrose in the first one with nine laps to go, but Jimmie Johnson was bumped in the first turn and his No. 48 spun around, collecting two other cars and precipitating a caution.\n\nThe race restarted again with five laps left and both Ambrose and Allmendinger were side-by-side through the esses, banging against each other before Ambrose took the lead in the chicane as he\u2019s done so many times in the past, dirt flying as both cars hit the grass.\n\nAllmendinger wasn\u2019t done, regaining the lead on the next lap as he out-braked the Australian into Turn 1 before a crash involving Denny Hamlin caused another red flag with four laps left.\n\nThe 90-lap race on the 2.45-mile layout was red-flagged for 1 hour, 21 minutes just past the midpoint after a violent crash involving Ryan Newman and Michael McDowell that involved three other cars.\n\nNewman\u2019s Chevrolet spun hard into the Armco barrier lining the track, ripping a big hole in the barrier\u2019s metal. The car then spun around twice and went back across the racing surface, collecting McDowell in his No. 95, which incurred heavy damage in the rear. Newman, McDowell and Alex Bowman were treated in the infield care center and released.\n\nAllmendinger gained the lead on Lap 64 after pit stops, with Kurt Busch and Ambrose close behind.\n\nAmbrose outbraked Busch into Turn 1 for second two laps later and set his sights on Allmendinger, who had a 2-second lead that was wiped out by the late stoppages.\n\nJeff Gordon started from the pole and led the first 29 laps, holding Ambrose at bay. But Gordon\u2019s engine died on lap 50 as he lost all power and couldn\u2019t get it refired, spoiling a promising day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three-time Cup champion Tony Stewart pulled out of the race 12 hours after he struck and killed a sprint car driver who had climbed from his car during a race in nearby Canandaigua, New York.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Three-time Cup champion Tony Stewart pulled out of the race 12 hours after he struck and killed a sprint car driver who had climbed from his car during a race in nearby Canandaigua, New York.", "title": "AJ Allmendinger wins at somber Watkins Glen", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/10/aj-allmendinger-wins-somber-watkins-glen/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/10/nascar-watkins-glen-a_lanc1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/10/nascar-watkins-glen-a_lanc1.jpg", "description": "Three-time Cup champion Tony Stewart pulled out of the race 12 hours after he struck and killed a sprint car driver who had climbed from his car during a race in nearby Canandaigua, New York.", "card": "summary", "title": "AJ Allmendinger wins at somber Watkins Glen"}, "Author": "John Kekis", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "It was the second straight time Stewart missed the race at The Glen, where he has a NASCAR-record five victories.\nLast year, he broke his leg in a sprint car accident in Iowa days before the Cup race and missed the rest of the season.\n\u201cI dreamed about this moment and I\u2019m not going to forget it,\u201d said Allmendinger, making his 213th Cup start.\nAllmendinger offered his condolences to the Ward family after he won, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re a community here, we\u2019re thinking about you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time for everybody,\u201d Allmendinger said.\nAllmendinger gained the lead on Lap 64 after pit stops, with Kurt Busch and Ambrose close behind."}
