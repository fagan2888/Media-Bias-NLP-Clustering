It's been a weekend of cleaning and disinfecting at all four schools in Demopolis. Friday, leaders were forced to send hundreds of students home after many of them showed up sick, including some teachers.

At least 400 students and teachers in Demopolis are infected with a severe stomach virus. There are four schools total in the district. Two of them have the most amount of affected students including Demopolis high school and U.S. Jones elementary. Administrators say they've never seen anything this bad.

"In 24 years I've never seen an illness situation result in having to close schools like this," Superintendent Dr. Al Griffin says.

Administrators decided to shut the door on all four schools. The four schools are being disinfected throughout the weekend. Administrators plan to open the campus Monday.
