Obamacare,\u201d Siegel griped. \u201cBecause Obamacare is one size fits all. Obamacare is not going to say, \u2018Hey, this cancer that you have that no one else has, we\u2019re going to get insurance to cover it.'\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare is narrow networks of doctors,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t include most of these major medical centers, the cancer institutes. It won\u2019t include these treatments that are $100,000 per year. And not only that, as you just said, it stifles innovation.\u201d\n\nDoocy doubted that Obama was serious about curing cancer, and wondered if the idea was just an \u201chomage to Joe\u201d instead of an \u201cactual effort\u201d because the vice president\u2019s son had recently died of cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice sentiment for Joe Biden,\u201d Siegel agreed, adding that Obama was just \u201cglomming on\u201d to the effort so he could take credit for an eventual cancer cure.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take a bow here,\u201d he quipped. But he\u2019s not really delivering.\u201d\n\nMedia Matters pointed out that conservative media outlets had \u201cdistorted\u201d an Associated Press report which found that only four of 19 cancer centers surveyed said that all health insurance plans had access to all treatments.\n\n\u201cNothing in the AP report says that any of the cancer treatment facilities are excluded from all of the exchange plans in a given state, like the New York Post and Fox suggest,\u201d Media Matters noted. \u201cThe truth is that a hospital being included in a particular plan\u2019s network is a decision that\u2019s made between the provider and the insurance company, and the choice to restrict access to certain providers, especially high-cost providers, is one that insurance companies have been making for decades.\u201d\n\nA press release from the White House this week revealed that President Barack Obama had budgeted a $215 million investment \u201cto accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools, knowledge, and therapies to select which treatments will work best for which patients.\u201d\n\nThe statement said that the effort would include \u201cthe design and testing of effective, tailored treatments for cancer by expanding genetically based clinical cancer trials, exploring fundamental aspects of cancer biology, and establishing a national \u201ccancer knowledge network\u201d that will generate and share new knowledge to fuel scientific discovery and guide treatment decisions.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below, uploaded by Media Matters.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fox_ff_measles_150122c-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Fox News doctor tells Obama to skip the \u2018war on cancer\u2019: \u2018He\u2019s the wrong commander-in-chief\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSome people when they saw this said, \u2018Wait a minute, isn\u2019t President Obama\u2019s Obamacare kind of stifling innovation with all the penalties and taxes and regulations?\nObamacare,\u201d Siegel griped.\nDuring President Obama\u2019s State of the Union Address on Tuesday, he announced that Vice President Joe Biden would lead a \u201cmoon shot\u201d to find a cure for cancer.\nHowever, Siegel argued that Obama was actually hurting cancer research by insuring more Americans with the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the wrong commander-in-chief in the war on cancer.\u201dThe doctor said that Nixon had \u201cput his money where his mouth is\u201d by budgeting an extra $100 million to cure cancer."}
