Humana is back to host another event on health insurance plans.

The organization is partnering with Pro Staffing Group to host a free health care reform event. Humana will set up in the old Blythe & Vine location in the lobby of Fondren Corner (2906 N. State St.) March 8.

The two organizations hope to reach associates that work with Pro Staffing, people who work in Fondren, artists, and anyone else interested in learning about the Affordable Care Act.

Humana will answer questions on what has changed with health insurance, how and when to get a new plan, if people can get help paying for insurance and health care, and Humana agents will assist event-goers in picking out new insurance plans before the March 31 deadline.

The event will be March 8 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The event is free and open to the public. For more information, call 601-953-3322.
