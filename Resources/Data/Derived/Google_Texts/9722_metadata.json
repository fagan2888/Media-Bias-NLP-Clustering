Bundy and his wife registered as voters with the Independent American Party this past May, following an event celebrating his \u201ccourage in standing up for state sovereignty\u201d by refusing to pay grazing fees for his cows\u2019 use of federally-owned land.\n\nThe ad begins with footage of Holder\u2019s February 2009 \u201cnation of cowards\u201d speech regarding racial tensions in the U.S., labeling him as a \u201crace-baiter.\u201d It then shifts to a scene of Bakari and Bundy, both wearing \u201ccowboy\u201d attire, complaining about the speech.\n\n\u201cI know Black folks have a had a hard time with slavery and you know, the government was in on it. And the government\u2019s in on it again,\u201d Bundy tells Bakari. \u201cI worked my whole life without mistreating anybody. A man ought to be able to express himself without being called names.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you, Cliven, and I believe you,\u201d Bakari responds. \u201cA brave white man like you might be just what we need to put an end to this political correctness stuff in America.\u201d\n\nBundy became a conservative media darling earlier this year with his show of defiance toward federal regulations, eventually attracting hundreds of supporters, several of them armed, to his Nevada ranch. However, he was quickly abandoned after the New York Times published his statements regarding \u201cthe Negro.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things,\u201d Bundy stated at the time. \u201cOr are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\u2019t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politifact, Bakari is considered a heavy underdog in his race to unseat incumbent Rep. Dina Titus (D). His party platform states that \u201cthroughout human history, most men have been slaves to man\u2019s institutions of government\u201d and argues against not only the Affordable Care Act, but \u201cmandatory medication or vaccinations\u201d and collective bargaining agreements for workers.\n\nWatch Bundy and Bakari\u2019s campaign ad, as posted online on Friday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Independent-American-Party-candidate-Kamau-Bakari-and-Cliven-Bundy-youtube-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Black Nevada conservative and \u2018brave white man\u2019 Cliven Bundy call Eric Holder out"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is one white man who\u2019s not scared to talk about race,\u201d Bundy says in the ad for Independent American Party candidate Kamau Bakari.\nIndependent American Party candidate Kamau Bakari and Cliven Bundy [youtube]Anti-government rancher Cliven Bundy resurfaced this week in a bizarre campaign ad for a far-right Black Nevada congressional candidate, with both men challenging Attorney General Eric Holder to a debate about racial issues in America.\nA man ought to be able to express himself without being called names.\u201d\u201cI hear you, Cliven, and I believe you,\u201d Bakari responds.\n\u201cI dare you to come to Las Vegas and talk to us.\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t give us that \u2018you\u2019re too busy\u2019 stuff,\u201d Bakari says.\n\u201cI know Black folks have a had a hard time with slavery and you know, the government was in on it."}
