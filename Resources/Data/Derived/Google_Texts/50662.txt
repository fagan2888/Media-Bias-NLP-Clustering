Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee hinted that he could ultimately have some regrets for leaving his Fox News show to explore running for president in 2016 if he doesn’t actually take the plunge and run.

Asked on “The View” about a presidential run, Mr. Huckabee replied, “Let me put it this way — I left the show I had for six and a half years on the Fox News network.”

“If I don’t end up running for president, I’ve got to be the dumbest man alive to leave that good of a gig to not run,” he said.

Mr. Huckabee is scheduled to be at GOP Rep. Steve King’s “Iowa Freedom Summit” on Saturday along with other potential Republican contenders in 2016.
