With Bush\u2019s announcement Tuesday that he\u2019s exploring a presidential bid, tea party activists are already looking through his record and criticizing his policies on taxes, spending and even Obamacare. Bush\u2019s very green record on conservation may also come into play. Activists are making it clear that he\u2019ll face plenty of questions if he makes a presidential race official \u2014 and they\u2019re not convinced he\u2019ll be able to excite the conservative voters he\u2019d need to turn out in the primaries.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Hill Republicans not lining up behind Bush)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely much more than Common Core,\u201d said Noah Wall, grass-roots director at FreedomWorks. \u201cThe whole idea that Jeb Bush will just walk away with this really doesn\u2019t take into account the need for the Republican Party to nominate a solid conservative.\u201d\n\nActivists are giving Bush a hard time for a 2011 statement in which he didn\u2019t completely rule out tax increases in exchange for deeper spending cuts, as well as a comment last year that defunding Obamacare wasn\u2019t the right strategy to defeat the law \u2014 that it would be better to let the law fall apart on its own.\n\nSome conservative activists are trying to paint a caricature of Bush as an old school Republican who doesn\u2019t represent the new conservative movement. In a fundraising email Tuesday, Shaun McCutcheon, chairman of the Conservative Action Fund, called him \u201canother establishment, compromising Republican\u201d and asked: \u201cWill you support a nominee who supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, the Washington takeover of our educational system (known as Common Core), and is already talking about raising taxes?\u201d\n\nCraig Shirley, a longtime conservative activist and Ronald Reagan biographer who helped Bush\u2019s father with outreach to conservatives in the 1980s \u2014 at a time when he faced similar distrust from the right \u2014 said Bush could benefit from the same kind of outreach campaign that the elder George Bush conducted when he was preparing to run to succeed Reagan.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt, because right now he\u2019s embedded as the establishment candidate,\u201d said Shirley. \u201cRight now, as long as it\u2019s a multi-candidate race, he\u2019s in good shape. But once it becomes a one-on-one contest, it becomes more of a problem for Bush.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Money men cheer Jeb news)\n\nRight now, that\u2019s getting a bit ahead of what Bush says he plans to do: He just wants to tour the country and give speeches as he \u201cactively explores\u201d a possible run. And that will give him plenty of opportunities to talk about his ideas and his record, according to spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bush will have an opportunity over the next few months, as he explores a possible run, to talk about his ideas for the country, and he\u2019ll also have a chance to talk about his own record, too,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nIt\u2019s not that any of the friction from the right is a surprise to Bush. Even though his allies say he did, in fact, have a conservative record as Florida governor \u2014 cutting taxes by $19.3 billion, building the state\u2019s reserves to $9 billion and streamlining regulations \u2014 they say his statement about \u201closing the primary to win the general\u201d was meant to signal that he\u2019s not going to change to please the right.\n\n\u201cThe governor is not passionate on running on any labels. He wants people to take his views as they are,\u201d said Al Cardenas, who served as Florida GOP chairman when Bush was governor. Still, \u201cin all the years I was in Florida, I never heard anyone in the Republican Party or anyone in the media suggest that he was not a conservative.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Cruz on Jeb: GOP will lose with another moderate)\n\n\u201cHe came up with an education reform plan that was based on choice and accountability and became a model for the nation. He cut taxes, he improved the state\u2019s credit rating, he cut the size of government and he reduced the regulatory process,\u201d Cardenas said.\n\nThere will be plenty of ammunition for Democrats, too. At times as governor, Bush sounded like the \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d his brother, George W. Bush, tried to be \u2014 but also one who was dedicated to cutting government. \u201cWe can embed in society a sense of caring that makes government less necessary,\u201d he said in his second inaugural address in 2003. \u201cThere would be no greater tribute to our maturity as a society than if we can make these buildings around us empty of workers; silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fill.\u201d\n\nBush also played a role in the controversial Terri Schiavo case a decade ago, siding with her parents in their fight with her husband and signing an order to have her feeding tube reinstated after a court said it should be removed. And even though he disagreed with Republicans who wanted to defund Obamacare, he\u2019s been bashing the Democrats\u2019 health law along with all the other potential 2016 contenders.\n\nStill, Bush would have to get through the Republican primaries before he could ever face the Democratic attack ads. And to do that, he\u2019ll have to convince conservative activists that he\u2019s really on their side.\n\nIn some respects, Bush would be an unlikely candidate to be accused of being soft of tax increases. As governor, he cut levies on businesses, investments, large estates and homes. By his count, he cut taxes by some $19 billion.\n\nBut at a congressional hearing in June 2012, he was asked whether he would have accepted a theoretical budget deal that included major spending cuts as well as tax increases.\n\nThe question first arose in a 2011 Republican presidential debate, during which all eight of the candidates said they would not accept such a deal. A Democratic congressman later asked Bush at a hearing before the House budget committee if he would have rejected the deal as well. Bush\u2019s answer surprised the panel.\n\n\u201cIf you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we\u2019re going to have $10 of spending cuts for $1 of revenue enhancement \u2014 put me in, Coach,\u201d said Bush, who added that he never signed anti-tax activist Grover Norquist\u2019s pledge to oppose tax increases.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s said some odd things,\u201d said Norquist. \u201cIt\u2019s not a strong sales pitch for the modern Republican party.\u201d\n\nCampbell says Bush \u201cdoes not support tax increases\u201d and that \u201chis record on fiscal issues is clear,\u201d especially with his deep cuts in Florida. And not all conservative activists have a problem with Bush\u2019s record. The conservative Club for Growth said it is willing to hear Bush out, saying it could abide tax increases if they got major spending cuts or an overhaul of the Tax Code in return.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the Club Against New Revenue \u2014 We\u2019re the Club for Growth,\u201d said spokesman Barney Keller.\n\nConservative critics are also hitting Bush for increases in state spending. The Cato Institute, for example, says total spending increased by 45 percent during his eight years as governor, and noted that it \u201crose quite rapidly\u201d in his second term. \u201cHe talks about lowering taxes, but spending grew on his watch,\u201d said Wall of FreedomWorks.\n\nBush\u2019s allies, however, said there\u2019s a reason spending appeared to go up during his second term: The state was getting slammed with hurricanes between 2004 and 2006, and Florida had to spend more on hurricane recovery (money that was reimbursed by the federal government anyway).\n\nAnd on Obamacare, Bush wants to repeal the law, but he also has talked frequently about the need for Republicans to have a replacement plan that reflects its own health care priorities \u2014 a view that is becoming more of a mainstream position within the GOP.\n\nBush\u2019s years as governor were also more complex than his critics would suggest, as his environmental record shows.\n\nHis most ambitious environmental undertaking, overseeing Florida\u2019s half of an $11 billion state-federal effort to restore the Everglades, brought him praise from dozens of environmental groups during his first term \u2014 though that relationship later turned caustic after those same greens accused him of backtracking on promises to protect the great marsh from pollution by Big Sugar.\n\nBush\u2019s election in 1998 began an era of unchallenged GOP dominance of Florida government, and he both ran and governed as a conservative. But state spending on conservation programs rose during the Bush years, in contrast to the budget cuts and job cuts that state environmental agencies have sustained under the current governor, Rick Scott.\n\nMore recently, Bush has offered conflicting signals about where he stands on climate change, calling himself a \u201cskeptic\u201d on manmade global warming in a 2009 Esquire interview but warning conservative activists last year that the GOP is imperiling its future by being seen as \u201canti-science.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeb Bush was the best governor for the environment that Florida every had,\u201d said J. Allison DeFoor, a former judge, sheriff and Florida GOP vice chairman who served as the state\u2019s Everglades czar during Bush\u2019s first term. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not an opinion. That\u2019s a fact, and a provable fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a green,\u201d said Eric Draper, the executive director of the National Audubon Society\u2019s Florida chapter, which had both worked with Bush on his Everglades restoration efforts but clashed with him on his handling of the Everglades\u2019 pollution limits. \u201cI actually miss him. He was one of Florida\u2019s most effective governors, and I\u2019m telling you that as a Democrat.\u201d\n\nTo reach Republican voters, however, Shirley says Bush should develop a \u201csignature issue that resonates with conservatives\u201d \u2014 and one that would convince them that he has something to offer besides a repeat of his father and brother\u2019s presidencies.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s got going for him is also what he has against him. He\u2019s got the Bush name, but he\u2019s also dragging the anchor of the Bush legacy, which within the conservative movement and the tea party isn\u2019t going to help him in the way that it will in other quarters,\u201d Shirley said.\n\nBrian Faler, Kim Dixon, Sarah Wheaton, Bob King and Darren Goode contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Conservative activists are on attack over taxes, spending, immigration and Common Core.", "title": "Jeb Bush's policy minefields", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/jeb-bushs-policy-minefields-113624.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/16/141216_jeb_bush_ap2_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,2016 Elections,Common Core,Jeb Bush", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Conservative activists are on attack over taxes, spending, immigration and Common Core.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdff3\"", "article_summary": "At times as governor, Bush sounded like the \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d his brother, George W.
