The Accordion Flange is a wafer-shaped device that adheres to skin around the stoma. Nurses and ostomates simply lift the accordion-like flange away from the body and click an ostomy pouch (which collects bodily waste) onto the flange. They then gently lower the pouch back into place against the body.\n\n\"The Accordion Flange makes the entire process of pouch application easier and more comfortable, especially for post-operative patients and others with tender abdomens,\" said Douglas LeFort, Vice President and General Manager of ConvaTec's Ostomy Care business. \"Our Moldable Technology provides unmatched protection against leaks and keeps surrounding skin healthy, giving ostomates the freedom and confidence to live life to the fullest.\n\n\"The Accordion Flange is an essential addition to our Moldable Technology portfolio, which addresses a full range of customer needs and preferences.\"\n\nConvaTec's Accordion Flange lifts upward from a flat profile to a height of 3/8\" (1cm), providing triple the amount of finger space than the Hollister New Image\u2122 flange.1 In the \"down\" position, the flange gives the wearer a low profile that is extremely flexible, comfortable and conforms to body contours.\n\nThe device's moldable, elastic-like seal \"rebounds\" to fit any stoma size and shape, providing an incredibly secure, snug fit that protects against leaks and skin complications. According to recent studies, half of all ostomates develop skin complications around the stoma. By contrast, more than 95 percent who started on Moldable Technology kept their skin healthy, and over 86 percent of ostomates with pre-existing skin disorders had improved skin after switching to Moldable Technology.\n\nLeaks and skin complications also contribute to high levels of hospital readmissions for ostomy patients. Reducing readmissions is a big concern for hospitals and other payers who are looking to reduce costs and avoid payment penalties under the Affordable Care Act, while also improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.\n\nClick here for a Backgrounder on Ostomy Skin Complications and Moldable Technology.\n\nAbout ConvaTec\n\nConvaTec is a global medical products and technologies company, with leading market positions in ostomy care, wound therapeutics, continence and critical care, and infusion devices.
