A lot of the Democratic Congress is brain dead. But that is different from the kind of demagoguery that we have seen to the kind of oppositional politics to undermine Barack Obama and undermine American interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s disloyal to oppose a president who\u2019s reelected,\u201d Kristol said. \u201cRonald Reagan was reelected in 1984. Tip O\u2019Neill and he had a disagreement, and the government shut down for a couple of days. Nobody thought Tip O\u2019Neill was disloyal, was being like Joe McCarthy. There were budget fights, there were fights over legislative priorities.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kristol added that, \u201cIf I were dictator of the Republican Party, I would have had a different set of tactics\u201d than those of Cantor\u2019s caucus.\n\n\u201cWith good reason,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nWatch the full clip below, via MSNBC:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carl Bernstein ignited a nearly eight-minute fight\u2014epic by cable news standards\u2014when he compared the House GOP caucus' effort to conflation of the defunding or", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bernstein.jpg", "title": "Kristol, Scarborough Go After Carl Bernstein for Comparing Eric Cantor to Joe McCarthy"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carl Bernstein ignited a nearly eight-minute fight\u2014epic by cable news standards\u2014when he compared the House GOP caucus' effort to conflation of the defunding or delaying of ObamaCare with government funding to McCarthyism.", "title": "Kristol, Scarborough Go After Carl Bernstein for Comparing Eric Cantor to Joe McCarthy", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bernstein.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-10-02T07:46:46+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9627\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEric Cantor (R-VA) and his Republican Party are the most dangerous, demagogic force in politics since Joe McCarthy,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\u201cThis is the first time I can say this in the history of Morning Joe, Carl, but you\u2019re actually outnumbered by conservatives this morning,\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough told guest Carl Bernstein Wednesday morning.\nNobody thought Tip O\u2019Neill was disloyal, was being like Joe McCarthy.\n\u201cThe proportion of what we\u2019re talking about here in terms of what one force is willing to do is quite different.\n\u201cI agree with you totally, except in terms of proportionality,\u201d Bernstein."}
