Despite all of the media attention and the increased focus in the medical community, overdoses and over-prescribing are still happening. This is still a major crisis and we need to continue to put forth our state's best effort to combat addiction and overdose deaths,\u201d said Michael Fine, MD, Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health.\n\nSince January 2014, there have been 162 apparent accidental drug overdose deaths, nine of which occurred in the month of October\n\nFive of the nine apparent accidental drug overdose deaths occurred between Wednesday, October 8 and Friday, October 10.\n\nOf the total number of apparent accidental drug overdose deaths since January 1, 2014, 141 (90%) of the screened cases involved at least one opioid or medication. At least 59 (38%) of the screened cases involve fentanyl that appears to have come from an illicit source.\n\nThese apparent accidental drug overdose deaths have taken place in 30 different cities and towns in Rhode Island affecting men and women of all ages and ethnicities:\n\n-115 men and 47 women ranging in age from 20 to 65.\n\n-31 people in their twenties, 48 people in their thirties, 37 people in their forties, 40 people in their fifties, and 6 people in their sixties;\n\n-148 people were white, 13 were black, and 1 was Asian.\n\nNaloxone (Narcan) is an emergency antidote to opioid overdose. It can be used in emergency situations to potentially reverse the effects of drug overdoses. Since January 1, 2014, Rhode Island Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has administered 1267 doses of Narcan. From April 2nd \u2013 October 14th, emergency departments in Rhode Island have administered Narcan 87 times.\n\nData from Rhode Island\u2019s Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), which are available to the public on the Department\u2019s website, continue to demonstrate that the amount and volume of prescribed controlled substances is not decreasing. In September, 116,383 individuals filled a prescription for a schedule 2, 3, or 4 drug in Rhode Island. Likewise, in September alone, 1.16 million doses of stimulants, 1.6 million doses of schedule 2 pain medicines, and 5.4 million doses of benzodiazepines were prescribed.\n\nCraig Stenning, Director of the RI Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH), reminds Rhode Islanders that access to treatment is available through the Medicaid Expansion of the Affordable Care Act; recovery coaches are available to mentor individuals through the early stages of their recovery; Narcan kits are available through treatment centers; and immediate access to substance abuse treatment is available to individuals through their primary care physicians.\n\nFor more information on drug overdoses: http://www.health.ri.gov/data/drugoverdoses/\n\nFor more information on controlled substance usage: http://www.health.ri.gov/data/controlledsubstances/\n\nRelated Slideshow: Breakdown of Overdose Deaths in RI - 2009 to 2014\n\nPrev Next 2009 Total overdose deaths: 137 Both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs: 22 Pharmaceutical drugs only: 84 Illicit drugs only: 31 Prev Next 2010 Total overdose deaths: 152 Both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs: 36 Pharmaceutical drugs only: 82 Illicit drugs only: 24 Prev Next 2011 Total overdose deaths: 175 Both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs: 41 Pharmaceutical drugs only: 93 Illicit drugs only: 41 Prev Next 2012 Total overdose deaths: 182 Both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs: 34 Pharmaceutical drugs only: 85 Illicit drugs only: 63 Prev Next 2013 (First Half) Total overdose deaths: 118* Both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs: 23 Pharmaceutical drugs only: 40 Illicit drugs only: 55 *Data only available for first half of 2013 Prev Next 2014 Total overdose deaths: Both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs: Pharmaceutical drugs only: Illicit drugs only: Prev\n\n2009\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2012\n\n2013 (First Half)\n\n2013 (First Half)\n\n2014 Next\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?
