Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, has requested former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to appear before the committee to address questions relating to her private email system and the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya. Gowdy noted that both David Kendall\u2013Clinton\u2019s lawyer\u2013and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD)\u2013the committee\u2019s ranking member\u2013agreed to have the former first lady appear before the Committee sometime in November of 2014. This was obviously before we knew that Clinton had used a private email address for all State Department business, had operated a personal server, and had submitted emails the former secretary of state deemed work-related; all of this was included in the letter.\n\n\u201cThank goodness the Committee did not schedule Secretary Clinton\u2019s appearance when some asked us to, or else that hearing would have been woefully and now obviously premature,\u201d Gowdy wrote. He also reiterated how a transcribed interview, which was rejected by Clinton\u2019s legal team, should have been an option for the former first lady\u2013and that the Committee is willing to travel to her \u201cif that would make the scheduling of this interview easier for the Secretary.\u201d\n\nGowdy also said that if she chose to appear before the Committee, they \u201cwould anticipate the hearing lasting until all relevant questions have been asked on both sides of the aisle.\u201d They\u2019re hoping to have this public hearing the week of May 18.\n\nThe letter contained over 100 sample questions for Hillary Clinton regarding the use of her private email account.\n\nHe also requested the former secretary to testify twice to the Committee from the press release issued earlier today, and reiterated some of the points mentioned in the letter to Clinton\u2019s lawyers\u2013specifically not having Clinton appear on the original date that was set:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The week of May 18th.05/27/2016 11:24:31AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The week of May 18th", "title": "Matt Vespa - Trey Gowdy: Madam Secretary, We Request Your Presence Before The Select Committee", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/04/23/trey-gowdy-madam-secretary-we-request-your-presence-before-the-select-committee-n1989719", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/36/4bc210df-525a-415d-aea2-85966d800eca.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The week of May 18th", "title": "Matt Vespa - Trey Gowdy: Madam Secretary, We Request Your Presence Before The Select Committee", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/04/23/trey-gowdy-madam-secretary-we-request-your-presence-before-the-select-committee-n1989719", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/36/4bc210df-525a-415d-aea2-85966d800eca.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trey Gowdy: Madam Secretary, We Request Your Presence Before The Select Committee, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThank goodness the Committee did not schedule Secretary Clinton\u2019s appearance when some asked us to, or else that hearing would have been woefully and now obviously premature,\u201d Gowdy wrote.\nGowdy noted that both David Kendall\u2013Clinton\u2019s lawyer\u2013and Rep.
