Now that CMS has released results from the first operating period, AISHealth interviewed four ACOs \u2013 one of whom will receive shared savings from CMS \u2013 who reviewed the successes and failures of the MSSP program.\n\nChris Lloyd, CEO of MHMD (formerly known as Memorial Hermann Physician Network) and Memorial Hermann ACO, said that Houston-based Memorial Hermann ACO started with its physicians. The organization used a 15-point checklist to choose its initial group of doctors. The requirements mandated that they already have an electronic medical record, accept some risk, and have efforts underway to implement other aspects of the ACO triple aim, according to Lloyd.\n\nThe checklist was successful. As a result of this approach, Memorial Hermann saved Medicare about $33 million and will receive shared savings of about $16 million. Lloyd asserted that the key to the organization\u2019s success was choosing a subset of physicians who already were invested in population health management, instead of enlisting its entire network and then trying to get buy-in.\n\nA second participant, Catholic Health System, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based non-profit provider that includes four different hospital locations and an affiliated 900-physician independent practice association, also saw success. According to Michael Edbauer, D.O., CMO, there were two tactics integral to the ACO\u2019s progress so far: extensive use of electronic health record (EHR)-based registries and data, plus care management \u201cacross the continuum\u201d with a focus on emergency room and inpatient opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, Summit Health Solutions executive director Kimberly Kauffman says the biggest success story for her ACO is embedded care, asserting, \u201cWithout a doubt, embedded care coordination has had the biggest impact on providing better care [and] lower cost for our Medicare patients. This model allows us to proactively engage patients and act as the point of first contact for patients.\u201d\n\nKnoxville, TN-based Summit has approximately 36,000 attributed Medicare patients and uses a single EHR from Allscripts. Although it did not earn a shared savings payment in the first reporting period, the ACO has been able to reduce inpatient admissions by 11 percent and readmissions by 2 percent \u2014 \u201cand those are off of starting points already considerably lower than the national average,\u201d Kauffman said.\n\nOne additional participant, Jordan Hospital, a not-for-profit, 155-bed community hospital based in Plymouth, MA, anticipated that it would see hospital admissions suffer as a side effect of the MSSP program. James Fanale, M.D., senior vice president of system development, admitted that after nearly two years in the program, the ACO is still focusing its efforts on reducing the facility costs. The ACO did not earn a shared savings payout in the first reporting period.\n\nUltimately, Fanale says, physician engagement is key to the success of the ACO, but \u201csometimes you have to work with and around [the physicians] to demonstrate that different processes work. Pilots are crucial. Finally, more analytical support \u2014 especially focusing on chronically ill patients, who need to be managed very closely \u2014 would have helped as the ACO started up,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Medicare ACO execs share experiences, advice regarding MSSP. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "Lessons Learned From MSSP", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/b08afe9d/b08afe9d-8cdf-4e3a-be48-ac1dda8c109f/medicare_shared_savings_program_mssp.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Medicare ACO execs share experiences, advice regarding MSSP.
