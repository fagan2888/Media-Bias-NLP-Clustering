McCarthy joined the Heartland Institute on June 12th to talk about his new book, Faithless Execution: Building the Political Case for Obama\u2019s Impeachment, with a packed and lively crowd of Heartland supporters. McCarthy was incisive and exceptionally convincing.\n\nMcCarthy began his talk by bemoaning the fact that an author must eventually stop writing and submit a book for publication, which means that events occurring between the final draft\u2019s submission and the actual publication cannot be included in the text. This fact means that his book is \u201ctwo or three impeachable offenses behind.\u201d Even still, the list he presents in Faithless Execution is enthralling and terrifying.\n\nThe talk then turned briefly to the subject of Bowe Bergdahl, whose release has stirred up tremendous controversy in Washington and across the nation. McCarthy explained that the focus in Congress was all wrong, and that the issue was not really about the violation of the statute requiring the president to talk to Congress 30 days before the release of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Rather, the issue of concern is the fact that releasing five Taliban leaders represents a clear case of replenishing an enemy that is still fighting the United States, which is an \u201cirresponsible dereliction of duty of a commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy explained that, despite the focus going awry, the Bergdahl case has had two positive effects. First, it was perfectly timed to publicize his book. Second, it had finally led mainstream politicians to start using a word they have constantly avoided: impeachment.\n\nImpeachment has ceased to be muttered behind closed doors alone and is now being spoken openly. \u201cEven Lindsey Graham is comfortable uttering it,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThe Obama administration has been, according to McCarthy, deliberately \u201coverloading the system,\u201d engaging in a cascade of scandals that takes advantage of ordinary people\u2019s finite ability to deal with crises. McCarthy gave the example of how the new EPA regulations that may have profound impacts on the health of the economy have barely been discussed, sandwiched as they are between the Bergdahl and VA hospital scandals.\n\nIt is because of these scandals and persistent abrogation of duty that McCarthy proposes the process of impeachment. McCarthy explained to the audience that, \u201cImpeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one.\u201d In other words, despite the trappings of the courtroom, impeachment proceedings are not about assessing criminal liability. Rather, the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d to which the Constitution refers are concerned with breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the public trust. McCarthy stated that he could identify many such breaches committed during Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nChief among the president\u2019s impeachable offenses, McCarthy explained, is his failure to execute laws faithfully. The president is the only federal official under the Constitution required to take an oath to execute the laws faithfully and to defend the Constitution. McCarthy cited Obama\u2019s unilateral amendments of Obamacare and his selective and arbitrary enforcement of certain laws to benefit his allies and harm his opponents as evidence of unfaithful execution.\n\nAnother offense McCarthy identified was Obama\u2019s dereliction of duty. He identified the atrocities committed to Americans in Benghazi and the previous unauthorized military actions in Libya as clear examples of this offense.\n\nAfter outlining these offenses, McCarthy turned the discussion to the political climate and the prospects for impeachment. McCarthy was adamant that impeachment must not be a frivolous exercise. After all, it takes a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict, which is only possible if there is wide bipartisan support for the proceedings both among legislators and in the public.\n\nMcCarthy then pointed out that there is no appetite in the American people for impeachment. He pointed to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment as a clear example of the dangers of impeachment when there is no popular will for it. When an impeachment fails, the media can paint it as an endorsement of the very actions under censure.\n\nWhat McCarthy proposed, in his book and during the talk, is a concerted effort to change the political environment so that the issue of lawlessness is front-and-center in the public discourse. Changing that environment would likely push Obama to actually execute the laws faithfully and to act within the bounds of the Constitution.\n\nFailure to change the discourse could have serious negative effects for the future of the American republic, as McCarthy deftly explained. He described how the accretion of presidential power erodes citizens\u2019 liberty, and that this is \u201cnot a conservative issue, not a Republican issue, it is an American issue.\u201d Unless something is done about it, the powers Obama takes for himself will belong to his successors, of whatever party.\n\nMcCarthy explained that he was still hopeful for the republic\u2019s future, a hopefulness he expanded upon during the Q&A session after his talk. When asked about what people can do if impeachment is not yet possible, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s make a big issue out of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nIt is that issue that must be won before the imperial presidency can be stopped. Andrew McCarthy\u2019s magisterial book will go a long way to winning it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/a-lawless-administration-andrew-mccarthy-at-the-heartland-institute/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Imperial-Lawless-Obama-610x400.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "A Lawless Administration: Andrew McCarthy at the Heartland Institute"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "McCarthy explained that he was still hopeful for the republic\u2019s future, a hopefulness he expanded upon during the Q&A session after his talk.\nAuthor and former federal prosecutor Andrew C.
