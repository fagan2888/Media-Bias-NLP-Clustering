Mike Pence made the disastrous decision to sign a bill that allowed businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian customers based on the business owner\u2019s religious views.\n\nThe move cost Indiana financially, economically and politically, with Pence now struggling for re-election. The bill was such a debacle that Pence and other supporters were forced to pass an amendment just days later effectively retreating from the discriminatory legislation.\n\nThe House\u2019s State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee is preparing to consider HB 1180 in coming weeks, a bill similar to the Indiana legislation. That would be a bad move all around.\n\nIndiana is not the only example of what not to do. In Georgia, legislators have also debated similar legislation. Business groups in Georgia recently released a study finding passage of a law protecting discrimination could cost the state up to $2 billion in lost business and direct sales.\n\nPut simply, defending discrimination is not just wrong, it is also costly.\n\nThe ink wasn\u2019t even dry on the Indiana bill when major companies began canceling events and conferences there, with some companies and organizations publicly contemplating relocating if the law was allowed to stand.\n\nColorado is no stranger to the negative repercussions of defending discrimination. In 1992, when Colorado voters passed Amendment 2 prohibiting local laws that protected gay and lesbian people from discrimination, we quickly became branded as the \u201cHate State\u201d and saw significant economic blowback as a result.\n\nSince then, Colorado voters have changed dramatically, with polls now showing overwhelming support for gay rights. Not only has Colorado changed, but the Republican Party has as well, as evidenced through a massive upswing in conservative support for gay rights. A 2015 reputable voter survey (conducted by a team of Republican polling firms) found that nearly three in four voters support protecting gays from discrimination at the hands of private businesses otherwise open to the public. While Republicans tend to be less gay-friendly, we still saw 54 percent say \u201cyes\u201d to the protection of gays in the marketplace.\n\nAs conservatives, we believe in the free market. If bigots don\u2019t want to serve certain classes of people, our instinct is to say \u201clet the market decide.\u201d Ultimately, we theorize, the bigots will go out of business.\n\nThis philosophy unfortunately now runs head-first into those who proclaim they need the government to protect their \u201creligious freedom.\u201d While state and federal law protect religious freedom, they do not protect the right to discriminate against those of other religions on all matters outside religious organizations and places of worship.\n\nOur opponents believe more laws are needed to allow businesses to discriminate against gays under the guise of religious freedom. Instead of banning discrimination, backers here demand the right to freely discriminate. As a society, we say \u201cno\u201d to discrimination based on race, gender, national origin and other protected characteristics. Gays deserve to spend their hard-earned dollars at the same place we spend ours.\n\nThere is a better way forward for conservatives. Our ultra-conservative neighbor Utah recently saw historic passage of LGBT job and housing protections. A month later, 71 percent of Utah voters approved of Gov. Gary Hebert.\n\nIn Colorado, we have strong protections both for our LGBT residents and for our people of faith. Let\u2019s keep it that way. No political movement has a copyright on any single civil rights issue.\n\nLaurie Leprino is a political activist. Jessica K.
