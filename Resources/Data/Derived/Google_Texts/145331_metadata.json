But that\u2019s only the start of AFL-CIO\u2019s wishlist.\n\nHow are AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka and other union leaders deciding who\u2019s worthy of the unions\u2019 activist machinery and vast campaign funds for 2016?\n\nAFL-CIO is using Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s \u201cRewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity\u201d as a guide.\n\nIn his report, Stiglitz \u2014 a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics \u2014 called for more federal spending and higher taxes on the rich to combat \u201cincome inequality\u201d and build on \u201cthe innovative legacy of the New Deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cInequality has been a choice, and it is within our power to reverse it,\u201d Stiglitz asserted. \u201cIf anything, a number of redistributive policies can lower net inequality and drive more durable growth.\u201d\n\nStiglitz\u2019s report listed a number of unfulfilled goals shared by AFL-CIO, whose leaders helped ram Obamacare through Congress but have been somewhat disappointed with President Obama\u2019s time in office.\n\nProposals in the report \u2014 few accompanied by cost estimates \u2014 would make Obama\u2019s $830 billion \u201cstimulus\u201d spending bill look like a drop in a bucket.\n\nMany \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d policy prescriptions would be a boon to AFL-CIO\u2019s two largest affiliates, the American Federation of Teachers and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\n\nStiglitz suggested taxpayers should pay for universal preschool, universal Medicare coverage, subsidized child care and more subsidization of college education.\n\nHe recommended increased infrastructure and public transportation spending, too, which would help AFL-CIO\u2019s construction affiliates siphon more union dues from more workers.\n\nOther Stiglitz suggestions, including a national minimum wage hike and universal paid sick leave, would make contract negotiations easier for union bosses by putting sweeping new mandates on employers.\n\nStiglitz was a featured speaker at the July meeting where AFL-CIO interviewed Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O\u2019Malley and Jim Webb.\n\n\u201cProfessor Stiglitz\u2019s voice was a critical presence at the AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting last month,\u201d AFL-CIO senior press secretary Josh Goldstein told Watchdog.org via email.\n\n\u201cThe ideas in his Rewriting the Rules report are part of the guiding principles that drove discussions with five presidential candidates and will be a central part of the measuring stick we use in 2016,\u201d Goldstein said.\n\nAFT has already endorsed Hillary Clinton, but endorsements from other AFL-CIO members \u2014 and AFL-CIO itself \u2014 are still up for grabs.\n\nRELATED: Teacher unions push progressive agenda, but many members aren\u2019t on board\n\nCurtis Dubay, a tax and economic policy researcher at the conservative Heritage Foundation, sees nothing new in the latest left-wing economic report embraced by AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cThe solutions are so boring. They\u2019re rote, liberal policies that they\u2019ve always wanted no matter what the situation is,\u201d Dubay told Watchdog.org. \u201cThey\u2019re just using \u2018inequality\u2019 as a veneer to push policies they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Stiglitz\u2019s tax proposals resembled recommendations from left-wing French economist Thomas Piketty.\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to help those in the middle and lower classes rise up, these policies would hurt those at the top to bring them down,\u201d Dubay said.\n\n\u201cAnd in the process of bringing them down, they\u2019re going to hurt those below by just eviscerating opportunity,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis will have the exact opposite result as what AFL-CIO leaders are saying they want.\u201d\n\nTrumka told Vox.com the coalition will wait for affiliated unions to make their presidential endorsements before an official AFL-CIO decision is reached.\n\nWith labor support for Sanders surging in early July, Trumka warned state and local AFL-CIO chapters not to make presidential endorsements. Though he\u2019s seeking the Democratic nomination, Sanders is an avowed socialist.\n\nStiglitz\u2019s \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d includes the same policy proposals as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s \u201cProgressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality,\u201d which itself resembles Sanders\u2019s presidential platform.\n\nAFL-CIO \u201cis more committed than ever to broad progressive policies,\u201d Trumka said in a press release announcing the July meeting with candidates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wanted: A presidential candidate who will help the AFL-CIO reshape America's economy to better suit the labor coalition.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Wanted: A presidential candidate who will help the AFL-CIO reshape America's economy to better suit the labor coalition.", "title": "Labor union bosses want a president who will 'rewrite the rules' - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/richard-trumka-aflcio-youtube-2015-07-02.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-31T21:55:25+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/233203/union-bosses-rewrite-rules/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Wanted: A presidential candidate who will help the AFL-CIO reshape America's economy to better suit the labor coalition.", "title": "Labor union bosses want a president who will 'rewrite the rules' - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/richard-trumka-aflcio-youtube-2015-07-02.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-08-12T04:00:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-31T21:55:25+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "AFL-CIO, richard trumka, union bosses, afl-cio bosses, rewriting the rules, joseph stiglitz, progressive agenda to combat income inequality, afl-cio presidential endorsement, afl-cio 2016 endorsement"}, "article_summary": "How are AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka and other union leaders deciding who\u2019s worthy of the unions\u2019 activist machinery and vast campaign funds for 2016?\nUnion bosses are always trying to make it easier for unions to organize and harder for workers to opt out of paying dues.\nStiglitz suggested taxpayers should pay for universal preschool, universal Medicare coverage, subsidized child care and more subsidization of college education.\nAFL-CIO is using Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s \u201cRewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity\u201d as a guide.\nWanted: A presidential candidate who will help the AFL-CIO reshape America\u2019s economy to better suit the labor coalition."}
