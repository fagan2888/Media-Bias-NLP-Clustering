Manchester City may give a debut to Stevan Jovetic, but David Silva is out with a thigh problem. Meanwhile Micah Richards is still struggling with a hamstring injury, and Gael Clichy has been ruled out. In addition new signing Martin Demichelis is set to miss six weeks with a knee injury.

City boss Pellegrini will know that the pressure is on due to his surprise loss to Cardiff, and if they lose against Stoke today there will definitely be murmurs of discontent around the City fans.

Pellegrini has changed the team's style somewhat, making sure that they carry more aerial threat. They have had more headed attempts on goal than any other top-flight club and have netted three - compared to just six headed goals last season.
