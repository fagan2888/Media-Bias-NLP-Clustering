Ted Cruz: Obama "Picking And Choosing Which Laws To Follow" Is "Dictatorial"

SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): One of the most disturbing aspects of the Obama presidency is the willingness of this president to disregard the law, to ignore the law. You know, we were talking a few minutes ago about Obamacare. And you mentioned it’s the law of the land. If it’s the law of the land, the president shouldn't keep ignoring the law.



He unilaterally granted an exemption for big business for one year. The law says big business doesn't get an exemption and the president just waved his hand and said, “I am granting them an exemption.” He unilaterally granted an exemption for members of Congress. The law says that members Congress have to be on the exchange without subsidies just like millions of Americans. The president just waved his hand and said, “Ignore that part of the law, I don't want to enforce it.”



And as you noted, when people started getting dismayed that his promise, “If you like your plan, you can keep it,” was demonstrated to be false, he told insurance, “Well, ignore that part of the law for one year.”



A president under a constitutional system doesn't have the ability to pick and choose which laws to follow. And that's the same pattern you see in dictatorial societies, where a leader says, “Ignore the law, go with the power of the president instead of the written law.” That's not the way our constitution is supposed to work.
