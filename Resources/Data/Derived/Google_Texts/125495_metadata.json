Asian American Commission held its health care summit, featuring a presentation on Asian American and Pacific Island health issues by Dr. Howard Koh, at the Boston Foundation on Sept. 10. He was the former U.S. assistant secretary for health nominated in 2009 by President Barack Obama. Koh stepped down in 2014 and is the Harvey V. Fineberg professor of the Practice of Public Health Leadership at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nKoh reported Asians make up about 6 percent \u2014 about 20 million \u2014 of the U.S. population based on census data, but are a fast growing group. Most or 74 percent of Asians are foreign-born and reside in coastal areas. According to population projections, by 2045, the majority of Americans will be of minority background.\n\n\u201cThe theme is most of our community is foreign-born, making it difficult to negotiate the health care system,\u201d Koh said. \u201cMany of us don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak English as a first language.\u201d\n\nDuring Koh\u2019s time in Washington, D.C., the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. Along with making health insurance affordable, the act improved care and required federal data reporting to include seven categories for Asian Americans and four categories for Pacific Islanders.\n\nAsians are a diverse group from a large region, making it hard to generalize health information. \u201cNow we get better data that\u2019s specific and disaggregated, so we can get counted and included,\u201d Koh said.\n\nKoh discussed cancer, hepatitis and mental health, with some forms disproportionately affecting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Health care providers must offer culturally and linguistically appropriate services to address issues.\n\n\u201cHealth is a gift. It\u2019s precious. We have it today, we hope we have it tomorrow,\u201d Koh said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to everyone to protect that.\u201d\n\nThis post is also available in: Chinese", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WPML ver:3.0.1 stt:1,63;0", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c03\"", "article_summary": "Asian American Commission held its health care summit, featuring a presentation on Asian American and Pacific Island health issues by Dr. Howard Koh, at the Boston Foundation on Sept. 10.\nHealth care providers must offer culturally and linguistically appropriate services to address issues.\nKoh stepped down in 2014 and is the Harvey V.
