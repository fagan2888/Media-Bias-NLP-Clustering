Dirty. Low-paying.\n\nThose are just a few of the things\n\nArielle Holland had in mind when she first considered taking a job at Baldor Electric Company, a manufacturer with a plant in Flowery Branch.\n\n\u201cBefore I worked here, I had a very stereotypical view of factories in my head,\u201d said the 18-year-old Johnson High School senior.\n\nStereotypes, however, are meant to be upended. With experience, reality replaces the cliche.\n\nAnd so Holland has found the industry rewarding in many ways.\n\n\u201cI really enjoy my job here,\u201d she said.\n\nManufacturing isn\u2019t what it used to be in the United States, but young students and workers like Holland show a promising future for the industry.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the quality of manufacturing suffers. To the contrary, \u201cMade in America\u201d still holds cache.\n\nBut perhaps no other industry has been hit harder by the economic recession, outsourcing and subsequent job losses in the past decade.\n\nOne-third of all manufacturing jobs were shed between 2000 and 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAnd depending on various counts, between five and six million industry jobs were lost over the last 15 years.\n\nToday, the industry employs about 12 million people, or about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s workforce, according to the BLS.\n\nJob losses, however, aren\u2019t the only sore spot in the industry.\n\nWith an aging and retiring workforce, many in the manufacturing sector are looking to the future with a cautious eye.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a motor manufacturing pool of employees out there,\u201d said Mike Holman, Baldor plant manager.\n\nThe need for skilled workers is greater than ever, particularly with technological advances, and as demand for services grows, so too does the hole in the manufacturing workforce.\n\nAbout one-quarter of all workers in Hall County are employed in some kind of goods-producing job, according to the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce, making it a critical backbone of the local economy.\n\nTo understand just how great the need is for new talent, the Chamber created a workforce development task force in the last year, and part of the group\u2019s job included a thorough survey of local manufacturing companies.\n\nThe results were revealing, though not all unexpected.\n\nThe biggest complaints from companies included the lack of qualified applicants, and succession planning is a major concern as businesses look forward.\n\nOf 58 local manufacturers that participated in Chamber\u2019s survey, 25 percent reported not employing high school students, but showed interest in doing so.\n\nShelley Davis, the Chamber\u2019s vice president of existing industry, believes high school students are an untapped resource in Hall County, and the Chamber is committed to removing barriers between employers and this pool of workers, she said.\n\nBut a major hurdle is convincing companies to take a chance on young workers.\n\nAccording to the Chamber\u2019s survey, companies reported job readiness as the biggest reason why they were hesitant to hire students.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a sustainable workforce,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey don\u2019t just want warm bodies.\u201d\n\nBut a natural pipeline is in place to connect students and manufacturing companies.\n\nThe Chamber is seeking ways to interest young applicants and established companies, while involving local school systems through work-based learning programs, which allows students time to hold down jobs and receive credits while attending school.\n\nAbout 800 students in the county participate in work-based learning programs, but just 2 percent have jobs in manufacturing.\n\nDavis said the Chamber\u2019s next steps include changing perceptions about manufacturing, just like those once held by Holland.\n\nShe said she hopes to grow enrollment in the local manufacturing sector among high school students by 2 percent over the next year or so.\n\nThe Chamber is also encouraging manufacturing businesses to sponsor school clubs and host tours of their facilities for students, something Baldor Electric has done.\n\nIf local manufacturing companies are committed hiring and training young workers interested in a career path, Holland shines as an example of the possible benefits.\n\nBaldor builds industrial motors for a variety of uses. The motors can range in size from a soup can to half a car length, with up to 12,000 horsepower.\n\n\u201cMost of them you\u2019ll never see in your life,\u201d Holman said.\n\nBaldor\u2019s top clients include the oil and gas industry, as well as the U.S. Navy, which uses Baldor motors on warships.\n\nHolman said he started working for Baldor in a seasonal role as a college student nearly 30 years ago, working his way up from the production line to plant manager.\n\nSo he understands the importance and value of young, educated workers like Holland.\n\n\u201cSo for us, taking a blank slate is really a good thing,\u201d he said, adding that Baldor has long been committed to training and employing high school and college-age workers.\n\nHolman said Holland\u2019s work ethic, enthusiasm and willingness to learn are bright spots for the company.\n\nAnd it\u2019s evident among her co-workers, who love hearing about her interests, or relish a little fun gossip about what color hair Holland will have from day to day.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just companies like Baldor that benefit.\n\nHolland said she was working 50 hours a week at Kroger before starting her manufacturing job, which pays more, has better hours and provides her invaluable education for a career in a field she excels at.\n\nHolland said she has learned about business management, production and assembly, all of which prepare her for future studies.\n\nHolland will graduate from Johnson High in May, and has been accepted to the University of North Georgia, where she will enroll in the fall.\n\nHolland said she plans to pursue studies in business management, and also her passion for theater and film.\n\nAnd when school ends and the day comes to enter the working world for good, Holland said her experience at Baldor, not to mention the good pay, has opened options for a career path.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity I have here,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/108927/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/04/06/0404WORKFORCE_0004.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tough.
