Gaming operators are now being required to either turn away gamblers they know work in state-sanctioned marijuana businesses or implement highly invasive and expensive procedures to monitor these gamblers.\n\nThese same costly procedures have resulted in the banking industry closing thousands of financial accounts in the last few years. Banks have essentially blacklisted anyone in the marijuana business from opening a checking or savings account.\n\nOn Thursday, Jim Dowling, a former White House advisor on money laundering issues and now a regulatory consultant to casinos, told gaming executives they are obligated to follow the same marijuana guidelines as banks.\n\n\u201cCasinos can\u2019t accept any money from them, or they have to comply with the new government guidance,\u201d Dowling said.\n\nIn order for a casino to knowingly accept a bet from someone in the marijuana industry, it would need to perform what Dowling described as a \u201ccriminal background check\u201d and then file reports every 90 days to federal regulators on the gambler\u2019s activities.\n\nEven then, the casinos cannot be certain the federal government will not pursue criminal or civil charges against them.\n\nWhile this will likely not prevent a marijuana dispensary owner from going to the blackjack table and plunking down $20, problems arise if a card dealer or pit boss recognizes the dispensary owner or if a large enough sum is wagered that would require the casino to research the gambler\u2019s source of income.\n\nIn that case, the casino would have to cut gamblers off or run a background check and monitor their gambling.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Coming to a Head\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is a federal problem that has been brewing for a while, and now it\u2019s coming to a head,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cState laws and federal laws don\u2019t match up.\u201d\n\nThursday was the first time the topic of state-authorized marijuana proceeds and casinos had been publicly broached, Dowling said.\n\nThe head of FinCEN, a bureau of the Treasury Department that regulates casinos and banks to ensure they follow these rules, also spoke at Thursday\u2019s industry conference.\n\nDirector Jennifer Shasky Calvery referred questions regarding marijuana and casino compliance to her media spokesman.\n\n\u201cFinCEN\u2019s guidance applies to all financial institutions covered under FinCEN regulations, including casinos,\u201d Stephan Hudak wrote in an email, in apparent confirmation of Dowling\u2019s assessment.\n\nPaul Camacho, who manages these issues for Station Casinos, which operates the newly opened Graton Resort & Casino in Rohnert Park, declined comment, saying he was not authorized to speak to the media. A call to the Station Casinos media representative was not returned by the time of publication.\n\nThe Graton Casino operates in a region the federal government deems a \u201cHigh Intensity Financial Crime Area\u201d because of the large amount of marijuana grown on California\u2019s North Coast. As a result, the Rohnert Park casino is required to implement additional monitoring to identify people who might be gambling with illicit funds, which according to the federal government includes money from medical marijuana businesses.\n\nOngoing Conflict Between the Feds and States\n\nCasinos are the latest institutions to get caught up in the ongoing conflict between federal and state laws on marijuana. Thursday\u2019s disclosure on federal policy comes only months after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder appeared to publicly support the right of state-authorized marijuana businesses to have access to the U.S. financial system and deposit their money.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want just huge amounts of cash in these places. They want to be able to use the banking system,\u201d Holder said during an appearance at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cThere\u2019s a public safety component to this. Huge amounts of cash \u2014 substantial amounts of cash just kind of lying around with no place for it to be appropriately deposited \u2014 is something that would worry me, just from a law enforcement perspective.\u201d\n\nThe North Coast has notoriously high amounts of cash transactions, with one Mendocino County banker saying more than half the deposits there are in cash, making it one of the highest ratios in the country.\n\nFollowing Holder\u2019s statement in February, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Treasury Department both issued updated guidelines on how U.S. financial institutions need to handle customers with ties to the marijuana industry.\n\nOne dispensary owner in San Francisco said he has gone through nine banks in 10 years.\n\nBut banking executives said the new guidelines did nothing to assuage their fears, leaving them open to both criminal and civil prosecution if they worked with businesses in the marijuana trade.\n\n\u201cBankers are all just saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want those problems,\u2019 \u201d said Dowling, who also consults on these issues for major U.S. banks. \u201cOne banker called them toxic.\u201d\n\nDowling expects casinos will react the same way, turning away from people who work in the state-sanctioned marijuana industries that now operate in 22 states and D.C.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is again saying people involved in the marijuana business don\u2019t have rights,\u201d said Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group.\n\nA dispensary owner in San Francisco, who asked not to be named because of previous regulatory problems with the federal government, said he has gone through nine banks in 10 years.\n\n\u201cAt the core, it\u2019s just the hypocrisy of the federal government and its financial regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say one thing but they are really acting a whole other way.\u201d\n\nAnother dispensary owner in Mendocino County, who likewise asked not to be named because of previous problems with federal regulators, said the U.S. government is ignoring the voters.\n\n\u201cThe federal government doesn\u2019t care about our state laws,\u201d the owner said. \u201cIt\u2019s dead wrong. It\u2019s one more right they are taking away from us.\u201d\n\nDowling said he decided to raise the issue at Thursday\u2019s conference because the federal government could prosecute casinos that are not complying with the new guidelines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very controversial. I\u2019ll probably get a lot of hate mail for bringing it up,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cBut if you put yourself in a banker\u2019s situation, would you want to have to do all that and put yourself at criminal risk?\u201d\n\nIronically, this all comes less than two weeks after a surprising bipartisan vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which passed a measure that seeks to end Department of Justice interference with state marijuana laws. Medical marijuana advocates praised the vote as a game-changer and one that reflected a huge shift in public opinion.\n\nNathan Halverson is a freelance reporter working at The Center for Investigative Reporting and Investigative Reporting Program and can be reached at Halverson@sonic.net.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Guidelines impact all casinos from Northern California to riverboat casinos in Mississippi to Las Vegas.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Feds Warn Casinos to Turn Away Gamblers With Medical Marijuana Ties\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/06\\/12\\/2014\\/-medical-marijuana-banks-casinos-federal-regulation\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-12 17:20:56\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-16 19:18:20\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":138994,\"author_id\":\"236\",\"author_name\":\"KQED News Staff\",\"author_display_name\":\"KQED News Staff\",\"tags\":[\"banks\",\"jim dowling\",\"medical marijuana\"],\"categories\":[\"Law and Justice\",\"Politics and Government\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2011\\/10\\/MedicalMarijuanaBag070811.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "Guidelines impact all casinos from Northern California to riverboat casinos in Mississippi to Las Vegas.", "title": "Feds Warn Casinos to Turn Away Gamblers With Medical Marijuana Ties", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/06/12/2014/-medical-marijuana-banks-casinos-federal-regulation/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2012/03/MedicalMarijuanaJustinSullivanGetty1-e1392680232523.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "banks,jim dowling,medical marijuana", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7af\"", "article_summary": "The marijuana guidelines impact all casinos, from Northern California to riverboat casinos in Mississippi to mega-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\u201cState laws and federal laws don\u2019t match up.\u201dThursday was the first time the topic of state-authorized marijuana proceeds and casinos had been publicly broached, Dowling said.\nGaming operators are now being required to either turn away gamblers they know work in state-sanctioned marijuana businesses or implement highly invasive and expensive procedures to monitor these gamblers.\nMedical marijuana advocates praised the vote as a game-changer and one that reflected a huge shift in public opinion.\n\u201cCasinos can\u2019t accept any money from them, or they have to comply with the new government guidance,\u201d Dowling said."}
