Ted Cruz on Friday became the first 2016 presidential candidates to sign the \u201cTaxpayer Protection Pledge.\u201d\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization, has been asking candidates since 1986 to simply pledge to \u201coppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to the American people, Senator Paul continues to protect American taxpayers against higher taxes,\u201d said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz understands that government should be reformed so that it takes and spends less of the taxpayers\u2019 money, and will oppose tax increases that paper over and continue the failures of the past,\u201d Norquist also said.\n\nAll Republican presidential candidates, except for Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, signed the pledge in 2012.\n\nA spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has spoken out against signing pledges of any kind, has suggested the Republican will not add his name to ATR\u2019s pledge if he runs.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Bush decides to move forward, he will not sign any pledges circulated by lobbying groups,\u201d Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told Reuters in February. \u201cHis record on tax cuts is clear.
