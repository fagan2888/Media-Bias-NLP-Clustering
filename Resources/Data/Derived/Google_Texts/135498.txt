A coloring book starring Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is selling like hotcakes on Amazon.Called " Cruz To The Future ," the $5.39 book is the No. 1 best-seller on the company's website in the coloring books category — and even beats "Stars Wars" and "Angry Birds" coloring books.Published by Really Big Coloring Books, it contains quotes from the tea-party senator as well as details about his life along with drawings of him that kids — or even his older supporters — can color in.In one sketch, it shows Cruz holding a rifle while wearing a hunting jacket, and the words, "Second Amendment — The Right to Bear Arms" written above his head.In another sketch, the Republican senator is standing in front of a podium in the Senate delivering his 21-hour speech in an attempt to prevent the disastrous launch of the Affordable Care Act."A lot of the career establishment politicians are far too out of shape, old, or overweight to even perform such a magnificent feat," he is quoted as saying about his marathon session. "God bless them all," he adds.The book, which is part of the coloring book company's series called "Tell the Truth, Tell it Often," also includes the 10 Commandments and the Pledge of Allegiance, along with Cruz's views on them while he also gives his opinion on small business."The book is suitable for any student desk in America, as millions of people across the country admire, respect, and portray Mr. Cruz as a positive role model for children," said publisher Wayne Bell, who did not ask for permission from Cruz before writing the book.Pointing out that the book is not an endorsement of the senator, but an educational tool, he added, "Parents have told our company they enjoy modern day heroes and positive role models in children's literature, and Mr. Cruz as a sitting U.S. senator certainly meets the criteria."In the Amazon review , it says, "Not only do pages describe Cruz's early years, education, and tea party stance in an easy way for parents and educators to explain to their children and students, but crossword puzzles and words searches along with other games and activities provide thought-provoking information and steps for more research."The Dallas Morning News says it would make a great Cruz-mas present for kids of all ages and says other Republicans could donate $10 to the Senate Conservatives Fund and receive a bumper sticker saying, "Ted Cruz Was Right." The sticker refers to Cruz's battle to defund the Affordable Care Act.Really Big Coloring Books, which has its headquarters in St. Louis, Mo., also has a 9/11 coloring book in which youngsters can take their crayons to a picture of Osama bin Laden's assassination.
