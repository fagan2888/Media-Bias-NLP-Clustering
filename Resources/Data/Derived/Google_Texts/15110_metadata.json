[Watch the video of his presentation here, or in the player embedded below.]\n\nTroy, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, is the rare presidential historian who has also served as a high-level White House aide. Confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2007 as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the George W. Bush administration, Troy is now recognized as an expert on health care policy. Having earned his doctorate in American Civilization at the University of Texas at Austin, Troy is also the author of Intellectuals and the American Presidency.\n\nAs an icebreaker, figuratively speaking now that Lake Michigan is mostly frozen over, Troy acknowledged being in Obama\u2019s home town, and spoke about Obama\u2019s Chicago connections \u2014 before digressing into Obama\u2019s recent State of the Union address by noting how these annual addresses are continuing to receive less and less attention. While 67 million watched Clinton address the nation, Obama\u2019s recent State of the Union address captured only 30 million listeners.\n\nFurther noted was how seldom memorable phases occur in a State of the Union address which linger on to elevate an address above the ordinary run-of-the-mill. Such was the situation with Obama\u2019s recent State of the Union Address. But that didn\u2019t stop Twitter from lighting up with nearly 2 million tweets expressing support of disdain for what they heard Obama say.\n\nInitially as a way to market his book, Troy considered calling it From Cicero to Snooki: How Culture Shapes Our Presidents. What made Troy believe Snooki and Cicero could exist in the same title? As Troy explained, he recognized Obama\u2019s affinity for pop culture, observed during the time of the Congressional battle over Obama\u2019s health-care bill. President Obama told a joke at the White House Correspondents Dinner that zeroed in on Snooki and Minority Speaker John Boehner, referencing the indoor tanning tax within Obamacare. Not long afterwards, however, Obama denied knowing who Snooki was when appearing on The View.\n\nPerhaps fortunate for Troy is that his submitted title proposal wasn\u2019t a hit with his publisher, who thought it made no sense to link the names of Cicero and Snooki together. The two names just didn\u2019t overlap in any way. Snooki was but a \u201cflash in the pan\u201d pop media sensation (the reality TV show featuring Snooki wasn\u2019t even around during the presidency of George W. Bush) whereas the collected works of Cicero are just as relevant today. Which led Troy to an unanswered question: \u201cIs it better to have a president who knows about Snooki or one who doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nPrompted by his publisher\u2019s rejection, Tevi Troy settled on What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 year of Popular Culture in the White House as a way to tell the story of how our presidents have been shaped by popular culture. And what a delightful and entertaining story Tevi Troy had to tell as he regaled his attentive Heartland audience with fascinating tidbits of information that only stoked the fire to learn more about how presidents have affected the culture and culture has affected them as set forth in Troy\u2019s book.\n\nIn Thomas Jefferson\u2019s day, only two \u201cpop culture\u201d options were available: Reading books and attending live performances, and 18th century presidents availed themselves to both. Even though books were very expensive, Thomas Jefferson had a library of 6,000 books. John Adams\u2019 library consisted of 3,000. Books shaped the American Revolution, which shaped our nation. It was the writings of John Locke, Troy said, which formed the basis for our Constitution. Not well known is that the early colonists were literate \u2014 likely to have a Bible and Shakespeare in their homes. Thus a concept of governing evolved that called for an enlightened leader to preside over an educated populace.\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century every president had attended at least one live theater performance. Presidents even went on good-will tours to be seen. As theatrical performances could vary as to the actors of stage, and the way the audience reacted to the dialogue, political expression developed.\n\nSuch was the situation in the reelection bid of President John Quincy Adams in 1828 \u2014 when Andrew Jackson defeated first term incumbent Adams, having first lost to Adams in his bid for president in1824 in an election decided by the House of Representatives. The win of Adams over Jackson in 1824 was known as a \u201ccorrupt bargain,\u201d angering Jackson supporters. So it was during a Washington, D.C. theatrical performance with John Quincy Adams present in the audience that ad lib dialogue by actors conveyed comments favorable to Andrew Jackson. This was enough to give Jackson more than the edge he needed to defeat Adams handily in 1828. The unschooled Jackson was seen as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d and it irked Adams that Jackson was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard, Adams\u2019 own alma mater.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was likewise good at conveying the common touch, according to Troy. Lincoln knew how to speak to the people in the language they understood. Lincoln also loved books and was obsessed with reading. In light of how expensive books were, and not being a wealthy man, Lincoln owned only a limited number of books \u2014 among them being the Bible, Shakespeare, and Aesop\u2019s Fables, from which Lincoln learned how to tell tales that resonated with voters. Books elevated Lincoln from his humble beginnings and into a self-educated man, proof that America was a land where one could rise up from poverty to become successful and even become president.\n\nWhile the railroad was an important technical development in the 19th century, radio emerged as a seismic change in the 20th century. President Warren G. Harding was the first president to use the radio to get his message out, reaching the then amazing total of 125,000 Americans. President Calvin Coolidge was likewise skilled in the use of the radio, using this tool effectively as a savvy radio operator.\n\nFDR was a skilled radio operator, even before being elected president 1932, Troy said. Roosevelt was the first president who shaped his speeches, not for the people in the room, but for the many listening at home. Although Roosevelt is now known for his \u201cfireside chats,\u201d FDR only gave them a few times a year because he didn\u2019t want to over-expose himself to the American people.\n\nTroy noted in his talk taht Roosevelt took his radio speeches very seriously \u2014 proven by the fact that he used special paper that didn\u2019t crackle when turning pages, and FDR\u2019s insertion of a false tooth in the front of his mouth to eliminate a whistling sound when he spoke. Roosevelt also crossed out all the \u201cfancy words\u201d his speech-writers gave him, Troy said, so he could better connect with the common folk. FDR was so fixated on appearing as \u201cman of the people,\u201d he served hot dogs to the Queen of England on her visit to the White House. Could it ever happen today that Roosevelt\u2019s bout with polio, leaving him wheel chair bound during his presidency, was unknown to most Americans? The media stuck to publishing photos of Roosevelt minus any hint of a wheelchair.\n\nFDR also exploited the Silver Screen\u2019s ability to distribute political messages. Roosevelt made use of the film industry indirectly to protect him and also gathered celebrities round him for their support \u2014 who never depicted him in a wheelchair.\n\nIt was with the introduction of TV that presidential politics and the culture were redefined, Troy said. A novelty during the presidency of Harry Truman, it came to be a make-or-break medium in presidential politics. By 1956 percent 73 percent of American homes were in areas capable of receiving TV programming.\n\nPresident Eisenhower was the first president to host a televised press conference. What is still considered Ike\u2019s most famous presidential speeches of all time is his televised farewell address in which he warned of the dangers of the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex.\u201d\n\nIke, the first presidential TV junkie, especially liked I Love Lucy. It just so happened that the birth episode of little Ricky happened during the time of Ike\u2019s Inaugural speech in 1953. To Ike\u2019s chagrin at the time, the I Love Lucy episode received more viewers than did his inaugural ceremony. TV did remain a problem for Ike during his campaign. It made Ike look old and gray and lacking the appearance of a war hero. Hollywood adviser Robert Montgomery was brought in to help perk up Ike\u2019s image, Troy said.\n\nTV certainly played a part in the September 1960 Nixon/Kennedy election, which featured the nation\u2019s first televised debate. Ike, Troy noted, had warned Nixon not to debate Kennedy on TV, realizing Kennedy\u2019s superior ability in projecting himself favorably \u2014 and all who watched the Nixon/Kennedy TV debate declared Kennedy the winner. While Kennedy came off as calm and confident, Nixon appeared sickly and sweaty. Radio listeners actually picked Nixon as the winner. Kennedy would never have won the presidency had TV not been so unkind to Nixon.\n\nWhen elected, Kennedy skillfully used TV and excelled at doing unedited live news conferences. Note from the Troy presentation: Kennedy was warned by his advisors about being too close to Hollywood celebrities. We know now that Kennedy for the most part disregarded this advice.\n\nSkipping ahead, we all now live in the era of generations raised in the 24-hour news cycle on TV \u2014 and worse, the era of Twitter and Facebook, of which Obama is a master. The one time Obama\u2019s father came to visit young Obama in Hawaii, Troy said, he tried to get Obama\u2019s grandparents to turn off the \u201ccontraption,\u201d upset that his son was watching too much TV.\n\n\n\nObama still likes to watch TV \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 and favors shows watched by the \u201c1 percent\u201d of Americans, rather than the \u201c99 percent.\u201d Obama\u2019s publicly expressed favorite shows, Troy said, are Homeland, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, Entourage, and The Wire \u2014 all on premium pay-cable. Once, when told about a sleeper terrorist cell, Obama replied that it sounded like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Troy said.\n\nIn the 2012 match-up between Mitt Romney and President Obama, the incumbent president used pop culture to his advantage by appearing on soft media venues like \u201cThe View\u201d and Leno \u2014 making Obama the first president to go on a late night TV show. Romney, in contrast, appeared dated. When asked about a favorite movie, Romney chose a 1986 movie, Bueller\u2019s Day Off, which didn\u2019t resonate with the younger crowd. Hanging out with celebrities also helped Obama look better and provided him with a platform to amplify his message, thereby contributing to his wins in 2008 and 2012.\n\nTroy said, however, that there was a positive message for Republicans. He believes conservatives are in a better position today than they were thirty years ago to have their message heard, although liberals continue to have the advantage in pop culture, Hollywood, and messaging through film.\n\nDiscounting the Republican disadvantage with Hollywood and the mainstream media, conservatives do own the talk media. Troy noted that recently Duck Dynasty has become associated with conservative TV viewing. Knowing how to engage in the cultural battle is essential to a winning strategy.\n\nTroy\u2019s book contains a wealth of material following its final and eleventh chapter. Featured is a comprehensive \u201cnotes\u201d section \u2014 which, chapter by chapter, tells the location of the presented material. There is also a helpful index to easily locate the references made throughout the book. (I was most interested in the Appendix with its \u201cRules for Presidents Engaging in Pop Culture.\u201d It would behoove Republican candidates to read up on these rules.\n\n: On February 13Troy wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal titled, \u201cThe Presidential Bible Class,\u201d which features information presented in his book.]\n\nWatch the video of his presentation below:\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/02/presidents-day-and-tevi-troys-book-a-perfect-match/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/presidents-day.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Presidents Day and Tevi Troy\u2019s Book a Perfect Match"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca180\"", "article_summary": "Initially as a way to market his book, Troy considered calling it From Cicero to Snooki: How Culture Shapes Our Presidents.\nPresident Obama told a joke at the White House Correspondents Dinner that zeroed in on Snooki and Minority Speaker John Boehner, referencing the indoor tanning tax within Obamacare.\nIn Thomas Jefferson\u2019s day, only two \u201cpop culture\u201d options were available: Reading books and attending live performances, and 18th century presidents availed themselves to both.\nAs Troy explained, he recognized Obama\u2019s affinity for pop culture, observed during the time of the Congressional battle over Obama\u2019s health-care bill.\nWhat made Troy believe Snooki and Cicero could exist in the same title?"}
