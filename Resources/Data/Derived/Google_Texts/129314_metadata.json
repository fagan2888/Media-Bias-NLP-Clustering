Marco Rubio called on congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday to repeal an Affordable Care Act (ACA) provision allowing for the potential bailout of health insurance companies that have lost money under Obamacare.\n\nThe presidential hopeful suggested a policy rider removing the risk corridors provision be added to the omnibus appropriations bill \u2014 a crucial piece of legislation that could lead to a government shutdown if it isn\u2019t passed by its Dec. 11 deadline.\n\n\u201cIf the only way ObamaCare can continue is for taxpayers to bail out health insurers that lose money because of it, that\u2019s as good an indication as any that the whole law should be repealed and replaced,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is our responsibility to completely shield the U.S. taxpayer from a deal in the Omnibus that might reimburse health insurers retroactively for these losses or any other future losses.\n\nInsurers losing money under the president\u2019s landmark legislation recently came into the spotlight as UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurance providers, threatened to pull out of the ObamaCare exchanges after sustaining sizable losses.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNBC, Ipsita Smolinski, an analyst and managing director at Capitol Street, said ACA has resulted in insurance companies losing around $2.5 billion since 2014.\n\nWhile insurers asked the ObamaCare risk corridor program for $2.87 billion, the Department of Health and Human Services announced last month it will pay just $362 million.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: the reason these health insurance companies are enduring a financial loss is that ObamaCare is a disastrous law,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt broke the promise to lower health insurance premiums and allow Americans to keep their health care. Now the very architects of this law are attempting to place taxpayers on the hook.\u201d\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
