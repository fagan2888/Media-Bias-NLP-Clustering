WASHINGTON– GOP front-runner Donald Trump is questioning rival Sen. Ted Cruz’s faith, painting Cruz as a hypocrite for calling himself a Christian “when he lies so much and is so dishonest.”

Trump listed his grievances on Twitter, along with a few insults. Cruz has campaigned telling voters Trump supports Obamacare. Trump says he would insure all Americans, by negotiating with hospitals to cover the uninsured and previously supported a single-payer plan. Since his campaign launch, Trump has touted he. like Cruz, would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Cruz, the son of a Baptist preacher, has rallied support from evangelicals in early voting states, often quoting scripture on the campaign trail.

Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage.” Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016

If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016

Cruz has also hit Trump on eminent domain calling the New York businessman “sleazy” for trying to level the house of an elderly woman for a limousine parking lot in Atlantic City.
