I think not. And I say this as someone who is an immigration reformer, not a restrictionist.\n\nThe free movement of trade, capital, and labor is strongly pro-growth. History shows that legal immigration is good for America, economic growth, entrepreneurship, job creation, and hard-working families. America must remain a city on a hill, attracting the best and brightest from around the world \u2014 a beacon of freedom.\n\nThe trouble is, Obama\u2019s executive actions not only usurp powers that are not his, they don\u2019t really solve key immigration problems.\n\nMainly, not even Obama is attempting to increase visas (that are the purview of Congress). Therefore there\u2019s no clear legal immigration process for the most important group: the high-tech brainiacs who are likely to be the entrepreneurial engines of new business start-ups and overall job-creating growth.\n\nTight limits on high-skilled worker visas and the whole whacky system of green-card, permanent-resident status are not being fixed. This can only happen through legislative change. In other words, Congress has to act (in this and a dozen other places).\n\nSo the Silicon Valley crowd is not cheering Obama\u2019s executive actions.\n\nFor example, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a trade organization representing nearly 400 tech companies, says the brainiac H-1B visas that are capped at 65,000 a year should at least be doubled. They also want some kind of legal status for science and math students. While Obama\u2019s action may let these students finish their studies without deportation, it\u2019s vague whether they can stay after that.\n\nAs Michael Barone has noted, it\u2019s the high-tech brainiacs that we want to invite and protect. They are more important than the low-wage groups. Even big-business advocates, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable are underwhelmed by Obama\u2019s actions. Chamber president Tom Donohue told Fortune.com, \u201cMeaningful and lasting immigration reform can only be achieved through the enactment of bipartisan legislation.\u201d (Italics mine.)\n\nSo here\u2019s Obama breaking all kinds of constitutional rules and losing important support.\n\nAnother problem is that Obama\u2019s plan is not going to have much economic impact. His Council of Economic Advisors is predicting a GDP increase of 0.4 percent after ten years, a 0.3 percent increase in average wages, and a reduction in the federal budget deficit of $25 billion. Virtually no change.\n\nIn their report, the council also says the economy will do slightly better because of increased innovation from high-skilled workers. But as noted, we\u2019re not going to get any more high-skilled workers because the president has no authority to issue them visas.\n\nThen there\u2019s the likelihood that the president\u2019s executive actions have \u201cpoisoned the well.\u201d If so, a bunch of economic growth measures will never go through. To my lights, the most important is business tax reform. A new Republican Congress is already very close to a compromise position that would lower tax rates for both C-corps and pass-through S-corps and LLCs. Repatriation of U.S. cash abroad is in that mix. Even President Obama has talked about a corporate-tax-reform compromise.\n\nBut with all the bad blood on immigration, the chances for a job-creating bill like this are very low. Perhaps the GOP will pass a good corporate tax cut, put it on the president\u2019s desk, and let him veto it, knowing they\u2019ll have a good 2016 campaign issue. But the U.S. economy could use that supply-side stimulus today, rather than in several more years.\n\nThe same is true for trade promotion. Free-trade bills are like tax cuts \u2014 everyone benefits. It\u2019s a global world, even for small businesses that would benefit from lower tariffs with Europe and Asia. And consumers would be the huge beneficiaries of lower-cost purchases. But this, too, will probably be stymied by the battle over immigration.\n\nThere are things in Obama\u2019s plan that look okay, such as the legalization of illegal parents who have been in the country for over five years, expanded eligibility for work permits, and increased eligibility for the so-called Dreamers who were brought into the country illegally. Another positive is the denial of access to Obamacare, food stamps, and other federal benefits. And there is no pathway to citizenship.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I can trust the president on border security. Nor do I know if Republicans can or will put together an alternative immigration plan. All that\u2019s up in the air. But what I think I know is that the failure to solve the brainiac visa problem is a huge mistake.\n\nOf course, all this could have been fixed. If the president had come to the GOP leadership and said, \u201cGive me something in a couple of months,\u201d the whole immigration problem could be solved. But he didn\u2019t.\n\nSo now even I\u2019m saying it looks like this game is not worth the candle.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Fri, 2014-11-21 18:00", "sailthru.author": "Larry Kudlow", "description": "Is this immigration game really worth the candle?
