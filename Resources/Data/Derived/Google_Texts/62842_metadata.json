Fortune\n\nKatherine Zaleski was once a cynical twenty-something who saw working mothers as an obstacle in her business decisions: she found herself silently judging them and avoiding making deals with them. Now, her view on the matter has completely changed, because she\u2019s just had a child of her own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how horrible I\u2019d been \u2014 until I had a child of my own,\u201d Zaleski admits in a Fortune piece she wrote recently, apologizing to working mothers for her younger self. \u201cFor mothers in the workplace, it\u2019s death by a thousand cuts \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s other women holding the knives.\u201d\n\nZaleski, who was a former manager at The Huffington Post and the Washington Post, is now CEO and president of her own company called PowerToFly, which aims to help working mothers work from home.\n\nAt the time, it was easy for her to judge women who skipped happy hours, scheduled later meetings, or wanted to work from home for the sake of their children. But it wasn\u2019t until now that she was fully able to empathize with their plight. Working mothers are often forced, unfairly, to choose between career and kids \u2014 and Zaleski realized she didn\u2019t want to do either, but rather find a balance. This is what motivated PowerToFly.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s the working moms of the world who are masters at getting things done.\n\n\u201cI wish I had known five years ago, as a young, childless manager, that mothers are the people you need on your team,\u201d Zaleski writes in her article. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying that \u2018if you want something done then ask a busy person to do it.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly why I like working with mothers now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "katharine zaleski, working mothers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new mother reflects on her past judgments on working mothers, and her online apology goes viral.", "title": "Female CEO Apologizes To Working Mothers Now That She\u2019s Become One [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/female-ceo-apologizes-working-mothers-i-didnt-realize-how-horrible-id-been-until-i-324870", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/07/zaleski.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new mother reflects on her past judgments on working mothers, and her online apology goes viral.", "title": "Female CEO Apologizes To Working Mothers Now That She\u2019s Become One [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/female-ceo-apologizes-working-mothers-i-didnt-realize-how-horrible-id-been-until-i-324870", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/07/zaleski.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/07/zaleski.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-07T17:38:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-07T17:41:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new mother reflects on her past judgments on working mothers, and her online apology goes viral."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce845\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how horrible I\u2019d been \u2014 until I had a child of my own,\u201d Zaleski admits in a Fortune piece she wrote recently, apologizing to working mothers for her younger self.\n\"Value their output, not their time in the chair,\" Zaleski, now herself a working mother, tells companies who employ women with children.\nWorking mothers are often forced, unfairly, to choose between career and kids \u2014 and Zaleski realized she didn\u2019t want to do either, but rather find a balance.\nFortuneKatherine Zaleski was once a cynical twenty-something who saw working mothers as an obstacle in her business decisions: she found herself silently judging them and avoiding making deals with them.\nNow, her view on the matter has completely changed, because she\u2019s just had a child of her own."}
