Damian Myers, an associate at Proskauer Rose, and Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, discuss the latest republican victory in their longstanding fight against Obamacare, which came after federal judge Rosemary Collyer ruled that the House of Representatives had legal standing to sue the president over how he was enforcing the Affordable Care Act. In a ruling on Thursday, Collyer took down a key part of the healthcare plan, which would reduce consumers’ out of pocket medical expenses, arguing that it is unconstitutional because it relied on money that had not been appropriated by Congress. They speak with Bloomberg Radio’s June Grasso and Michael Best.
