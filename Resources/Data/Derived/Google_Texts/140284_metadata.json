James Lankford, R-Okla.; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; and Mike Lee, R-Utah, last week sent a letter to Fadi Chehad\u00e9, chief executive officer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), inquiring about an apparent conflict of interest posed by his co-chairmanship of an advisory body for the upcoming World Internet Conference.\n\nIn their letter, the senators say Chehad\u00e9\u2019s affiliation with the annual conference organized by China could represent a conflict of interest because of ICANN\u2019s contractual relationship with the federal government. They write:\n\nICANN\u2019s participation in the World Internet Conference is especially concerning because of the Chinese government\u2019s long and established record of restricting free access to the Internet, censoring content, and criminalizing certain forms of online speech.\n\nIn a public meeting last week, Chehad\u00e9 dismissed the Republican senators\u2019 letter as being \u201cabout politics.\u201d\n\nChehad\u00e9 announced in December that he will leave ICANN in March and take a post as co-chairman of the advisory committee for this summer\u2019s World Internet Conference, the third such gathering organized by the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to continue to advocate for global multi-stakeholder governance and a single, open, and interoperable Internet. To avoid any misunderstanding, I wish to confirm again that I have accepted this future role in my personal capacity,\u201d Chehad\u00e9 said in his resignation announcement.\n\n\u2018Give Voice to a Billion People\u2019\n\nICANN is a nonprofit organization contracted with a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce to administer functions associated with the Internet\u2019s domain name system, the results of which can help shape brand identities and ease online searches.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration intends to transfer oversight of domain names to the Internet\u2019s \u201cglobal multistakeholder community.\u201d But amid controversy over the Obama administration move, the agency last year extended its contract with ICANN to the end of September 2016.\n\nIn a statement sent Thursday morning to The Daily Signal, Chehad\u00e9 said he would \u201cstep out of my advisory position\u201d to the Chinese-run conference if it compromised his commitment to \u201cinclusivity.\u201d\n\nReferring to China, he added: \u201cIf we really are inclusive, then it\u2019s important that we find a way to give voice to a billion people.\u201d\n\nThe ICANN chief\u2019s complete statement to The Daily Signal:\n\nIt is important to note that I will assume the advisory committee role with the World Internet Conference (WIC) as an individual, not as the ICANN CEO and only after I have left ICANN next month. My position on the advisory committee to the WIC, along with other members involved in Internet governance, U.S. business, civil society and others, is part time. This is an unpaid position, where I get absolutely no remuneration. I am firmly committed to the inclusive multistakeholder model and that will extend beyond my tenure at ICANN. My work with the advisory committee is an extension of that and I invite everyone to join me in this mission. If we really are inclusive then it\u2019s important that we find a way to give voice to a billion people. And if the committee proves not to support that inclusivity, I will step out of my advisory position.\n\nCruz, Lankford, and Lee request that Chehad\u00e9, who took over ICANN in 2012, confirm or deny his attendance in December at a World Internet Conference advisory committee meeting.\n\nChehad\u00e9 attended the first and second gatherings of the World Internet Conference in 2014 and 2015, according to reports.\n\nThe senators\u2019 letter demands that Chehad\u00e9 clarify his relationship with the conference and whether he believes that his leading role makes ICANN \u201ccomplicit in the Chinese censorship regime.\u201d\n\nThe senators ask Chehad\u00e9 to respond by Feb. 19.\n\nChina\u2019s Role\n\n\u201cChina is home to the largest number of Internet users and a vital, innovative and competitive Internet industry,\u201d Chehad\u00e9 told China Daily in the lead-up to the 2015 conference. \u201cChina has started to gradually take a leading role in the discussion on global Internet governance and a truly inclusive global Internet governance system will be impossible without the participation of China.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has organized an annual World Internet Conference since 2014. China operates the world\u2019s most sophisticated online censorship system, nicknamed the \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping called for \u201ccyber sovereignty\u201d during last year\u2019s conference.\n\nCNN reported that Xi said the international community should \u201crespect the right of individual countries to choose their own path to cyber development, model of cyber regulation and participate on the same footing.\u201d\n\nA New York Times reporter said the newspaper was refused admittance to the two previous conferences, Hong Kong Free Press reported.\n\nThe free-press group Reporters Without Borders and China censorship watchdog GreatFire.org called for a boycott of the conference.\n\nRepresentatives of some of the largest U.S. tech companies\u2014including Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM\u2014attended last year.\n\nAnswers Needed\n\n\u201cIt was unfortunate that the CEO of ICANN chose to lend his credibility and stature to the Chinese effort, and the questions the senators ask are worth having answers to,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig, founder of the homeland security consulting company Red Branch Consulting PLLC and a senior adviser to the Chertoff Group, told The Daily Signal.\n\nRosenzweig has authored a series of articles on ICANN\u2019s contractual relationship with the U.S. government.\n\nIn response to a question posed last Friday during an open ICANN session by Brett D. Schaefer, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Jay Kingham senior research fellow in international regulatory affairs, Chehad\u00e9 said the letter from the three Republican senators was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cYou know that this letter is not driven by anyone really worried about the transition. This is somebody who\u2019s really worried about politics,\u201d Chehad\u00e9 said.\n\nChehad\u00e9 also said he would correct the letter\u2019s \u201cmistaken characterization\u201d in a formal response by clarifying that his advisory role for the conference \u201cwas not done in my ICANN capacity and that the advisory council has not met yet.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, however, the committee met in December on the sidelines of the World Internet Conference.\n\nChehad\u00e9 also said last Friday that he would deny any possibility of personal gain, which he said could constitute a conflict of interest. Observers should \u201cresist the temptation\u201d to politicize ICANN\u2019s transition process, he said, adding:\n\nLet\u2019s instead stay focused, as I said in the last mile, on doing our work. And yes, we will answer fully and clarify the issue of how procedures were followed and what procedures were followed. We will do that. But let\u2019s resist bringing the politics of our lovely capital into this process, this global process that has been perfect.\n\n>>> Read More: Protecting Internet Freedom Requires Reforms and Standards", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If we really are inclusive then it\u2019s important that we find a way to give voice to a billion people,\" Fadi Chehad\u00e9, chief of ICANN, tells The DaIly Signal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"If we really are inclusive then it\u2019s important that we find a way to give voice to a billion people,\" Fadi Chehad\u00e9, chief of ICANN, tells The DaIly Signal.", "title": "Internet Naming Chief Defends Role in Chinese Conference", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160209_ICANN_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-11T17:23:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Pm4iuO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"If we really are inclusive then it\u2019s important that we find a way to give voice to a billion people,\" Fadi Chehad\u00e9, chief of ICANN, tells The DaIly Signal.", "title": "Internet Naming Chief Defends Role in Chinese Conference", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160209_ICANN_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2016-02-11T14:00:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-11T17:23:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Congress, Internet, ICANN, Fadi Chehad\u00e9, World Internet Conference, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, China, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, James Lankford"}, "article_summary": "They write:ICANN\u2019s participation in the World Internet Conference is especially concerning because of the Chinese government\u2019s long and established record of restricting free access to the Internet, censoring content, and criminalizing certain forms of online speech.\nChehad\u00e9 attended the first and second gatherings of the World Internet Conference in 2014 and 2015, according to reports.\n\u201cChina has started to gradually take a leading role in the discussion on global Internet governance and a truly inclusive global Internet governance system will be impossible without the participation of China.\u201dThe Chinese government has organized an annual World Internet Conference since 2014.\nMy work with the advisory committee is an extension of that and I invite everyone to join me in this mission.\nCruz, Lankford, and Lee request that Chehad\u00e9, who took over ICANN in 2012, confirm or deny his attendance in December at a World Internet Conference advisory committee meeting."}
