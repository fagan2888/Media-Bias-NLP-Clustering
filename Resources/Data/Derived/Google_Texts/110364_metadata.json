The break also deprived Coors Field of water pressure, knocking the restrooms and concessions facilities out of action.\n\nInitially a 30-minute delay was announced for the 6:10 p.m. game as Denver Water workers attempted to resolve the problem. The Denver Office of Emergency Management eventually asked the game be postponed, and Denver Water crews began moving in heavy equipment to start digging up the pipe.\n\nCoors Field opened in 1995 and much of the infrastructure surrounding it is new. But the failed pipe dates back to the early 1900s, Chesney said.\n\nThe Colorado Rockies rescheduled the game against the Reds to 7:10 p.m. Sunday, making it the second act in a split double-header.\n\nFans with a ticket for the Saturday evening game can use their tickets for the game Sunday evening, but not for the afternoon game at 2:10 p.m.\n\nThey can also exchange the ticket for another comparable seats at another game during what is left of the season. No cash refunds will be provided, the team said.\n\nOn Sunday the Rockies planned to retire Todd Helton\u2019s number 17, adding even more pressure to get the water pressure back in time.\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12a8\"", "article_summary": "Initially a 30-minute delay was announced for the 6:10 p.m. game as Denver Water workers attempted to resolve the problem.\nThe break also deprived Coors Field of water pressure, knocking the restrooms and concessions facilities out of action.\nFans with a ticket for the Saturday evening game can use their tickets for the game Sunday evening, but not for the afternoon game at 2:10 p.m.\nThe Denver Office of Emergency Management eventually asked the game be postponed, and Denver Water crews began moving in heavy equipment to start digging up the pipe.\nOn Sunday the Rockies planned to retire Todd Helton\u2019s number 17, adding even more pressure to get the water pressure back in time."}
