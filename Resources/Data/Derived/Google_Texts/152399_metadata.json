(Photo: 2014 photo by Elise Amendola/Associated Press)\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of play in the 2016 presidential contest yet, but count on it becoming more of an issue as the election draws nearer.\n\nWhoever the next president is, he or she could have a rare opportunity to recast the court\u2019s politics for a long time with multiple key appointments in a first term.\n\nOn the conservative side of the court, Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia will be 80 next year; on the liberal side Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is 82 and Stephen Breyer is 77.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that none of their seats will become available by 2020.\n\nAt Wednesday night\u2019s Republican debate, the court came up in a narrow sense, as several candidates trashed Chief Justice John Roberts (a nominee of George W. Bush and an undeniable conservative on the court) and even went so far as to say his appointment was a \u201cmistake.\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who, like Roberts, was a clerk for former ultraconservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist, said Roberts should have been passed over for a more conservative nominee. Even Jeb Bush questioned his brother\u2019s pick, saying \u2014 ridiculously \u2014 that Roberts, who\u2019d served in the Reagan White House and in the Solicitor General\u2019s Office for George H. W. Bush in addition to clerking for Rehnquist, didn\u2019t have enough of a record to establish his conservative bona fides.\n\nThe source of ire last week was a pair of Roberts opinions, both having to do with health care reform. Roberts twice saved Obamacare from congressional challenge \u2014 first in the ruling that deemed the health insurance mandate a constitutionally acceptable tax, and the second preserving the federal subsidies for state-run health insurance exchanges.\n\nTwo opinions. Culled from nearly a decade on the court.\n\nAnd let's be clear: The Roberts opinions that aren\u2019t in lockstep with conservative political values are very few and far-between.\n\nHe\u2019s just as well known for helping decimate affirmative action or any other government-sponsored attempt to achieve racial equality, writing once that race-conscious efforts to fight inequality were as much a part of the problem as outright discrimination.\n\nAnd he blew a hole though the government\u2019s ability to ensure black voting rights, saying several Southern states with pernicious histories of terrible discrimination shouldn\u2019t be singled out by the Voting Rights Act for simple federal review of proposed voting or ballot-related changes.\n\nAnd then there are the stats: Roberts votes most frequently with Scalia and then with Samuel Alito, inarguably solid conservative members. (SCOTUSblog.com is a great resource for numbers about the high court.)\n\nSo why the kvetching?\n\nWell, conservatives have a long history of eating their own when it comes to court appointments. Earl Warren was vilified as a traitor for his embrace of school desegregation and other decisions through the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nJustices John Paul Stevens and David Souter faced similar ridicule and political bile.\n\nAnd Anthony Kennedy, nominated to the court by Ronald Reagan, is a darling punching bag of the right, principally for his profound evolution on the question of gay rights.\n\nWhat always amuses me is how the so-called conservative court traitors tend to embody the core beliefs of conservatism.\n\nTake Kennedy, for instance. His protection of gay rights is rooted in a belief that the constitution constrains government from singling out classes of Americans for differential treatment. (It absolutely does, in the 14th Amendment.)\n\nAnd in fact, the same impulses that have driven his contempt for discrimination against gays shape his opposition to race-conscious policies like affirmative action. Kennedy doesn\u2019t care whether the government is treating people different in the name of expanding their liberty or confining it; his point is that the government ought not be in the business of treating people differently.\n\nRoberts, too, is a conservative rock, even when he\u2019s voting in favor of preserving the Affordable Care Act. In both rulings, he was exercising deference to Congress\u2019 lawmaking abilities, and the court\u2019s responsibility to carve wide berth \u2014 and avoid nitpicking defeatism \u2014 in interpreting what the popularly elected branches want or intend to do.\n\nSounds pretty conservative to me. I doubt Roberts, or Kennedy for that matter, is rushing off to join even the most conservative wings of the Democratic party.\n\nI know the Republican candidates were poking at Roberts only by way of jabbing at Obama; this is primary season, and they know there are votes to be mined in the opposition to just about anything the current president has done.\n\nAnd I know that, in office, the brash calculations of a debate-stage performance almost always give way to more considered, thoughtful decision-making. Especially when it comes to the high court.\n\nBut before we all vote next year, it might be good if we had a more honest discussion about what this court looks like, how its members fit with our various views of the constitution, and what we might want in what could be a really different cast of characters by the next election.\n\nThe sound-byting and posturing doesn\u2019t quite cut it.\n\n\n\nStephen Henderson is editorial page editor for the Detroit Free Press.
