The whole month of February, we're serving up intoxicatingly fun articles on bars and clubs \u2013 including guides, the latest trends, bar reviews, the results of our Best of Bars poll and more. Grab a designated driver and dive in!\n\nFor the second year in a row, the title of Milwaukee's best Bloody Mary goes to Sobelman's Pub & Grill and its massive, appropriately titled Bloody Masterpiece.\n\nThe Bloody Mary behemoth \u2013 which is available at both its main location at 1900 W. St. Paul Ave., as well as at the Sobelman's restaurant on Marquette's campus \u2013 comes with 13 total garnishes, including celery, onion, Brussel sprout, lemon, pickle, shrimp, mushroom, cherry tomato, olive, cheese, sausage, asparagus and green onion. Oh, and a bacon cheeseburger slider. Throw in a Sprecher chaser, and the Bloody Masterpiece is less of a drink and more of a complete, balanced meal.\n\nComing in second place, nearly 200 votes behind Sobelman's, is The Wicked Hop. It was still a strong showing from the former king of the category, whose loaded-up and well-balanced Bloody Mary still makes it the choice for the OnMilwaukee.com editors. For OMC readers, however, it seems there's just no beating a bonus burger.\n\nOnMilwaukee.com editors' pick: The Wicked Hop\n\nRunners up:\n\n2. The Wicked Hop\n\n3. Steny's\n\n4. AJ Bombers\n\n5.
