Bill Owens.\n\nCoffman\u2019s brief is in response to Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s recent filing in the high court asking them intervene and declare he \u201chas ultimate authority\u201d on whether to sue the federal government.\n\nHickenlooper supports the federal emissions initiative and says Coffman\u2019s effort to block the program is an overreach of her position.\n\n\u201cExcept in very rare circumstances, generally the governor is supposed to make that decision in concert with the attorney general,\u201d Hickenlooper told The Denver Post last month. \u201cBut the governor should have that final say.\u201d\n\nHowever, Coffman says the state\u2019s constitution gives her an ability to represent Colorado residents that goes beyond the limited powers outlined in state law.\n\nThe Salazar case, she says, shows just that.\n\n\u201cBecause the relevant legal questions presented by the petition were resolved in Salazar, this court should not invoke its \u2018extraordinary\u2019 original jurisdiction to re-litigate the same dispute,\u201d Coffman\u2019s filing reads.\n\nThe brief accuses Hickenlooper of trying to destabilize the state\u2019s checks and balances system, explaining that governors and attorneys general have a long, healthy history of disagreement in Colorado.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment on the filing, saying the brief \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the governor argued in their petition to the high court that the Salazar case does not encompass the question circling the Clean Power Plan lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Hickenlooper said Friday night that the governor\u2019s office was reviewing the brief.\n\nThe response comes a day after Coffman faced sharp questions from Democratic lawmakers about the costs and legal conflicts associated with her suit.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s office has until Dec. 4 to respond to Coffman\u2019s brief, after which the Colorado Supreme Court will decide whether or not to hear the case. It could take months for the dispute to be resolved if the high court takes on the matter.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan is touted by President Barack Obama as a major effort to fight climate change. Colorado is one of roughly two dozen states challenging the new EPA regulations, which seek to cut carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants nationwide by 32 percent before 2030, compared to 2005 levels.\n\nObservers say the dispute between Coffman and Hickenlooper could have ramifications over the next four years as they serve their terms.\n\n\u201cThe two of them will have to figure out if this will be the norm \u2014 whether this is, in effect, a raised middle finger,\u201d Eric Sondermann, an independent political analyst, said earlier.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado AG responds to governor\u2019s challenge of Clean Power Plan suit", "title": "Colorado AG responds to governor\u2019s challenge of Clean Power Plan suit", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/20/colorado-ag-responds-to-governors-challenge-of-clean-power-plan-suit/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__BN20151120_Z00_BNCD20FILINGp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__BN20151120_Z00_BNCD20FILINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-20T18:48:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T08:51:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cExcept in very rare circumstances, generally the governor is supposed to make that decision in concert with the attorney general,\u201d Hickenlooper told The Denver Post last month.\nIt could take months for the dispute to be resolved if the high court takes on the matter.\nJohn Hickenlooper\u2019s recent filing in the high court asking them intervene and declare he \u201chas ultimate authority\u201d on whether to sue the federal government.\nColorado\u2019s Republican attorney general, Cynthia Coffman, filed a brief Friday in the state\u2019s high court defending her authority \u2014 through case law \u2014 to challenge the Clean Power Plan in spite of the governor\u2019s wishes.\n\u201cEven when the governor and the attorney general split along party lines, the attorney general has not only the authority but also the public duty to seek judicial review to protect the legal interests of Colorado,\u201d the filing says."}
