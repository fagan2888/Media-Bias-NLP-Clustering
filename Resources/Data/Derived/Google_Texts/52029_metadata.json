Those pills, the new antivirals that wipe out the disease, gave her back her health.The Harleysville, PA resident contracted the virus through a blood transfusion when she had brain surgery decades ago. Interferon treatment made her miserable and did not work. Now, on the new antivirals, after years of being weak and worried, she is better.\u201cI am cured and I\u2019m feeling good\u2014I am feeling just wonderful,\u201d Nyce said. How do you put a price on that?, she wondered.Her story is typical of what physicians and patients see as one of modern medicine\u2019s great success stories: the new antivirals that knock out hepatitis C.At Hahnemann University Hospital, in Philadelphia, PA, the new drugs are putting a new face on the specter of hepatitis C, surgeons, hepatologists, and patients agreed.Though the drugs are expensive, they are cheap compared to the cost of having advanced liver disease including liver cancer, and of liver transplantation.A third of patients who are fortunate enough to get a donor liver still have to live with the threat of the infection returning, said David Reich, MD chief of multi-organ transplantation and hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia.Reich and his colleagues believe that not only will the new drugs cure patients, they will ultimately increase the supply of donor livers.It\u2019s really probably the greatest change in my field in over a decade, easily,\u201d he said.Hepatitis C patients whose liver disease puts them on a downward trajectory headed for transplant will start to reverse course. An estimated 40% of patients on liver transplant lists are there because of hepatitis C.\u201cThe big picture is that some patients with hepatitis C will not progress to needing liver transplant because their livers will improve,\u201d Reich said, \u201cThey may come off the transplant list.\u201dThat has already happened to several of his patients.Of course, hepatitis infection is not the only reason patients come to need transplants.For Andrej Holowchak, a Levittown, PA resident, it was primary biliary cirrhosis that put him on a transplant list. He lived through many medical crises including hepatic encephalopathy, and a build-up of 1-liters of fluid in his abdomen that required repeated draining, until a successful transplant gave him back his life. Now he\u2019s looking forward to returning to work managing an auto repair facility, and \u201ca normal family lifestyle,\u201d he said. His 8-year-old daughter has never known her father as a healthy man. \u201cIt\u2019s been horrible,\u201d he said, of his long bout with liver disease.His hepatologist, Kenneth Rothstein, MD, chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at Drexel University and medical director of abdominal transplantation at Hahnemann said such stories as his patient\u2019s do not always have such a happy ending.\u201cPatients are waiting longer and longer to get a liver,\u201d Rothstein said, adding that Holowchak \u201cshould have had a liver one or two years ago but it just wasn\u2019t going to be.\u201dRothstein said his hope is that \u201cas treatments for hepatitis C become more firmly established . . .we\u2019ll see less of need for transplants,\u201d but that should take a year or two to result in less demand for liver transplantation. Not that hepatologists are likely to run out of patients, he added. Obesity is behind a new epidemic of fatty liver disease, which can also progress to liver failure.\u201cIt\u2019s not all about obesity but obesity drives it, so with obesity you get diabetes, you get high cholesterol, high triglycerides, things like that,\u201d he said. There are drugs in the pipeline that researchers hope will be effective, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like many urban centers in the Northeastern US, Philadelphia has a chronic shortage of donor livers.
