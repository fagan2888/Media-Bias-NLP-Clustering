As if a higher power wanted to underscore the group\u2019s irrelevance, the very next morning the Obama administration announced it captured the man it believes was the ringleader of the Benghazi attack.\n\nMilbank\u2019s column focused on the abuse suffered by Saba Ahmed, a Pakistani Muslim, when she suggested that some at the conference seemed to stereotype all Muslims as violent and anti-American. Rather unbelievably, conservatives and even some media critics are siding with Heritage and saying Milbank made the crowd look uglier than it was. Even after Media Matters released video of the clash between Ahmed and panelist Brigitte Gabriel of ACT! For America, criticism intensified.\n\nWow. Now that we have video http://t.co/q5vSyHmpYl I feel like @Milbank totally misrepresented the panel: http://t.co/uOc4NTCJXi \u2014 Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) June 17, 2014\n\nYou can read Milbank\u2019s story and watch the video yourself. I think Byers and the other critics are wrong. In fact, the firestorm over Milbank\u2019s column shows how hard even nominally mainstream reporters will work to excuse increasingly unhinged rhetoric on the right.\n\nThe conflict began when Ahmed, wearing a headscarf, took the microphone and quietly observed, \u201cWe portray Islam and all Muslims as bad, but there\u2019s 1.8 billion followers of Islam. We have 8 million-plus Muslim Americans in this country and I don\u2019t see them represented here.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s true that Islamophobe Frank Gaffney played the moderate in the clash with Ahmed, thanking her for her question and reassuring her that no one on the panel \u201cthinks that all Muslims are the problem.\u201d Clearly Gaffney didn\u2019t want anything to upstage his renewed charge that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has \u201cdeep personal ties\u201d to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nBut Brigitte Gabriel, known for calling Muslims \u201cbarbarians,\u201d tore into Ahmed, shrieking at her: \u201cWe are not here to bash Muslims, you were the one who brought up the issue about \u2018most Muslims,\u2019 not us.\u201d Then she whipped the crowd into a standing ovation, asking Ahmed, \u201cWhere are the other Muslims speaking out?\u201d She went on: \u201cYou took the limelight instead of \u2026 standing up and saying a question, asking something about our four Americans who died and what our government is doing to correct the problem, you stood there to make a point about peaceful American Muslims.\u201d\n\nIt was bullying plain and simple, and it was ugly. It\u2019s true that Gaffney and moderator Chris Plante treated Ahmed more gently than Gabriel did, but Gabriel deliberately channeled anti-Muslim prejudice to get the crowd to applaud her hectoring of Ahmed.\n\nAhmed herself (assuming it\u2019s the same one) is a curious case. Once a Democrat, she became a Republican after losing a quixotic race for Congress in Portland, Oregon, in 2011. She wrote on her Facebook page at the time:\n\n(M)y conservative Islamic values (pro-life, pro-family values, pro-business) made it very hard for me to defend myself as a Democrat. George Bush advocated water boarding torture just like Obama advocated drone missiles. Both parties treat Muslims badly, which is why American economy is going bankrupt fighting Islam. Inshallah, I look forward to helping foster a better understanding of our faith\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wingers and pundits claim the Islamophobia at a big right-wing event wasn't so bad, after all.
