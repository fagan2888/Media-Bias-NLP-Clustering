CU special-teams coach Toby Neinas is far from satisfied, however.\n\n\u201cWe have to improve, or I\u2019m not getting it done,\u201d Neinas said Tuesday. \u201cWe have to see improvement in all the return phases of our kicking game. We have to be better for us to be a better football team.\u201d\n\nA linebacker by trade, Ryan Severson \u2014 5-foot-10, 200 pounds and fearless \u2014 handled the majority of CU\u2019s kickoff returns last fall as a true freshman, fielding 36 of the team\u2019s 48 returns. Look for Severson to get more help this season.\n\nSeverson said Phillip Lindsay (5-8, 175), a redshirt freshman running back, has been getting a lot of work with him on kickoff returns during practice. Exceptionally quick, Lindsay is a former Denver South standout.\n\nOthers used as kickoff returners during Saturday\u2019s scrimmage included running backs Tony Jones (senior) and Christian Powell (junior), and receivers Devin Ross (sophomore), Donovan Lee (freshman) and Lee Walker (freshman).\n\nNeinas said he\u2019d like to narrow the list to about five kickoff returners going into the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of great athletes that we can use,\u201d Severson said.\n\nIn addition to linebacker, Severson also played running back for Valley Christian High School in San Jose, Calif., rushing for 1,951 yards in 2012 as a senior with a long gain of 95 yards.\n\nSeverson was initially recruited by CU coach Mike MacIntyre when MacIntyre coached at San Jose State.\n\n\u201cI loved returning kicks last year; it was great,\u201d Severson said. \u201cCoach Neinas tells us to just hit the gap and not stutter. Having played running back in high school, returning kicks is just like offense \u2014 you have to find the hole and go.\u201d\n\nSeverson also continues to compete for a spot in the two-deep at linebacker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting more reps there, which I\u2019m excited about,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for punt returns, veteran receiver Nelson Spruce was credited with each of the team\u2019s nine punt returns. Colorado ranked 11th among Pac-12 teams in punt returns with a modest average of 5.0 yards per return, often calling for a fair catch or allowing the punt to be downed.\n\nNeinas has a comfort level with Spruce but acknowledged becoming \u201creally uplifted\u201d by breakaway returns during the Saturday scrimmage by senior cornerback Greg Henderson and speedy freshman receiver Shay Fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not where we\u2019d like to be in that phase,\u201d Neinas said of the punt-return unit. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting better.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado special teams looking for many happy returns in 2014", "title": "Colorado special teams looking for many happy returns in 2014", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/19/colorado-special-teams-looking-for-many-happy-returns-in-2014/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819__fbc-cu-specialp1.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819__fbc-cu-specialp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T17:22:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:20:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "As for punt returns, veteran receiver Nelson Spruce was credited with each of the team\u2019s nine punt returns.\nBOULDER \u2014 Statistically, kickoff returns were a strength for Colorado a year ago.\nColorado ranked 11th among Pac-12 teams in punt returns with a modest average of 5.0 yards per return, often calling for a fair catch or allowing the punt to be downed.\nSeverson said Phillip Lindsay (5-8, 175), a redshirt freshman running back, has been getting a lot of work with him on kickoff returns during practice.\nThe Buffaloes ranked fourth among Pac-12 teams in that category with an average of 22.6 yards per return."}
