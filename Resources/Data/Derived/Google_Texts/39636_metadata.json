This year, federal officials have said they will not provide the money unless Florida expands Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nThe Obama administration is using similar tactics in Texas, Tennessee and Kansas, threatening to withhold the indigent care money unless those states get on board with expanding Medicaid, part of the president\u2019s plan to provide health care coverage to more people.\n\nThe Florida Senate supports the idea, but House Republicans and Gov. Rick Scott oppose it. Scott has said he will sue Obama for using the hospital money as a sort of blackmail to force Medicaid expansion opposed by Republicans who fear the state cannot afford the additional costs.\n\nThe rift between the House and Senate has created a budget stalemate that will send the Legislature into a special or extended session.\n\nThe prospect of losing the federal hospital money has led some to argue that hospitals will be devastated and the state\u2019s economy upended. But financial data collected by the state from hospitals show it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nOf the 230 hospitals receiving the low-income pool money, 65 \u2014 or 28 percent \u2014 had negative total margins or survived on a margin at less than 1 percent, according to the most recent financial data compiled by the state. Total margin is a measure of a hospital\u2019s profitability that does not include long-term debt. The financial data comes from the most recent fiscal year reported by the hospitals, some ending their financial year in December 2013 and others ending in mid-2014.\n\nThose struggling hospitals collectively received $519 million in low-income pool, or LIP, funding in the current state budget, according to state figures. If LIP goes away, their budgets would be further reduced.\n\nSome of the most profitable hospitals in the state currently receiving LIP money would also remain profitable if they lost the cash, financial reports show.\n\nLee Memorial Hospital, a 355-bed facility in Fort Myers, had a 25 percent margin in 2013, one of the best in the state. The facility\u2019s profits topped expenses by $169 million in 2013-14. The current state budget doles out $35 million in LIP funding for the hospital, a loss that would hurt but still leave the company with a sizable margin.\n\nJim Nathan, president of Lee Memorial Health System, which operates the Fort Myers hospital, said his facilities collectively face a $48 million loss if LIP goes away, which would jeopardize the ability to expand and \u201ccould lead to even longer waits and fewer services in the future.\u201d He said the system has capital needs far in excess of $1 billion over the next decade due to aging baby boomers.\n\nThe hospitals with the top 20 margins in the state brought in $1.7 billion above expenses in 2013-14.\n\nReuben said that even large hospitals must react to million-dollar cuts, which can result in cutting programs or shifting costs to insured patients.\n\n\u201cWhen a hospital has a big funding cut, especially a significant one over a short period of time \u2026 one approach they use is cost shifting,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Republicans last week proposed using $600 million in state money to provide hospitals some relief. That money would be used to draw down federal matching dollars, but it\u2019s so far unclear how much.\n\nHospitals say that\u2019s not nearly enough.\n\nBut House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, says they need to reexamine their budgets.\n\n\u201cListen, they built their budgets around what I\u2019d call a lottery,\u201d Crisafulli said of LIP, a program created in 2005 that was meant to be temporary.\n\nThe Senate has balked at the House plan, and says it wants to hear from the feds before moving into final budget negotiations. It\u2019s unlikely the feds will shut down all supplemental hospital funding, but most believe it will be below current levels.\n\nAt the request of federal officials, a Senate-crafted hospital funding plan would give some money to 82 hospitals that currently get no funding. Some of those new LIP recipients have comfortable bottom lines.\n\nNorth Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville had a $65 million margin in fiscal 2014 and would get $1.7 million under the Senate plan. South Miami Hospital had a margin of $54 million and would get $4.4 million under the Senate proposal; and Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in Miami-Dade County had a margin of nearly $50 million and would gain $1.5 million from the Senate plan.\n\nContact Daily News reporter Matt.Dixon@naplesnews.com and 352-233-0777", "article_metadata": {"title": "Some Florida hospitals would stay profitable despite $2 billion loss at stake in Obamacare fight", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/politics/some-florida-hospitals-would-stay-profitable-despite-2-billion-loss-at-stake-in-obamacare-fight-ep-1-338019161.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/istock_000044510826_full_1430000152322_17319991_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 425}, "type": "article", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As lawmakers continue to debate the possible loss of $2 billion in federal health care money and how it could impact the state, the latest financial reports show some hospitals would maintain healthy profits even without the federal help.", "title": "Some Florida hospitals would stay profitable despite $2 billion loss at stake in Obamacare fight"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/istock_000044510826_full_1430000152322_17319991_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As lawmakers continue to debate the possible loss of $2 billion in federal health care money and how it could impact the state, the latest financial reports show some hospitals would maintain healthy profits even without the federal help.", "site": "@ndn", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Some Florida hospitals would stay profitable despite $2 billion loss at stake in Obamacare fight"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5e7\"", "article_summary": "The prospect of losing the federal hospital money has led some to argue that hospitals will be devastated and the state\u2019s economy upended.\nNorth Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville had a $65 million margin in fiscal 2014 and would get $1.7 million under the Senate plan.\nSome of the most profitable hospitals in the state currently receiving LIP money would also remain profitable if they lost the cash, financial reports show.\nHouse Republicans last week proposed using $600 million in state money to provide hospitals some relief.\nThis year, federal officials have said they will not provide the money unless Florida expands Medicaid under Obamacare."}
