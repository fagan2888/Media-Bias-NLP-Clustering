The Affordable Care Act lets companies redefine which workers receive medical insurance, a costly benefit that it can now reduce by shifting workers to newly created private health plans.\n\nMost of the Sodexo employees affected are in food service at Gonzaga and Whitworth universities and at the two Spokane community colleges.\n\nAs the law\u2019s main regulations on businesses take effect in January, the company said its Spokane ratio of full- and part-time workers will change under a new system of classification.\n\nSodexo\u2019s full-time workers here will drop from 188 to 111, company spokesman Enrico Dinges said.\n\nThe company is not reducing work hours for those workers, Dinges said. All 77 in effect are being redefined as part-time employees.\n\nBecause the company offers benefits including medical coverage only to full-timers, some of those workers will be forced to find a health insurance alternative.\n\nNot all of those workers used the company health plan, Dinges said. He said he\u2019s been told that 33 current full-time workers will lose the company-provided health plan.\n\nThe former full-time workers will also lose other benefits, including eight paid holidays, five vacation days (more if employed more than five years) and up to 10 days of sick leave.\n\nThe changes follow Sodexo\u2019s announcement earlier this year that it was redefining workers based on standards in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat law says full-time workers are those who work at least 30 hours per week on average over 52 weeks. Companies with 50 or more workers must provide health care to their full-time workers or face a fine, the law states.\n\nThe law does not require a company to eliminate benefits for workers who become part-timers.\n\nUntil January 2014, Sodexo said a full-time worker was one who worked 30 or more hours per week over a six-week period.\n\nBecause college workers often take breaks for vacations and summers, many Sodexo workers will not meet the law\u2019s full-time standard over the course of a year.\n\nDinges said the company wouldn\u2019t disclose its average cost for full-time workers\u2019 health insurance.\n\nFor workers losing full-time status, the company plans to provide assistance in finding medical coverage, he said.\n\nThat will include having managers assist workers in making applications for insurance through the Washington state health exchange.\n\nGenerally, about 15 percent of Sodexo\u2019s U.S. workers belong to unions, Dinges said. Those in Spokane are not affiliated with a union.\n\nEarlier this year, the Sodexo shift on benefits led to heated debate at the University of Vermont, where the company has more than 200 full-time workers. Facing loud criticism by school administrators and students, Sodexo officials agreed to delay the change pending a review by the state insurance commissioner.\n\nThat review is ongoing, according to a university spokesman.\n\nPhilip Baruth, a University of Vermont professor and state legislator, said Sodexo officials have conceded to university administrators that the change is less about compliance with the law and more about \u201cremaining competitive\u201d in the marketplace.\n\nGonzaga spokeswoman Mary Joan Hahn said in an email, \u201cWe believe that (Sodexo) has endeavored to provide a thoughtful and personal approach in navigating the changes to health care and other benefits coverage with the employees impacted.\u201d\n\nDinges also said Sodexo will compensate workers who lose vacations and sick days by giving them an \u201cequivalent increase in pay to compensate.\u201d\n\nDinges declined to give details on what that compensation would come to, saying it\u2019s based on \u201caccrued days multiplied by their daily pay rate \u2026 and divided across each pay period.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citing the federal Affordable Care Act, national food-service provider Sodexo is cutting health care benefits for more than 30 of its Spokane-area workers.
