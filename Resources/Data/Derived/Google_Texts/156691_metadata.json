It was not known whether the Department of Health & Human Services would extend the rule's implementation date after four years of false starts and procedural wrangling. Thorny legal arguments over how to identify Medicaid overpayments have been a big reason for many of the delays.\n\nAs proposed, the rule would give Medicare Part A and B providers and suppliers 60 days to return overpayments once they are identified. The rule also includes a 10-year \u201clook back\u201d period on claims not identified by a provider. CMS has been roundly criticized for the move because it conflicts with shorter look back periods for Part C and D overpayments.\n\nThe CMS plan came to light in February 2012 after an Inspector General report disclosed the agency's failure to collect more than $300 million in overpayments dating back to 2010.\n\nEven now, entities are required under the False Claims Act to report known overpayments within 60 days or face penalties of up to $10,000 apiece and potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "description": "Barring objections from the Office of Management and Budget, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will implement a new rule early next year aimed at retrieving hundreds of millions of dollars of provider overpayments dating back to 2010.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "Barring objections from the Office of Management and Budget, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will implement a new rule early next year aimed at retrieving hundreds of millions of dollars of provider overpayments dating back to 2010.", "title": "Medicare overpayment rule might take effect in February", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/medicare-overpayment-rule-might-take-effect-in-february/article/457636/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/11/17/mltcnpage12tc1215_870029_870030.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mcknightsltcn", "image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/11/17/mltcnpage12tc1215_870029_870030.jpg"}, "description": "Barring objections from the Office of Management and Budget, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will implement a new rule early next year aimed at retrieving hundreds of millions of dollars of provider overpayments dating back to 2010.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Medicare overpayment rule might take effect in February"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-12-04T12:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-03T13:56:05"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Medicare overpayment rule might take effect in FebruaryShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintMedicare Part A and B providers would have 60 days to return overpayments under the new rule.\nAs proposed, the rule would give Medicare Part A and B providers and suppliers 60 days to return overpayments once they are identified.\nThorny legal arguments over how to identify Medicaid overpayments have been a big reason for many of the delays.\nBarring objections from the Office of Management and Budget, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will implement a new rule early next year aimed at retrieving hundreds of millions of dollars of provider overpayments dating back to 2010.\nThe rule also includes a 10-year \u201clook back\u201d period on claims not identified by a provider."}
