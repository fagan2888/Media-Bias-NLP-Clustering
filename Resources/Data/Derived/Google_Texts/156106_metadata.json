Much of it, of course, came from companies that will be pushing their own agendas before committees and then when the full Legislature meets in March.\n\nDonors, both corporate and individual, gave $32 million to candidates for the 120-member Florida House in the run-up to the November 2014 vote. Candidates for the 40-member state Senate raked in $11 million, according to records on file with the Department of State\u2019s Division of Elections.\n\n\u201cThe name of the game is access,\u201d said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida and longtime analyst of state government.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary was state Sen. Jeff Brandes, who pulled in $1.4 million in winning a district stretching from his home turf in St. Petersburg to South Tampa. Brandes is chairman of the powerful Senate Transportation Committee. He could not be reached for comment over the holidays.\n\nDonors had been limited to $500 contributions for legislative races, but the Legislature upped that cap in 2013 to $1,000.\n\nAlthough \u201cpay-to-play\u201d scandals occasionally break out nationwide \u2014 in September, Virginia\u2019s Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, was convicted on 11 counts of performing government favors for a big gift-giver \u2014 MacManus and other Florida insiders say that\u2019s not necessarily how it\u2019s done here.\n\n\u201cThe textbook example for donors, particularly corporate donors or unions or whatever, is that they want access more than they expect outcomes,\u201d MacManus said. \u201cThey want to actually talk to (a lawmaker) on the phone and make a pitch.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of folks who want that kind of access. In addition to next week, committee hearings are set for the weeks of Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, 9, and 16. The legislative session begins March 3.\n\nA key issue is expected to be health care, with Democrats pushing to expand Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and Republicans seeking to continue restrictions on the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation.\n\nLikely picking up the phone will be the Florida Medical Association, which contributed $138,000 to House and Senate candidates; the Florida Hospital Association, in for $76,400; Hospital Corporation of America, whose affiliated companies donated $409,000; and insurers such as Humana ($138,000) and Florida Blue/Blue Cross and Blue Shield ($73,500).\n\nWhile utilities weight the benefits of the drilling process known as fracking, and who should pay for it, and the Legislature addresses other industry issues such as a revamped Public Service Commission, Duke Energy pumped $73,000 into legislative races and TECO Energy another $122,000.\n\nThose contributions are dwarfed by Florida\u2019s traditional elephant in the room. Three different Disney-related companies contributed $506,000 to legislative candidates. The Disney organization opposes expansion of gambling in the state, an issue the Legislature may address.\n\nOther notable contributors to Florida legislative candidates include U.S. Sugar, $53,000; Bright House Networks, $89,500; Florida Education Association, $39,500; Koch Industries, $70,000; and Publix Super Markets, $107,500.\n\nRon Book, long considered the most influential lobbyist in Tallahassee, repeated MacManus\u2019 assessment of the relationship between givers and receivers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it until the day I die: I believe that if you participate, what you\u2019re hoping to do is get your phone calls returned, and get your meeting scheduled,\u201d Book said. \u201cThe notion of quid-pro-quos are inaccurate and unfair.\u201d\n\nBook himself spread more than $73,000 around in candidate donations for the 2014 cycle. He\u2019s not alone; the powerful Southern Strategy Group doled out $22,500 in contributions, as did other legal/lobbying firms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any substitute for shoe leather on the ground and going door-to-door and working it,\u201d said Book. \u201cThose who try to degrade the process by implying there\u2019s some sort of pay-to-play game is unfair, and it disrespects the institution of government.\u201d\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Thu, 01 Jan 2015 20:55:55 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The fall 2014 state elections were the costliest in Florida history, with candidates and causes racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The fall 2014 state elections were the costliest in Florida history, with candidates and causes racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions.", "title": "After political contributions, donors will expect access to Florida lawmakers", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/after-political-contributions-donors-will-expect-access-20150101/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2015-01-01T21:44:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "After political contributions, donors will expect access to Florida lawmakers"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-01-01T20:55:55Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T21:44:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Other notable contributors to Florida legislative candidates include U.S. Sugar, $53,000; Bright House Networks, $89,500; Florida Education Association, $39,500; Koch Industries, $70,000; and Publix Super Markets, $107,500.\nDonors had been limited to $500 contributions for legislative races, but the Legislature upped that cap in 2013 to $1,000.\nDonors, both corporate and individual, gave $32 million to candidates for the 120-member Florida House in the run-up to the November 2014 vote.\n\u201cThe textbook example for donors, particularly corporate donors or unions or whatever, is that they want access more than they expect outcomes,\u201d MacManus said.\nCandidates for the 40-member state Senate raked in $11 million, according to records on file with the Department of State\u2019s Division of Elections."}
