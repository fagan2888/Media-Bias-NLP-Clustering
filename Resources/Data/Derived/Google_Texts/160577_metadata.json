He likes to do the opposite for his patients. Dr. Ores is the founder of Fresh Start, a service that removes tattoos for free from people coming out of prison or leaving gangs. The side gig is just another expression of Dr. Ores' colorful approach to medicine.\n\nA graduate of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr. Ores has avoided taking private health insurance since he started his practice in 1993. \"I don't think they're evil or misguided,\" he said, \"but I know for a fact a for-profit corporation is the wrong instrument to provide health care.\"\n\nDr. Ores, 55, started a health care co-op for restaurant workers. Restaurants\u2014there are about 30 so far in New York City\u2014pay a monthly fee, from $50 to $400, and any of their employees can see one of four participating doctors when they need to. Restaurants average one or two visits per month; a doctor gets paid only when he sees a patient.\n\nBecause Dr. Ores has no other staff, his costs stay low. As a result, he can afford to see low-income patients. \"If I took insurance, I'd have to bill $250 per visit just to get $40. Now I can just take my $40 and I'm done.\"\n\nHis tattoo removal focuses on hands and necks\u2014areas that pose big barriers to employment. He's removed about 200 tattoos since 2006, working out of his practice on the Lower East Side, near his home. He would like to do more but his marketing is limited, as was the laser he used, which could remove only certain colors. Five doctors in other states are donating their services, and he's asking tattooed NBA players to spread the word.\n\n\"Just the fact that you helped someone can change their perception of the world,\" he said. \"I think that helps them know it's not so bleak.\"\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
