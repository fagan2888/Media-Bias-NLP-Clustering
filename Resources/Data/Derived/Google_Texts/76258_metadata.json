Today, we took it upon ourselves.\u201d\n\nSaturday, on a perfect autumn afternoon, in front of a sellout, homecoming crowd Hughes Stadium, Oden\u2019s Rams shut up. Then they put up a dominating performance in a 38-23 victory over longtime rival Air Force.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe how I feel right now,\u201d junior wide receiver Rashard Higgins said. \u201cWe have had some close games, so it\u2019s good to see what we (can do) on offense and defense. We showed what we can happen when we come together, and how dominating we can be.\u201d\n\nBehind a composed, precise game from sophomore quarterback Nick Stevens, a blue-collar rushing performance between the tackles by Oden and a disciplined defense that hemmed in the Falcons\u2019 vaunted option attack, CSU (3-4, 1-2 Mountain West) took control late in the second quarter and never faltered. Touchdowns on three consecutive possessions salted the game away.\n\nLast season, Air Force beat CSU 27-24, taking down a team that cruised into the game with a 10-1 record. So why did the Falcons struggle Saturday?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good team,\u201d testy Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said of the Rams. \u201cThey played well. They played better than we did today.\u201d\n\nStevens threw for 296 yards and three touchdowns, completing 23-of-30 passes. Oden rushed for 89 yards and two touchdowns, bouncing off would-be tacklers en route to the end zone.\n\nAir Force (3-3, 2-1) has owned this series of late, winning seven of the last eight games, but CSU was the better team Saturday. Air Force entered the game averaging 320.8 yards per game on the ground, fifth-best in the nation. Saturday, the Falcons gained 269 yards on the ground.\n\nToo often this season, CSU has made crucial mistakes at crucial times, but that was not the case Saturday.\n\nStevens, secure in the knowledge that the starting quarterback job belonged to him \u2014 not redshirt freshman Coleman Key, who split time with him last weekend in a loss to Boise State \u2014 set the tone by playing an excellent first half. Stevens threw for 194 yards and three touchdown as the Rams passed their way to a 21-13 lead.\n\n\u201cI thought Nick practiced well all week and that solidified his position going into this week,\u201d coach Mike Bobo said. \u201cNo. 1, I told him, \u2018You have to go out there and believe in yourself. You have to believe you are the man, and it\u2019s almost a borderline cockiness you need to have to play quarterback.\u2019 I thought he carried himself in that manner all week.\u201d\n\nStevens\u2019 one mistake was attempting to force a pass to Joe Hansley at the Air Force 24 with 4:41 left in the second quarter. The pass was picked off by safety Weston Steelhammer.\n\nThat led to Jacobi Owens\u2019 12-yard touchdown romp for the Falcons around the right side, cutting CSU\u2019s lead to 14-13.\n\nThe Rams came back with one of their best drives of the season \u2014 a nine-play, 90-yard march, culminating with a 44-yard touchdown pass to Hansley. It was Hansley\u2019s second TD catch of the day, the other coming on a 16-yard pass late in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cThat drive was huge \u2014 90 yards,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cWe knew we were backed up near the goal line, but we came through. That was an awesome job by the offense.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\n\nGame Balls\n\nNick Stevens, CSU, QB:\n\nMade big plays at big times, throwing for 296 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nTyree Simmons, CSU, DB: Was the game\u2019s biggest defensive playmaker, getting a sack, forced fumble and an interception.\n\nJasen Oden, CSU, RB: Churned for 91 yards rushing on 11 carries (8.1 yards per carry) and scored two touchdowns.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State football cruises past longtime rival Air Force", "title": "Colorado State football cruises past longtime rival Air Force", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/colorado-state-football-cruises-past-longtime-rival-air-force/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__FBCAirForceColoradoSt1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__FBCAirForceColoradoSt1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T17:14:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T08:03:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "Then they put up a dominating performance in a 38-23 victory over longtime rival Air Force.\nLast season, Air Force beat CSU 27-24, taking down a team that cruised into the game with a 10-1 record.\nAir Force entered the game averaging 320.8 yards per game on the ground, fifth-best in the nation.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good team,\u201d testy Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said of the Rams.\nJasen Oden, CSU, RB: Churned for 91 yards rushing on 11 carries (8.1 yards per carry) and scored two touchdowns."}
