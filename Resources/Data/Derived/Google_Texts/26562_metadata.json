Tony Hale plays that guy on TV. For two seasons, he's appeared on HBO\u2019s vulgar political comedy Veep as Gary Walsh, the vice president\u2019s personal aide. Walsh is the oblivious, lovestruck sidekick to Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s borderline incompetent Selina Meyer, fulfilling her every whim and snack craving with the same kind of neurotic codependence he delivered as Buster on Arrested Development. Given the show\u2019s history of coming up with storylines that later become real-life headlines, critics have hailed Veep as a hilarious confirmation of one of the country\u2019s worst fears: that the federal government is indeed run by a bunch of proud, power-hungry blowhards more concerned with moving up in the ranks than doing their jobs. Yet even after playing the bumbling little guy privy to Washington\u2019s (fictional) worst behavior, Hale says he has only become more impressed with the public servants the show sets out to skewer. I spoke with Hale about his favorite moments from Season Two (out on DVD this week), why British comedy writers nail American politics, and what to expect when Veep returns for its third season on April 6. We included Veep on our best television episodes of 2013 feature last December. What was your favorite episode of Season Two? I would say it\u2019s the episode where she walks into a glass door and she\u2019s going on a marathon and Gary accidentally gives her a very high dose of St. John\u2019s wort. She gets loopy and tells Gary every single thing he\u2019s ever wanted to hear: That she\u2019s going to his parents\u2019 wedding anniversary, they\u2019re going to dance, she adores him. Gary\u2019s like, \u201cThis is happening!\u201d And it all comes to a very sad crash.\n\nRelated Story The House of Cards Hypothesis: Why the British Get Washington Better Than Hollywood Does I picked the episode where everyone goes to Finland, and Gary is a big part of what makes that episode funny. What do you remember about that episode? Obviously working with Sally Phillips, who played the prime minister, and the awkward conversations she and Selina have made me laugh so hard. One of the hardest things about this job is to keep a straight face. I am incredibly unprofessional. I break every single time. I remember that episode, and also Dave Foley playing [Phillips\u2019] husband, he gropes Selina\u2014the whole thing was so extreme and ridiculous I could not keep it together. Anytime Selina and Gary have a private conversation, it takes me having rehearsal time with Julia [Louis-Dreyfus] just so I can keep it together before we shoot. I just have to have a moment to get it out. I need to laugh, I need to get this material in my head so I don\u2019t break on camera. And, of course, the camera rolls, and I still break. It\u2019s worthless. Part of what made the second season so great was its plot about a fictional government shutdown that aired months before the government actually did shut down. I know! Isn\u2019t that crazy? What was it like seeing a Veep story arc become a real news story? It\u2019s happened a couple times. Something would happen in the press, and it hadn\u2019t aired yet, and we were like, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d It was a direct connection. That\u2019s always strange. \"When she belittles him and puts him down, he just pops right back up like he didn\u2019t hear it. She\u2019s screaming at him, and he\u2019s seeing rainbows and unicorns.\" Veep\u2019s creator, Armando Iannucci, has done a lot of research in D.C., meeting with all sorts of Hill staffers and basing characters off real people. Are you part of that, or do you keep your distance from the Capitol? I was able to meet with a guy who was a body man for a politician for two years in his 20s, and he shared with me how he had no life, he never saw his family, he was there constantly for two years, and then he moved on to something else. I think about Gary, who\u2019s still there, in his 40s. He knows no life outside of Selina. I just thought, Oh my gosh, this two years of this guy\u2019s life, what if that was extended into 20 years? His identity is completely this woman, which is incredibly sad.\n\nBut he\u2019s content. Where everybody else wants to get new positions and power, Gary doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere. He wants everything to stay the same. He wants her to get more famous so that he can keep his position and his place. Do you think he likes the job or just likes Selina? I think he\u2019s obsessed with the job. I think he absolutely loves the job. When she belittles him and puts him down, he has this amazing recovery and just goes into a state of denial and pops right back up like he didn\u2019t hear it. She\u2019s screaming at him, and he\u2019s seeing rainbows and unicorns. It\u2019s just this odd, dysfunctional recovery. Is there something that could pull him away? I don\u2019t think he would survive on his own. I think he would probably stalk her. I think it could get really ugly! I don\u2019t think he knows how to survive. I think he might still show up at her house. I think he might send her an itinerary. He might sit in a car outside of her residence. I think he might be committed. I think he might be a serial killer. Except for the serial killer part, I want to see that happen. In a perfect world, in Gary\u2019s world, they\u2019re going to get married. They\u2019re going to be at the altar together and it\u2019s going to be nirvana. \"This made me have more respect for people in politics. You\u2019re walking into a pressure cooker, having to make these massive decisions.\" How would you describe their relationship to someone who didn\u2019t know the show? If you ask each of them what their relationship is like, you would get very different answers. If you ask Gary, they are incredibly tight. She desperately needs him. He thinks about her every minute of the day. She cannot live without him, he cannot live without her. If you ask Selina, she might ask you what Gary\u2019s last name is. She would go, \u201cOh, Gary? He\u2019s very sweet.\u201d And you\u2019d be like \u201cSelina, what\u2019s your relationship like with Gary?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s a regular working relationship; he does his job.\u201d Or if somebody says, \u201cWhat is Gary like?\u201d she\u2019d say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, me?\u201d What\u2019s even sadder is that it\u2019s going to get more uncomfortable than it has. How could it get more uncomfortable? How can it get more dysfunctional? It can. That\u2019s what\u2019s scary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The actor shares what he&#39;s learned about Washington from playing the veep&#39;s devoted bag man.", "author": "Nolan Feeney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The actor shares what he&#39;s learned about Washington from playing the veep&#39;s devoted bag man.", "title": "Veep's Tony Hale: 'We Need to Stop Putting Politicians on Pedestals'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/gary_1024/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/-em-veep-em-s-tony-hale-we-need-to-stop-putting-politicians-on-pedestals/359537/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce21b\"", "article_summary": "I need to laugh, I need to get this material in my head so I don\u2019t break on camera.\nFor two seasons, he's appeared on HBO\u2019s vulgar political comedy Veep as Gary Walsh, the vice president\u2019s personal aide.\nI think he\u2019s obsessed with the job.\nShe gets loopy and tells Gary every single thing he\u2019s ever wanted to hear: That she\u2019s going to his parents\u2019 wedding anniversary, they\u2019re going to dance, she adores him.\nObviously working with Sally Phillips, who played the prime minister, and the awkward conversations she and Selina have made me laugh so hard."}
