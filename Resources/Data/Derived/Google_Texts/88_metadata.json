Ron Wyden in November spoke fervently Monday about ousting the longtime incumbent and reducing the federal government\u2019s role in the public\u2019s daily lives.\n\nA debate between the candidates was sponsored by the Redmond Patriots group and held at Highland Baptist Church. The primary election will take place in Oregon on May 17.\n\nThe Republican candidates include Mark Callahan, Sam Carpenter, Dan Laschober and Faye Stewart. About 40 people attended the debate in the church sanctuary.\n\nA moderator asked candidates about their stances on the Affordable Care Act, immigration and climate change, as well as which federal agency they\u2019d like to get rid of.\n\nCallahan, of Portland, ran in the Republican primary for Sen. Jeff Merkley\u2019s Senate seat in 2014. Monica Wehby won that primary election and went on to lose to the incumbent Democrat.\n\n\u201cOur government needs to live within their means,\u201d Callahan said, when asked about the federal budget. \u201cThey need to be fiscally responsible.\u201d\n\nCallahan said he believes human-caused climate change is a myth and said he would support deporting immigrants who are in the United States illegally. \u201cThey break the law to get here, and so I would say, \u2018Deport them,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nCarpenter, a Bend businessman, said a major part of his campaign will be fighting political correctness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight through this political correctness and we\u2019re going to go after Wyden,\u201d Carpenter said.\n\nCarpenter said he would like to reduce the impact of the federal government on businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cI will work toward weakening the federal government\u2019s influence in this state,\u201d he said.\n\nFaye Stewart, of Cottage Grove, who has been a Lane County commissioner for 12 years, said there are several federal agencies he would like to drastically reduce.\n\n\u201cWe have agencies that are trying to achieve zero risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re making it almost impossible for us to do anything.\u201d\n\nStewart said private property rights have been taken away as federal agencies have become burdensome, passing more and more regulations.\n\nDaniel Laschober, of Wilsonville, a software and finance consultant, said he is up at night asking himself whether the country is freer today than it has been in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we had someone who can actually go there and do what he says he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Laschober said about being elected and going to Washington, D.C.\n\nLaschober said he questions whether some federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, are doing what they are supposed to do today compared with when they were created. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need these agencies to go in perpetuity,\u201d he said.\n\nAll of the candidates said they were in favor of restructuring the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7820, tshorack@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "REDMOND \u2014 Four Republican candidates who hope to unseat Oregon Democratic Sen.
