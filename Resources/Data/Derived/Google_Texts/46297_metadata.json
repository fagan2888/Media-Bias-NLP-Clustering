Abrams and Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy were eventually joined on stage Friday by \u201cStar Wars\u201d veterans and \u201cForce Awakens\u201d stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher.\n\nFord, making his first public appearance since his plane crash in March left him hospitalized and injured, assured the audience and host Chris Hardwick that he was fine. The already excitable crowd exploded when Ford, the last to be introduced, walked out.\n\nSeated next to Hamill, the gruff Ford was not hesitant to talk about his reluctance to revisit the world of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the character of Han Solo.\n\n\u201cIt should have felt ridiculous, it was 30 years ago,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI sort of grew up.\u201d\n\nHe never thought that he\u2019d do another film after the original trilogy.\n\n\u201cI was very gratified when I read the script because I read something that I thought was really remarkable, really well-written and with some very intriguing developments,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI was delighted to be involved and I was very happy to be part of the story and the cast again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d which hits theaters on Dec. 18, picks up about 30 years after the events of \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d\n\nBefore fans were treated to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d veterans, they were introduced to the newcomers on the light side of the force and, for the first time, those on the dark side.\n\nAdam Driver, Gwendoline Christie and Domhnall Gleeson were on hand representing the bad guys. As the mysterious three-pronged lightsaber-wielding Kylo Ren, Driver tried to skirt any questions about his character.\n\nWhen pressed, he talked vaguely about the philosophy of evil.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a lot of conversations about bad or evil when we were shooting it,\u201d said Driver. \u201cIt was more the difference between being bad and being right.\u201d\n\nGleeson, whose character\u2019s name was revealed to be General Hux, didn\u2019t hesitate to say that he was evil. While talking about getting the role, Gleeson accidentally \u201cspoiled\u201d the name of his command station, much to the dismay of Abrams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ford, Abrams shed light on \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 at Comic-Con", "title": "Ford, Abrams shed light on \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 at Comic-Con", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ford, Abrams shed light on \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 at Comic-Con", "title": "Ford, Abrams shed light on \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 at Comic-Con", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/11/ford_abrams_shed_light_on_the_force_awakens_at_comic_con/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/aptopix-2015-comic-con-quotstar-wars-the-force-awakensquot-panel.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ford, Abrams shed light on \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 at Comic-Con", "title": "Ford, Abrams shed light on \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 at Comic-Con", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/aptopix-2015-comic-con-quotstar-wars-the-force-awakensquot-panel.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsey Bahr", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd013\"", "article_summary": "Filmmaker J.J.
