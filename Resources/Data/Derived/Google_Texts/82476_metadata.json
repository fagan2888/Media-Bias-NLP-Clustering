(Not that he\u2019s really all that far out of the Democrat mainstream, mind you. The rest of them understand the necessity of lying about their agenda and posing as God-Bless-America prosperity-seeking technocrats.)\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nI\u2019d rather salute Bernie for his remarkable literary foresight. It turns out he was about forty years ahead of the \u201c50 Shades of Grey\u201d phenomenon. If he wasn\u2019t so busy trying to seize and redistribute other peoples\u2019 wealth, he could have been a beach-novel powerhouse.\n\n\u201cA man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused,\u201d reads one excerpt from the Sanders oeuvre, circa 1972. \u201cA woman enjoys intercourse with her man \u2014 as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.\u201d\n\nThese writings were, of course, dismissed as irrelevant old news by the very same media that assured us the tale of Mitt Romney allegedly giving a fellow student a haircut in 1965 was among the reddest and hottest of bulletins in 2012.\n\nKatie McDonough at Salon goes a bit further by offering the strongest, purest form of the argument that politics is the sole important measure of character, at least where Democrats are concerned, listing various bills he\u2019s voted for and political statements he\u2019s made that supposedly provide ironclad proof that he can\u2019t possibly harbor a single misogynist thought in his dear old mind. We heard the same thing when we were assured no amount of real, live sexual harassment could possibly tarnish Bill Clinton\u2019s wonderful feminist credentials, or that it\u2019s crazy to overlook Ted Kennedy\u2019s \u201cliberal lion\u201d voting record to dwell on that one girl he left to drown in his car.\n\nWe hear echoes of the politics-as-character argument when we\u2019re instructed to accept Bill and Hillary Clinton as noble champions of the Little Guy and world-class philanthropists, no matter how many charities they mercilessly loot, and how much exotic currency piles up in their maze of bank accounts and shell corporations.\n\nWe get the converse of the politics-as-character sham when conservatives and Republicans are treated as \u201canti-woman\u201d because they have qualms about abortion or socialized contraceptive distribution, or \u201chateful\u201d if they\u2019re not on board with the latest billion-dollar boondoggle. We\u2019ve been told critics of ObamaCare must be inhuman monsters who enjoy watching poor people drop dead in the street.\n\nFor another Sanders-Romney contrast, look at the crazy \u201cbinders full of women\u201d assault on Romney\u2019s character during the 2012 campaign. Specifically, here\u2019s how CNN began an October 2012 report on the nontroversy: \u201cMitt Romney showed up Tuesday night talking about \u2018binders full of women\u2019 being brought to him when he was governor. Sounds kind of kinky and certainly not something you want to be touting.\u201d\n\nReally? \u201cKinky and certainly not something you want to be touting?\u201d But Bernie Sanders\u2019 rape fantasies, written when he was not a child, but a grown man in his 30s, are utterly irrelevant?\n\nThe massed ranks of dim-bulb liberalism screamed into their oversized media megaphone that Romney\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cbinders full of women\u201d provided some sort of dark window into the festering depths of his woman-hating character. I know we\u2019re all supposed to forget about these political cudgels after the Left discards them, but if by chance the reader has forgotten the 2012 presidential campaign, this was a huge deal, and it went on for days, generating thousands of op-eds.\n\nThat contemporaneous CNN report notes that by the morning after Romney dropped the line, \u201calmost 300,000 people had supported a Facebook page about what a politically dumb statement it was.\u201d Some of those people are, right this instant, writing Facebook posts saying Bernie Sanders writing about women enjoying forcible intercourse with multiple men says nothing meaningful about him.\n\nAnd it was all over the following quote from Mitt Romney, in response to a question during a presidential debate, saying that when he was governor of Massachusetts, \u201cI had the chance to pull together a Cabinet, and the applicants seemed to be men. I went to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u2018Can you help us find folks?\u2019 And they brought us whole binders full of women.\u201d\n\nHilariously, CNN\u2019s probing analysis tried to grant Romney a little \u201cfairness\u201d by saying \u201c\u2018binders\u2019 was most likely a slip of the tongue,\u201d before launching into a lengthy unpacking of how that little slip illustrated his insufficient dedication to women\u2019s equality. \u201cBinders\u201d is not a slip of the tongue \u2013 it\u2019s a perfectly ordinary word for a common object, which can be used to hold a stack of resumes. But we were buried beneath a billion words of such idiotic flapdoodle about how Romney \u2013 in the course of telling a story about how he decided his gubernatorial cabinet needed more women, so he asked for and received help from women\u2019s groups \u2013 had inadvertently revealed the dark heart of a woman-oppressing throwback.\n\nObviously this was an entirely political outburst of cultivated stupidity, based on the principle that Romney\u2019s party affiliation said everything important about his character, just as the politics of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton define their characters.\n\nIt\u2019s a double game that should have stopped a long time ago, because this robotic acceptance of ideology as morality is killing us. The truth is closer to the opposite: what good are the promises of someone who cannot be trusted? Seven years after electing a President whose character and history the press refused to examine in depth, we should have learned that painful lesson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "50 Shades of Bernie Sanders: Politics as Character", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "50 Shades of Bernie Sanders: Politics as Character", "title": "50 Shades of Bernie Sanders: Politics as Character - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Bernie-Sanders-and-Hillary-Clinton-AP-Photos.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-05-29T15:36:05-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/29/50-shades-of-bernie-sanders-politics-as-character/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "50 Shades of Bernie Sanders: Politics as Character", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Bernie-Sanders-and-Hillary-Clinton-AP-Photos.jpg", "title": "50 Shades of Bernie Sanders: Politics as Character - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2012 election, 2016 election, Bernie Sanders, feminism, Mitt Romney,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-29T14:04:10-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-05-29T15:36:05-07:00", "tag": "Mitt Romney", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cKinky and certainly not something you want to be touting?\u201d But Bernie Sanders\u2019 rape fantasies, written when he was not a child, but a grown man in his 30s, are utterly irrelevant?\nObviously this was an entirely political outburst of cultivated stupidity, based on the principle that Romney\u2019s party affiliation said everything important about his character, just as the politics of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton define their characters.\nA woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused,\u201d reads one excerpt from the Sanders oeuvre, circa 1972.\nIt turns out he was about forty years ahead of the \u201c50 Shades of Grey\u201d phenomenon.\nFor another Sanders-Romney contrast, look at the crazy \u201cbinders full of women\u201d assault on Romney\u2019s character during the 2012 campaign."}
