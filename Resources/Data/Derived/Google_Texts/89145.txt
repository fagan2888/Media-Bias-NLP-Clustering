It's that time of year where thousands are traveling to the beach with their families, and with more drivers on the road, more accidents can occur. The Walton County Sheriff's Office, along with Florida Highway Patrol are teaming up and implementing Operation Safe Travels.

Over the next three months officials say there will be more traffic enforcement and, as always, a zero tolerance policy for traffic violations.

"We are going to be out here. If you get pulled over, don't be surprised, if you get a ticket don't be surprised,” said Chief AJ Smith, of the Walton County Sheriff's Office. “Slow down, have the proper distance of the car in front of you, and enjoy the beach, and make it home alive, that is what we want people making it home alive."

Sheriff's officials say they have seen a lot of drivers speeding, and accidents occurring on U.S. Highway 98 and Highway 331.
