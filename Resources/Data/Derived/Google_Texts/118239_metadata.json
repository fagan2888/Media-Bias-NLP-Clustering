(The company) had its workforce leaving voluntarily,\u201d Fortune Magazine senior editor Christopher Tkacyzk said. \u201cKeeping that low turnover rate is a testament to the fact that The Cheesecake Factor is a really great place to work.\u201d\n\nWhile the company currently has 181 locations, it plans to expand with around a dozen more restaurants opening in the future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is a reason The Cheesecake Factory is among Fortune Magazine's \"100 Best Companies To Work For\".", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/04/01/cheesecake-factory-only-la-based-company-to-land-on-fortunes-100-best-companies-to-work-for/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/keyframe271.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/keyframe271.jpg?w=640", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "There is a reason The Cheesecake Factory is among Fortune Magazine's \"100 Best Companies To Work For\".", "title": "Cheesecake Factory Only LA-Based Company To Land On Fortune's '100 Best Companies To Work For'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/keyframe271.jpg?w=640", "description": "There is a reason The Cheesecake Factory is among Fortune Magazine's \"100 Best Companies To Work For\".", "site": "CBSLA", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cheesecake Factory Only LA-Based Company To Land On Fortune's '100 Best Companies To Work For'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of LA/OC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Los Angeles", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "keywords": "business, food, food & drink, news, syndicated local, business, fortune magazine, los angeles, restaurant, the cheesecake factory", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5c05896c022a6d5696298ac60bad5bcf?s=16", "news_keywords": "business, fortune magazine, los angeles, restaurant, the cheesecake factory"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd367b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI have four children, and they all work for The Cheesecake Factory right now,\u201d 20-year employee and senior general manager Frank Harris said.\nIn fact, The Cheesecake Factor is the only Los Angeles-based company to make Fortune\u2019s list.\nCompared to the national turnover rate of 44 percent and specifically a 66 percent turnover rate for the restaurant and hotel industry, The Cheesecake Factory\u2019s six percent turnover rate catches attention.\nLOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) \u2014 There is a reason The Cheesecake Factory is among Fortune Magazine\u2018s \u201c100 Best Companies To Work For.\u201dEven before Obamacare, the Los Angeles-based restaurant chain offered health insurance coverage to its employees, including part-time employees, who work at least 25 hours per week.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re putting things on (and) taking things off, at Cheesecake Factor every six months.\u201dWhile employees of restaurant chains generally come and go relatively quickly, the tendency for The Cheesecake Factory employees to remain with the company is rather unique."}
