The usually reliable Justin Tucker missed two field goal tries, and all three units made enough mistakes to keep a football coach up late at night - even after a victory.\n\n\u201cWe had too many to overcome to play the kind of football we wanted to play,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cToo many long-yardage situations, too many penalties, too many special teams penalties \u2026 too many things we had to clean up.\u201d\n\nBut the defense was sound, and there were enough positives to enable Baltimore to escape with its fourth win in five games.\n\n\u201cOur guys have the ability to overcome adversity and have the ability to keep pounding and keep fighting and not let self-inflicted wounds overcome us,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nTerrell Suggs was credited with 2 1/2 sacks and rookie Timmy Jernigan, starting for the suspended Haloti Ngata, had two.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we just do best - knocking down quarterbacks,\u201d said linebacker Elvis Dumervil, who had a sack to match his single-season high of 17.\n\nJacksonville (2-12) tried just about everything in its bid to pull off an upset, including an onside kick and a fake punt. Both worked, but it wasn\u2019t enough to earn the Jaguars their first win on the road.\n\nJoe Flacco went 20 for 30 for 221 yards and a touchdown for the Ravens, who blanked the Jaguars over the final 30 minutes.\n\nBortles completed 21 of 37 passes for 210 yards, and an interception that came in the game\u2019s final minute. He threw under pressure for most of the game - Baltimore\u2019s season-high eight sacks increased the number Jacksonville has yielded this season to 62.\n\nBortles played much of the game with a sprained right foot and was in a walking boot afterward.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re great up front. We knew that coming into the game,\u201d Bortles said of the Ravens. \u201cA lot of the sacks were on me holding the ball too long. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m working on and have to do better.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars\u2019 points came on four field goals by Josh Scobee.\n\n\u201cNo touchdowns,\u201d coach Gus Bradley lamented. \u201cEven if we get one, one touchdown, it gives us a great opportunity in this game.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving to jeers on their first series of the second half, the Ravens mounted an 80-yard drive to take a 17-12 lead with 8:34 left in the third quarter. Flacco went 5 of 5 for 65 yards, including a 27-yard completion to Owen Daniels and a 3-yard touchdown pass to the tight end.\n\nThe Jaguars were then poised for a three-and-out, but punter Bryan Anger flipped a pass to Will Ta\u2019ufo\u2019ou for 19 yards to extend the drive. Five plays later, however, Jacksonville punted.\n\nFrom that point, neither team had much success moving the ball until the Ravens put together a late 49-yard march that produced a field goal and an eight-point cushion with 1:11 remaining.\n\n\u201cObviously it didn\u2019t go as smoothly as we would have liked,\u201d Daniels said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nBaltimore trailed 12-10 at halftime after gaining only 13 yards on the ground and going 0 for 6 on third-down conversions.\n\nThree straight plays during the game\u2019s opening series showed why Jacksonville came to town with only two wins. After tight end Marcedes Lewis dropped a second-down pass, Bortles missed connecting with a wide-open Cecil Shorts.\n\nOn fourth down, Baltimore\u2019s Darian Stewart burst through the line to block Anger\u2019s punt. Kamar Aiken scooped up the ball and went 11 yards for a touchdown, Baltimore\u2019s first score on a blocked punt since Ed Reed did it against Seattle in 2003.\n\nFrom there, the only scoring in the first half came on field goals.\n\nNOTES: Ravens S Terrence Brooks hurt his right knee on the game\u2019s first play and is likely lost for the season, Harbaugh said. \u2026 Jaguars LB Ryan Davis (hip) and Ravens DB Asa Jackson (knee) left early and did not return. \u2026 Flacco went over 25,000 yards for his career. He\u2019s at 25,024. \u2026 Ravens WR Steve Smith became the 18th player in NFL history with 900 career catches.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "At this point in the season, when results count far more than style, the Baltimore Ravens will happily accept a flawed victory.", "Author": "David Ginsburg", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "At this point in the season, when results count far more than style, the Baltimore Ravens will happily accept a flawed victory.", "title": "Ravens go for substance over style to beat Jaguars", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/14/ravens-use-defense-to-beat-jaguars-20-12/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/899c0b8905543c31680f6a706700275a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/899c0b8905543c31680f6a706700275a.jpg", "title": "Ravens go for substance over style to beat Jaguars", "description": "At this point in the season, when results count far more than style, the Baltimore Ravens will happily accept a flawed victory.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Baltimore Ravens, Baltimore, Jacksonville, Blake Bortles"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbc3\"", "article_summary": "Three straight plays during the game\u2019s opening series showed why Jacksonville came to town with only two wins.\nJoe Flacco went 20 for 30 for 221 yards and a touchdown for the Ravens, who blanked the Jaguars over the final 30 minutes.\nThe Ravens (9-5) scored just once with their offense on the field and gained only 31 yards rushing through three quarters.\n\u2026 Jaguars LB Ryan Davis (hip) and Ravens DB Asa Jackson (knee) left early and did not return.\nIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m working on and have to do better.\u201dThe Jaguars\u2019 points came on four field goals by Josh Scobee."}
