Problem is he is not eligible to return until the San Diego game in Week 15. As a result, the Broncos enter this week compromised at linebacker with Brandon Marshall undergoing the concussion protocol.\n\nThat leaves rookie Lamin Barrow, backup Steven Johnson and possibly safety T.J. Ward as potential replacements at Kansas City if Marshall is not cleared.\n\n\u201cWe have options,\u201d coach John Fox said Monday.\n\nBarrow has participated in four games this season, but played a season-high 21 snaps in Sunday\u2019s win over the Dolphins. He was used in nickel coverage for nine snaps. He was designated to call defensive signals after Marshall\u2019s second-half injury, but had technical problems with the helmet.\n\n\u201cI know I have plenty to work on,\u201d said Barrow, a former star at Louisiana State. \u201cI am critical of my work. I know have to get better and continue to adjust to the speed of the game.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 defense also faces issues at cornerback. Kayvon Webster dislocated his left shoulder and Aqib Talib played just 17 snaps because of a hamstring injury. Omar Bolden replaced them, and impressed Fox with his preparation.\n\n\u201cYou always like to see when a guy is ready when called upon,\u201d said Fox said.\n\nWebster and Talib are listed as day-to-day. Talib said he would discuss his injury on Wednesday. Tight end Julius Thomas sat out the Dolphins game with a left ankle injury. He remains hopeful that he will return against the Chiefs, but nothing is certain.\n\n\u201cI have had better days and I have had worse,\u201d Thomas said Monday. \u201cYou hope to wake up and feel better. It has improved, though.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
