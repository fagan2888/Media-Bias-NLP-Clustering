Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) compared Obamacare to Snapchat, an app that allows users to send pictures and videos between phones for a limited amount of time before the images disappear.

"Obamacare is the health care version of Snapchat, now you see, now you don't," Bachmann said Wednesday, according to Politico's Ginger Gibson.

Bachmann later explained she uses Snapchat to talk with her kids during the day.

"It's pictures of what they're eating," Bachmann said.

Bachmann then proceeded to explain the app to some of her colleagues:

Bachmann heard on mic explaining Snapchat to lawmakers: "...what you do is you record yourself, you know it's like a selfie.." — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) January 15, 2014

Bachmann's not the only lawmaker on Snapchat. Politico reported Wednesday Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) just joined the social network.
