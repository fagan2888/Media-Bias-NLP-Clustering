Kinston police say a tractor trailer side swiped a woman's vehicle when making a turn and kept going.

No injuries were reported, but the woman, Dawn Wiggins, contacted WITN on Facebook saying she has roughly $6000 dollars worth of damage.

The accident happened around 7:20 a.m. Friday on US 58 South and Highway 70 near Lenoir Community College in Kinston, according to police.

Wiggins says she's physically okay, but is upset that the truck driver never stopped.

Police have very little to go on at this time.

Wiggins says the truck was carrying a load of wood.
