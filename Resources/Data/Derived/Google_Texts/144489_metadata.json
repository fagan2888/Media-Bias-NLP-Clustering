Ted Cruz of being \u201ca sleazy, Rovian liar\u201d for remarks he made about his rival Donald Trump.\n\nDuring an interview on The Kelly File on Wednesday evening, Cruz said that Trump \u201cis calling for the same socialized medicine as Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of them are saying expand Obamacare to put the federal government in charge of every one of our health care, which will eventually lead to rationing of care,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCoulter, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump, took to social media in an effort to refute Cruz\u2019s remarks.\n\nThis is shocking. Cruz is a sleazy, Rovian liar. You can look up the debates. Trump never said ANYTHING like this \u2013 https://t.co/DWVxHTdMeo \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 11, 2016\n\nTrump insults opponents; he doesn't lie about them. Cruz is a despicable liar \u2013 see video: https://t.co/DWVxHTdMeo \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 11, 2016\n\nSee my Facebook page for transcript of what Trump actually said about healthcare, compared to Cruz's outright lies on Coyote News last night \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 11, 2016\n\nTed Cruz lies like a Clinton \u2014 see my Facebook page for details. \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 11, 2016\n\nFULL transcripts of Cruz's lies & Trump's actual words on my webpage. I wanted to like Cruz, but this is despicable. https://t.co/kwGC1z9VvV \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 11, 2016\n\nIn an extensive Facebook rant, Coulter highlighted excerpts from debate transcripts in which Trump denied support for socialized medicine.\n\nIn both instances she referenced, Trump denied support for Obamacare, arguing that he would repeal it and replace it with \u201csomething so much better.\u201d\n\n\u201cHERE\u2019S CRUZ,\u201d she concluded. \u201cLYING UP A STORM!\u201d\n\nTED CRUZ, SLEAZY LIAR: Compare Cruz's claims on Fox News (Coyote News) last night \u2013 to what Trump actually said about\u2026 Posted by Ann Coulter on Thursday, February 11, 2016\n\nIn the very excerpts that Coulter highlighted, however, Trump said that \u201cAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here.\u201d\n\nIn the second excerpt highlighted by Coulter from the most recent GOP debate, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. We\u2019re going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that:\n\n\u201cIn addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don\u2019t want that to happen. We\u2019re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we\u2019re going to take care of those people and I think everybody on this stage would have to agree you\u2019re not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.\u201d\n\nAsked about universal health care during an interview with 60 Minutes in September, Trump said, \u201cI am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?\u201d Scott Pelley asked in response.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be taken care of,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably-\u201d\n\n\u201cMake a deal? Who pays for it?\u201d Pelley pressed.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it\u2019s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Author and commentator Ann Coulter has accused Republican presidential candidate Sen.
