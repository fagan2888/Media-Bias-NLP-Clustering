His world-class castle, San Simeon, perched above the California coast, is a popular tourist destination for the many thousands each year who wish for a jaw-dropping glimpse of American opulence. By comparison, anything Donald J. Trump has built as a monument to his ego has to be considered third-rate.\n\nTrump may think he\u2019s one of a kind, but that isn\u2019t quite true \u2014 not in the way he built his empire, and not in the broader political sense either. A century ago, Hearst ran for president and was, for a time, taken seriously. The bicoastal billionaire thrived on the art of the deal and domination in international business. Besides his influential San Francisco and New York newspapers, he expanded his multi-media business by going Hollywood. As a pioneer in the motion picture industry, he produced silent film classics as well as war propaganda, and proved that the entertainment industry could weigh in on, and even direct, national political controversies.\n\nWe all know what Trump did to command attention these last few weeks: He went after Mexico, whose illegals were somehow sent north by the Mexican government, and who pose a significant threat to the health and well being of the U.S. Trump may think his Great Wall provides the answer; but he doesn\u2019t go half as far as his more glamorous predecessor did. Will Hearst urged that the government intervene militarily in Mexico, capitalizing on political upheaval there. \u201cThere is only one course to pursue,\u201d he editorialized in 1913, \u201cand that is to occupy Mexico and restore it to a state of civilization by means of American men and American methods.\u201d He generalized about the Mexicans as \u201ccunning and unscrupulous,\u201d as he proposed all-out invasion.\n\nHeadline grabbing was, literally, Hearst\u2019s business. His combustible personality had already been responsible for the \u201cyellow journalism\u201d that got the U.S. into war in Cuba in 1898. Trump hasn\u2019t done that yet. While \u201cThe Donald\u201d tells us China is a subverter of all that is of value to the health of the American economy, \u201cThe Chief,\u201d as Hearst was known, accused the same government of setting a subversive example among the key nations with which the U.S. conducted its trade. He attacked the \u201crich mandarins\u201d of the East who, he said, stood as the model for an across-the-board American business failure.\n\nIndeed, the egocentric Hearst aimed every bit as high as Trump, making noises (as Trump did) about running for mayor of New York City (he almost won) and governor of New York, and making a serious run for president in 1904. He spent millions of his own money in the process, constructing an independent political organization, appealing directly to the people, and dismissing his national competition as lesser men who were barely worth paying attention to. It was as if the election was a referendum on him. Yet he groused about incumbent President Theodore Roosevelt: \u201cHe is a creation of newspaper notoriety.\u201d Hearst\u2019s campaign strategist, Arthur Brisbane, said: \u201cThe American people, like all people, are interested in PERSONALITY.\u201d Even then they knew.\n\nBut here\u2019s the crucial difference between Hearst\u2019s and Trump\u2019s loud efforts to capture the presidency: The earlier billionaire (worth seven times what Forbes says Trump is worth; three times what Trump says Trump is worth) was a more credible populist. He was a staunch union supporter, and said the following: \u201cWide and equitable distribution of wealth is essential to a nation\u2019s prosperous growth and intellectual development. And that distribution is brought about by the labor union more than any other agency of our civilization.\u201d Yes, he said that while running for president in 1904. Also, \u201cthe corporations control the Democratic machine as much as they do the Republican machine.\u201d There was a touch of Bernie Sanders in the Hearst message. Trump, for his part, has only this to say: \u201cI\u2019m very, very rich.\u201d\n\nThough he failed to capture the presidency, Hearst actually represented New York in Congress for two terms. It is hard to imagine Trump doing anything so mundane. His ambition is to be the ringmaster of the Greatest Show on Earth, and if it can\u2019t be the presidency (which of course it won\u2019t be), then he\u2019ll be perfectly content to maintain a visual media presence and intermittently steal headlines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump may think he's one of a kind, but that isn't true.
