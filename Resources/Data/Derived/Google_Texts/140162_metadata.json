It was a celebration that spread quickly on the Internet, spawning a new meme: \u201cHenrying.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday night at Red Bull Arena in the team\u2019s 2014 home opener, Henry perhaps provided a clue of his life after soccer (he is in the final year of his contract with Major League Soccer and the Red Bulls) when he did his best Jean-Luc Godard imitation, taking a page from the French New Wave film director.\n\nHenry had just scored the 42nd goal of his Red Bulls career to move past Giovanni Savarese (the current coach of the Cosmos of the North American Soccer League) and into second place on the team\u2019s career list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the 57th minute of the 1-1 draw against visiting Colorado, Lloyd Sam lofted a soft cross from the right side into the Rapids\u2019 penalty area.

He dove for the ball and headed it past goalkeeper John Berner.\n\nWhat followed was a bit on the bizarre side, but perhaps not for Henry.\n\nAs the video below shows, Henry jumped over the advertising boards behind the end line and shooed away a cameraman from his equipment, taking up residence behind the lens.\n\nThe goal is being called the \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Sam said of the play: \u201cI knew that if I put it towards the back post there would be a couple of guys there. In my head I would have thought Tim before Thierry, but I was happy that he converted it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140316155410, "twitter": {"description": "The Red Bulls\u2019 captain, Thierry Henry, added another chapter to his novel postgoal celebrations when he scored against Colorado on Saturday night.", "title": "Red Bulls Rewind: Lights, Camera, Henry", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/red-bulls-rewind-lights-camera-henry.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002771337"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/17rbny2/17rbny2-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/red-bulls-rewind-lights-camera-henry.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002771337", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/red-bulls-rewind-lights-camera-henry.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/soccer", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/soccer/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 16, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "New York Red Bulls (Soccer Team)", "keywords": "Henry  Thierry,Soccer,New York Red Bulls (Soccer Team)", "news_keywords": "Soccer", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jack Bell", "SCG": "soccer", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Henry, Thierry", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JACK BELL", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Red Bulls\u2019 captain, Thierry Henry, added another chapter to his novel postgoal celebrations when he scored against Colorado on Saturday night.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/17rbny2/17rbny2-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The Red Bulls\u2019 captain, Thierry Henry, added another chapter to his novel postgoal celebrations when he scored against Colorado on Saturday night.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Soccer", "modified": "2014-03-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/soccer/index.jsonp", "tag": "New York Red Bulls (Soccer Team)", "published": "2014-03-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "17rbny", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140318145611, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/red-bulls-rewind-lights-camera-henry.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/17rbny2/17rbny2-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Red Bulls\u2019 captain, Thierry Henry, added another chapter to his novel postgoal celebrations when he scored against Colorado on Saturday night.", "title": "Red Bulls Rewind: Lights, Camera, Henry"}, "pdate": 20140316, "des": "Soccer", "articleid": 100000002771337, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Red Bulls Rewind: Lights, Camera, Henry", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/17/sports/soccer/17rbny2/17rbny2-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "PhotoHARRISON, N.J. \u2014 As goal-scoring celebrations go, the Red Bulls\u2019 captain, Thierry Henry, has a distinct flair for the dramatic with a flash of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nLast season, after scoring a goal against Toronto, Henry struck a pose, leaning against the goal post.\nor any league, Henry was left alone by the near post.\nHenry had just scored the 42nd goal of his Red Bulls career to move past Giovanni Savarese (the current coach of the Cosmos of the North American Soccer League) and into second place on the team\u2019s career list.\nIn my head I would have thought Tim before Thierry, but I was happy that he converted it.\u201d"}
