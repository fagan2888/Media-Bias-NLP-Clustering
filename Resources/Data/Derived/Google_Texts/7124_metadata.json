Nevertheless, the findings offer new insight into possible osteoporosis treatments.\n\nThe mechanisms behind why this happens are actually quite easy to understand. Osteoblasts, one type of large cell present in bones, help to build bone tissue, and they tend to be more active during the day. Osteoclasts, on the other hand, resorb bone tissue, breaking it down, over and over again \u2014 It\u2019s a constant process between the two. As we age, and start losing sleep more often, osteoclasts begin to get the upper hand. The combination of lost sleep and increased bone stress \u201ctends to speed up the process of bone breakdown,\u201d said Faleh Tamimi, professor at the University\u2019s School of Dentistry, in a press release.\n\nFor those who are at risk of developing osteoporosis, melatonin supplements may be enough to reset their circadian rhythms, get them sleeping again, and could possibly reduce the effect of osteoclasts on the bone.\n\nThey discovered this after testing a melatonin solution on 22-month-old rats, which would have been 60 years old in human years. For 10 weeks (six years in human years), the rats drank the solution, after which the researchers compared their femurs\u2019 strength to those of a control group. Bone density and strength tests showed that their bones were stronger, when compared to the control group. In another, rather brutal, test to prove their strength, they broke the rats\u2019 bones. The results were confirmed. It took much more force to break the bones of the rats that took the melatonin than it did to break the bones of the control group.\n\nThe researchers are looking at these results as a possible solution for the 54 million people who are at risk of osteoporosis due to low bone mass. Although the condition is most associated with occurring in women, men are also at risk of developing it. In all, one in two women and one in four men over 50 years old are at risk of breaking a bone from osteoporosis, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n\nTamimi said that his team\u2019s next steps are to determine whether melatonin can only prevent reductions in bone density, or if it can repair damage that has already occurred. \u201cUntil there is more research as well as clinical trials to determine how exactly melatonin is working, we can\u2019t recommend that people with osteoporosis go ahead and simply take melatonin supplements,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, a simpler answer may be to just get more sleep.\n\nSource: Tamimi F, Eimar H, Barralet J, et al.
