The program prioritizes efforts that benefit disadvantaged communities.\n\nColonia Park, a 10-acre facility at Juanita Avenue and First Street, has two baseball fields where just over 43,000 square feet of grass would be replaced.\n\nAt 13.5-acre Del Sol Park, southwest of Camino Del Sol and Rose Avenue, two soccer fields totaling 57,600 square feet would get the synthetic turf.\n\nThe project would require removal of more than 3,700 cubic yards of field in all. The new surface would include a drainage layer and multiple layers of synthetic covering.\n\nThe city is expected to save nearly $43,000 a year through lower costs for water, electricity, mowing, fertilizer, aeration and sod replacement, the report says. Residents would get an estimated 25 more hours of play time a week, because the turf, unlike grass, requires no down time to recover.\n\nThe artificial turf is expected to last 10 years. The grant would fund total project costs.\n\nThe application was submitted in December, and on Tuesday the City Council approved a resolution supporting the application and authorizing expenditure of the expected funds.\n\nDuring the hearing, Councilwoman Dorina Padilla asked that any savings be set aside to fund future turf replacement, a request supported by her colleagues. City Manager Greg Nyhoff said a separate fund would be set up for that purpose.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Two Oxnard parks may get synthetic turf", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/oxnard/two-oxnard-parks-may-get-synthetic-turf-ep-932201130-348645891.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/parkweb_13266933_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Two Oxnard parks in the La Colonia neighborhood, Colonia and Del Sol, would have grass fields replaced with synthetic turf if the city wins an expected $2.5 million state grant.", "title": "Two Oxnard parks may get synthetic turf"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/parkweb_13266933_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Two Oxnard parks in the La Colonia neighborhood, Colonia and Del Sol, would have grass fields replaced with synthetic turf if the city wins an expected $2.5 million state grant.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Two Oxnard parks may get synthetic turf"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00e1\"", "article_summary": "<p>GRETCHEN WENNER/THE STAR</p><p>Grass fields at Colonia and Del Sol parks in Oxnard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s La Colonia neighborhood could be replaced by synthetic turf if the city wins an expected $2.5 million grant.</p>Two Oxnard parks in the La Colonia neighborhood, Colonia and Del Sol, would have grass fields replaced with synthetic turf if the city wins an expected $2.5 million state grant.\nAt 13.5-acre Del Sol Park, southwest of Camino Del Sol and Rose Avenue, two soccer fields totaling 57,600 square feet would get the synthetic turf.\nDuring the hearing, Councilwoman Dorina Padilla asked that any savings be set aside to fund future turf replacement, a request supported by her colleagues.\nThe funds would come from a state Department of Water Resources grant program meant to reduce water and energy use.\nThe artificial turf is expected to last 10 years."}
