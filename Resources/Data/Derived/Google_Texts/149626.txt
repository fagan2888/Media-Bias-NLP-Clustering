Walmart Stores said on Tuesday that lower margins in its pharmacy business had emerged as a drag on profits, as it gets paid less by drug plan managers and as fewer customers pay in cash, since the Affordable Care Act has increased the ranks of insured Americans. The company warned that the margin squeeze would continue for at least the remainder of the year, although a spokesman said the pharmacy business is profitable and that Walmart has no plans to sell it or find a partner to share the risk. Walmart said its margins were being cut by reduced reimbursement rates from PBMs. Walmart's pharmacy generates $19 billion a year in annual revenue, according to Evercore ISI, but it is still no match for the clout held by the top three PBMs, which collectively process about 70% of all prescriptions in the United States, says Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj. "With that kind of power they have in hand, they can dictate what pricing is going to be for the most part," Lekraj states.
