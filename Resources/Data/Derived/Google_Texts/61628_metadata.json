At the same time, without smart fixes, the ACA threatens the middle class with higher premiums, loss of hours, and a shift to part-time work and less comprehensive coverage.\"\n\nIt's a criticism that could have been written by any Republican -- in fact, Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., wrote the same thing in a Politico op-ed last month.\n\n\"The president talks a lot about tackling inequality,\" Jindal wrote. \"But his health care law is a recipe for increasing inequality, not decreasing it. Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion doesn\u2019t just discourage work; it also prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities.\"\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

The law creates that \"perverse incentive\" because a Health and Human Services regulation defines \"full-time\" status as 30 hours of work weekly.\n\nThe report even complains about the exemption for congressional staffers that Sen. David Vitter, R-La., has tried to eliminate.\n\n\"We cannot sit idly by as the politicians carve up our health plans while they carve out exceptions for themselves and every special interest feeding at the trough in Washington,\" the cover letter to the report says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new labor union research report offers a scathing indictment of how Obamacare affects middle-class workers.
