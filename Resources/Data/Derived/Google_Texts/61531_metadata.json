Unfortunately you're the same creepy corrupt compulsive liar wearing a fake sincere expression while promising to bring back the good days that you were twenty years ago.\n\nCBS's Charlie Rose, the man who could make WW3 seem boring, did a softball interview with Bill Clinton asking him about his non-intern related priorities for Hillary's two terms.\n\nBill touted the usual stuff. More ObamaCare, more student loans and more Green Energy. And he did compliment Americans on how much less racist and homophobic we were.\n\nThe former president said the nation\u2019s political and media climate was bad in the mid-1990s, but had gotten even more difficult because party politics \u201care even more polarized.\u201d While Americans are \u201cless racist and homophobic\u201d than they used to be, he said, they tend to be far less willing to spend time listening to those who don\u2019t agree with them, he said, calling that a dangerous trend.\n\nThat's hilarious coming from a guy with his own in-house smear-and-spin factory, Media Matters.\n\nAnd Americans always appreciate lectures on racism from a guy who said that Obama should be fetching him coffee. But the great thing about the Democratic Party is that yesterday's racist is today's scold about white privilege.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Unfortunately Bill is the same creepy corrupt compulsive liar", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Unfortunately Bill is the same creepy corrupt compulsive liar", "title": "Bill Clinton: Americans \"Less Racist and Homophobic\" Than They Used to Be", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/241617/bill-clinton-americans-less-racist-and-homophobic-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/241617/bill-clinton-americans-less-racist-and-homophobic-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Unfortunately Bill is the same creepy corrupt compulsive liar", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill Clinton: Americans \"Less Racist and Homophobic\" Than They Used to Be"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-23T14:12:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedf9\"", "article_summary": "But the great thing about the Democratic Party is that yesterday's racist is today's scold about white privilege.\nAnd he did compliment Americans on how much less racist and homophobic we were.\nAnd Americans always appreciate lectures on racism from a guy who said that Obama should be fetching him coffee.\nCBS's Charlie Rose, the man who could make WW3 seem boring, did a softball interview with Bill Clinton asking him about his non-intern related priorities for Hillary's two terms.\nThanks Bill."}
