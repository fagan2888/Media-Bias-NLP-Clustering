A Wisconsin coalition says Governor Scott Walker's health care plan would lead to skyrocketing health care costs.

Citizen Action of Wisconsin spoke about the governor's plan at the Eau Claire Area Hmong Mutual Assistance Association Thursday.

The coalition says a high-cost health care area like Eau Claire, would be disadvantaged by Governor Walker's plan.

"It's especially clear in Eau Claire, where Governor Walker's tax credit that he replaced the Affordable Care Act with, don't take into account income, or the cost of health care in an area, " said Robert Kraig, with the Citizen Action.

Governor Walker's campaign says, in part, "Day One Patient Freedom plan is a big, bold conservative solution that replaces Obamacare's government-centric approach with a market-driven system that works for all Americans."
