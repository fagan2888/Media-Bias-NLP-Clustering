The relatively healthy 61-year-old didn\u2019t try to see the doctor until last month, when she and her husband both needed authorization to see separate specialists.\n\nShe called the doctor\u2019s office several times without luck.\n\n\u201cThey told me that they were not on the plan, they were never on the plan and they\u2019d been trying to get their name off the plan all year,\u201d said Papa, who recently bought a plan from a different insurance company.\n\nIt was no better with the next doctor she was assigned. The Naples, Florida, resident said she left a message to make an appointment, \u201cand they never called back.\u201d\n\nThe Papas were among the 6.7 million people who gained insurance through the Affordable Care Act last year, flooding a primary care system that is struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nA survey this year by The Physicians Foundation found that 81 percent of doctors describe themselves as either over-extended or at full capacity, and 44 percent said they planned to cut back on the number of patients they see, retire, work part-time or close their practice to new patients.\n\nAt the same time, insurance companies have routinely limited the number of doctors and providers on their plans as a way to cut costs. The result has further restricted some patients\u2019 ability to get appointments quickly.\n\nOne purpose of the new health law was connecting patients, many of whom never had insurance before, with primary care doctors to prevent them from landing in the emergency room when they are sicker and their care is more expensive. Yet nearly 1 in 5 Americans lives in a region designated as having a shortage of primary care physicians, and the number of doctors entering the field isn\u2019t expected to keep pace with demand.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges projects the shortage will grow to about 66,000 in little more than a decade as fewer residency slots are available and as more medical students choose higher-paying specialty areas.\n\nFor now, experts say most patients are receiving the care they need, even if they have to drive farther, wait longer or see a nurse practitioner or physician assistant rather than a doctor.\n\nMore importantly, many are getting care for the first time. The surge also has forced many doctors to streamline their practice and rely more on mid-tier professionals instead of seeing every patient themselves.\n\n\u201cFamily doctors are seeing a pretty significant increase in requests for appointments from new patients,\u201d said Dr. Wanda Filer, a primary care doctor in York, Pennsylvania, and president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nIn response, the academy of more than 115,000 doctors say they\u2019re adding new physicians to their practices, relying more on nurse practitioners and physician\u2019s assistants, adding evening and weekend appointments. Despite the demand, Filer said most patients can get same-day appointments with someone on their team.\n\nDr. Laura Byerly has seen a surge of more than 2,000 new patients since January at her chain of health clinics in Hillsboro, Oregon, about 30 minutes west of Portland. Many had sporadic or no medical care for many years.\n\nShe hired new primary care doctors, receptionists and nurses whose sole role is to see new patients and prepare the chart for the first visit with the doctor. They even opened a new clinic so patients who used to drive 45 minutes for a visit could now see a doctor five minutes from home.\n\n\u201cThe new patients required a significant amount of work to understand just what medications they should be on, what are their active diagnoses, what studies are needed now, and just who they are and what their life is like,\u201d said Byerly, who is the medical director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation health clinics.\n\nDr. Jack Chou takes patients only during open enrollment. Otherwise, it\u2019s a six to nine-month wait at his Los Angeles-area practice, where most of the new patients were covered through Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe initial visit takes much longer because we\u2019re trying to learn about patients who had fragmented care or no care at all,\u201d said Chou. Despite the staffing struggles, \u201cit\u2019s actually a godsend for some of my patients.\u201d\n\nWhile most doctors are successfully juggling the influx, there have been cases like that of the Papas, in which consumers call multiple doctors only to find they are not in network or the doctors are not taking new patients.\n\nInsurance agent Anthony Halby heard similar complaints from his clients in Grass Valley, California, a Sierra foothill community about an hour east of Sacramento. He said half a dozen consumers wanted him to switch their health plans as soon as the second round of open enrollment started earlier this month. They told him the plan they chose last year made it extremely difficult to find primary care doctors.\n\nOnly two insurance companies in the Gold Rush-era town offer coverage through the state exchange, and just four or five primary care doctors out of about 135 signed up with one insurer.\n\nThe other insurer has more doctors, but most are considered out of network. That means patients who use them will pay 60 percent of the bill, he said.\n\n\u201cCoverage does not equal access,\u201d said Halby, who instead recommends his clients choose a plan outside the exchange that has a much broader provider network but also will not come with the government premium subsidies given to most of those who buy insurance through the exchange. \u201cI tell people this up front: The premiums are going to be higher because there\u2019s no subsidy. However, I\u2019m going to guarantee you can keep your doctor.\u201d\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
