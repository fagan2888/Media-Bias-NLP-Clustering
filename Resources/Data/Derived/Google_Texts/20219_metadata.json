They warned that the group posed a dire threat to the United States.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ), who has long criticized Obama for not using force, said that the president\u2019s current strategy would be ineffective given the conditions in northern Iraq. There, tens of thousands of Christians are being targeted for execution by ISIS.\n\nRelated: Iraq, Middle East Paying for Obama\u2019s Miscalculation\n\n\u201cLaunching three strikes in an area around where a horrible humanitarian crisis is taking place \u2026 while ISIS continues to make gains everywhere, is very, very ineffective, to say the least,\u201d McCain said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a strategy, that\u2019s not a policy,\u201d McCain added, referring to the president\u2019s goal of simply stopping the humanitarian crisis as opposed to taking out ISIS. \u201cThat is simply a very narrow and focused approach to a problem that is metastasizing as we speak.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) echoed McCain\u2019s comments. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Graham called on Obama to widen the airstrikes to Syria, where ISIS was born. \u201cIf we don\u2019t hit \u2018em in Syria, you\u2019ll never solve the problem in Iraq,\u201d Graham said.\n\nRelated: With Iraq in Ruins, ISIS Turns to Genocide\n\nGraham added that if Obama doesn\u2019t expand operations, ISIS would target the American homeland.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. President, you have never once spoken directly to the American people about the threat we face from being attacked from Syria, now Iraq. What is your strategy to stop these people from attacking the homeland? They have expressed a desire to do so,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a replacement for a strategy to deal with an existential threat to the homeland,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cTo every member of Congress, we've been told by every major intelligence leader in our nation that we're threatened. The homeland is threatened by the presence of ISIL in Iraq and Syria. To change that threat, we have to have a sustained air campaign in Syria and Iraq. We need to go on offense.\"\n\nWithout this, Graham argued, it was inevitable ISIS would target the west.\n\nRelated: How the U.S. Allowed ISIS to Form a Terrorist Army\n\n\u201cIf he does not go on the offensive against ISIS, ISIL - whatever you want to call these guys - they are coming here,\" Graham said. \"This is just not about Baghdad, this is just not about Syria, this is about our homeland. And if we get attacked because he has no strategy to protect us, then he will have committed a blunder for the ages.\u201d\n\nPartisan Politics\n\nNot surprisingly, Democrats viewed the president\u2019s strategy differently. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MI), appearing on Fox News Sunday, said that the United States did not have the ability to defeat ISIS with air firepower. He said that the solution to stop the group was political.\n\n\u201cI don't think we can take out ISIS from a military point of view from the use of our airstrikes. That's not going to solve the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental problem is whether the Iraqis believe they have a representative government so that Sunnis feel comfortable with the government in Baghdad. I think that's going to be the key to cutting off the type of permanent support that ISIS could otherwise have.\"\n\nCardin\u2019s comments did little to deter Republicans, who continued their attacks on the president on Meet the Press.\n\n\"They are more powerful now than al Qaeda was on 9/11,\" Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said. \"I lost hundreds of constituents on 9/11. I never want to do that again.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republicans blasted President Obama\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes against the Intern", "title": "Republicans: ISIS\u2019s Next Target Is America", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/10/Republicans-ISIS-Next-Target-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/10/Republicans-ISIS-Next-Target-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Republicans blasted President Obama\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes against the Intern", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1593\"", "article_summary": "Republicans blasted President Obama\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes against the International State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) Sunday, calling them too soft.\nRelated: With Iraq in Ruins, ISIS Turns to GenocideGraham added that if Obama doesn\u2019t expand operations, ISIS would target the American homeland.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t hit \u2018em in Syria, you\u2019ll never solve the problem in Iraq,\u201d Graham said.\n\u201cThis is not a replacement for a strategy to deal with an existential threat to the homeland,\u201d Graham continued.\nAnd if we get attacked because he has no strategy to protect us, then he will have committed a blunder for the ages.\u201dPartisan PoliticsNot surprisingly, Democrats viewed the president\u2019s strategy differently."}
