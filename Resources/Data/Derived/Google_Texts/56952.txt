NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Increased tax deductions for long-term care insurance policies were approved by the IRS for coverage purchased in 2015.



“The increase amounts to about 2%compared to the prior year,” said Jesse Slome, executive director with the American Association for Long Term Care Insurance.

The small increase in tax deductibility is significant, because it helps to awaken the public to the importance of planning for long-term care risk and cost.



“Most consumers ignore this insurance until they’re stricken by a chronic illness or frailty which require expensive extended care,” said Stephen A. Moses, president with the Center for Long-Term Care Reform, a private institute dedicated to ensuring quality long-term care for all Americans.

However, few long term care insurance policy holders qualify for the deduction, because tax payers can only deduct amounts in excess of a percentage of their adjusted gross income (AGI).



“AGI was recently increased to 10% from 7.5% although people over 65 are exempted from this increase until end of the year 2016,” Moses told MainStreet. “Few seniors qualify for the deduction so its impact on tax preparation is relatively small.”

According to the IRS, deductible limits in 2015 for policy holders older than 40 years old but not more than 50 years old will be $710 compared to $700 in 2014, $380 for those less than 40 years compared to $370 in 2014 and $1,430 for those 50 years old but not more than 60 years old compared to $1,400 in 2014.“Genuine above-the-line tax deductibility or tax credits would have a greater impact on consumer demand for long-term care insurance than the current, very limited deductibility, but the product’s market penetration will not take off until consumers can no longer ignore the risk, avoid the premiums and qualify easily for public funding for most of the costs,” said Moses.
