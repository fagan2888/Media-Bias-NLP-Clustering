Stephen King has unloaded on the Republican presidential field on Twitter — the horror master’s latest dive into savvy GOP bashing.

This tweet takes on the nightmare that is the current field of right-wing senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

Cruz, Paul and Rubio, all running for President. Hey, I thought I was supposed to write the horror stories. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 16, 2015

In recent weeks, King has jumped into the debate over Indiana’s religious freedom bill:

Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration act is gay discrimination, pure and simple. You can frost a dog turd, but it's still a dog turd. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 31, 2015
