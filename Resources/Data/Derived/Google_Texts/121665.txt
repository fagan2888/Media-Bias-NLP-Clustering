A Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ate who sup­ports the cur­rent fed­er­al back­ground checks for guns and doesn’t want the gov­ern­ment to pre­vent wo­men from get­ting abor­tions is poised to turn Col­or­ado’s Re­pub­lic­an Sen­ate primary in­to an ideo­lo­gic­al battle­ground next year.

Former Au­rora City Coun­cil­man Ry­an Fra­zi­er, who stepped down from his role as a polit­ic­al com­ment­at­or for a loc­al news chan­nel last week to take “a close and ser­i­ous look at the race” for Sen­ate, would line up on the left-hand side of a GOP primary to take on Demo­crat­ic Sen. Mi­chael Ben­net. But the 38-year-old Afric­an-Amer­ic­an former Navy in­tel­li­gence of­ficer says he has the “unique pro­file” to beat the in­cum­bent in a gen­er­al elec­tion.

“As a fath­er, a Navy vet­er­an, a small busi­ness own­er, a cofounder of a charter school in Col­or­ado … I think I have a very unique pro­file,” Fra­zi­er said in an in­ter­view Wed­nes­day. “I be­lieve there’s some core is­sues that I really care about that have tre­mend­ous cros­sov­er ap­peal … I think I can ap­peal both to our Re­pub­lic­an base, but also to in­de­pend­ent and wo­men voters who are ul­ti­mately go­ing to de­cide the elec­tion.”

Fra­zi­er plans to de­cide wheth­er or not to run for Sen­ate in the com­ing days. If he does, he’ll join a field of Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates already stak­ing out con­ser­vat­ive ground for the primary. Since na­tion­al Re­pub­lic­ans’ top choices to take on Ben­net—Rep. Mike Coff­man and Dis­trict At­tor­ney George Brauchler—turned them down, the con­test has largely been a race to the right.

State Sen. Tim Neville, the latest to join the race, is con­sidered one of the most con­ser­vat­ive mem­bers of the state le­gis­lature for his views on guns and abor­tion. Neville will face com­pet­i­tion for con­ser­vat­ive voters from a wealthy Col­or­ado Springs busi­ness­man, Robert Blaha, who is already lin­ing up cam­paign staff for a run. Already in the race: El Paso County Com­mis­sion­er Darryl Glenn, whose web­site calls him a “con­sti­tu­tion­al con­ser­vat­ive,” and former Col­or­ado Small Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion Dir­ect­or Greg Lopez.

Fra­zi­er’s so­cially mod­er­ate, fisc­ally con­ser­vat­ive pro­file—to the left of Re­pub­lic­an Sen. Cory Gard­ner on some is­sues—could de­fuse some of Demo­crats’ fa­vor­ite at­tacks in Col­or­ado. In par­tic­u­lar, Demo­crats re­lent­lessly at­tacked Gard­ner over his views on abor­tion is­sues in 2014, in­clud­ing con­tro­ver­sial “per­son­hood” le­gis­la­tion and bal­lot meas­ures. But to get to a race against Ben­net, Fra­zi­er would first have to sur­vive a com­pet­it­ive primary, something Gard­ner didn’t have to do.

Fra­zi­er said he is pro-Second Amend­ment rights but be­lieves in the cur­rent sys­tem of fed­er­al back­ground checks for gun own­ers. He’s per­son­ally against abor­tion—but doesn’t be­lieve it’s the gov­ern­ment’s place to get in­volved in wo­men’s health de­cisions.

“As a pro-life in­di­vidu­al, we need more of the type of people in the Sen­ate who real­ize that this is not something the gov­ern­ment can or should try to fix,” said Fra­zi­er. “This is something that we need to have a con­ver­sa­tion about just as in­di­vidu­als in a so­ci­ety, about al­tern­at­ives to abor­tion, so that wo­men when mak­ing that choice know what op­tions they have.”

On im­mig­ra­tion re­form, he said he wants to fo­cus first on bor­der se­cur­ity, then a path­way to leg­al work status, and even­tu­ally cit­izen­ship for cur­rently un­doc­u­mented im­mig­rants.

“What mo­tiv­ates me to run are the eco­nom­ic, na­tion­al se­cur­ity, fisc­al is­sues fa­cing our coun­try that we need to deal with,” said Fra­zi­er. “I’m not run­ning for the Sen­ate to try to tackle a lot of the so­cial is­sues.”

Fra­zi­er also lis­ted crim­in­al-justice re­form and the na­tion’s stu­dent-loan crisis—two is­sues tra­di­tion­ally cham­pioned by Demo­crats, though sev­er­al GOP pres­id­en­tial can­did­ates have also dis­cussed them at length—as top pri­or­it­ies that he be­lieved would ap­peal to voter in both parties.

Fra­zi­er, who chal­lenged Demo­crat­ic Rep. Ed Per­lmut­ter in 2010, said he has met with the Na­tion­al Re­pub­lic­an Sen­at­ori­al Com­mit­tee to dis­cuss the race and spoken with some of Col­or­ado’s mem­bers of Con­gress, in­clud­ing Gard­ner. Fra­zi­er briefly launched a cam­paign against Ben­net in 2009, but he ended it to pur­sue the House seat in­stead. Fra­zi­er said he was first ap­proached about this race more than a year ago, but only began to give it ser­i­ous con­sid­er­a­tion in the past two months, as some po­ten­tial Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates dropped out.

His as­sess­ment of the con­test reads like it came right out of the NR­SC’s play­book.

“A great ma­jor­ity of the people in Col­or­ado are not pleased with the dir­ec­tion of our coun­try, and Sen. Mi­chael Ben­net has had a lot to do with that,” said Fra­zi­er. “He voted for Obama­care, which we now learned thou­sands of Col­or­adoans are go­ing to be without in­sur­ance with the clos­ing of the co-ops; he voted for the Ir­an deal, which I be­lieve is a bad deal for Amer­ica, a deal that was brokered with the biggest state spon­sor of ter­ror­ism; and he’s stood on the side­lines as our eco­nomy has limped along with lackluster job growth.”

Col­or­ado is one of Sen­ate Re­pub­lic­ans’ few pickup op­por­tun­it­ies in 2016, as they already con­trol most of the Sen­ate seats up in the next elec­tion. Giv­en Gard­ner’s suc­cess in 2014, the GOP im­me­di­ately looked at Ben­net as a po­ten­tially vul­ner­able in­cum­bent in the next elec­tion. But while the party has been look­ing for can­did­ates, Ben­net has already amassed an in­tim­id­at­ing $5.4 mil­lion in cam­paign funds.

Still, Fra­zi­er points to his ex­per­i­ence on the Au­rora City Coun­cil as proof he can break through where oth­er Re­pub­lic­ans may not. “I rep­res­en­ted the third largest city in the state for eight years, the most di­verse city in the state, a city that is urb­an and sub­urb­an and leans Demo­crat­ic,” said Fra­zi­er.

CLA­RI­FIC­A­TION: The latest ver­sion of this art­icle makes clear that while Fra­zi­er sup­ports back­ground checks for gun pur­chases, he does not want to ex­pand them past what’s already writ­ten in fed­er­al law.
