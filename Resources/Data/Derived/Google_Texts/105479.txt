The economy is picking up but money is still a big source of stress in the lives of most Americans, according to a new survey.

The American Psychological Association (APA) had Harris Poll question more than 3,000 Americans in August 2014 and found 72% said they felt stress over money at least some of the time during the previous month.

Thirty-one percent of respondents admitted that money-related stress was a significant source of conflict in their relationship, according to Stress in America: Paying with Our Health (pdf).

Despite gains made in health coverage since passage of the Affordable Care Act, healthcare costs continue to be a stressor. Among lower-income Americans, 44% say paying for out-of-pocket health care costs is a very or somewhat significant source of stress, compared with 34% of those with higher incomes, according to the report.

“Regardless of the economic climate, money and finances have remained the top stressor since our survey began in 2007. Furthermore, this year’s survey shows that stress related to financial issues could have a significant impact on Americans’ health and well-being,” Norman B. Anderson, the APA’s CEO and executive vice president, said in a press release.

The survey also discovered that more than one in five Americans reported experiencing extreme stress about money. For 64% of people, money was either a somewhat or very significant source of stress.

Other sources of stress reported were work (60%), the economy (49%), family responsibilities (47%) and personal health concerns (46%).
