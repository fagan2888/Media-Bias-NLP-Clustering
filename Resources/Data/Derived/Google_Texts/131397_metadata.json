The hourly rates were first reported this week by The Associated Press.\n\nTheir firm, Compass Public Affairs, could take assignments directly from Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn\u2019s administration under a special provision of its subcontract. Compass was part of a team assembled by the main contractor, the Chicago office of public relations agency FleishmanHillard.\n\nBranded \u201cGet Covered Illinois,\u201d the campaign surpassed a federal enrollment target, signing up more than 217,000 people. But the hourly billing rates exceeded similar contracts in other states, and the enrollment number fell short of an internal goal.\n\nIllinois officials viewed the campaign as similar to a get-out-the-vote drive, according to AP interviews with more than a dozen people directly involved. The hiring of Compass, whose owners are among the best-known Democratic political strategists in Illinois, fit with that viewpoint.\n\nNoonan is a former staffer for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and a former campaign manager for Attorney General Lisa Madigan. Reyes is an ex-aide to former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and founded the powerful Hispanic Democratic Organization. Jackson is a former statewide field director for Quinn.\n\nIn particular, Noonan played a crucial leadership role in the campaign, according to documents reviewed by the AP.\n\nIn mid-October, as the broken federal HealthCare.gov website drew relentless news media attention, Noonan called for daily meetings of high-ranking executives from FleishmanHillard and other subcontractors. The daily meetings continued through mid-December.\n\n\u201cWe needed to touch base every day to talk about the reality on the ground, what we were hearing from our navigators, whether HealthCare.gov was or wasn\u2019t working, what problems we were encountering,\u201d said Jennifer Koehler, the state\u2019s top official involved with the campaign.\n\nWhen asked whether political favoritism played any part in awarding the contract, Quinn administration spokesman Mike Claffey said FleishmanHillard won the bid \u201cpurely on the merits\u201d and because it offered the best overall price.\n\nCompass was recruited to the team before FleishmanHillard won the bid, said Jack Modzelewski, a senior partner of FleishmanHillard. He said Compass had been recommended by a trusted acquaintance, Gene Reineke, whose company, Hawthorne Strategy Group, also became a subcontractor.\n\n\u201cWe really needed some deep experience in reaching specific communities around the state,\u201d Modzelewski said. Compass knew how to influence black and Hispanic communities, seen as fundamental to the campaign\u2019s success, Modzelewski said. And Compass could reach the mayors, congressmen and state lawmakers, who would be asked to motivate their constituencies.\n\nCompass helped develop the campaign\u2019s grassroots strategy and supervised outreach to church leaders, black business leaders and ethnic media.\n\nNoonan declined to comment directly, saying in an email that Modzelewski was \u201cspeaking for the entire team.\u201d\n\nThe other subcontractors working with FleishmanHillard had various degrees of political experience:\n\nHawthorne Strategy Group: The Chicago consulting firm worked on small business outreach. Hawthorne was founded by Republican-turned-independent Reineke, who was chief of staff to former Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, and led President George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1992 campaign in Illinois. In 2012, a few months before starting Hawthorne, Reineke told Crain\u2019s Chicago Business that he considered himself an independent, voted for Barack Obama in 2008, contributed to his campaign and planned to vote for him again that year.\n\nDowntown Partners: The Chicago midsize advertising agency developed TV and digital ads for the campaign. The company also has produced ads for the Illinois Lottery, the Chicago Cubs, Chicago\u2019s bid for the 2016 Olympics and Attorney General Lisa Madigan\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cIllinois state politics are interesting to say the least,\u201d says Downtown Partners\u2019 website. \u201cBut we do have an Attorney General always looking out for those in need. We helped keep her in office.\u201d\n\nElemento L2: The Chicago marketing agency specializes in multicultural outreach. It developed a process for translating Get Covered Illinois materials into Spanish, helped engage Spanish language media and planned Hispanic community events including a traditional Mexican Day of the Dead festival.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
