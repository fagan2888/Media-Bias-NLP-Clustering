But with the SNP pledging to improve soldiers\u2019 terms and conditions, experts said the enticements might amount to \u2018bribes for troops\u2019. Professor Malcolm Chambers said: \u2018You could get issues of competition between the Scottish and British forces.\u2019\n\nSpecial Forces and explosives and ordnance personnel would be handed over too.\n\nThe SNP says that to recruit the 3,500 regular troops and 1,200 reservists it requires, it will negotiate with the Ministry of Defence.\n\nBut Mr Salmond\u2019s plans came under attack last night from a former head of the Royal Navy, Lord West, who said: \u2018These reductions to the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the British Army would have a major impact on the UK\u2019s defensive capability. Our capability to defend the British Isles will be diminished and the Scots won\u2019t have the ability either. We\u2019ll all lose out. This is very damaging.\u2019\n\nHow Scotland will establish its defence forces by 2016 \u2013 when independence would be declared in the event of a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote \u2013 was questioned by Professor Malcolm Chambers of the Royal United Services Institute. He said last night: \u2018It is not realistic to manage all these capabilities by day one and how long it takes would rely on the level of UK support. While 9,000 troops sounds affordable it is not realistic to increase the numbers of personnel to 15,000 [the SNP\u2019s ten-year target] on the same \u00a32.5 billion annual budget.\u2019\n\nAn MoD spokesman said: \u2018Scotland is safer and better defended as part of the UK, protected by the full range of UK defence capabilities, and benefiting from the manpower, bases and military equipment that the Union provides.\u2019\n\nScots 'MI6 will get just 720 spies to fight terror\n\nBy ROBERT VERKAIK FOR THE MAIL ON SUNDAY\n\nAn independent Scotland will leave the rest of the UK exposed to acts of terrorism from groups such as Islamic State, security experts warned last night.\n\nThey say that on the day of independence Scotland will lose the services of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and the rest of the UK\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations.\n\nIts newly created Scottish security and intelligence agency is expected to be left with just 720 spies to defend the new state \u2013 and it will no longer be able to rely on the cooperation of the American agencies, who view Scotland with deep suspicion after the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.\n\nAn independent Scotland will leave the rest of the UK exposed to acts of terrorism from groups such as Islamic State, security experts warned\n\nAlex Carlile QC, the former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: \u2018There have been many terrorist issues which have been of shared interest to the police in Scotland, the UK and the various control authorities. It\u2019s hard to imagine Scotland would be anything like as secure if it obtained independence.\n\n'It would be very difficult for the new security agency because any serving security service personnel would be British and their contractual loyalties would be to the UK, not Scotland.\u2019\n\nRobin Simcox, an expert on the threat posed by Islamist extremists, said that there were \u2018real concerns\u2019 over how Scotland would be able to monitor returning jihadis. He said: \u2018They will lose a lot of capability and as result the rest of the UK would be more vulnerable.\u2019\n\nExpert analysis by the Royal United Services Institute, Britain\u2019s leading defence and security think-tank, concludes Scotland will be excluded from the \u2018five eyes\u2019 intelligence sharing programme of Britain, America, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.\n\nAnd former security minister Lord West warned that Britain and America could be forced to spy on Scotland, which will be considered an alien state. If Scotland doesn\u2019t have the resources or wherewithal to guard against Islamic extremists who have returned from Syria and Iraq then the UK will have no choice but to treat Scotland as hostile.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Salmond,demands,10bn,tartan,army,Ships,jets,helicopters,troops,SNP,s,sights,Scotland,votes,Yes", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2754901/Salmond-demands-10bn-tartan-army-Ships-jets-helicopters-troops-SNP-s-sights-Scotland-votes-Yes.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Alex Salmond wants aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops if Scotland votes for independence.", "title": "Alex Salmond wants \u00a310bn for his own Scottish army", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2754901/Salmond-demands-10bn-tartan-army-Ships-jets-helicopters-troops-SNP-s-sights-Scotland-votes-Yes.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/13/1410648545961_wps_33_Scotland_s_First_Minister.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2754901/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2754901/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2754901, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Salmond,demands,10bn,tartan,army,Ships,jets,helicopters,troops,SNP,s,sights,Scotland,votes,Yes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-09-13T21:00:15.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Mark+Nicol+for+The+Mail+on+Sunday", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T06:41:31.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Salmond demands 10bn tartan army Ships jets helicopters troops SNP s sights Scotland votes Yes"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Alex Salmond wants aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops if Scotland votes for independence.", "title": "Alex Salmond wants \u00a310bn for his own Scottish army", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2754901/Salmond-demands-10bn-tartan-army-Ships-jets-helicopters-troops-SNP-s-sights-Scotland-votes-Yes.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/13/1410648545961_wps_33_Scotland_s_First_Minister.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/09/1418450360_3776570457001_salmond.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Alex Salmond wants aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops if Scotland votes for independence."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f4f\"", "article_summary": "Alex Salmond is demanding a \u00a310 billion carve-up of Britain\u2019s Armed Forces \u2013 including aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops \u2013 if Scotland votes for independence.\nThe SNP also says it needs 2,000 regular sailors and 200 reservists and expects the Royal Navy to provide most of these personnel.\nPolicy documents reveal the full inventory of supersonic jets, fully armed warships and army battalions the Scottish nationalists expect to get their hands on if there\u2019s a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote this Thursday \u2013 with the Royal Navy facing the heaviest losses.\nBut last night, experts said his asset-stripping of Britain\u2019s Armed Forces would severely damage the UK\u2019s military capability.\nBut with the SNP pledging to improve soldiers\u2019 terms and conditions, experts said the enticements might amount to \u2018bribes for troops\u2019."}
