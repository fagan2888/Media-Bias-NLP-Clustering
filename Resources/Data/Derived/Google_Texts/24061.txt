The Florida Highway Patrol is calling its DUI Checkpoint in Panama City Beach Friday night a success.

More than 25 state troopers participated in the "Comprehensive Roadside Safety Checkpoint."

Officers set up several checkpoints on Back Beach Road between Natuilus Drive and Gulf Coast Drive.

Between 7:00 p.m. and midnight, cars were checked for impaired drivers with onsite sobriety tests.

The Florida Highway Patrol is hoping this will send a message during the holidays to stay safe and keep off the roads if you've been drinking.

"If you think about Christmas is one of the busiest holiday in the country. It's one of the times where families come together, not just from the state but from all over the world. We are going to protect our vistors as well as our residents," Lt. Rick Warden, Florida Highway Patrol.

During the operation, several cars were stopped to check for driver impairment.

Law enforcement also cited drivers for traffic violations.
