REUTERS/Gary Cameron (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH) - RTR4HB7Q\n\n4448036\n\nWe submit for your consideration a video of infamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber performing a rap song.\n\nGruber, who called the American people \u201cstupid\u201d when explaining why he had to deceive people about the bill he wrote with President Obama, makes a fool of himself in this video, which we will present as Gruber gets ready for a call-back from the Rep. Jason Chaffetz\u2019s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to get to the bottom of various Obamacare failures.\n\nWATCH (49:00)\n\n(courtesy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)\n\nGruber won the faculty talent contest.\n\nEver since the first video of Gruber talking about deceiving stupid Americans caught on, he\u2019s lost some top-level government advisory work, but kept his job at MIT.\n\nSome fellow Boston-area college teachers are trying to downplay the controversy, like Harvard professor Theda Skocpol, who appeared alongside Gruber on his last known panel before his video bombshells started coming out.\n\nIn an op-ed, Skocpol called Rich Weinstein, a concerned citizen who kicked off the new Internet subculture of clipping Gruber videos, \u201copposition research.\u201d (Really? Weinstein told me. Opposition to what?)\n\n\u201cI wrote an op-ed that said what I had to say,\u201d Skocpol told TheDC. \u201cThe only conversations I can recall are academics saying this is typical arrogance from an economist talking about things he doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nBut Gruber did have a key Oval Office role in writing Obamacare, and even mentored Obama on health care before the Illinois Democrat ran for president (boring him so much that Obama had to go out for a smoke break).\n\nSo what kind of stuff was this guy saying exactly?\n\nHERE\u2019S A 2009 QUOTE in which Gruber says that we just need to pass Obamacare and then fix it later. Sound familiar to something Nancy Pelosi said?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pass this bill now and then we can fix it later on\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Gruber to Physicians For A National Health Program, November 2009\n\nAnd here\u2019s Gruber on tape getting real about how Obamacare doesn\u2019t know how to control costs. So treatment would be denied.\n\n\u201cCost control is about taking stuff away.\u201d \u2013Jonathan Gruber At Harvard Law School, 2013 [h/t Rich Weinstein]\n\nHis old buddy Mitt Romney, gearing up for another presidential run, probably doesn\u2019t want to hear from Gruber. HERE\u2019S A VIDEO where Gruber admits that Romneycare didn\u2019t even manage to keep health costs lower than the national average.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the one where he blabbed about Romney\u2019s key role in getting the Bush administration to create what eventually turned into Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThird, we had a major source of financing in place, which we had formerly had a pretty powerful senator named Ted Kennedy who had been delivering about $400 million a year in slush funds to our safety-net hospitals that the Bush administration was threatening to take away. The Romney administration, to their credit, went to Washington and said, \u201cCan we keep this money if we use it to cover the uninsured?\u201d And the Bush administration, to their credit, said yes.\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Gruber, 2012\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s okay. He still makes enough money to finance his wife\u2019s bird habit. (\u201cShe became the crazy bird lady of Lexington \u2013 Jonathan Gruber\u201d).\n\nI bet The Washington Post is feeling kind of stupid now for running a pro-Obamacare \u201cexpert\u201d op-ed from Gruber back when he was writing Obamacare for the administration, without disclosing Gruber\u2019s consulting contract.\n\nBut it will all work out for the guy. After all, he counts as a \u201cReference\u201d the most powerful Obamacare official in the White House: senior domestic policy adviser Jeanne Lambrew. (PAGE 40 OF THIS).\n\nRemember Jeanne Lambrew? She was the one who asked IRS official Lois Lerner for confidential taxpayer information on conservatives. (Who Is Jeanne Lambrew?).\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Obamacare architect knows how to bust a rhyme", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "We submit for your consideration a video of infamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber performing a rap song.
