The pathways in the area, one of the most heavily mined pieces of land in the world, are well known to both sides; the explosions prompted the South to accuse the North of covertly planting new devices.\n\nRelated: North Korea Threatens Military Action If South Continues Loudspeaker Broadcasts\n\nIn response, Seoul switched on for the first time in years a series of massive speakers amassed along the border to blast propaganda messages into the Hermit Kingdom. The North responded with a cross-border speaker campaign of its own.\n\nOn Thursday, tensions flared again when North Korea fired four artillery shells into South Korea in apparent protest. Seoul responded in kind, blasting 29 rounds of its own over the DMZ. Then on Friday, state media reported Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader and the supreme commander of its military, ordered front-line units along the heavily fortified frontier to move to a \u201cquasi-state of war.\u201d\n\nHe ratcheted things up again when he issued an ultimatum that his country would take military action by 4am ET Saturday if the South doesn\u2019t turn off its speakers, something leaders in Seoul seem reluctant to do.\n\nRelated: Japan Says Has Strong Concerns Over North Korea's 'Provocative Acts'\n\nThe nuclear-armed North has a reputation for saber rattling, either to win concessions, like food or economic aid, from the international community or its patron state, China.\n\nConflict between the two states is nothing new. In 2010 the North shelled an island along a disputed maritime border, killing two South Korean service members, and the two militaries have exchanged machinegun fire on land and sea a few times since.\n\nBut the latest dust-up has observers worried because so much remains unknown about Kim Jong-un, who has given control of the country in 2011 by his father, Kim Jong-il. His rhetoric could be a bargaining tactic or he may indeed be ready to commit to military action in order to show strength.\n\nAround 28,500 U.S. troops are deployed on the Korean Peninsula to act as a deterrent to Pyongyang. Those soldiers are \u201cready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said Friday during an interview with CNN.\n\nWhether or not an off-ramp to the latest tensions can be found before Pyongyang\u2019s deadline remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cIn the past I\u2019ve said we\u2019re one dead fisherman away from something spiraling but In this particular case it would be really, really odd\u201d for the North to be \u201cespecially provocative\u201d since the U.S. and South Korea are in the midst of a military exercise, James Walsh, international security expert and a Research Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Security Studies Program, told CNN.\n\n\u201cWe essentially have a gun at their heads and for them to choose this moment to escalate would be strange,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula have leaders around the globe nervousl", "title": "The Situation on the Korean Peninsula Is Worse Than You Realized", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/21/Situation-Korean-Peninsula-Worse-You-Realized", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southkorea-northkorea-mines_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/21/Situation-Korean-Peninsula-Worse-You-Realized", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southkorea-northkorea-mines_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula have leaders around the globe nervousl", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3589\"", "article_summary": "It all began earlier this month when a pair of South Korean soldiers were maimed by land mines while on patrol in the DMZ.\nOn Thursday, tensions flared again when North Korea fired four artillery shells into South Korea in apparent protest.\nThe escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula have leaders around the globe nervously wondering what will happen before an early Saturday morning deadline.\nAround 28,500 U.S. troops are deployed on the Korean Peninsula to act as a deterrent to Pyongyang.\nIn 2010 the North shelled an island along a disputed maritime border, killing two South Korean service members, and the two militaries have exchanged machinegun fire on land and sea a few times since."}
