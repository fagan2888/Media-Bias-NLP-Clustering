CLEVELAND,Ohio-- What does it say about the Ohio Democratic Party bench of candidates and Ed FitzGerald, that a Fox News analyst may mount a primary challenge against him for Governor and actually outperform the party's endorsed candidate?

Wednesday, Henry Gomez, Chief political reporter for Northeast Ohio Media Group, reported that a telephone poll was in the works asking voters what they think of a Kucinich-Portune, Democratic Gubernatorial ticket.

In addition to maybe wanting to do something else besides being Fox News' token liberal, fielding questions from Hannity and friends, Henry Gomez speculates Dennis may be motivated to run after getting snubbed by FitzGerald in favor of Marcy Kaptur.

Kucinich already has FitzGerald beat on the statewide name-recognition front. Kasich's lowest approval ratings came during the failed SB5 vote. Kucinich has more union street cred built up over his decades-long political career than FitzGerald. That and his anti-NAFTA, anti-war, anti-Goliath anything, mantra might be appealing for southern Ohio voters. Can't really imagine him doing any worse than FitzGerald at this point.

Sherrod Brown probably would have mounted the best and strongest challenge against Kasich. But after him, who do the Dems have? Their political bench looks not much better than the one assembled by the Browns front office.

Considering the way the Browns' coaching search has been going, it really wouldn't be a stretch to wake up and read that league sources have confirmed that the Browns wanted to interview Dennis, but he declined, saying engaging in conversation with Sean Hannity and Gretchen Carlson is less of a mind-numbing, losing proposition.
