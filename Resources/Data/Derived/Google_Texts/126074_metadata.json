To the uninitiated scanning by 95.3 FM in and around Florence, they\u2019re in for a surprise.\n\nFormer lieutenant governor Ken Ard, whose name once punctuated sentences containing the words \u201cethics\u201d and \u201creform,\u201d now has a different kind of gig, dishing out politics at a machine-gun pace on \u201cGood Morning Pee Dee.\u201d\n\nThere is wonk, there is substance but most of all there are surprises to keep the FOX devotee shaking her head, chuckling and wanting more:\n\nOn Sarah Palin: \u201cShe\u2019s crazy as a bat. And she ain\u2019t as pretty as she used to be.\u201d\n\nOn Dick Cheney: \u201cSomebody lock Dick Cheney up and don\u2019t let him talk about a war.\u201d\n\nOn Hillary Clinton: \u201cHillary has a distinct political advantage.\u201d\n\nArd, who was forced to resign as lieutenant governor after a guilty plea to campaign finance charges in 2012, is a libertarian-leaning conservative with a mix of other strains of thought who\u2019s not afraid to say whatever comes to his mind. More often than not, it\u2019s a trifecta of informative, entertaining and funny. He prepares for the show by looking through the regular news suspects, but says his primary sources these days are CBS Sports and ESPN. Even when he was a politician, he said, he was never much into politics.\n\nWhatever the formula, it\u2019s a potent elixir. Now a little more than two years in, the show has grown from one to two hours, commercial breaks are getting longer (too long, some think) and Ard hears about the show a lot more around town. The Miller Communications program doesn\u2019t subscribe to rating services, but by every other measure, Ard\u2019s mix of Republican populism and cheeky banter has drawn a crowd.\n\nArd said he doesn\u2019t believe in talking about vindication. He owns up to what he did and paid his penance. He laughs off a question about whether this is part of a master plan for redemption in the public eye.\n\nBelieve him. Or not. He doesn\u2019t care what other people think.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take ourselves too serious,\u201d Ard said after a recent Friday show. \u201cWhat you hear is who I am, exactly who I am. I don\u2019t make any bones, I don\u2019t make any apologies. It\u2019s kind of the way I see the world.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a kind of success most would have expected after the events of March 2012. Ard, who had run for statewide office as a county councilman who outworked better-known candidates in the 2010 primary and election, stood before a judge, choked back tears and was sentenced for multiple campaign finance crimes. He had concocted a scheme to funnel his own money to friends and other \u201cdonors\u201d who then put Ard\u2019s own money back into his campaign.\n\nIt allowed him to appear as though he had a groundswell of support from a large donor base.\n\nPeople got suspicious when Ard started to spend his campaign money on personal stuff that didn\u2019t have much to do with being lieutenant governor: buying his family clothes, iPads, football tickets and billing his campaign during vacations. The (Columbia) Free Times unearthed it and the rest is history.\n\nArd said at the time he was simply trying to get some of his money back.\n\n\u201cThose mistakes are something I\u2019ll live with forever,\u201d he told the court, according to the Free Times. One woman, a prosecutor said, would meet others in a parking lot with a bag full of cash that totaled up to $20,000.\n\nA witness said it felt more like a drug transaction than campaigning.\n\nRadio slot\n\nAbout five months after pleading guilty, a friend came to the former lieutenant governor with an opportunity: an opening for a radio show host. Ard was more concerned with getting his business back on track. An entrepreneur, Ard has been involved with different ventures, most recently development.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t have much appetite for being back in what had been a harsh, unforgiving public glare.\n\nAs he put it, he\u2019d still go to church but he wanted to sit in the back row for awhile.\n\n\u201cThe big (issue) is your family,\u201d Ard said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through a political (expletive)-storm, your family doesn\u2019t understand it and they struggle with it and it hurts. It still hurts. Because you care about them. And you know you\u2019re responsible for it. My wife or (three) kids didn\u2019t ask for any of this. I did this and they\u2019ve had to deal with it and that\u2019s incredibly unfair to them. And if you\u2019re a man and worth anything, you take that responsibility seriously.\u201d\n\nAn unlikely candidate\n\nArd was 40 when he cast his first vote, for himself. The first time he saw a session of the South Carolina Senate was when he led it as lieutenant governor. His first time in a courtroom, he pleaded guilty to a crime.\n\nArd is the first to admit that his greatest strength as a candidate was his biggest weakness as an office-holder. Ard doesn\u2019t make notes or deliver speeches. Win or lose, he prizes authenticity and doesn\u2019t try to hide his roots or his thick Pamplico dialect. His campaign strategy is to back-slap, schmooze and outwork the other guy.\n\nArd, as they say, was a pure natural out on the hustings. He\u2019s also not afraid to say that he contradicts himself and doesn\u2019t stay consistent. The unabashed conservative is an equally unabashed Bruce Springsteen fan. Another thing you won\u2019t expect to hear on conservative talk radio: \u201cThe Springsteen side of me says we have a moral obligation to one another to make sure people are not hungry, homeless; to take care of the needy,\u201d Ard said.\n\nThe son of a self-made businessman from the no-stoplight town of Pamplico in Florence County, Ard figured if he could run a business, he could run a campaign. It was the same can-do attitude and story \u2014 the son of a man who had started a successful manufacturing business \u2014 that had vaulted him from virtual unknown to party leader. Key Republicans liked his no-frills style and pro-economic development message.\n\nAt points, Ard\u2019s campaign was as simple as the country boy running it.\n\n\u201cThe guys who should really be embarrassed are the guys that we beat,\u201d Ard says, laughing, reflecting on the early days of his campaign when he was a lesser-known in the Republican primary. \u201cEarly on, man, we were amateur hour at the opera. We were Keystone Cops. And it was me directing it.\u201d\n\nArd remembers being handed a list of names. Campaigns are expensive, he was told, so get started. Ard had run his campaign as someone who hoped to get government out of the way when it came to economic development, to let the free enterprise market flourish in South Carolina.\n\nHe didn\u2019t like asking for money. So Ard came up with a pick-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps, free-market solution to his fundraising problem. Funnel his own money to donors.\n\n\u201cIn my self-justifying way (I said) \u2026 \u2018That\u2019s my money; I can do with my money what I want to,\u2019 \u201d Ard said. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible, terrible way to think and that was wrong. Because you can\u2019t do that. But it was the only thing I knew to do. I didn\u2019t take it as seriously as I should have. And that\u2019s absolutely 100 percent my fault.\u201d\n\nHe said there is no part of him that believes in self-loathing. But he worried about his three children and wife. And he wondered whether anyone would return his calls on business deals. Could he make a living?\n\nPolitical future?\n\nHis supporters want him back in the political ring. Eddie Floyd, a physician and well-known Republican financier who was Ard\u2019s earliest big supporter, said he partly blames himself for what went wrong in 2012.\n\nHe had pushed Ard to run after the Republican showed ability on the Florence County Council.\n\n\u201cI should have insisted at that time he get somebody that would manage the campaign and keep all the finances straight,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he got in trouble. I am kicking myself a little bit. I gave him advice to get into the lieutenant governor\u2019s race but I didn\u2019t give him stronger advice and financial management.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Ard\u2019s radio show features a popular political roundtable held live in a booth at Victors Bistro in downtown Florence. The regular panelists are Gavin Jackson, a reporter at the Florence Morning News; Neal Thigpen, a right-leaning retired political science professor; and Rod Jernigan, a lawyer who plays the panel\u2019s liberal foil.\n\nThey say the segment is Ard at his best. \u201cHe was born for this sort of roundtable,\u201d Thigpen said.\n\nThe segment has a continual roar of laughter in between subjects that range from the inane to impressions of state politicians (Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster and Sen. John Courson have much-imitated dialects).\n\nArd\u2019s past is the spoken-of elephant. In one segment relating to campaign finance, Ard said: \u201cWho am I to talk about campaign finance?\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his political downfall, Ard said it might have bothered him more if politics were his end-all, be-all. He said lieutenant governor was what he did, not who he is.\n\nHis friends still continue to urge him to get involved. \u201cIt was stupid stuff,\u201d said Jernigan, a friend. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t criminal. It was stupid.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIf Mark Sanford can get elected to Congress?\u201d\n\nArd isn\u2019t interested in returning to politics at the moment. Maybe someday, he says. Besides, there are more important things, and that\u2019s not the sort of vindication he needs.\n\n\u201cEven in my darkest days, man, even when I knew that I\u2019ve done something I shouldn\u2019t have done and I had to be held responsible, I was always comfortable with who I was.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Three years after guilty plea, Ken Ard at ease as Pee Dee talk-show host, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nPeople, \r\nPeople, 95.3 FM ,Eddie Floyd,Gavin Jackson,Good Morning Pee Dee,Ken Ard,lieutenant governor,Neal Thigpen,Rob Jernigan", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "FLORENCE \u2014 FOX radio news blares the latest on Obamacare and terrorism, teases a local TV station and introduces the 7 a.m. spot\u2019s conservative host.
