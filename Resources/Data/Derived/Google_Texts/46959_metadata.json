Diamond Physicians in Dallas offers clients unlimited visits and 24/7 access to care for a fixed monthly membership fee. Everything is paid in cash, which saves the practice massive amounts of time and money.\n\nYou can listen to the podcast below or on the For the Record Soundcloud stream.\n\n\u201cCashcare: Exposing the Middleman\u201d airs Wednesday, March 4 at 8:00 p.m. ET on TheBlaze TV.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "This week, For the Record examines health care and health insurance and finds that they may not be as closely related as you've been led to believe.
