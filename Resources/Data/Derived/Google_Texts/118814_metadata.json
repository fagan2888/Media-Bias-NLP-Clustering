Those worried about the projections should take note of the latest developments in California. The L.A. Times reported\n\nDefying dire predictions about health insurance rate shock across the country, California\u2019s Obamacare exchange negotiated a 4% average rate increase for the second year in a row. The modest increase for 2016, announced Monday, may be welcome news for many of the 1.3 million Californians who buy individual policies through the state marketplace, known as Covered California. California\u2019s rates are a key barometer of how the Affordable Care Act is working nationwide, and the state\u2019s performance is sure to be hotly debated among supporters and foes of the healthcare law, including the current crop of presidential candidates.\n\nIn case it\u2019s not obvious, a 4% average rate increase is tiny, and a small fraction of recent reports pointing to skyrocketing premiums. It\u2019s also much smaller than the kind of rate hikes that were common before \u201cObamacare\u201d was signed into law.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Mother Jones\u2019 Kevin Drum reported , with subsidy values also climbing a bit, and the even-more-modest increases in silver plans through the ACA, a lot of consumers are about to see their premiums shrink, not grow. Mother Jones\u2019\n\n\u201cI have a feeling this number is not going to be widely reported on Fox News,\u201d Kevin added.\n\nThat\u2019s a good line, but let\u2019s not brush past the underlying point too quickly.\n\nCalifornia is, obviously, just one state, but it\u2019s easily the nation\u2019s largest. More to the point, it\u2019s also a Democrat state, which made a decision early on to embrace the Affordable Care Act, create a stable marketplace, and encourage competition for consumers\u2019 business.\n\nThe result is a well-run state system, operated by state officials who not only negotiated better rates for the public, but who also have no reason to sabotage \u201cObamacare\u201d out of partisan or ideological spite.\n\nIn the coming weeks, other states are going to have similar announcements about premiums, and some states are going to fare better than others. But the questions consumers, especially in red states, should ask themselves is simple: \u201cDid my state\u2019s officials do everything they could to implement the ACA effectively? Were it not for politics and ideology, would I be getting a better deal?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "\"Obamacare\" tends to work best in states where officials want it to succeed.
