Psychologists deeply invested in their discredited theory launched a crusade of retaliation against the people who proved them wrong.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a scientific misconduct case filed against us,\u201d Mary Koss, a professor of public health at the University of Arizona and a critic of the serial predator assumption, told Reason. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nLast year, a team of social scientists including Koss, Georgia State University\u2019s Kevin Swartout, and four other researchers made a startling discovery about the assumption that most campus rapists are serial perpetrators. The ubiquitous theory\u2014constantly cited by activists, policymakers, and even the Obama White House\u2014was false. New data just didn\u2019t support it.\n\n\u201cIf colleges and policymakers continue to focus on a serial rapist conceptualization, they are going to miss more than three-quarters of the rapes that happen on campus,\u201d Koss told Reason.\n\nKoss might have expected the originators of the serial predator theory\u2014Dr. David Lisak and his cohorts\u2014to accept the new research and adjust accordingly. After all, that\u2019s how scientific progress works. Old assumptions are constantly tested against new data, and abandoned when they prove faulty.\n\nBut it\u2019s not what happened.\n\nView this article.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "New research says most college rapists are not serial predators.", "title": "Adherents of Junk Campus Rape Science Are Retaliating Against Critics: New at Reason", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/09/junk-campus-rape-science-lisak-koss", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14550413846734.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14550413846734.jpg", "title": "Adherents of Junk Campus Rape Science Are Retaliating Against Critics: New at Reason", "description": "New research says most college rapists are not serial predators.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-09T19:59:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/reason-staff"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "What happened when new research undercut the prevailing justification for the public panic about serial rapists on college campuses?\nKoss might have expected the originators of the serial predator theory\u2014Dr.\n\u201cIf colleges and policymakers continue to focus on a serial rapist conceptualization, they are going to miss more than three-quarters of the rapes that happen on campus,\u201d Koss told Reason.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a scientific misconduct case filed against us,\u201d Mary Koss, a professor of public health at the University of Arizona and a critic of the serial predator assumption, told Reason.\nPsychologists deeply invested in their discredited theory launched a crusade of retaliation against the people who proved them wrong."}
