As it turns out, he argues, \u201cthe enemies of reform can\u2019t withstand sunlight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost nobody wants to be seen as a bought and paid-for servant of the financial industry,\u201d he writes, \u201cleast of all those who really are exactly that.\u201d\n\nLast year the vampires of finance bought themselves a Congress. I know it\u2019s not nice to call them that, but I have my reasons, which I\u2019ll explain in a bit. For now, however, let\u2019s just note that these days Wall Street, which used to split its support between the parties, overwhelmingly favors the G.O.P. And the Republicans who came to power this year are returning the favor by trying to kill Dodd-Frank, the financial reform enacted in 2010. And why must Dodd-Frank die? Because it\u2019s working. This statement may surprise progressives who believe that nothing significant has been done to rein in runaway bankers. And it\u2019s true both that reform fell well short of what we really should have done and that it hasn\u2019t yielded obvious, measurable triumphs like the gains in insurance thanks to Obamacare. But Wall Street hates reform for a reason, and a closer look shows why.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Nobody wants to be seen as a bought and paid-for servant of the financial industry,\" he writes. \"And yet...\"", "title": "Paul Krugman: The \u201cvampires of finance bought themselves a Congress\u201d and want to destroy America with it", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Nobody wants to be seen as a bought and paid-for servant of the financial industry,\" he writes. \"And yet...\"", "title": "Paul Krugman: The \u201cvampires of finance bought themselves a Congress\u201d and want to destroy America with it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/11/paul_krugman_the_vampires_of_finance_bought_themselves_a_congress_and_want_to_destroy_america_with_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/paul-krugman-flickr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Nobody wants to be seen as a bought and paid-for servant of the financial industry,\" he writes. \"And yet...\"", "title": "Paul Krugman: The \u201cvampires of finance bought themselves a Congress\u201d and want to destroy America with it", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/paul-krugman-flickr.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Economics, Paul Krugman, vampires of finance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9230\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Economics, Paul Krugman, vampires of finance, News, Politics NewsNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman is surprisingly sanguine about the current state of finance reform, claiming today that \u201cthe vampires of finance\u201d have been disappointed by the rate-of-return on their dollars recently.\nFor now, however, let\u2019s just note that these days Wall Street, which used to split its support between the parties, overwhelmingly favors the G.O.P.\nBut Wall Street hates reform for a reason, and a closer look shows why.\nAnd the Republicans who came to power this year are returning the favor by trying to kill Dodd-Frank, the financial reform enacted in 2010.\nI know it\u2019s not nice to call them that, but I have my reasons, which I\u2019ll explain in a bit."}
