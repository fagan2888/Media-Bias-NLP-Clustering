Martin O\u2019Malley said. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that this partner will have the website upgraded by the time the next open enrollment period begins in November.\u201d\n\nConnecticut\u2019s website was created with the help of private contractors, including Deloitte Consulting and KPMG. It is run by AccessHealthCT CEO Kevin Counihan, who once said his \u201cmission is to make history.\u201d\n\nCounihan met with Maryland exchange officials in Baltimore in February to discuss the possibility of Maryland's using the AccessHealthCT technology in a concept he calls \u201cexchange in a box.\u201d\n\nCounihan said the state must work quickly to rebuild its exchange website if it expects to be ready for the next enrollment period, which begins Nov. 15.\n\nThe current enrollment period ended Monday at midnight.\n\n\u201cWe learn from both success and failure,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cThe vendors we hired failed to build us the platform they promised. So now that the first open enrollment period has ended, we\u2019ve decided to upgrade our website.\u201d\n\nCounihan had experience developing a health care website. From 2006 to 2011, he was chief marketing officer for the Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, the portal that helped Bay State residents register for health care in a state plan that achieved near universal health coverage and became the model for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn a letter to the board of the Maryland exchange, called the Maryland Health Connection, O\u2019Malley said he had considered adopting the federal website, HealthCare.gov, which had its share of problems, and he also looked at Kentucky\u2019s exchange, which has run smoothly. Another option was to pour more resources into Maryland\u2019s exchange, but O\u2019Malley also rejected that idea.\n\n\u201cRemediating our system would take over 12 months and cost more than $66 million, and the resulting product would likely still not meet our needs or provide a stable, sustainable system,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Malley hired a private contractor, Optum/QSSI, to look into the problems of the Maryland exchange.\n\nOptum/QSSI reviewed exchange operations in Connecticut, Kentucky, Washington, New York, California and Nevada, the Maryland governor said.\n\nConnecticut won out because its exchange is \u201cproven in the marketplace,\u201d has reusable hardware and software and the potential for expansion, O\u2019Malley said.\n\nHe also said the price was the most reasonable. Deloitte gave O\u2019Malley an estimate of between $40 million and $50 million.\n\n\u201cDropping the failed Maryland Health Connection and moving to a platform that works is the right thing to do for the people of our state,\"said Rep. John Delaney, D-Md. \"It has been apparent for a very long time that the Maryland Health Connection was not fixable or patchable, and that the best option was to start over.\"\n\nCounihan said other states are interested in Connecticut\u2019s system, although he declined to identify which. Officials in Oregon, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Idaho and New Mexico have said they want to review the operations of their exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/01/maryland-scraps-obamacare-website-for-ctmodel/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, Washington, AccessHealth CT, Affordable Care Act, exchange, Kevin Counihan, Martin O'Malley, Maryland Health Connection, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/01/maryland-scraps-obamacare-website-for-ctmodel/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Maryland has decided to scrap its malfunctioning health care exchange for the technology Connecticut developed for its Obamacare website, AccessHealthCT, the state\u2019s governor said late Tuesday.", "title": "Maryland scraps Obamacare website for Connecticut model", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/01/maryland-scraps-obamacare-website-for-ctmodel/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/04/OMalley-Maryland-gov.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/01/maryland-scraps-obamacare-website-for-ctmodel/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcca1\"", "article_summary": "Governor's Executive OfficeWashington -- Maryland is scrapping its malfunctioning health care exchange for the technology Connecticut developed for its Obamacare website, AccessHealthCT, the state\u2019s governor said late Tuesday.\nSo now that the first open enrollment period has ended, we\u2019ve decided to upgrade our website.\u201dCounihan had experience developing a health care website.\n\"It has been apparent for a very long time that the Maryland Health Connection was not fixable or patchable, and that the best option was to start over.\"\nO\u2019Malley hired a private contractor, Optum/QSSI, to look into the problems of the Maryland exchange.\n\u201cDropping the failed Maryland Health Connection and moving to a platform that works is the right thing to do for the people of our state,\"said Rep.
