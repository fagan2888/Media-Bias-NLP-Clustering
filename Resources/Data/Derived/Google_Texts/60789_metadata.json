Here\u2019s what it looks like (the darker the red, the worse the conditions):\n\nCalifornia\u2019s currently in its dry season, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s to blame for the extremity of the drought, explains Climate Central. Instead, the dire conditions are the result of three years of abnormal dryness; officials are only now beginning to understand the extent of the problem:\n\nCalifornia has seen three consecutive winters, traditionally the rainy season, come up relatively dry. In particular, 2013 was the driest year on record in parts of the state, with some places running precipitation deficits of 30 to 40 inches. As of May 15 of this year, 100 percent of the state was in the highest three categories of drought. While the drought can\u2019t be directly linked to climate change, experts have said the unabated warming of the planet will influence the development of drought in places like California in the future. Water supplies in California\u2019s reservoirs, which are built to factor in drought years, were at fairly good levels going into last winter, but the heat of the subsequent dry season sent demand for water soaring and reservoir levels declined. Currently, reservoirs in the state are at anywhere from 14 to 67 percent of capacity, according to the most recent numbers from the California Department of Water Resources, which run through May 31. Precipitation amounts from July 1, 2013, to June 1, 2014, range from 35 percent of normal in Los Angeles to 53 percent in San Francisco and Sacramento.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A full third of the state is now experiencing \"exceptional drought\"", "title": "California\u2019s terrible drought just got even worse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A full third of the state is now experiencing \"exceptional drought\"", "title": "California\u2019s terrible drought just got even worse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/20/californias_terrible_drought_just_got_even_worse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/california-wildfire.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A full third of the state is now experiencing \"exceptional drought\"", "title": "California\u2019s terrible drought just got even worse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/california-wildfire.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Aquifers, California, California Drought, drought, Wildfires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce541\"", "article_summary": "That means a full 77 percent of the state is now experiencing extreme to exceptional drought, according to he U.S. Drought Monitor.\nHere\u2019s what it looks like (the darker the red, the worse the conditions):California\u2019s currently in its dry season, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s to blame for the extremity of the drought, explains Climate Central.\nWhile the drought can\u2019t be directly linked to climate change, experts have said the unabated warming of the planet will influence the development of drought in places like California in the future.\nAs of May 15 of this year, 100 percent of the state was in the highest three categories of drought.\nWater supplies in California\u2019s reservoirs, which are built to factor in drought years, were at fairly good levels going into last winter, but the heat of the subsequent dry season sent demand for water soaring and reservoir levels declined."}
