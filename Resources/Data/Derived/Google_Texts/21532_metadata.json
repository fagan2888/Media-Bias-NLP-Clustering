In 2012, only 39 percent of Hispanics in Texas eligible to vote cast a ballot in the presidential election. In that same election, 61 percent of eligible white Texans voted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMobilizing that voting bloc has become part of the Democrats\u2019 strategy to make gains in the state. And Republicans, both at the local and national levels, have started their own outreach efforts.\n\nMs. Van de Putte\u2019s supporters hope she can draw a clear contrast with Mr. Patrick, who has attracted headlines \u2014 and criticism \u2014 over some of his comments on illegal immigration.\n\nDuring his primary campaign, Mr. Patrick described the influx of undocumented immigrants to Texas as an \u201cillegal invasion.\u201d In his runoff victory speech last month, Mr. Patrick struck a more conciliatory tone, saying he would work to make inroads with the state\u2019s Hispanic community.\n\n\u201cBefore you can get someone\u2019s vote, you have to respect them enough to go talk with them and explain who you are,\u201d Mr. Patrick said in the speech.\n\nThe Patrick campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGuadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a political-science professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville, said voters identify with a candidate who speaks their language and understands their traditions. But she argued that Ms. Van de Putte\u2019s campaign against Mr. Patrick could be more successful among Hispanic voters if she \u201cenriched\u201d her campaign with specific policy proposals to help the Hispanic community.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a successful Hispanic woman, and that in itself means a lot,\u201d Dr. Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cBut you have to take advantage of that to do something more and utilize that image to do something for the Hispanic community.\u201d\n\nMs. Van de Putte has sought to differentiate herself from Mr. Patrick on crucial issues among Hispanics, including immigration and health care. Mr. Patrick opposes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and he is against allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates to attend public universities. Ms. Van de Putte has been a vocal supporter of in-state tuition and has talked about the need for immigration reform. Mr. Patrick staunchly opposes the Affordable Care Act; Ms. Van de Putte has endorsed it.\n\nLionel Sosa, a Republican media consultant who previously worked for George W. Bush, said that while Ms. Van de Putte\u2019s understanding and connection with Hispanic voters could be beneficial, her biggest challenge would be to raise enough money to spread her message.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAn intimate knowledge of the needs and concerns of the Latino is always the key to serving this important group, but I doubt that she\u2019s running as a \u2018Latina for Latinos,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sosa said. \u201cMy sense is that she\u2019s running as a leader for all Texans.\u201d\n\nMs. Van de Putte agreed and emphasized that she is running to create a better future for all Texans. But she added that her Hispanic heritage \u2014 like her career in health care and her role as a mother \u2014 play into who she is as a leader and the issues she is concerned about.\n\nWhile it may be odd for individuals outside South Texas to realize how much of her personality and daily life are a product of her bicultural upbringing, it all falls to the fact that voters in Texas are not accustomed to seeing Hispanic women run for high office.\n\n\u201cSome people say, \u2018She\u2019s playing it up,\u2019 but it\u2019s just my regular day. It\u2019s who I am,\u201d Ms. Van de Putte said. \u201cI\u2019m Leticia San Miguel \u2014 Van de Putte.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140607164712, "twitter": {"description": "With the chances of Texas Democrats winning a statewide office in November hinging on a higher turnout among Hispanics, the only Hispanic on their statewide ticket goes by the last name Van de Putte.", "title": "Unfamiliar Name Becomes Hurdle for Hispanic Candidate", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/us/unfamiliar-name-becomes-hurdle-for-hispanic-candidate.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002925649"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/07/us/TT07PUTTE/TT07PUTTE-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/us/unfamiliar-name-becomes-hurdle-for-hispanic-candidate.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002925649", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/us/unfamiliar-name-becomes-hurdle-for-hispanic-candidate.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Unfamiliar Name Becomes Hurdle for Hispanic Candidate", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 7, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-06-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Davis, Wendy", "published": "2014-06-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Texas,Van de Putte  Leticia,Hispanic-Americans,Elections  State Legislature,Voting and Voters,Democratic Party,Davis  Wendy", "description": "With the chances of Texas Democrats winning a statewide office in November hinging on a higher turnout among Hispanics, the only Hispanic on their statewide ticket goes by the last name Van de Putte.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Alexa Ura", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/07/us/TT07PUTTE/TT07PUTTE-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Davis, Wendy", "slug": "08ttputte", "byl": "By ALEXA URA", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "With the chances of Texas Democrats winning a statewide office in November hinging on a higher turnout among Hispanics, the only Hispanic on their statewide ticket goes by the last name Van de Putte.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/07/us/TT07PUTTE/TT07PUTTE-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Texas,Hispanic Americans", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Democratic Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140608032604, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/us/unfamiliar-name-becomes-hurdle-for-hispanic-candidate.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/07/us/TT07PUTTE/TT07PUTTE-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With the chances of Texas Democrats winning a statewide office in November hinging on a higher turnout among Hispanics, the only Hispanic on their statewide ticket goes by the last name Van de Putte.", "title": "Unfamiliar Name Becomes Hurdle for Hispanic Candidate"}, "pdate": 20140607, "des": "Voting and Voters", "articleid": 100000002925649, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Unfamiliar Name Becomes Hurdle for Hispanic Candidate", "col": "The Texas Tribune", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4973\"", "article_summary": "But she argued that Ms. Van de Putte\u2019s campaign against Mr. Patrick could be more successful among Hispanic voters if she \u201cenriched\u201d her campaign with specific policy proposals to help the Hispanic community.\nAlthough less than a third of eligible voters in Texas are Hispanic, the Hispanic population is expected to become a plurality by 2020 as the state\u2019s demographics continue to shift.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a conscious effort to emphasize or play up my heritage,\u201d Ms. Van de Putte said.\nMs. Van de Putte has been a vocal supporter of in-state tuition and has talked about the need for immigration reform.\nMs. Van de Putte\u2019s campaign has recently promoted a \u201cViva La Leti\u201d slogan, pushing it on social media and using it as a marquee for events."}
