That\u2019s excluding extraordinary revenue from special federal and state programs, which varies widely from year to year.\n\n\n\nIU Health\u2019s operating profits rose 6.2 percent in the first nine months of this year to $457.4 million.\n\n\n\nAdmissions to IU Health\u2019s hospitals has been flat, but the system has been able to earn more money because the expansion of the Healthy Indiana Plan to 337,000 Hoosiers has increased patient visits to physicians and for outpatient surgeries, while it decreased the amount of unpaid patient bills.\n\n\n\nAlso, IU Health\u2019s insurance arm has contributed significantly as well. Premiums from IU Health\u2019s insurance operations have risen by more than $119 million, or 66 percent.\n\n\n\nIndiana University Health Plans, the insurance subsidiary of IU Health, provides health benefits to IU Health\u2019s employees, to a growing number of employers and to individuals who buy IU Health policies on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\n\n\nKitchell said IU Health is receiving \"more than adequate\" premiums on the Obamacare exchange this year, prompting it to cut its average rates for next year by 16.5 percent.\n\nIU Health also provides population health services for the customers that buy an Obamacare policy from Indianapolis-based MDwise Marketplace. IU Health is a co-owner of MDwise, along with Indianapolis-based Eskenazi Health.\n\n\n\nIU Health also provides population health services to the patients that choose MDwise\u2019s Medicaid managed care plan and who then receive services at IU Health facilities.\n\n\n\nIn the future, IU Health hopes to reach its 1 million goal by expanding its population health services to other insurers\u2014such as Columbus-based SIHO Insurance, in which IU Health holds an ownership stake\u2014and via contracts with employers that act as health insurer for their own workers. That means that IU Health would not be the insurer to all of the 1 million people it hopes to serve.\n\n\n\nIf IU Health reached its goal of 1 million Hoosiers served, it would likely touch more Hoosiers than any other insurer except for Indianapolis-based Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which claims more than 2.3 million Hoosiers as health plan members.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo the extent that you can leverage those [population health] improvements across a larger populations, it could have a meaningful impact,\u201d said Jim Parker, president of IU Health Plans.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana University Health intends to grow its health insurance subsidiary aggressively over the next five to seven years to serve more than 1 million Hoosiers.
