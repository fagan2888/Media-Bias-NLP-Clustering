(Photo: Reuters / Lucas Jackson)\n\n\n\nAngered by videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discussed compensation for providing fetal tissue from abortions, Republicans in Congress are again demanding an end to government funding for the nearly 100-year-old provider of women\u2019s health services.\n\nAway from the headlines, however, the group is facing other major challenges, including one from a far different source: the Affordable Care Act, which it avidly supports.\n\nMany formerly uninsured women who once depended on Planned Parenthood for low-cost access to birth control, abortions and other reproductive healthcare have gotten coverage under President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law, making them less reliant on the organization\u2019s 700 clinics.\n\nIn many states, Planned Parenthood is losing clients as newly insured patients turn to medical providers included in their health plan\u2019s networks, according to data provided to Reuters and interviews with more than two dozen of its affiliates.\n\n\u201cSome people relied on us because they were uninsured prior to the Affordable Care Act. Now they can go anywhere for care, and some of them have been,\u201d said Lori Carpentier, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan, which expects to treat 58,000 patients in 2015, down about 15 percent from the 68,000 it treated in fiscal 2012, before major parts of the law went into effect.\n\nThe ACA has also brought some benefits to the organization, its leaders say. In interviews, affiliates all reported a significantly larger percentage of insured visitors among their remaining patients. Some locations \u2013 including Ohio, New York City, Chicago and the Northwest \u2013 are even adding clients as they expand services to better compete for women with medical coverage.\n\nStill, Planned Parenthood client numbers nationwide are on the decline. Part of the drop in patient numbers can be traced to decisions by legislatures in Republican-leaning states like Texas to cut funding to affiliates beginning in 2011.\n\nThe declines then accelerated after Obamacare took full effect in 2014, when Planned Parenthood served 2.68 million patients, down about six percent from 2.84 million a year earlier, according to numbers last updated in July.\n\nThe decline was apparent even in areas like upstate New York, New England and parts of the Midwest, which have not seen decreases in state funding.\n\nSome declines are considered positive. The U.S. abortion rate is down, for example, and Obamacare has increased contraceptive coverage, making it easier for women to afford long-lasting birth control methods such as IUDs, which require fewer office visits.\n\n\u201cData about health centers and patients will fluctuate,\u201d said Kim Custer, executive vice president of health care, Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cBut at the end of the day, Planned Parenthood has a unique relationship with our patients, some of whom would not be able to get healthcare anywhere else.\u201d\n\nThe National Right to Life Educational Trust Fund, an arm of one of the nation\u2019s biggest anti-abortion groups, said the numbers could suggest that women are acting on their beliefs once they have a choice of provider.\n\nInsurance coverage allows them to \u201cgo someplace where they can get a broader range of services and can avoid a place that also does abortions,\u201d said Randall K. O\u2019Bannon, director of education and research at the group.\n\nA DIFFERENT MODEL\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s latest public battle has come from the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, which began posting secretly recorded videos online in July. The center says the tapes show Planned Parenthood engaged in illegal sales of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood denies the charges, saying that a few affiliates donate tissue for research and are paid a small fee to cover costs.\n\nIn recent weeks, citing the videos as a reason, several Republican-leaning states including Louisiana and Alabama have moved to defund Planned Parenthood by ending agreements under the Medicaid program for the poor. Democrats are calling the controversy a \u201cWar on Women,\u201d saying it could delay final action on the federal spending bill.\n\nBut even before the most recent dispute, Planned Parenthood had begun reconsidering its model of serving primarily the poor. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to expand services, upgrade buildings and improve customer service, hoping to better compete for more affluent insured patients and tap a more stable source of revenue than public funding.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "A sign is pictured at the entrance to a Planned Parenthood building in New York August 31, 2015.
