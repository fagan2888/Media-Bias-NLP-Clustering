The laughter quickly turned to concern after Medforth began to feel sick, dizzy, and experience hallucinations. \"Everything I saw was green,\u201d he said \u201cAnd I had a massive erection that would not go away.\u201d\n\nMedsworth fessed up to his wife as soon as he got home, and she immediately sent him to the hospital. He told The Daily Beast that his wife was \u201ca little mad\u201d at him, which is most likely an understatement. Medsforth was admitted to the hospital for observation for a total of 36 hours.\n\n\u201cThe paramedics were very professional, but you could see they were trying not to laugh,\" Medsforth said. \"The doctors and nurses told me off.\"\n\nMedsforth's erection lasted for five whole days after being discharged; it wasn't painful, but \"it sprang to life\" everytime he brushed up against something \u2014 not exactly useful, he explained.\n\nMedsforth says his wife has since forgiven him, and that he realizes he was \u201cvery, very lucky.\u201d It\u2019s true, since Viagra overdoses can result in various negative symptoms, particularly symptoms associated with the cardiovascular system. Chest pain and low blood pressure are the most common, but fainting, irregular heartbeat, heart attack, and (in rare cases) even death can also occur, the Mayo Clinic reported.\n\nViagra\u2019s generic name is Sidenafil Citrate, and it works by relaxing the blood vessels. So it's no surprise that taking too much of it can lead to dangerously low blood pressure, especially if taken in combination with nitrates \u2014 medicine used to combat chest pains.\n\nMedforth\u2019s case was serious, but men in the past have suffered even worse consequences for overdosing on the drug. A 66-year-old man had to have his inflamed, fractured, gangrene-ridden penis amputated because doctors were worried the gangrene would spread to the rest of his body. And in 2008, a 28-year-old Russian man had a heart attack after taking an entire bottle of blue pills in order to win a bet. He won the bet, but he died after the heart attack.\n\nIt may seem funny in certain situations, but Viagra is a serious drug with serious consequences. An overdose of it can \u2014 and has \u2014 lead to irreversible consequences.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "viagra, psa, british, man, experiences, 5, day, erection, hallucinations, after, taking, too", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The 36-year-old has made a full recovery.", "title": "A British Man Took 35 Viagra Pills \u2014 Here's What Happened", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/viagra-psa-british-man-experiences-5-day-erection-hallucinations-after-taking-too-353356", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/viagra.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 36-year-old has made a full recovery.", "title": "A British Man Took 35 Viagra Pills \u2014 Here's What Happened", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/viagra-psa-british-man-experiences-5-day-erection-hallucinations-after-taking-too-353356", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/viagra.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/19/viagra.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-19T14:46:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-19T14:46:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The 36-year-old has made a full recovery."}, "article_summary": "It may seem funny in certain situations, but Viagra is a serious drug with serious consequences.\nA British man learned the hard way that Viagra is nothing to mess around with.\nAnd in 2008, a 28-year-old Russian man had a heart attack after taking an entire bottle of blue pills in order to win a bet.\nHe told The Daily Beast that his wife was \u201ca little mad\u201d at him, which is most likely an understatement.\nThe laughter quickly turned to concern after Medforth began to feel sick, dizzy, and experience hallucinations."}
