The government exempts large corporations, small businesses, and other religious ministries from what they are imposing on us\u2014we just want to keep serving the elderly poor as we have always done for 175 years. We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case, and pray for God's protection of our ministry.\"\n\nThe 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, CNN reported, earlier ruled that \"compelling the participation\" of religious non-profits to take part in the mandate process \"by threat of severe monetary penalty\" was a substantial burden on their exercise of religion, according to WND.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Becket Fund, which is representing the nuns, said the Little Sisters is facing millions in Internal Revenue Service fines because it cannot include contraceptives in their employee health plan.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has consolidated the cases involving the Houston Baptist and East Texas Baptist Universities, Priests for Life, South Nazarene University, Geneva College, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington and Zubik.\n\n\"The Becket Fund is grateful that the Supreme Court has decided to weigh in on this important case,\" said Mark Rienzi, Senior Counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \"The Little Sisters spend their lives taking care of the elderly poor\u2014that is work our government should applaud, not punish.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The US Supreme Court has agreed to review seven cases including that of the Catholic Little Sisters of the Poor about the accommodation mandate for contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Supreme Court to hear nuns' complaint on Obamacare contraceptive mandate", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/33752/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "description": "The US Supreme Court has agreed to review seven cases including that of the Catholic Little Sisters of the Poor about the accommodation mandate for contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Supreme Court to hear nuns' complaint on Obamacare contraceptive mandate"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,Obamacare,Little Sisters of the Poor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case, and pray for God's protection of our ministry.\"\n\"The Little Sisters spend their lives taking care of the elderly poor\u2014that is work our government should applaud, not punish.\"\n\"The Becket Fund is grateful that the Supreme Court has decided to weigh in on this important case,\" said Mark Rienzi, Senior Counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has consolidated the cases involving the Houston Baptist and East Texas Baptist Universities, Priests for Life, South Nazarene University, Geneva College, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington and Zubik.\n(Becket Fund for Religious Liberty)The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review seven cases including the one involving the nuns of the Catholic Little Sisters of the Poor about the accommodation mandate for contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare."}
