A few years into her medical program, she started researching productive ways she could add to her development as a physician and a professional.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take a year off in my M.D. (medical doctorate) program for a reality and perspective check,\u201d Thompson explained. \u201cA friend asked me if I ever thought about getting my MBA, so I started doing some research. I called the Smeal MBA (master of business administration) Program to get some more information, and it turned out that they were just beginning to put this program together.\u201d Thompson applied, interviewed and was accepted.\n\n\u201cWith the joint MD/MBA Program, we want to equip the next generation of physicians with the knowledge and confidence to respond to the rapid change in the industry.\u201d \u2014 Carrie Marcinkevage, managing director,\n\nPenn State Smeal MBA Program\n\nIn the MD/MBA Program, the first three years are spent at the Penn State College of Medicine completing the standard medical school curriculum. During the fourth year, students move to the Penn State Smeal MBA Program to participate in the standard first-year MBA curriculum. The fifth year consists of a mix of both business and medicine.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an increasing need in health care for medical professionals who possess a level of business competence and a deeper understanding of the business changes that affect health care delivery,\u201d said Carrie Marcinkevage, managing director of the Penn State Smeal MBA Program. \u201cWith the joint MD/MBA Program, we want to equip the next generation of physicians with the knowledge and confidence to respond to the rapid change in the industry.\u201d\n\nTerry Wolpaw, vice dean for educational affairs and professor of medicine at the Penn State College of Medicine, added, \u201cBeing a physician not only means understanding patients and their needs, it also means understanding the system and processes that turn plans for a patient\u2019s needs into reality. More and more physicians across the country are learning to appreciate how much a business education can add to their understanding of system-wide aspects of health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing a physician not only means understanding patients and their needs, it also means understanding the system and processes that turn plans for a patient\u2019s needs into reality.

Also, learning and thinking about leadership issues from a business perspective has provided me a completely different way of thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cLearning these skills at an early stage in my career will make me a more well-rounded physician.\u201d\n\nFor more information about admissions to the Penn State Smeal MBA Program and the College of Medicine, respectively, visit www.smeal.psu.edu/mba/admission and www.med.psu.edu/web/md/admissions.\n\nSmeal offers other joint MBA programs in addition to the partnership with the College of Medicine, including a four-year J.D.
