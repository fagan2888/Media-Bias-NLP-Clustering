Much of the popular discussion focuses on the implications of the newly-implemented and widely-anticipated employer mandate, which requires firms with 50 or more workers to provide health insurance for full-time employees (defined as workers with 30 or more hours per week). The employer mandate, unsurprisingly, creates strong incentives for companies to scale back employee hours (\u201c29 hour work weeks\u201d) and lay off workers or consolidate part-time jobs into full-time jobs in order to get under the 50 employee threshold.\n\nThere is comparatively less discussion of the incentives faced by workers. Although the Congressional Budget Office has provided estimates and discussion of the pertinent labor market effects, one issue that tends to get lost in all of this is how increasing a household\u2019s income creates certain \u201cnotches\u201d in a household\u2019s budget constraint. By \u201cnotches\u201d, economists mean very large changes in the subsidy (known as the \u201cPremium Tax Credit\u201d) received by a household for extremely small changes in income. These notches are well known in other transfer programs, particularly the \u201cMedicaid notch\u201d and the \u201cpublic housing notch\u201d. The ACA notch occurs in both states that expanded their Medicaid program, as well as those that didn\u2019t.\n\nTo illustrate the sheer magnitude of the ACA notch, it is helpful to examine ACA subsidies for different individuals. First, consider a person who is expensive to insure \u2013 a 64-year-old \u2013 in a locality that generally has high insurance premiums. A good example is Clay County, Georgia (where Georgia also didn\u2019t expand its Medicaid program). As the \u201cPlan Preview and Price Estimator\u201d from the federal government\u2019s exchange shows, the premium tax credit goes up dramatically for this individual at an income of $11,671 and falls dramatically at an income of $46,679.\n\nNow You See It, Now You Don\u2019t\n\nThe premium tax credit appears when income reaches 100% FPL\n\nThe premium tax credit disappears when income reaches 400% FPL\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Subsides \u2013 discounts off the premiums for health plans offered on the exchange (known as the premium tax credit or \u201cPTC\u201d) \u2013 are related to household income as well as cost factors (namely an individual\u2019s age and price of health plans in the local marketplace). Subsidies kick in at 100% of the Federal poverty line \u2013 or $11,671 for a one-person household \u2013 and turn off at 400% of the Federal poverty line \u2013 or $46,679. Thus, small changes in income lead can lead to very large changes in the subsidy.\n\nBefore discussing the labor market consequences, it is important to note that such ACA notches are more important for expensive-to-insure individuals and couples, and the size of the ACA notch also varies by location. The following table shows a high-cost individual (the 64-year-old) and a low-cost individual (a 30-year-old) in a high-cost location (Clay County, GA) and a lower-cost location (Andersen County, TN).\n\nSources: https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/39851/?state=GA and https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/37705/?state=TN (Accessed 6/11/2015).\n\nThere are several things to take away from this table. First, Georgia and Tennessee are among the 21 states that have not expanded their Medicaid program. The ACA only provides subsidies for individuals at or above 100% of the Federal poverty line; in states that expanded Medicaid, individuals below 138% of the Federal poverty line would qualify for Medicaid. Second, for the 64-year-old, the first ACA notch \u2013 in states without a Medicaid expansion \u2013 creates dramatic subsidies once income reaches 100% of the Federal poverty line, or $11,671. Earning the extra $1 after $11,670 raises the subsidy by $10,849 per year in Clay County, GA, but only $5,910 in Andersen County, TN. Both of these ACA notches \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t be present in the Medicaid expansion states \u2013 create strong incentives to increase work effort to reach this threshold. As can also be seen, the ACA notches are present but less dramatic for the younger person. Third, there are \u201cmini ACA notches\u201d as income exceeds certain multiples of the Federal poverty line. As the 64-year-old individual earns the extra $1 in Georgia that raises income from $15,521 to $15,522 (133% of the Federal poverty line), the subsidy falls by $157. Fourth, once income exceeds 400% of the Federal poverty line, the subsidy disappears entirely. For this individual, that entails a loss of subsidy of $6,621 from earning the extra $1 that takes income from $46,679 to $46,680. This notch is also present in Tennessee, but to a smaller extent. Finally, in all cases we can see the subsidy typically erodes quite smoothly as income goes up \u2013 this is known as a benefit reduction rate or tax rate. As income increases by $33,000 from $12,000 to $45,000, the PTC falls by $4,061, resulting in an average tax rate of 12.3% just from the ACA. For the younger individual, the subsidy erodes to $0 before income reaches 400% of the Federal poverty line in both Georgia and Tennessee.\n\nHow do things look for married couples? Much like single individuals, the subsidies kick in and turn off at multiples of the Federal poverty line. Although the unsubsidized cost of a health insurance plan for two 64-year-olds is twice that of one 64-year-old, the dollar amounts for the poverty thresholds are quite different. The dollar amounts go up less than proportionally with family size. As a consequence, the notches look quite different \u2013 and in some cases are jaw-dropping \u2013 for a married couple. Consider the two areas we just considered, and assume that two individuals of the same age are married to each other. The first column in the next table shows that the ACA notch when reaching 100% of the Federal poverty line (of $15,731) is an incredible $21,850! That is, earning the extra $1 that brings income from $15,730 to $15,731 leads to a dramatic increase in the premium tax credit. The magnitudes are clearly different, but present, for all family types illustrated. As family income goes from $15,731 to $62,919 (or 100% to 400% of the Federal poverty line), for all couples, the subsidy more-or-less is smoothly taxed away (and in, fact, the young couple in the inexpensive market loses its subsidy before 400% of the Federal poverty line). For the first couple, as income goes from $18,000 to $60,000, the PTC falls by $5,374, resulting in an average tax rate from the ACA alone of 12.8%. The notch for older couples is dramatic at 400% of the Federal poverty line; in Clay County, GA, earning the extra $1 that takes income from $62,919 to $62,920 results in a loss of subsidy of $16,152! The results in Tennessee are also large, but not nearly as large as Georgia. In Tennessee, the older couple only loses $6,275 for earning the extra $1. Younger couples don\u2019t completely escape this punitive tax. For younger couples, the ACA notch exists in Georgia, but the PTC is eroded completely in Tennessee before income reaches 400% of the Federal poverty line, so there is no ACA notch.\n\nSources: https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/39851/?state=GA and https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/37705/?state=TN (Accessed 6/11/2015).\n\nHow would such incentives affect the labor market? Abstracting away from other taxes and transfers, these notches create incentives in all cases to reach the earnings threshold of 100% of the Federal poverty line in order to qualify for subsidized health insurance. Moreover, there are very strong incentives to not exceed 400% of the Federal poverty line, especially because you must repay all of the premium tax credit. In states that did not expand Medicaid, the first effect \u2013 the incentive to raise earnings above 100% of the Federal poverty line \u2013 is present, but isn\u2019t in states that expanded Medicaid. In all 50 states and DC, the second ACA notch at 400% of the Federal poverty line will be present, to larger or smaller degrees depending on health premiums and age. The larger the ACA notch, the greater the incentive to constrain earnings under the second threshold.\n\nIt is also the case that this structure creates unusual marriage taxes and bonuses, an incentive that has been examined in the context of Medicaid expansions from an earlier era. To illustrate, imagine that two unmarried, 64-year-olds in Clay County, GA each had annual income of $10,500. The first table illustrates that neither would be eligible for the PTC. By marrying, household income is $21,000, resulting in a premium tax credit of $21,526. However, not all couples look so good. Consider these same two individuals, each earning $33,000. As single individuals, they each receive a premium tax credit of $8,094, or a cumulative amount of $16,188. By marrying, their credit would fall to $0, because household income would exceed the limit of 400% of the Federal poverty line. Evidence from the ACA mandate to cover young adults shows that marriage taxes and bonuses are an important factor.\n\nGraphical Summary\n\nCited Work:\n\nWall Street Journal, \u201cUnemployed by Obamacare,\u201d August 21, 2014, Accessed from: http://www.wsj.com/articles/unemployed-by-obamacare-1408664211\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \u201cThe Labor Market Effects of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d February 2014, Accessed from: http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-breako\u2026\n\nInternal Revenue Service, Publication 974: The Premium Tax Credit, March 2015, Accessed from: http://www.irs.gov/publications/p974/\n\nYelowitz, A., \u201cThe Medicaid Notch, Labor Supply and Welfare Participation: Evidence from Eligibility Expansions,\u201d The Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1995, 110(4): 909-939.\n\nYelowitz, A., \u201cPublic Housing and Labor Supply,\u201d Mimeo, University of Kentucky, November 2001.\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, \u201cStatus of State Action on the Medicaid Expansion Decision,\u201d Accessed from: http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expan\u2026\n\nYelowitz, A., \u201cWill Extending Medicaid to Two Parent Families Encourage Marriage?\u201d The Journal of Human Resources, Fall 1998, 33(4): 833-865.\n\nAbramowitz, J., \u201cSaying \u2018I Don\u2019t\u2019: The Effect of the Affordable Care Act Young Adult Provision on Marriage,\u201d Accessed from: https://appam.confex.com/appam/2014/webprogram/Paper10104.html", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is great interest in how the labor market will respond to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "There is great interest in how the labor market will respond to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).", "title": "The Economic Consequences of the ACA Notch", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/economic-consequences-aca-notch", "image": "http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/screen_shot_2015-06-16_at_10.22.29_am.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/economic-consequences-aca-notch", "title": "The Economic Consequences of the ACA Notch", "description": "There is great interest in how the labor market will respond to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/6/16", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-16T11:52:00-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/6/16", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac3f\"", "article_summary": "To illustrate the sheer magnitude of the ACA notch, it is helpful to examine ACA subsidies for different individuals.\nBefore discussing the labor market consequences, it is important to note that such ACA notches are more important for expensive-to-insure individuals and couples, and the size of the ACA notch also varies by location.\nThese notches are well known in other transfer programs, particularly the \u201cMedicaid notch\u201d and the \u201cpublic housing notch\u201d.\nFor younger couples, the ACA notch exists in Georgia, but the PTC is eroded completely in Tennessee before income reaches 400% of the Federal poverty line, so there is no ACA notch.\nThe larger the ACA notch, the greater the incentive to constrain earnings under the second threshold."}
