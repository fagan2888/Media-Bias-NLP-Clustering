The March of Dimes goal is 8.1 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s a predominant killer of babies,\u201d says Dr. Bill Sappenfield, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. In addition to being a leading factor in infant deaths, he says all these premature births put babies at much higher risk of disabilities and developmental delays later in life.\n\n\u201cThese babies who are born premature in some ways are born behind, and many of them stay behind, and it can really impact their whole life,\u201d says Sappenfield.\n\nThe report broke down and graded the premature birth rates in larger cities\u2014many of which did worse than the state average:\n\nCape Coral 11.5% F\n\nClearwater 8.9% B\n\nCoral Springs 10.7% D\n\nFort Lauderdale 11.6% F\n\nHialeah 8.2% B\n\nJacksonville 10.8% D\n\nMiami 11.3% D\n\nOrlando 10.0% C\n\nPembroke Pines 10.2% C\n\nSt. Petersburg 10.1% C\n\nTallahassee 11.2% D\n\nTampa 10.9% D\n\nSappenfield says that smoking and obesity make premature birth numbers worse than they need to be. Florida\u2019s high rate of women without insurance also means women who should be seeing doctors ahead of time are not getting the prenatal care they need.\n\nThe report found Florida had one of the country\u2019s largest racial disparities. Black women had nearly one-and-a-half times the premature birth rates of their white and Hispanic counterparts.\n\nThe March of Dimes also created a series of heat maps to highlight where premature birth rates were spiking across the state.
