The cost to attend Lake Havasu City's annual celebration of hot air balloons is going up.

The Today's News-Herald reports that admission for next month's Lake Havasu City Balloon Festival and Fair will be $15 per person, up by $5 from this year's.

Organizers say a hike in fees was inevitable but they believe it is still a good value.

It is the third increase in five years. However, children 14 and under can still enter for free.

The event first began five years ago and admission was only $5.

The festival raises money for local charities and netted $133,000 this year.

The Balloon Festival and Fair takes place at the Nautical Beachfront Resort from Jan. 15-17.
