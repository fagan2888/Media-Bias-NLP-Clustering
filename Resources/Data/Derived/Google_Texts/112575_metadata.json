The scenario assumes only a slight increase in enrollment, according to Braun.\n\nThe second model would involve adding upfront costs from modifying technology systems, such as making user interface improvements, but also reducing expenditures by 10 percent by the end of fiscal 2017 and an additional 5 percent by 2018.\n\nThe hope with that scenario, Braun said, is to \u201cget to a point at the end of two fiscal years where the exchange is operational as a stand-alone.\u201d\n\nUnder the third option, the exchange would lease some services to the federal government, such as operation of the reinsurance program and assessment or determination for Medicaid and Child Health Plan Plus eligibility, said Adele Work, chief information officer.\n\nThe exchange would remain responsible for the \u201cmajority of marketplace functions, including administration, in-person assistance and consumer outreach and education,\u201d Work said.\n\nFederal leasing would result in reductions in customer service center costs by 90 percent and about 50 percent in technology costs.\n\nBraun said moving forward requires \u201cmore work to even determine if it\u2019s a financially viable option or not.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states were able to set up their own exchanges to serve as marketplaces for insurance plans, use the federal exchange or partner with the federal exchange.\n\nKevin Patterson, Connect for Health Colorado\u2019s chief executive, said the transitional expenses for the federal leasing option have yet to be accounted for and the transition likely would not be implemented until the end of fiscal 2018.\n\n\u201cWe had a question to discuss today about options of financial stability and structure, so we want to reassure and make it known that we\u2019re making progress,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a decision. We\u2019re just beginning to look at the framework. I think we\u2019re at an informative point in this juncture for us to begin to frame the conversation.\u201d\n\nThe committee also said that introducing these scenarios is only in terms of a \u201cnumbers framework,\u201d and there are other policies that need to be considered before moving further.\n\nBraun said some of those next steps include introducing timing and a budgeting plan to present to the board at the next meeting.\n\n\u201cWe need to show we can manage our expenditures and operations on our own, which means starting now to get there by 2018.\u201d\n\nSome state legislators are concerned about the exchange\u2019s long-term stability as federal grant funding is set to expire, and enrollment numbers came up short last year from their projected plan which was adopted last June.\n\nThe exchange signed up about 1 53,000 people with commercial coverage during the most recent enrollment period. In June, when the exchange board approved a budget with a $13.3 million deficit and raised its fees, staff projected nearly 170,000 sign-ups.\n\nNatalie Munio: 303-954-1666, nmunio@denverpost.com or @nataliemunio", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Connect for Health Colorado considers whether to ask feds for help", "title": "Connect for Health Colorado considers whether to ask feds for help", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/22/connect-for-health-colorado-considers-whether-to-ask-feds-for-help/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160218__Colorado_Health_Exchangep1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160218__Colorado_Health_Exchangep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-22T16:56:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:29:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Connect for Health Colorado board members met Monday to consider whether the health insurance exchange will remain independent or shift some operations to its federal counterpart.\nBrian Braun, the Connect for Health chief financial officer, introduced three scenarios Monday to members of the board\u2019s finance and operations committee.\nOut of concern for the exchange\u2019s long-term stability, state legislators requested the committee develop alternatives to remaining a stand-alone operation.\nThe exchange would remain responsible for the \u201cmajority of marketplace functions, including administration, in-person assistance and consumer outreach and education,\u201d Work said.\nFederal leasing would result in reductions in customer service center costs by 90 percent and about 50 percent in technology costs."}
