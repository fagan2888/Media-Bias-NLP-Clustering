The results were messy, GAO\u2019s Seto Bagdoyan says in testimony prepared for a hearing Wednesday of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.\n\n\u201cThe federal marketplace approved coverage for 11 of our 12 fictitious applicants who initially applied online, or by telephone,\u201d Bagdoyan, who directs GAO\u2019s Forensic Audits and Investigative Service, said in testimony obtained by NBC News.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed White House 'Confident in Legal Basis' of Obamacare 0:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nThe GAO operatives made up 18 applications -\u2013 12 applied online or by telephone, and six started out looking for in-person help. All were completely false, with fake incomes and counterfeit documentation.\n\n\u201cThe federal Marketplace approved coverage for 11 of our 12 fictitious applicants who initially applied online, or by telephone.\"\n\nOnly one of the group of 12 was correctly told he or she could not apply. \u201cFor one application, the marketplace denied coverage because GAO\u2019s fictitious applicant did not provide a Social Security number as part of the test,\u201d Bagdoyan said.\n\nThe other 11 got through and received federal subsidies to help pay for their health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe total amount of these credits for the 11 approved applications is about $2,500 monthly or about $30,000 annually. We also obtained cost-sharing reduction subsidies, according to marketplace representatives, in at least nine of the 11 cases,\u201d Bagdoyan said.\n\nAfter encountering all sorts of trouble getting in-person help, six more fake applicants were turned away.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a trend with Obamacare information systems: under every rock, there is incompetence, waste and the potential for fraud,\u201d committee Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, told NBC News. \u201cLast month, we found that the administration was unable to verify income or eligibility for insurance subsidies. Now, we learn that in many cases, the exchange is unable to screen out fake identities or documents.\u201d\n\nPeople are sworn to tell the truth in their applications, on pain of perjury. The Internal Revenue Service has the power to claw back any subsidies that were improperly paid, by taking the money out of next year's tax refund, if there is one.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed White House 'Confident in Legal Basis' of Obamacare 0:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nA spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department said the process for verifying claims made in applications was still ongoing. \u201cAs the GAO notes in its interim report, the steps we take to ensure that individuals and families get the premium support and coverage they deserve, and that no one receives a benefit they shouldn't, are ongoing and have not concluded,\" spokesman Kevin Griffis said.\n\n\"While the marketplace has several layers of safeguards in place to verify consumer data, including requiring consumers to submit accurate information to qualify for health coverage, we are examining this report carefully and will work with GAO to identify additional strategies to strengthen our verification processes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a bad week for Obamacare. A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the federal premium subsidies are illegal, although a different appeals court said they were fine in a separate case.\n\nRepublicans say they\u2019d redouble efforts to get rid of the law, although many experts say they will be hard-pressed to do so this late in the process.\n\n\"Obamacare is a mess. Its broken structure invites waste, fraud, and abuse that will cost the American taxpayer millions in subsidies to individuals whose eligibility the administration won't bother to verify,\u201d Rep. Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the oversight subcommittee, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNo wonder hard-working Americans are fed up with a government that spends too much on broken programs that aren't doing the job they're intended to. We can and must do better.\"\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act aims to get more Americans covered by health insurance, and seeks to improve the quality of the insurance.\n\nTo help people pay for the insurance, the law, known widely as Obamacare, provides for federal subsidies for certain people who want to buy insurance providing modest coverage. The federal government foots the whole bill.\n\nNo one quite knows how much it will cost because it\u2019s not clear precisely how many people have applied and precisely how many would qualify for subsidies.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will have to shell out $36 billion for all coverage provisions for fiscal year 2014 and another $1.4 trillion for fiscal years 2015\u20132024.\n\nPeople get their premiums subsidized via tax credits toward their federal income taxes. \u201cThese advance premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions are not paid directly to enrolled consumers; instead, the federal government pays them to issuers on consumers\u2019 behalf,\u201d Bagdoyan said.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated to try to calculate someone\u2019s income, their tax liability and verify citizenship \u2013- illegal residents can\u2019t buy insurance on the exchanges. It\u2019s one of the reasons the federal exchange crashed when it rolled out in October, as did several state exchanges. It is working better now. But the GAO team found holes in the verification process.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace asked two of three applicants with inactive Social Security numbers to submit proof of citizenship, identity, and income, but it asked a third only for income information,\u201d Bagdoyan said.\n\n\"Our coverage remains in effect for all 11 approved applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor each of our six online applications that were among the total group of 12, we failed to clear an identity checking step,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, we subsequently were able to obtain coverage for all six of these applications begun online by completing them by phone.\u201d As of July 17, two of the fake applicants were told their citizenship had been verified.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the status of any post-approval communications, our coverage remains in effect for all 11 approved applications,\u201d he said.\n\nGAO said about inconsistencies had been identified in 3.5 million applications for health insurance through the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It finds 11 of 12 fake applications for health insurance are approved in secret test of government's verification process.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gao-sting-finds-it-easy-fake-it-get-obamacare-premiums-n162456", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_30/578656/140722-obamacare-1845_795cee27a6fad2545bce6266b6103f9e.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It finds 11 of 12 fake applications for health insurance are approved in secret test of government's verification process."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "It finds 11 of 12 fake applications for health insurance are approved in secret test of government's verification process.", "title": "GAO Sting Finds It Easy to Fake It, Get Obamacare Premiums - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_30/578656/140722-obamacare-1845_795cee27a6fad2545bce6266b6103f9e.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-22", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gao-sting-finds-it-easy-fake-it-get-obamacare-premiums-n162456", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Maggie-Fox/262695730411456"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health news,Investigations,Politics News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb22c\"", "article_summary": "GAO said about inconsistencies had been identified in 3.5 million applications for health insurance through the exchanges.\n\u201cThe federal Marketplace approved coverage for 11 of our 12 fictitious applicants who initially applied online, or by telephone.\"\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act aims to get more Americans covered by health insurance, and seeks to improve the quality of the insurance.\n\u201cLast month, we found that the administration was unable to verify income or eligibility for insurance subsidies.\nThe GAO launched the sting to check to see how well the Obamacare process checks for counterfeit applications."}
