The 66th Annual Winterhaven Festival of Lights is underway in midtown. Hundreds of people walked through the neighborhood despite the cold and wet weather.



"I could never do this. There's so many lights. They're incredible. I could never get this many lights up. I have a hard time decorating the tree. I can't imagine doing this," said Michael and Chris Massimi, visitors.



"I feel like if you live here you're spending hours and hours but you're dedicated to it because you know how it makes other people feel. It gives them

that Christmas feeling," said Anna Malkan, a visitor.



Exactly how much time goes into lighting up the whole neighborhood? Alex Parrs, a resident, said he started setting up lights on Thanksgiving Day.



"You repeat your theme so you don't have to do the whole thing every time. So there was quite a bit of work that was done in years previous, and then you

take another couple hundred hours to set it up basically," said Parrs.



After weeks of detangling and setting up with some help, his front yard is now covered in about 100,000 lights.



As for the electricity bill, Parra said it's not as much as you might think.



"For the whole season we might have an extra 100-200 bucks in electric," he said.



Parrs and other residents said the main reason for the festive displays is to give back to the community.



"It's really neat to have kids come by and you get to hear all the people say 'oh look at the lights' and we really like to put little details in that people

can find," Parrs said.



But this isn't the only way residents give back. Last year the Festival of Lights raised more than 18,000 and close to 43,000 pounds of food for the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona.



The Festival of Lights runs from December 12-26 from 6 to 10 pm.
