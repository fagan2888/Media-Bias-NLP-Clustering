She was also facing big waves that challenged her traditional navigation skills.\n\nOn the way to Bali, the crew stopped at Ashmore Reef, an uninhabited atoll in the Timor Sea.\n\nCrew member Kaniela Lyman-Mersereau said in a video that the reef was pristine and teeming with marine life, but also littered with marine debris.\n\n\u201cIt reminds us that we\u2019re not doing quite enough to malama honua (care for the earth) when we see stuff like this,\u201d Lyman-Mersereau said, holding some of the degraded debris in his fist.\n\nHokulea was welcome at Bali with an event at the island\u2019s Sanur Beach that featured traditional local dance and Hawaiian Hula. State Rep. Gene Ward was there to help welcome the canoe, and Hokulea captain Nainoa Thompson thanked the supporters in Hawaii who helped make the journey possible.\n\nThe crew is scheduled to stay in Bali for two weeks. They plan to visit the ancient temples, fishing villages and farms.\n\nThe next step of Hokulea\u2019s journey is to travel to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, according to the Polynesia Voyaging Society.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe Hokulea arrived in Bali Thursday after the latest leg of its around-the-world journey.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/2/traditional-polynesian-canoe-hokulea-lands-in-bali/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe Hokulea arrived in Bali Thursday after the latest leg of its around-the-world journey.", "title": "Traditional Polynesian canoe Hokulea lands in Bali"}, "twitter": {"description": "The traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe Hokulea arrived in Bali Thursday after the latest leg of its around-the-world journey.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Traditional Polynesian canoe Hokulea lands in Bali"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27ac\"", "article_summary": "HONOLULU (AP) - The traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe Hokulea arrived in Bali Thursday after the latest leg of its around-the-world journey.\nHokulea was welcome at Bali with an event at the island\u2019s Sanur Beach that featured traditional local dance and Hawaiian Hula.\nIshii said winds were extremely light and the boat had to stay on schedule for a welcome ceremony in Bali.\nBut several days later, Ishii said strong winds were propelling the Polynesian canoe along the Indian Ocean at 8 knots or 9.2 mph.\nState Rep.
