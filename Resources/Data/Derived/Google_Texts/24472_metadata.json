In fact, they risk repeating 2012 mistakes where Tea Party candidates proved too far right for voters, like in the cases of Indiana\u2019s Richard Murdouck and Todd Akin.\n\nIt\u2019s still early in the seven-way Republican primary for Georgia Senate \u2014 a field including Reps. Phil Gingrey, Jack Kingston and Paul Broun, as well as former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. The candidates have only held three of seven debates three months before the primary, but they have already taken controversial stands on positions ranging from defending child labor to impeaching the president.\n\nLegitimate rape \u201cpartially right\u201d: Gingrey, a self-described pro-life OB-GYN and former House Science committee member, defended Todd Akin\u2019s infamous comments on women\u2019s bodies shutting down pregnancy when there is a \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d Gingrey said Akin was \u201cpartially right wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nNo immigration reform, but yes to English as official language: Most of the field oppose immigration reform and the three House members running for the seat are on the record to deport undocumented youth. But in the last debate, Broun said, \u201cThe only new law I\u2019d like to see passed is one that makes English the official language of America.\u201d Handel is the exception, recently softening her position on reform and calling out fellow Republicans for their laser-like focus on the U.S.-Mexican border and ignoring other problems.\n\nImpeach Obama: At a debate, Broun, a birther, called for Obama\u2019s impeachment for so-called perjuring \u201chimself on multiple occasions\u201d (candidate Derrick Grayson agreed).\n\nMinority voter outreach: During the last presidential election, Gingrey denounced Democratic minority outreach efforts as \u201cworse than sad.\u201d His colleague Broun has described the Civil War as the \u201cWar of Yankee Aggression,\u201d and expressed surprise when airport security didn\u2019t profile a \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d man and him go \u201cright through\u201d security.\n\nMake low-income kids work for lunch: Jack Kingston suggested low-income students sweep cafeteria floors because there\u2019s \u201cno such thing as free lunch.\u201d Yet the congressman has expensed hundreds of thousands of dollars in free meals on the campaign trail and in taxpayer dollars.\n\nEvolution \u201clies straight from the pit of hell\u201d: Broun, who sits on the House Science committee, denies climate change and said that evolution, embryology, and the Big Bang theory are \u201call lies straight from the pit of hell.\u201d He\u2019s not the only creationist: Kingston once said, \u201cI believe I came from God, not from a monkey so the answer is no. I don\u2019t believe that a creature crawled out of the sea and became a human being one day.\u201d\n\nGun giveaways: In January, Broun raffled off an AR-15, the same gun model used to murder 26 children and adults in Newtown.\n\nObamacare helps people with \u201chang nails\u201d: According to Gingrey, the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act was \u201cone of the worst decisions in Supreme Court history.\u201d Gingrey dismissed the law\u2019s protection of pre-existing medical conditions as nothing more than protecting people with \u201chang nails and fever blisters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Georgia Senate race is proving how difficult it is for Republicans to ditch the party's extremist image.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Georgia Senate race is proving how difficult it is for Republicans to ditch the party's extremist image.", "title": "Child Labor, Impeachment, Legitimate Rape: Bizarre Positions In The Georgia Senate Race", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/02/25/3322251/georgia-senate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP495040003332.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Georgia Senate race is proving how difficult it is for Republicans to ditch the party's extremist image.", "creator": "@rebleber", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP495040003332-321x214.jpg", "title": "Child Labor, Impeachment, Legitimate Rape: Bizarre Positions In The Georgia Senate Race", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP495040003332.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP495040003332.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-25T10:32:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98b7\"", "article_summary": "Politics Child Labor, Impeachment, Legitimate Rape: Bizarre Positions In The Georgia Senate Race CREDIT: AP/Phil Sears The Georgia candidates at a January debate.\nThe Georgia Senate race is proving how difficult it is for Republicans to ditch the party\u2019s extremist image.\nIt\u2019s still early in the seven-way Republican primary for Georgia Senate \u2014 a field including Reps.
