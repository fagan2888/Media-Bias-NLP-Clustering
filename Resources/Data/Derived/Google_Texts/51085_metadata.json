Humana told HHS that rate calculations for all of its Texas plans are affected by many factors, including changes to contracts with hospitals and physicians, shifts in expected claims costs and changes in the use of medical services.  \u201cOur premium rates for 2015 reflect many changing factors in the marketplace \u2014 for instance, the growing use of high-cost specialty drugs, increasing or decreasing numbers of people with chronic health conditions or medical needs, and the increasing (or decreasing) cost of medical services,\u201d Humana said in a prepared statement to the Express-News.

The new rates reflect the company\u2019s assessment of the market and overall costs, including market risk and the influx of new customers who previously lacked coverage, the spokesperson said.  Humana\u2019s San Antonio HMOx individual major medical plans, sold both on and outside of the exchange, will see an average rate increase of 16 percent across the product line, as will the company\u2019s HMOx plans in the Houston, Austin and Waco markets.  The rates that health insurers currently charge vary based on several factors, including medical care costs for a region and pharmaceutical cost and utilization. \u2026", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "premiummysa-article-5940744"}, "author.name": "By Peggy O'Hare, Staff Writer", "og": {"site_name": "San Antonio Express-News", "description": "The data, released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, focuses on health plans sold to consumers shopping for their own coverage and small employers providing health insurance to workforces of fewer than 50 full-time employees.  \u201cThere may be new players in the market who can offer a better deal, even a new product,\u201d said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the health and wellness program at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a Texas public advocacy group.
