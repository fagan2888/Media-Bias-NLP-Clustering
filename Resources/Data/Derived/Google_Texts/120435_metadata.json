He said the Legislature is trying to bridge an estimated $1.3 billion budget deficit on the backs of the poor.\n\nNews 9 sat down with Jackson after the rally, and asked him why he came here when so many other states also have budget issues.\n\n\u201cEvery place I go, I raise the stakes,\" Jackson said.\n\nJackson said he hopes his visit will add pressure to state leaders to accept Obamacare dollars.\n\nBackers say that could bring $900 million federal dollars back to the state.\n\n\"It\u2019s ideological,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey want Medicare. They want care but not Obamacare. That's like an omelet not wanting the eggs.\"\n\nThe state healthcare authority announced Saturday it would hold off on proposed 25 percent cuts to Medicaid reimbursements to see what solutions the Legislature offers this week.\n\nCuts could force hospitals and nursing homes around the state to close.\n\n\"God has been too good to the few of us to be so unkind to the most of us,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cToo few are getting too much. Too many are getting too little. And the middle class is sinking. We must rise up all together.
