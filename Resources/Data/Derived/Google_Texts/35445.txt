Teary-eyed University of Denver lacrosse coach Bill Tierney opened his postgame comments Saturday looking like he had never advanced to the NCAA Final Four. Turns out, the legendary coach was just enormously emotional about the way his 14th team — and fourth at DU — advanced to the national semifinals.

“Amazing, amazing game,” Tierney said at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, host of the first western-based NCAA quarterfinals. “I’m just so proud of everybody affiliated with this team.”

Tierney’s Pioneers erased the deficit of a decade against Ohio State, refusing to lose in the biggest NCAA lacrosse event in Colorado history.

Behind gritty performances from senior goalie Ryan LaPlante and senior attack Wesley Berg, DU defeated the Buckeyes 15-13 after the Buckeyes jumped out to a 7-1 lead.

A crowd of 13,076 witnessed a remarkable comeback in the finale of an NCAA quarterfinal doubleheader that sends DU to its fourth Final Four in the last five years.

“It’s easy to get emotional because you don’t want to let anyone down,” Tierney said. “And then you get down 7-1 and watch a group of young men refuse to lose.”

Denver (15-2) will take an NCAA-leading 11-game winning streak into the national semifinals in Philadelphia, facing top-seeded Notre Dame (12-2) on Friday at Lincoln Financial Field. The two other Final Four berths will be determined Sunday in Annapolis, Md.

“We know what we’re up against,” said Tierney, who’s team beat Notre Dame 11-10 in overtime on Feb. 27 in Denver.

Beating Ohio State (12-7) wouldn’t have been possible without LaPlante (13 saves) and Berg (six goals), who were tremendous in the second and third quarters when DU went on a 9-0 run during Ohio State’s scoreless drought of 25 minutes, 55 seconds.

LaPlante couldn’t stop a beach ball in the first quarter, allowing six goals on eight shots, but was 7-of-7 from the 12:25 mark of the second quarter to 1:30 of the third. During that time, Berg scored four goals and Connor Cannizzaro, Zach Miller, Max Planning and Erik Adamson each had one as DU built a 10-7 lead.

Freshman faceoff specialist Trevor Baptiste was a modest 50 percent (15-of-30) after entering with an NCAA-high 70.5 percent.

“You could see the life go back into us after we got to 7-4, and kept chipping away from there,” Berg said. “You don’t want to be in that spot, ever, down 7-1 to begin the game. But we knew it could be done and we knew we had the team to do it.”

Late in the third quarter, Ohio State stopped the skid, and then some, scoring with 1:30 and 36.6 seconds left in the quarter to make it a 10-9 game going into the fourth quarter.

But DU senior Sean Cannizzaro scored consecutive goals to make it 12-9 early in the fourth quarter and brother Connor, a sophomore, struck after Ohio State briefly got within one.

Ohio State (12-7) is the last team to beat DU, and the Buckeyes looked like they would end the Pioneers’ season early by scoring seven of the first eight goals. Jesse King had three goals and three assists in OSU’s early attack.

“It comes down to possessing the ball and that’s what we did a really good job of in the first quarter,” King said. “We were scoring on probably 50 percent of our possessions. Then you get unlucky and you don’t get a couple of ground balls that you want and Denver starts getting them, and that’s when things turned.”
