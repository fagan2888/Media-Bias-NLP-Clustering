He hopes Lagasse visiting Hernando Beach will help promote the small town on the Gulf, and bring in out-of-county visitors, not only to his restaurant but other local businesses.\n\nJavidi expects the show will air in December or January. Until then, R Beach patrons can see a slideshow of photos from Emeril\u2019s visit, which are displayed on a screen in the indoor tiki bar, or hear the story from Javidi himself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to make friends,\u201d Javidi said.\n\nMore information on R Beach, including the menu and event calendar, is available at http://www.rbeachrestaurant .com/.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Oct 2013 21:17:04 -0400", "Description": "HERNANDO BEACH \u2014 R Beach owner Fred Javidi isn\u2019t interested in sport coats and ties or fancy flowers garnishing the plates that come out of his restaurant\u2019s kitchen.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "HERNANDO BEACH \u2014 R Beach owner Fred Javidi isn\u2019t interested in sport coats and ties or fancy flowers garnishing the plates that come out of his restaurant\u2019s kitchen.", "title": "Celebrity chef Emeril films at Hernando Beach restaurant", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/events/celebrity-chef-emeril-films-at-hernando-beach-restaurant-20131005/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009447/AR/0/AR-131009447.jpg", "height": 623}, "updated_time": "2013-10-06T15:53:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "HERNANDO BEACH \u2014 R Beach owner Fred Javidi isn\u2019t interested in sport coats and ties or fancy flowers garnishing the plates that come out of his restaurant\u2019s kitchen.", "title": "Celebrity chef Emeril films at Hernando Beach restaurant", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009447/AR/0/AR-131009447.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-05T21:17:04Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-06T15:53:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d7f\"", "article_summary": "HERNANDO BEACH \u2014 R Beach owner Fred Javidi isn\u2019t interested in sport coats and ties or fancy flowers garnishing the plates that come out of his restaurant\u2019s kitchen.\nHe hopes Lagasse visiting Hernando Beach will help promote the small town on the Gulf, and bring in out-of-county visitors, not only to his restaurant but other local businesses.\nMore information on R Beach, including the menu and event calendar, is available at http://www.rbeachrestaurant .com/.\n\u201cAnybody can have good food, very seldom do you find great food with super pricing.\u201dJavidi and his staff must be doing something right, because last month, celebrity chef and restaurateur Emeril Lagasse decided to pay R Beach a visit.\nLagasse visiting R Beach was exciting enough, Javidi said, but then the chef asked for recipes to add to the show\u2019s website, and sent out a photo with his \u201cnew friends\u201d at R Beach to his hundreds of thousands of followers on social media."}
