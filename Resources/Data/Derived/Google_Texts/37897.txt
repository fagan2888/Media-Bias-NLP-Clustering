In case the rush of euphoria that accompanied news of Michele Bachmann’s possible 2016 run has begun to recede from your memory, here’s some more good news: Comically xenophobic right-wing radio star and Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham is considering becoming a full-blown political candidate, too!

Or at least that’s what she wants Toby Harnden of the right-wing Sunday Times to tell his readers.

“I’ve been approached by various people to get involved [in electoral politics],” Harnden quotes Ingraham as telling him at the end of a rather starry-eyed puff piece (that goes a whole sentence before bringing up Ingraham’s “striking good looks”). “I’m keeping an open mind about running for office in the future.”

The impetus for Ingraham’s floating the idea of her as a candidate is the recent new boost of attention and success she’s gained by holding down the right-most post of the mainstream debate over immigration reform.
