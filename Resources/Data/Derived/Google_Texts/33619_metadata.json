In Afghanistan, many women live in villages that are many miles away from the nearest hospital. In the most remote areas, there are no roads or cars that can be enlisted if there\u2019s an emergency. As a result, complications during home births often result in death for the child or mother, or both.\n\nOne clever health charity has devised a solution that\u2019s perfectly customized to the resources and terrain in Afghanistan: a donkey ambulance.\n\n\u201cThe British charity HealthProm and designer Peter Muckle developed the inflatable donkey saddle,\u201d reports the Atlantic. The invention is a lightweight and comfortable solution that encourages women to make the trek to a medical facility before the labor begins, thus helping to lower Afghanistan\u2019s high infant mortality rates.\n\n\u201cHealthProm found that there was no comfortable way for women to travel in order to give birth,\u201d Muckle told the Atlantic. \u201cAnd they also found that if they did give birth in the health centers there was much more chance for them surviving.\u201d\n\nSo, he took some supplies that might otherwise have ended up in the landfill \u2014 such as inflatable camping cushions, the armrest from an air bed and part of an inflatable pool lounger \u2014 and stitched them together into a puffy chair that could be strapped to a donkey\u2019s back much like a saddle.\n\nIt seems so simple that it\u2019s almost silly, but it\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cThe donkey saddle is very safe and secures the pregnant woman during her transfer to the health center,\u201d said Dr. Azada Parsa, the project manager of HealthProm\u2019s Safe Motherhood Project in the provincial capital of Mazar-e Sharif. \u201cThey are very happy with this saddle and they are coming to the health center all the time while they are in labor.\u201d\n\nImage via Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "One clever health charity is saving infant lives with a solution that's perfectly customized to the resources and terrain in Afghanistan.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3046/3045913.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "donkey ambulance,afghanistan,pregnancy,infant mortality,women in afghanistan,pregnant afghanistan,healthprom,safe motherhood project", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda612\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe British charity HealthProm and designer Peter Muckle developed the inflatable donkey saddle,\u201d reports the Atlantic.\nOne clever health charity has devised a solution that\u2019s perfectly customized to the resources and terrain in Afghanistan: a donkey ambulance.\nIn Afghanistan, many women live in villages that are many miles away from the nearest hospital.\nAs a result, complications during home births often result in death for the child or mother, or both.\n\u201cHealthProm found that there was no comfortable way for women to travel in order to give birth,\u201d Muckle told the Atlantic."}
