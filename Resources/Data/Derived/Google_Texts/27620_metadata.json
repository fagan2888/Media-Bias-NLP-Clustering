(WWLP) \u2013 The region\u2019s largest employer is laying off 24 workers, and eliminating 45 open positions as it faces an approximately $22 million budget shortfall. According to a news release sent to 22News by Baystate Health spokesperson Ben Craft, an additional 17 workers will have their hours cut.\n\nCraft says that most of the layoffs are at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, though doctors and bedside nurses are not among those who are being let go. He added that some of those who have been laid off are in management positions. The people being laid off will leave in 30 days, and are being provided with severance pay and job placement assistance.\n\nBaystate Medical Center Chief Operating Officer Nancy Shendell-Falik said that they feel badly about the layoffs, but that they are necessary.\n\n\u201cLike many healthcare providers, we are facing a need to adjust our human, material, and financial resources to adapt to the rapidly changing healthcare environment,\u201d Shendell-Falik said. \u201cDifficult decisions such as these make it possible for us to continue to invest in services we\u2019re able to provide our patients, whether it\u2019s a new program, a new or renovated facility, surgical supplies, or a CT scanner.\u201d\n\nShe said that the reimbursements the hospital receives for treating Medicaid patients is between 70 and 80 cents on the dollar, and that is not enough to recover the cost of care.", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "news_keywords": "Springfield, Baystate Medical Center, Baystate Health, Baystate layoffs, Baystate Health layoffs", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "Facing a $22M budget shortfall, Baystate Health is laying off two dozen workers, cutting hours of some other workers, and eliminating 45 open positions.", "title": "Baystate Health announcing layoffs, elimination of positions", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2015/06/04/baystate-health-announcing-layoffs-elimination-of-positions/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/baystate-medical-center.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facing a $22M budget shortfall, Baystate Health is laying off two dozen workers, cutting hours of some other workers, and eliminating 45 open positions.", "title": "Baystate Health announcing layoffs, elimination of positions", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/baystate-medical-center.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2015-06-04T17:37:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T22:58:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Facing a $22M budget shortfall, Baystate Health is laying off two dozen workers, cutting hours of some other workers, and eliminating 45 ope\u2026"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb454\"", "article_summary": "Baystate Medical Center Chief Operating Officer Nancy Shendell-Falik said that they feel badly about the layoffs, but that they are necessary.\nCraft says that most of the layoffs are at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, though doctors and bedside nurses are not among those who are being let go.\nAccording to a news release sent to 22News by Baystate Health spokesperson Ben Craft, an additional 17 workers will have their hours cut.\n(WWLP) \u2013 The region\u2019s largest employer is laying off 24 workers, and eliminating 45 open positions as it faces an approximately $22 million budget shortfall.\nHe added that some of those who have been laid off are in management positions."}
