Multiple agencies responded and were able to put the flames out quickly, but there was hardly anything salvageable.\n\nMeridian fire marshal Jason Collier says it appears to be accidental. He says the flames sparked from an extension cord. No one was home at the time of the fire. There were no injuries. Collier wants to remind everyone of extension cord safety. You can check to see if the cords are warm. If so they are probably overloaded. Never overload or run the cords under rugs or in walls.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mobile home caught fire around one on Christmas Day on Old Highway 80 West.", "language": "english", "author": "Lindsey Jennings", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Home-Catches-Fire-on-Christmas-Day-363533021.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/house+fire197.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A mobile home caught fire around one on Christmas Day on Old Highway 80 West.", "title": "Home Catches Fire on Christmas Day"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A mobile home caught fire around one on Christmas Day on Old Highway 80 West.", "title": "Home Catches Fire on Christmas Day", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Home-Catches-Fire-on-Christmas-Day-363533021.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/house+fire197.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Home Catches Fire on Christmas Day", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Home Catches Fire on Christmas"}, "article_summary": "A mobile home caught fire around 1 p.m. Christmas Day on Old Highway 80 West.\nHe says the flames sparked from an extension cord.\nCollier wants to remind everyone of extension cord safety.\nMultiple agencies responded and were able to put the flames out quickly, but there was hardly anything salvageable.\nYou can check to see if the cords are warm."}
