White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he wouldn’t “disagree” or “quibble” with comments in a book by Barack Obama’s former adviser that says the president was lying about his position on gay marriage, admitting to insiders that he was “bullshitting” his answers on the issue.

Former White House senior advisor David Axelrod explains in his new book that Obama frequently stumbled when he was asked about the issue during his 2008 campaign.

“I’m just not very good at bullshitting,” Obama told Axelrod, after an event where he stated his opposition to same-sex marriage, according to the book.

Earnest said that while he hadn’t read the entire book yet, he wouldn’t “disagree or quibble” with Axelrod’s account, pointing out that he was in the “front row seat to history.”

When pressed on the issue by The Hill’s Justin Sink, Earnest would only cite the president’s record on LGBT issues.

Recalling when Obama finally admitted in 2012 that he supported gay marriage, Earnest pointed out that it was “a pretty controversial political stance.”

“Justin, I think the president’s record on these issues speaks to this even better than I possibly could,” Earnest said.
