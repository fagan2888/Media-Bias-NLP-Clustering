Earlier research showed a link between buildup of the protein amyloid and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nNow, they are looking to confirm the protein tau is also prominent.\n\n\"We think that amyloid protein is building up first but not long after that, tau protein is also building up and it\u2019s when the tau protein builds up and starts to spread in the brain is when the memory loss starts to occur,\" Salloway said.\n\nWhile they can see tau protein on pet scans now, they U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires it be confirmed though autopsy. Volunteers have a scan before death and an autopsy afterward.\n\n\"It\u2019s for people who are terminally ill who have less than six months to live,\" Salloway said. \"They can have dementia or not. They could have cancer causing their terminal illness with totally normal memory.\"\n\nThat way, they can prove the tau protein is in the Alzheimer\u2019s brain and not the normal brain, and that promises to help doctors better treat people with the memory-robbing disease.\n\n\"I know that she, herself, would want to help others,\" Medina said.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2016 Sunbeam Television.
