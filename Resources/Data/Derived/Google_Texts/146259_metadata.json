Sex yourself to better health with these orgasm cures.\n\nWhen we have an ache or a pain, we go to the doctor, get our meds, and call it a night. But there is a step we often miss in between lying in bed and going to sleep \u2014 having an orgasm. The \u201cbig O\u201d is not just a fun way to spend a night; it also contains great healing properties that treat anything from headaches to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) cramps.\n\nAn orgasm is \u201cthe miracle cure\u201d to staying healthy and balanced. Natural chemicals such as dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin are released during an orgasm, making us feel happy, flushed, warm, or sleepy, says Brown University Health Promotion. When they enter the bloodstream, these chemicals can induce both pleasure-enhancing and pain-relieving sensations.\n\nOur pain threshold raises during an orgasm, making us more equipped to block the pain. This can help us lessen some of life\u2019s more common pains and discomforts. Next time you have pain, aim for an orgasm instead of reaching for an aspirin. It's a free, fun, healthy way to alleviate some of life\u2019s most common ailments.\n\n1. Headaches\n\nNext time you have a headache, reach for your partner and not the medicine cabinet. Orgasms can relieve migraine pain or cluster headaches, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Cephalalgia. The researchers found you get relief no matter who your partner is, which position you use, or which type of sexual activity you engage in. However, achieving a full orgasm is necessary in alleviating the pain.\n\n2. Hiccups\n\nA case of the hiccups that just won\u2019t go away no matter what you do could physically and mentally drain you. Before you take a spoonful of peanut butter or try to scare yourself silly, try to have an orgasm instead. A 2000 case report published in the journal Canadian Family Physician said a healthy 40-year-old man made his intractable hiccups disappear for 12 months when he reached the moment of ejaculation during intercourse. This also works for women, according to a 1990 study published in the Journal of Internal Medicine, which found \u201cdigital rectal massage\u201d and orgasms can be a cure-all for intractable hiccups. The vagus nerve needs to be stimulated to alleviate hiccups, which is done during sex.\n\n3. Morning Sickness\n\nSex is what gave you morning sickness, and it can also be what alleviates it. Gordon Gallup, a SUNY-Albany psychologist, believes in the \u201chair of the dog\u201d concept when it comes to curing morning sickness \u2014 ingesting semen, specifically the impregnator\u2019s semen, so the woman\u2019s body can build up a tolerance to what\u2019s already in her body.\n\nGallup, who presented his findings at the 2012 Northeastern Evolutionary Psychology Society, proposed the woman\u2019s body initially rejects the father\u2019s semen as an infection and reacts to it by vomiting, the NY Daily News reported. However, the woman will become immune to the semen by swallowing it and could ebb morning sickness in subsequent pregnancies if the second child has the same father as the first. This remedy proposes oral sex may treat one of the most troubling symptoms of pregnancy.\n\n4. PMS Cramps\n\nCramps can be one of the most temporary debilitating symptoms women experience every month. Before an orgasm, a woman\u2019s uterus is more relaxed, but at the moment of climax, the blood flow increases, helping to relieve the cramps. The uterine muscles contract during an orgasm while releasing chemicals in the brain that act as a natural pain reliever. Judith Golden, a registered sex therapist in Toronto, told Best Health magazine, \u201cThe strength and intensity of an orgasm can relieve cramps.\u201d Women who masturbate often report it helps relieve menstrual cramps and even improve the symptoms of PMS, such as irritability and crankiness.\n\nOrgasm therapy can keep you healthy, fit, and pain-free without the need for going to the medicine cabinet.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vaginal orgasm, female orgasm,  clitoris, the g-spot, msexual arousal, sexual stimulation, sexual intercourse, aches and pains, headache, hiccups, morning sickness, pms cramps, better health, sexual health, women's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If you\u2019re in pain, grab your partner and forget the meds.
