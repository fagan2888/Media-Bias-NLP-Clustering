Clinton spoke about how to build an economy that will boost the middle class. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images)\n\nThe following post first appeared on FactCheck.org\n\nHillary Clinton has continued to twist Jeb Bush\u2019s words, suggesting that he thinks \u201cthe nurse who stands on her feet all day or the trucker who drives all night\u201d needs to \u201cwork longer hours.\u201d Bush did say \u201cpeople need to work longer hours,\u201d but he has since said he was talking about part-time workers who want full-time hours.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Bush had in mind when he first spoke, but his explanation is consistent with his previous statements about the underemployed.\n\nBush\u2019s \u201clonger hours\u201d comment exploded on social media, and in traditional media, as Democrats pounced on a carelessly worded response to a question about tax reform that the Republican presidential candidate fielded in New Hampshire from The Union Leader:\n\nBush, July 8: My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get out of this rut that we\u2019re in.\n\nHis campaign quickly clarified that the \u201clonger hours\u201d quote was a reference to the underemployed and part-time workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 6.5 million people in June who said they were working part-time because they couldn\u2019t find full-time work or because business was slow. By comparison, that figure was 4.6 million when the Great Recession started in December 2007.\n\nNonetheless, a number of Democrats criticized Bush for being out-of-touch, accusing him of saying Americans ought to work more than the standard 40 hours a week.\n\n\u201cAmericans already work the longest hours of any people in the western industrialized world,\u201d said Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. \u201cIn fact, 80 percent of working men work longer than 40 hours a week.\u201d\n\n(Actually, Sanders was wrong. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Americans worked more hours than the average for OECD-member countries, but ranked 15th out of the 34 countries surveyed. And, OECD reported, 83 percent of men and 65 percent of women in the U.S. worked 40 hours or more \u2014 but that\u2019s not the same as working more than 40 hours.)\n\nThe jabs continued on Twitter, where Rep. Steve Israel wrote: \u201cBush: \u2018People should work longer hours\u2019; next up: Bush: \u2018GDP could double without those lazy weekends.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign tweeted out, \u201cAnyone who believes Americans aren\u2019t working hard enough hasn\u2019t met enough American workers.\u201d\n\nBush addressed the budding controversy himself the same day, telling reporters, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to grow the economy, people need to stop being part-time workers, they need to be having access to greater opportunities to work.\u201d\n\nBush, July 8: You can take it out of context all you want, but high-sustained growth means that people work 40 hours rather than 30 hours and that by our success, they have money, disposable income for their families to decide how they want to spend it rather than getting in line and being dependent on government. Health-care costs are rising. In many places, the cost of doing business is extraordinarily high and the net result of that is that business start-up rates are at an all-time low. Workforce participation rates are low. If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery then they\u2019re totally out of touch. The simple fact is that people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you\u2019re going to see people lose hope.\n\nThat explanation is not only a plausible clarification of his original comment, it is consistent with previous statements Bush has made about the problem of underemployment.\n\nFor example, when laying out his economic plan on Feb. 4 at the Detroit Economic Club, Bush said the Obama economy had led to workers\u2019 hours being cut (at the 14:51 mark of the video).\n\nBush, Feb. 4: For several years now, they have been recklessly degrading the value of work, the incentive to work, and the rewards of work. We have seen them cut the definition of a full-time job from 40 hours to 30 hours, slashing the ability of paycheck earners to make ends meet. We have seen them create welfare programs and tax rules that punish people with lost benefits and higher taxes for moving up those first rungs of the economic ladder.\n\nBush was referring to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement for employers with at least 50 workers to provide health insurance to full-time employees, defined as those who work 30 hours or more per week. Bush and other critics of the ACA say that encourages employers to cut workers\u2019 hours to avoid the insurance requirement.\n\nThe Bush campaign also addressed the issue of underemployment in a July 5 Medium blog post, stating: \u201cMore than 6 million people are working part-time jobs when they\u2019d prefer full-time.\u201d That same post blamed the Obama-backed Affordable Care Act for \u201cholding down worker hours and reducing the payoff from working.\u201d\n\nAnd in an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News on June 2, Bush lamented that the \u201cwork force participation rate is lower than it was 30 years ago.\u201d\n\n(As an aside, we have noted that the ratio of part-time workers to all workers is about the same as when Obama took office. We also addressed the reasons for the declining workforce participation rate.)\n\nSome Democrats have softened their tone on the \u201clonger hours\u201d quote in light of Bush\u2019s clarification. For example, Sanders said this July 10 after CNN anchor Chris Cuomo accused Sanders of twisting Bush\u2019s words: \u201cWell, if [Bush] is talking about the need for more full-time jobs rather than part-time jobs, he\u2019s absolutely correct. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what we have to. But I want to reiterate. We work \u2014 our people work today the longest hours of any people in any major industrialized country.\u201d\n\nClinton has continued to take digs at Bush\u2019s \u201clonger hours\u201d comment, suggesting that Bush thinks that already hard-working Americans need to work harder still. One example came during a speech on July 13 at the National Council of La Raza\u2019s annual conference. (starting at the 11:36 mark)\n\nClinton, July 13: Now you probably heard Governor Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he should tell that to the farm workers breaking their backs picking fruit in Southern California. Or he should tell that to the dishwashers working their hands raw in the kitchens of Las Vegas. Or he should tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the trucker who drives all night or the fast-food workers marching in the streets for better pay. They don\u2019t need a lecture; they need a raise.\n\nClinton made nearly identical remarks when outlining her economic policy plan the same day in New York City (starting at the 21:30 mark).\n\nClinton, July 13: Now, you may have heard Governor Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met very many American workers. Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay. They don\u2019t need a lecture; they need a raise.\n\nThe Clinton campaign says she was simply making the point that the central economic problem for American workers is not that they need to work longer hours, but rather that they are not paid enough for the hours they do work.\n\n\u201cDuring this speech, Hillary Clinton laid out what she views as the defining economic challenge of our time: Raising incomes for hardworking Americans so they can afford a middle class life,\u201d Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin told us via email. \u201cThe contrast she was making with Bush is that he\u2019s not offering any ideas to address this central economic challenge.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an argument worthy of political debate. But by highlighting Bush\u2019s comment about people needing to work longer hours and following that with the suggestion that Bush needs to \u201ctell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night,\u201d Clinton implies that Bush thinks those workers need to work more hours. Those are full-time workers, but Bush says he wasn\u2019t referring to them at all.\n\nMisrepresenting your opponent\u2019s words is a campaign staple, of course. It reminds us at FactCheck.org of Republicans twisting Obama\u2019s quote, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business \u2014 you didn\u2019t build that,\u201d and of Obama spinning Mitt Romney\u2019s quote that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t move heaven and earth to get one man,\u201d referring to Osama bin Laden.\n\nBush\u2019s \u201clonger hours\u201d comment makes for hard-to-resist material during a heated campaign, appealing to full-time workers who might be offended by someone saying he or she needs to work longer hours. We\u2019d be surprised if this doesn\u2019t continue to be a frequent attack point. But Bush has since clarified that his words were being misinterpreted, and that he was making an argument in favor of part-time workers who want more hours to be given those opportunities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org. \n    \n     \n   Hillary Clinton has continued to twist Jeb Bush\u2019s words, suggesting tha...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-07-17 16:04:19 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org. \n    \n     \n   Hillary Clinton has continued to twist Jeb Bush\u2019s words, suggesting tha...", "title": "Hillary Clinton Twists Jeb Bush\u2019s Words", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-jeb-bush_us_55a808e0e4b0896514d0b2e0", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55a80cf21300002c00939f96.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55a80cf21300002c00939f96.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org. \n    \n     \n   Hillary Clinton has continued to twist Jeb Bush\u2019s words, suggesting tha...", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hillary Clinton Twists Jeb Bush\u2019s Words"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-16 16:04:19 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55a808e0e4b0896514d0b2e0", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,Elections 2016,2016 election,hourly workers", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Hillary Clinton,Jeb Bush,Elections 2016,2016 election,hourly workers", "published_time": "2015-07-16 16:04:19 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-07-16 16:04:19 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4274\"", "article_summary": "It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families.\nSo giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer.\nSome Democrats have softened their tone on the \u201clonger hours\u201d quote in light of Bush\u2019s clarification.\nBush\u2019s \u201clonger hours\u201d comment makes for hard-to-resist material during a heated campaign, appealing to full-time workers who might be offended by someone saying he or she needs to work longer hours.\nHis campaign quickly clarified that the \u201clonger hours\u201d quote was a reference to the underemployed and part-time workers."}
