Police are looking for the driver of a vehicle that struck a disabled car on the side of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Sunday night, killing a man and injuring his fiancée.

U.S. Park Police released a photo of the victims’ car Monday with the hope that any motorists who may have seen the maroon 2007 Hyundai Sonata will contact police and be able to offer additional details about the crash.

Rick Warrick, 38, had stopped the Sonata about 9:15 p.m. on the northbound side of the parkway just north of Route 197 in Laurel, where he was struck and killed while attempting to change the left front tire.

His fiancée, Julia Pearce, 28, was hospitalized with injuries not considered life-threatening, authorities said.

Police do not have a description of the striking vehicle, which left the scene.
