Thursday morning, the Oklahoma City Zoo announced the sudden death of beloved 4-year-old, female Asian Elephant Malee.

Malee died in the early morning hours on Thursday, Zoo officials said. Zoo keepers noticed slower than normal movements on Wednesday, which continued into the afternoon. However, they said Malee was eating and otherwise normal.

Around 4:30 p.m., officials said concern grew as zoo keepers noticed discoloration in her mouth. At that time, they initiated protocol treatment for EEHV (elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus,) although it is not confirmed as the cause of death.

Following a prescribed protocol, officials said a second treatment was given around 1 a.m. Thursday. But Maleeâ€™s condition had not changed at that time. Despite the aggressive treatment, officials said Malee declined rapidly and passed away at approximately 4 a.m.

A necropsy (animal autopsy) will be performed to determine exact cause of death, according to Zoo officials. But results may not be known for some time.

Zoo officials said all the other elephants are doing well at this time.
