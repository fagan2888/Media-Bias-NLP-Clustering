(Mehgan Pierce/Union Leader Correspondent)\n\nSanders finds enthusiasm in Keene campaign stop\n\n\n\n- Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders drew about 1,000 people to the Keene Recreation Center for a town hall gathering Saturday afternoon.\n\n\n\nThe Vermont senator had the crowd cheering when he voiced his opposition to the trade promotion authority bill, but when asked by a reporter afterward, he declined to comment on whether Hillary Clinton's lack of a stance on the issue was hurting her campaign.\n\n..\n\n\"Call her up and ask her,\" Sanders said. \"I'm against it.\"\n\n\n\nThe town hall attendees took to their feet, applauding and cheering Sanders on several issues, including his position that all are entitled to health care and a public college education.\n\n..\n\nThough the Affordable Care Act has made strides, many are still struggling with high deductibles and high co-payments they can't afford, he said.\n\n\n\nSanders said he would work to enact Medicare for all through a single payer program.\n\n..\n\nHe also said many young people have given up on the dream of going to college because of the high cost and many adults are burdened with high-interest rate student loans.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama took a step in the right direction by moving student loan debt to the federal side and out of the hands of the private sector, but that has resulted in the government making money off the high interest rates, he said.\n\n..\n\nPeople are still struggling, he said. Students' loan interest rates should be cut in half, he said, and the government should offer free college education through public colleges.\n\n\n\nWithout mentioning Clinton, Sanders said, he opposed the Iraq War from the start.\n\n..\n\n\"Not only did I vote against that war, I led the opposition to that war,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOn the \"war and peace issue,\" Sanders said. \"My top priority is to make sure we are not involved in another war that doesn't end.\"\n\n..\n\nLooking out into the room that was standing-room only and spilling out of each entryway, Sanders said he is confident he can win New Hampshire in the primary.\n\n\n\nMany of his supporters agreed and said they were not surprised by the turnout.\n\n..\n\n\"We've loved him forever,\" John Duggan of Contoocook said after the gathering. \"He's always been for the people, for the community.\"\n\n\n\nmpierce@newstote.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders drew about 1,000 people to the Keene Recreation Center for a town hall gathering Saturday afternoon.", "title": "Sanders finds enthusiasm in Keene campaign stop | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders drew about 1,000 people to the Keene Recreation Center for a town hall gathering Saturday afternoon.", "title": "Sanders finds enthusiasm in Keene campaign stop | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150607/NEWS0605/150609347", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150607/NEWS0605/150609347/AR/0/AR-150609347.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Primary Plus", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "date": "2015-06-07 00:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "keywords": "General News, Manchester, Primary Status,", "twitter": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders drew about 1,000 people to the Keene Recreation Center for a town hall gathering Saturday afternoon.", "title": "Sanders finds enthusiasm in Keene campaign stop | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150607/NEWS0605/150609347", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150607/NEWS0605/150609347/AR/0/AR-150609347.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Mehgan Pierce/Union Leader Correspondent)Sanders finds enthusiasm in Keene campaign stop- Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders drew about 1,000 people to the Keene Recreation Center for a town hall gathering Saturday afternoon.\nContoocook brothers Heath Duggan, 11, Sheamus Duggan, 13, and Iain Duggan, 6, attend a Bernie Sanders town hall in Keene with their family Saturday afternoon.\n(Mehgan Pierce/Union Leader Correspondent) Contoocook brothers Heath Duggan, 11, Sheamus Duggan, 13, and Iain Duggan, 6, attend a Bernie Sanders town hall in Keene with their family Saturday afternoon.\nThe town hall attendees took to their feet, applauding and cheering Sanders on several issues, including his position that all are entitled to health care and a public college education.\nThough the Affordable Care Act has made strides, many are still struggling with high deductibles and high co-payments they can't afford, he said."}
