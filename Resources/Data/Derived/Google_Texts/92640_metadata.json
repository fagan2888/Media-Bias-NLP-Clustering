When Bob\u2019s wife Michelle found out her kidneys were failing, Bob was faced with a situation that he could not fix, but that didn\u2019t stop him from doing everything in his power to help.\n\n\"If something breaks in the house, I can fix it,\" Bob told KUSA-TV. \u201cWhen it comes to health, it's like I can't fix this. Sometimes I'll be alone and I'll just start, you know, crying about it.\u201d\n\nMichelle, who suffers from systematic lupus, has battled pain, fatigue, and even comas over the past 30 years as her condition has continually attacked all of her vital organs. After finding out about her failing kidney, Michelle and her family began shopping their options for a kidney transplant. Those options included waiting five to six years to receive a deceased kidney in Colorado \u2014 five to six years that could be longer than Michelle has \u2014 or find their own living donor.\n\nThe search for a living donor started out a little rocky. Bob was unable to grab anyone\u2019s attention with flyers and fundraisers. With an admittedly limited understanding of social media, Bob decided to turn his truck into the family\u2019s very own Facebook post. The post got straight to the point:\n\n\u201cTYPE O BLOOD, WIFE NEEDS KIDNEY, Michelle Stewart, 720-848-0855.\u201d\n\nWhile driving around last Friday, someone caught a quick photo of Bob\u2019s truck and posted it to Reddit. By Tuesday, the photo had already garnered over three million views. Although finding a match could take months with the help of the University of Colorado, Bob and Michelle are more than thankful for the fighting shot kind-hearted strangers have granted them.\n\n\"It's amazing. It just puts a lump in your throat,\" Bob explained. \"We were thinking that we would find one person,\" Michelle added. \"We had no idea that it would become so big.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "colorado, man, goes, above, and, beyond, find, wife, lupus, patient, michelle, stewart, new", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Bob Stewart did everything in his power to find a living kidney donor for his wife Michelle.", "title": "Colorado Man Gets Creative To Help Find His Wife A New Kidney [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/colorado-man-goes-above-and-beyond-find-wife-lupus-patient-michelle-stewart-new-327748", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/01/bob-and-michelle-stewart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bob Stewart did everything in his power to find a living kidney donor for his wife Michelle.", "title": "Colorado Man Gets Creative To Help Find His Wife A New Kidney [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/colorado-man-goes-above-and-beyond-find-wife-lupus-patient-michelle-stewart-new-327748", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/01/bob-and-michelle-stewart.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/01/bob-and-michelle-stewart.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-01T11:20:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-01T11:20:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Bob Stewart did everything in his power to find a living kidney donor for his wife Michelle."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ba6\"", "article_summary": "After finding out about her failing kidney, Michelle and her family began shopping their options for a kidney transplant.\nBob Stewart is what you would call a \u201chandy man.\u201d After 21 years of masonry work, his family knows who to go to when something breaks.\nThe post got straight to the point:\u201cTYPE O BLOOD, WIFE NEEDS KIDNEY, Michelle Stewart, 720-848-0855.\u201dWhile driving around last Friday, someone caught a quick photo of Bob\u2019s truck and posted it to Reddit.\nWhen Bob\u2019s wife Michelle found out her kidneys were failing, Bob was faced with a situation that he could not fix, but that didn\u2019t stop him from doing everything in his power to help.\n\"If something breaks in the house, I can fix it,\" Bob told KUSA-TV."}
