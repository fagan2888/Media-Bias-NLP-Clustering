In states lie Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal, patients have been told their assisted suicide would be paid for while their medical treatment would not.\n\nNow, out of the UK, new NHS guidelines are urging doctors to ask elderly patients to sign DNR orders that would have doctors taking their lives by refusing to resuscitate them rather than providing them lifesaving care.\n\nNew NHS guidelines urge doctors to draw up end-of-life plans for elderly patients and younger patients with serious conditions, such as cancer. Doctors are told to ask patients if they want a DNR order if thei9r medical condition worsens. Medical professionals say it is \u2018blatantly wrong\u2019 and will frighten elderly patients.\n\nHere\u2019s more:\n\nThe NHS says the guidance will improve patients\u2019 end-of-life care, but medical professionals say it is \u2018blatantly wrong\u2019 and will frighten the elderly into thinking they are being \u2018written off\u2019. In some surgeries, nurses are cold-calling patients over 75 or with long-term conditions and asking them over the phone if they have \u2018thought about resuscitation\u2019.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Death Panels: British Govt Urges Doctors to Ask Elderly Patients to Sign DNR Orders", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The onset of Obamacare in the United States brought on fears of death panels via rationed health care that encourages the elderly, disabled or terminally ill to", "title": "Death Panels: British Govt Urges Doctors to Ask Elderly Patients to Sign DNR Orders", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/04/27/death-panels-british-govt-urges-doctors-to-ask-elderly-patients-to-sign-dnr-orders/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/elderlypatient20.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "death panels: british govt urges doctors to ask elderly patients to sign dnr orders", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "New NHS guidelines urge doctors to draw up end-of-life plans for elderly patients and younger patients with serious conditions, such as cancer.\nDoctors are told to ask patients if they want a DNR order if thei9r medical condition worsens.\nNow, out of the UK, new NHS guidelines are urging doctors to ask elderly patients to sign DNR orders that would have doctors taking their lives by refusing to resuscitate them rather than providing them lifesaving care.\nMedical professionals say it is \u2018blatantly wrong\u2019 and will frighten elderly patients.\nIn states lie Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal, patients have been told their assisted suicide would be paid for while their medical treatment would not."}
