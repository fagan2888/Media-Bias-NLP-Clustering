The stars of the show are truly selfless heroes\u2013men and women who set up dream hunts for terminally ill children and brave members of the FDNY and NYPD.\n\nThe show kicks off in Missouri with field host Tara Conner visiting with Dan Wilhite and the incredible organization called Hunt Of A Lifetime. Whilite donates his time and resources to put smiles on the faces of serious ill children. This time out Whilite took young brothers Blake and Cole Vanhouten out to look for whitetail deer. Blake, 13 and Cole, 10 both have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Their mom, Casey Fair tells Conner you just have to make every day special. This hunt was certainly one of those days.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe boys had an absolute blast on a cold, snowy, early morning in The Show Me State. Meantime, Conner was moved by the story of those who make all these hunts possible.\n\nTina Pattison, the founder of Hunt Of A Lifetime tells Conner how the group started. Her terminally ill son, Matt wanted to go moose hunting. It wasn\u2019t easy to find a program that provided such a hunt. Once Pattison did however she decided that she needed to make this dream possible and more accessible to other kids as well. Hunt Of A Lifetime was born.\n\nMatt was able to get his moose and fulfill his hunting goal. Six months after his big day, Matt passed away. Now, his mom looks to heaven each and every time a child in Hunt Of A Lifetime bags an animal and she tells her son they \u201cgot another one\u201d.\n\n\u201cI can think of no sweeter way to honor your son\u2019s memory, Tina,\u201d Palin said. \u201cYou are exactly the kind of woman I mean when I talk about mama grizzlies.\u201d\n\nAnother mama grizzly, Barb Rabbitt is introduced to us later. She\u2019s Wilhite\u2019s girlfriend and she provided a great meal of biscuits and gravy for the Vanhouten boys. The kids also dug in to a huge camouflage cake. \u201cThese two little dudes are having the time of their lives,\u201d said Palin.\n\nThe brothers certainly did have fun doing what they love. It didn\u2019t hurt having a former Miss USA along for the ride. The boys thanked Conner for coming with them on their hunt with Cole adding \u201cTara, next time I kill a deer you\u2019re going to have to skin it.\u201d No word yet from Conner if she\u2019s up for that one.\n\nWhile hunting can make children smile it can also prove therapeutic, not only for kids but for big, strong men. Field host Jerry Carroll headed to Pike County, Illinois to spend a day with New York City police officers and firefighters who make an annual trek to the Land of Lincoln for some relaxing deer hunting. The guys had monster bucks on their mind but for a group that started this tradition following 9-11, camaraderie and a place to escape for a few days trumps any hunting success.\n\nThese men lost friends in the attacks on the World Trade Center. They know about people paying the ultimate price. You can see why time in the great outdoors, far from the city they protect and serve can work wonders.\n\nSean Murtha (NYPD officer), Jerry Murtha (Ret. FDNY), Kevin Shea (Ret. FDNY), and Kevin Keatley (FDNY) are a spirited bunch. They\u2019re the kind of guys you\u2019d like to hang out with. Men you\u2019d be proud to call friends.\n\n\u201cI have so much gratitude in my heart for these guys\u2013police and firefighters everywhere,\u201d Palin said. \u201cWhere would we all be without their sacrifices? And yet for them, heroism\u2013it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nShea, who was injured in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center and lost a partner on 9-11 has seen it all. Now, he\u2019s all about giving back\u2013teaching others how to hunt along the way, including military firefighters. As Palin put it \u201cthis is what a hero\u2019s retirement looks like.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Carroll and the guys came up empty. No deer on this trip. But, that didn\u2019t matter one bit. They came up huge where it counts the most. Another wonderful trip filled with laughter and togetherness.\n\n\u201cEvery working man and woman faces a lot of stress on the job, but none more so than police and firefighters,\u201d Palin said. \u201cSo, thanks for all that you do to protect and to serve in America.\u201d Americans from coast to coast are echoing those very sentiments.\n\nAmazing America with Sarah Palin airs Thursdays on Sportsman Channel", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin Honors NYPD, FDNY, Kids Battling Illness Through Special Hunts", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sarah Palin Honors NYPD, FDNY, Kids Battling Illness Through Special Hunts", "title": "Sarah Palin Honors NYPD, FDNY, Kids Battling Illness Through Special Hunts - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/HuntofALifetime-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T21:21:28-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2015/03/01/sarah-palin-honors-nypd-fdny-kids-battling-illness-through-special-hunts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah Palin Honors NYPD, FDNY, Kids Battling Illness Through Special Hunts", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/HuntofALifetime-1.jpg", "title": "Sarah Palin Honors NYPD, FDNY, Kids Battling Illness Through Special Hunts - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Amazing America, FDNY, Hunt Of A Lifetime, hunting, NYPD, Sarah Palin,Breitbart Sports,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-01T00:12:34-07:00", "section": "Breitbart Sports", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T21:21:28-07:00", "tag": "Sarah Palin", "categories": "Breitbart Sports"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6b9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvery working man and woman faces a lot of stress on the job, but none more so than police and firefighters,\u201d Palin said.\nTheir mom, Casey Fair tells Conner you just have to make every day special.\nTina Pattison, the founder of Hunt Of A Lifetime tells Conner how the group started.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn the latest edition of Amazing America with Sarah Palin, viewers were treated to stories of love through hunting.\n\u201cI have so much gratitude in my heart for these guys\u2013police and firefighters everywhere,\u201d Palin said."}
