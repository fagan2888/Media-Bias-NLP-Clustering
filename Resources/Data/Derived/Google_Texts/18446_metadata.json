Ted Cruz speaks at a campaign event in Kalamazoo. (Oct. 5, 2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nKALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD/AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who is among a big field of Republican presidential candidates, was in Kalamazoo on Monday to tell voters that he is the person for the job.\n\nIt was Cruz\u2019s second trip to Michigan in as many months \u2014 he was at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in September. The trips here appear to be part of a longer range plan to get past primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and the rest and then into the big March block, in which Michigan will figure prominently.\n\n\u201cMichigan is a big state. It\u2019s an important state,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, the core of our campaign are working men and women. Michigan is a state that we are competing vigorously in in the primary and we intend to compete vigorously in Michigan and win Michigan in the general election.\u201d\n\nCruz, 44, is nothing if not confident. The last time Republicans won Michigan in the general election, he was 17.\n\nSpeaking before a crowd of hundreds at the Wings Event Center, he also laid out a litany of things he would do on day one if elected president, taking aim at the Obama administration in nearly all of them.\n\n\u201cI will go to Congress and we will repeal every word of Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to targeting the Affordable Care Act, he also voiced opposition to Common Core education standards and Planned Parenthood. If elected, he said, he would undo executive actions of President Barack Obama and order the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhen asked if voters could count on him to do what he says he will, he replied, \u201cYes, yes and hell yes.\u201d\n\nHe also presented himself as someone who will take on Washington as an outsider. That field of outsiders has grown with names like business mogul Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and others playing the outside game in the primary race. They are picking up support from those who think current leadership in both the Democratic and Republican parties doesn\u2019t represent them.\n\nCruz moved forward with scathing reviews of the Obama administration and Washington. Upon his visit to Michigan, which came following a week in the nation\u2019s capital, he said it was great to be back \u201cin the United States.\u201d\n\nHe said that constitutional rights are under attack, but that \u201chelp is on the way.\u201d\n\nCruz invoked the name of President Ronald Regan and \u2014 as he did on Mackinac Island \u2014 said that the \u201cReagan Revolution\u201d in some ways started in Michigan with \u201cReagan Democrats.\u201d He said he thinks he can launch a similar movement here as well.\n\nHe ended by saying that \u201cfreedom isn\u2019t some abstract concept we learn about in school\u201d and talked about his father fleeing Cuba in the 1950s to achieve the freedom that he says is under attack.\n\nSYRIAN REFUGEES\n\nCruz also called the Obama administration\u2019s plan to accept refugees from war-torn Syria \u201cnothing short of crazy,\u201d because he believes some are Islamic State terrorists.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason the director of national intelligence said among those refugees are no doubt a significant number of ISIS terrorists,\u201d he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. \u201cIt would be the height of foolishness to bring in tens of thousands of people including jihadists that are coming here to murder innocent Americans.\u201d\n\nIn fact, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has not confirmed that the refugee wave includes significant numbers of terrorists. He has spoken of the risk of terrorists mingling in, saying last month: \u201cWe don\u2019t obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees.\u201d ISIL is an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group.\n\nClapper said the U.S. was aggressively screening the small number of Syrian refugees it has accepted.\n\nThe Obama administration said it intends to accept about 10,000 Syrian refugees and increase the overall number of refugees allowed into the country from around the world to 85,000 in the next 12 months. That total would increase to 100,000 by 2017. The U.S. now accepts up to 70,000 refugees per year.\n\nGov. Rick Snyder, also a Republican, is talking with federal officials about what the state can do to accept more Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it part of our nature as Americans to say, \u2018How can we help people in need?'\u201d he asked last week.\n\nThe Detroit area has one of the largest Middle Eastern populations in the country.\n\nDr. Carson also has said the U.S. should bar refugees from Syria because they are \u201cinfiltrated\u201d with Muslim extremists. Another rival, Donald Trump, has pledged to send Syrian refugees home.\n\nCruz said the Islamic State rose to power \u201cin the face of American weakness.\u201d The refugees should be resettled in the Middle East in majority Muslim countries, he said.\n\nCruz made his visit to Michigan polling sixth nationwide in the Real Clear Politics average of polls.\n\nGregg Stephenson, a 59-year-old former automotive technician from Gowen, northeast of Grand Rapids, said he likes Cruz\u2019s combative tactics and stance against illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody that stands up for us,\u201d he said.\n\nMichigan\u2019s primary is scheduled for March 8.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Senator Ted Cruz, presidential candidate, Kalamazoo, GOP", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "Speaking in Kalamazoo, the Republican presidential candidate said he is confident he can win Michigan in the general election.", "title": "Cruz in Kzoo: \u2018Michigan a big, important state\u2019", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2015/09/28/gop-contender-cruz-to-campaign-in-kzoo/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ted-cruz-in-kzoo2.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaking in Kalamazoo, the Republican presidential candidate said he is confident he can win Michigan in the general election.", "title": "Cruz in Kzoo: \u2018Michigan a big, important state\u2019", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ted-cruz-in-kzoo2.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@woodtv", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Senator Ted Cruz, presidential candidate, Kalamazoo, presidential campaign, Republican, Wings Event Center, GOP", "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2015-09-29T00:59:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T00:03:35+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Speaking in Kalamazoo, the Republican presidential candidate said he is confident he can win Michigan in the general election."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca653\"", "article_summary": "Clapper said the U.S. was aggressively screening the small number of Syrian refugees it has accepted.\nRick Snyder, also a Republican, is talking with federal officials about what the state can do to accept more Syrian refugees.\nMichigan is a state that we are competing vigorously in in the primary and we intend to compete vigorously in Michigan and win Michigan in the general election.\u201dCruz, 44, is nothing if not confident.\nCruz said the Islamic State rose to power \u201cin the face of American weakness.\u201d The refugees should be resettled in the Middle East in majority Muslim countries, he said.\n\u201cMichigan is a big state."}
