And the one good thing about their refusal is that it brings the concept of constitutional hardball out into the open so that we can get a much better fix on what they\u2019re up to\u2014and what they have been up to for quite some time now.\n\nThe term was coined by Mark Tushnet in a 2004 paper of the same name. As he explained:\n\n[I]t consists of political claims and practices\u2013legislative and executive initiatives\u2013that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings.\n\nOf course, the Senate can refuse to vote on a presidential nominee; there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that specifically prohibits it. It\u2019s just never been even considered, much less done, before. That\u2019s some tension, all right! Could it be because of Obama\u2019s race? Or just because he\u2019s a Democrat? Tushnet continues:\n\nIt is hardball because its practitioners see themselves as playing for keeps in a special kind of way; they believe the stakes of the political controversy their actions provoke are quite high, and that their defeat and their opponents\u2019 victory would be a serious, perhaps permanent setback to the political positions they hold.\n\nLet\u2019s see, Roe v. Wade, the Voting Rights Act, Citizens United, executive orders on climate change and immigration, just to name a few\u2013yes, I\u2019d say the stakes are high. As for \u201ca serious, perhaps permanent setback,\u201d that might be harder to say, but it\u2019s certainly something that conservatives believe.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no question this is the sort of thing that Tushnet was talking about. In fact, it seems to me an even more clear-cut example than ones he cites in his paper, such as Democrats\u2019 filibuster of specific judicial nominations in 2002-2003, mid-decade redistricting efforts in Colorado and Texas and the impeachment of President Clinton. Yet, for whatever reason, Tushnet only told the New York Times that it \u201cprobably\u201d qualified.\n\nConstitutional Hardball in Transition Periods\n\nWe\u2019ll return to what he said, but first I want to dig a bit deeper into the concept and how to understand it. At one point, Tushnet writes, \u201cMy suggestion is that constitutional hardball is the way constitutional law is practiced distinctively during periods of constitutional transformation,\u201d such as that which occurred during the New Deal. Constitutional transformations replace one constitutional order with another one, each involving a set of assumptions about fundamental institutional arrangements, \u201cthe relations between President and Congress, the mechanisms by which politicians organize support among the public, and the principles that politicians take to guide the development of public policy.\u201d\n\nAs one illustrative example, Tushnet notes:\n\n[P]rior to the New Deal, Congress initiated legislation subject to modest review by the President, whereas after the New Deal the President initiated legislation subject to modest review by Congress. And, during the transformative period when Franklin D. Roosevelt was attempting to construct a new constitutional order, his efforts to seize the legislative initiative were understood to be challenges to settled pre-constitutional understandings about the relation between President and Congress\u2013and, as such, revolutionary.\n\nWhile constitutional transformations may often occur relatively rapidly, this need not be case, Tushnet argues. In fact, he believes, \u201cthe concept of constitutional hardball does seem to describe a lot of recent, that is, post-1980, political practices. The reason, I believe, is that we have been experiencing a quite extended period of constitutional transformation.\u201d The result is an \u201cextended period in which political leaders played constitutional hardball. Indeed, it might come to seem as if constitutional hardball was the normal state of things rather than a symptom of the possibility of constitutional transformation. Transformation might seem like an ever-receding light at the end of the tunnel, and constitutional hardball the way politicians play day-to-day politics.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, a profound irony here: those trying to transform the constitutional order call themselves \u201cconservatives,\u201d even as they drive the process of striving for radical constitutional transformation. Liberals play hardball, too, of course, as Tushnet describes it, but the prime example he gives, mentioned above\u2014the judicial filibuster of Bush appointees in 2001-2003\u2014was a clearly defensive move, was turned to reluctantly, and was deployed against a limited number of targets. There was, throughout the process, a prudential conservative element in the Democrat\u2019s thinking, which made good sense: they were trying to (re-)normalize things, trying to appeal to traditional notions of comity. Even if they had to take an extraordinary action in order to do so, they wanted their extraordinary action to be as reasonable and restricted as possible, while still achieving their goal\u2014which was inherently a limited, defensive one.\n\nThe Case at Hand\n\nWith all this in mind, let\u2019s return to what Tushnet told the New York Times:\n\nThe argument for calling it hardball is that there might be a reasonably settled understanding that it\u2019s undesirable for the Supreme Court to operate \u2018too long\u2019 without a full complement of judges, and, as a result of that understanding, that the Senate will consider nominations sent to it reasonably far in advance of a presidential election.\n\nBut I believe what\u2019s going on here is potentially much more radical than Tushnet\u2019s description allows. The actual settled understanding is much clearer, and has nothing to do with presidential elections. That\u2019s just a convenient ruse Republicans are using in their propaganda war. The Constitution (Article II, Clause 2) says the President \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court\u2026.\u201d To repeat: \u201cshall nominate.\u201d Not \u201cmay nominate.\u201d It is a presidential duty, an obligation of the office, not a presidential right, which some may contest because they do not like him personally. It\u2019s a duty of his office as long as he\u2019s in office. There is no cut-off date. Thus, what Republican senators have almost immediately said is that President Obama should not do his duty.\n\nTo further underscore what the settled understanding is, we can look to the historical record. Since the time of George Washington, 196 nominations have been made, with 160 confirmations, while 36 declined, withdrew or were defeated,. Of those 160 confirmations, 10 were confirmed the same day they were nominated, 53 within a week, and 88\u2014more than half\u2014within a month. Only six nominees have taken more than three months to get a vote. Of these, two were rejected, one withdrawn and three confirmed. Only one nominee took more than four months for a vote\u2014Louis Brandeis, who was confirmed 47-22. These last six examples represents the outer limits of delay, compared to the 11 months that Obama has remaining in his term. He could appoint three of the most contentious nominees ever in the time remaining.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the process has grown more intensive in the television age, the basic understanding has not changed. Since Richard Nixon took office, the average time from submission to vote has been notably longer than in the pre-television era, but it\u2019s still only a fraction over 60 days, the longest being 114 days for Robert Bork. Again, we are nowhere near to any sort of time limit, other than the time limit that Obama should never be allowed to act as president at any time whatsoever.\n\nBut that view of theirs is entirely at odds with the universal understanding of what the office of the president entails. So what we have here is not a situation which is \u201cprobably\u201d constitutional hardball. It is constitutional hardball on steroids. They want to cripple the president\u2014at least until they control the Oval Office again, at which point, well, who knows? Because this is where I think Tushnet\u2019s argument needs some refinement. I think he\u2019s absolutely right about the prolonged period of constitutional transformation and constitutional hardball, but for whatever reasons, conservatives and Republicans have been unable to clearly formulate the constitutional order they wish to achieve, beyond simply keeping Democrats out of power. If they have the White House, they\u2019ll make it as powerful as possible. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll cripple it. This is not a recipe for a constitutional order, it\u2019s a recipe for constitutional disorder\u2014and incoherence in terms of defending it. And they\u2019re only getting better and better at it over time.\n\nOh, and just in case you might think being in an election year matters, at SCOTUSBlog, Amy Howe reports that \u201cThe historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election,\u201d and then goes on to describe the record. Woodrow Wilson actually nominated two justices in 1916. Both were confirmed. So the idea that a president should hold off and \u201clet the people decide\u201d has never been taken seriously in practice. The people already did decide when they voted in the previous election.\n\nConfusion, Inc.\n\nOf course, conservatives and Republicans have gone all out on obscuring the issue. It\u2019s what they do. And Media Matters has been going all out in batting them down. For example, they highlight Hugh Hewitt on CNN making up a new rule, \u201cLame ducks don\u2019t make lifetime appointments.\u201d And just to be clear Hewitt explicitly was framing it as a sort of marching order for the entire GOP:\n\nIf I were a Republican, whether the majority leader all the way down to the county clerk and every nominee, I would say very simply, no hearings, no votes. Lame ducks don\u2019t make lifetime appointments\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s a nifty rhetorical contrast\u2014lame duck vs. lifetime appointment\u2014but it\u2019s utterly without substance, since \u201clame duck\u201d is a term referring to someone who has either lost or not run for re-election, and is simply serving out \u201cdead time,\u201d waiting for their successor to take office. It is simply ludicrous to refer to a two-term president in their last year in office as a \u201clame duck\u201d: they have no elected successor, and all the normal responsibilities of their office still require their attention\u2014including the appointment of Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe CNN host Dana Bash tried to question this canard, but Hewitt easily danced away into spinning further irrelevancies:\n\nDANA BASH: And he\u2019s a lame duck even a year out? HEWITT: Easily. The last time \u2014 Justice Kennedy has been referred to a lot \u2014 was nominated in November of 1987 after Judge Bork had been blocked. That vacancy occurred in June of 1987. So there is no precedent. And I would simply add, the base will not forgive anyone. Senators will lose their jobs if they block the blockade. There should be an absolute blockade on this. And [Sen.] Patrick Leahy [(D-VT)], who was your guest earlier, voted 27 times to deny a vote or a hearing to Republican nominees between 2001 and 2003. Patrick Leahy created the conditions that he was decrying right now.\n\nI\u2019ll have more to say about Bork below, and while it\u2019s true that Leahy took unusual steps\u2014it\u2019s the first example of constitutional hardball that Tushnet considers in his paper\u2014his actions were all directed against specific nominees who had been named, and deemed too extreme or otherwise unfit. Neither Leahy nor any other Democrat sought to block all Bush nominees\u2026 none of whom were to the Supreme Court. Nor, of course, did anyone dream of telling Bush he couldn\u2019t make such nominations in the first place. That\u2019s four key points of difference between what Leahy did and what Hewitt\u2014and others\u2014are calling for now.\n\nSo what you see here is a typical performance of ill-informed conservative outrage, which seems to help fuel the dynamics of constitutional hardball in a way that\u2019s quite satisfied to never settle down into a new constitutional order, but simply to move from one crisis formulation to the next, playing hardball all the way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives wrap themselves in a Constitution they don't understand, claiming powers it does not provide", "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives wrap themselves in a Constitution they don't understand, claiming powers it does not provide", "title": "Ted Cruz just makes this stuff up: Scalia, the GOP and the lies they tell about the Constitution", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/20/ted_cruz_just_makes_this_stuff_up_scalia_the_gop_and_the_lies_they_tell_about_the_constitution/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/bork_cruz_scalia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives wrap themselves in a Constitution they don't understand, claiming powers it does not provide", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/bork_cruz_scalia.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz just makes this stuff up: Scalia, the GOP and the lies they tell about the Constitution", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ted Cruz just makes this stuff up: Scalia, the GOP and the lies they tell about the Constitution", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Antonin Scalia, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Robert Bork, Supreme Court, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is not a recipe for a constitutional order, it\u2019s a recipe for constitutional disorder\u2014and incoherence in terms of defending it.\nIndeed, it might come to seem as if constitutional hardball was the normal state of things rather than a symptom of the possibility of constitutional transformation.\nIn fact, he believes, \u201cthe concept of constitutional hardball does seem to describe a lot of recent, that is, post-1980, political practices.\nConstitutional Hardball in Transition PeriodsWe\u2019ll return to what he said, but first I want to dig a bit deeper into the concept and how to understand it.\nThe reason, I believe, is that we have been experiencing a quite extended period of constitutional transformation.\u201d The result is an \u201cextended period in which political leaders played constitutional hardball."}
