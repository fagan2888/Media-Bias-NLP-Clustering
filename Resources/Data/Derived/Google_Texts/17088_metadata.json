Some participants also would have to pay monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s stuff that needs to be tweaked,\u201d Torpey said. \u201cBut whether you agree with the Affordable Care Act or think it\u2019s a train wreck, we in Missouri should have some say in how we make some adjustments in the Medicaid health care system.

But he said it would require that Medicaid recipients be working or in school, similar to a pending proposal in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn other highlights, he said the plan would:\n\nRequire that recipients who abuse the emergency room or fail to use preventive services pay 1 percent of their income in premiums.\n\nHelp people who make between the poverty level and 138 percent of the poverty level buy private insurance on the federally run marketplace, HealthCare.gov.\n\nRequire hospitals to be more transparent about the price of their services.\n\nMissouri would need a federal waiver of Medicaid rules to implement the Medicaid changes.\n\nTorpey headed an interim committee that held hearings around the state last summer to seek public opinions about Medicaid.\n\nCo-sponsoring Torpey\u2019s bill is Rep.
