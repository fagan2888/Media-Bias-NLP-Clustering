Beyond 10% and the exchanges will provide premium and cost-sharing subsidies on a temporary basis while additional documentation is requested from the applicant.\n\nHHS contracted with Equifax to use its database of 54 million payroll records \u2014 out of about 140 million U.S. jobs \u2014 for instant verification. When Equifax data aren\u2019t available, states will have leeway in ObamaCare\u2019s first year to seek further documents from only \u201ca statistically significant sample.\u201d For other enrollees, stated income can be taken at face value.\n\nTo clarify, the ObamaCare exchanges will only investigate income disparities of more than 10% if income appears to be understated.\n\nStated income that is higher than tax records show \u201cwould generally be accepted without further verification,\u201d HHS said.\n\nOfficially, households with income below 100% of the poverty level aren\u2019t eligible for exchange subsidies. They were supposed to all go to Medicaid \u2014 until the Supreme Court ruled that the expansion of Medicaid must be voluntary.\n\nNow in states that declined to expand Medicaid, these individuals \u2014 often childless adults \u2014 are mostly out of luck. (Arkansas, which got a special HHS waiver Friday, is an exception.) Yet the income-verification procedures mean these poor individuals should be able to sign up and receive exchange subsidies without a hitch.\n\nWon\u2019t Have To Repay\n\nIf the IRS subsequently finds out that households understated income, any excess premium subsidies can be taken out of federal income tax refunds. On the other hand, any excess subsidies paid out to reduce cost-sharing (deductibles and copays) would be water under the bridge. Households that overstate income would likely be in the clear for both premium and cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nAs Boston University health economist Austin Frakt wrote, \u201cIt is hard to imagine the IRS auditing lots of poor people because they are claiming their incomes are too high.\u201d\n\nFamilies Get 1-Year Break\n\nAnother group expected to be left in the lurch despite the coverage expansion also could get a big ObamaCare break this year \u2014 if they shade the truth.\n\nObamaCare\u2019s family penalty \u2014 some call it the law\u2019s family glitch \u2014 is among its most criticized features.\n\nIf one spouse is offered individual coverage by an employer that meets the law\u2019s affordability test of 9.5% of household income, then the other spouse and their children are ineligible for ObamaCare subsidies.\n\nLacking such support, families could be forced to spend an un tenable share of income on health coverage (though the children might be eligible for CHIP).\n\nBut for now, because the White House delayed employer reporting requirements for a year, the exchanges may be clueless as to whether a worker is offered affordable coverage on the job.\n\nAnd once coverage is approved, there is no prospect of an audit that would require repayment of premium subsidies, much less cost-sharing support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For some individuals and families signing up for ObamaCare, a little fudging can make a big difference in their bank accounts.
