Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. POLITICO Pro CBO pick Hall a Bush vet, government skeptic\n\nRepublicans on Friday named Keith Hall head of the Congressional Budget Office, installing a conservative Bush administration economist atop an agency charged with determining how much lawmakers\u2019 bills would cost.\n\nHall, who served on George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, is a critic of the Affordable Care Act who shares Republican skepticism of government spending and regulation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe has criticized proposals to raise the minimum wage, expand regulation and boost anti-poverty programs.\n\nHall will replace Doug Elmendorf, a Democratic appointee who has run the office since 2009.\n\nThe pick is the latest bid by Republicans to revamp Congress\u2019 budgeting process since they took control of the Senate. Last month, House Republicans formally adopted controversial budgeting rules known as \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d that aim to account for the macroeconomic effects of legislation. Democrats call it fuzzy math.\n\nThough many Republicans hope the combination of a new CBO director and the dynamic scoring rules, will make it much easier to cut taxes, revenue estimates are actually the job of a different office: The Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThe twin budget offices divvy up the scorekeeping responsibilities, with JCT focused on taxes and CBO handling spending, deficits and economic forecasts.\n\nHall will handle proposals to rewrite President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, as well as those to revamp the nation\u2019s immigration laws, among other issues. Many Republicans were unhappy with the agency\u2019s analyses of Obamacare under Elmendorf and are eager for a new director to declare a repeal of the law would boost the economy.\n\n\u201cKeith Hall will bring an impressive level of economic expertise and experience to the Congressional Budget Office,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, in a statement. \u201cHis vast understanding of economic and labor market policy will be invaluable to the work of CBO.\u201d\n\nDemocrats gave Hall a chilly welcome.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, and the ranking member on the Budget Committee, called him outside the mainstream.\n\n\u201cHis opposition to increasing the minimum wage and his resistance to sound strategies for eliminating poverty place him outside the mainstream,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThat said, I look forward to continuing the important, 40-year tradition of independent and objective budget analysis at the CBO.\u201d\n\nHis counterpart in the House, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, offered little more than congratulations.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, Congress relies on CBO for nonpartisan, unbiased economic and budgetary analysis,\u201d said the Maryland Democrat. \u201cI hope that Director Hall will continue that tradition.\u201d\n\nDemocrats pointed to a 2013 op-ed Hall wrote for the Hill in which he criticized Obamacare as well as proposals to raise the minimum wage.\n\nThe health care law would depress labor participation, while increasing the minimum age would result in fewer people being hired, Hall wrote \u2014 findings CBO actually made under Elmendorf to the disappointment of Democrats.\n\n\u201cPolicies that either raise the cost of hiring or reduce the incentive for work are counterproductive to fostering employment,\u201d Hall wrote. \u201cGoing forward, our economic policies must focus on avoiding and correcting such counterproductive policies.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized efforts to combat joblessness through increased government spending, more generally.\n\n\u201cThrowing more government dollars at this problem won\u2019t solve it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told the Senate Budget Committee in 2014 that \u201cwhile new regulation may be important, they raise the cost of production and therefore the cost of hiring.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hardly uncommon for CBO chiefs to come into the job with a record of opinions on various public policy issues, said Alice Rivlin, the agency\u2019s first and longest-serving director.\n\n\u201cThat was true of me, and it was certainly true of, I think, almost everybody who\u2019s served in the job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very demanding job because you have to put your own opinions aside and do solid analysis that isn\u2019t biased, and I hope he can do that.\u201d\n\nHall, who will be just the ninth CBO director in its 40-year history, was also previously head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and chief economist at the Commerce Department. and a fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. His GMU biography lists labor markets and labor market policy as well as economic data as his primary interests.\n\nHe has a Ph.D. in economics from Purdue University.\n\nHall will begin work on April 1, Price said, with Elmendorf remaining in office until then. Hall\u2019s four-year term runs through 2018.\n\nRepublicans had been split over whether to reappoint Elmendorf, who was named to the job by Democrats. Some prominent Republicans economists such as Greg Mankiw and Alan Viard had urged their colleagues to retain him, calling him a fair broker. Others led by Grover Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform argued that Republicans ought to install their own person in the office.\n\nRepublicans also interviewed Harvard University health care economist Katherine Baicker and former FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, an economist, for the job.\n\nCBO directors are chosen jointly by the heads of the House and Senate Budget Committees, with the Speaker and Senate\u2019s president pro tempore \u2014 its longest serving member of the majority party, who is Sen. Orrin Hatch \u2014 formally making the appointment.
