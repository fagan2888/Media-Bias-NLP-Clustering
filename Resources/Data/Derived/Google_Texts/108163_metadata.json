The CBO\u2019s most recent calculations estimate that in 2023, a decade after the implementation of Obamacare, there will still be over 30 million people uninsured \u2014 or about the population of Canada.

Britain\u2019s National Health Service serves a population less than a fifth the size of America\u2019s and is the third-largest employer on the planet after the Indian National Railways and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, the last of which is now largely funded by American taxpayers through interest payment on federal debt. A single-payer U.S. system would be bigger than Britain\u2019s NHS, India\u2019s railways, and China\u2019s army combined, at least in its bureaucracy. So, as in banking and housing and college tuition and so many other areas of endeavor, Washington is engaging in a kind of under-the-counter nationalization, in which the husk of a nominally private industry is conscripted to enforce government rules \u2014 and ruthlessly so, as Michelle Malkin and many others have discovered.\n\nObama\u2019s pointless, traceless super-spending is now (as they used to say after 9/11) \u201cthe new normal.\u201d Nancy Pelosi assured the nation last weekend that everything that can be cut has been cut and there are no more cuts to be made. And the disturbing thing is that, as a matter of practical politics, she may well be right. Many people still take my correspondent\u2019s view: If you have old money well managed, you can afford to be stupid \u2014 or afford the government\u2019s stupidity on your behalf. If you\u2019re a social-activist celebrity getting $20 million per movie, you can afford the government\u2019s stupidity.

Obamacare is something new in American life: the creation of a massive bureaucracy charged with downsizing you \u2014 to a world of fewer doctors, higher premiums, lousier care, more debt, fewer jobs, smaller houses, smaller cars, smaller, fewer, less; a world where worse is the new normal. Would Americans, hitherto the most buoyant and expansive of people, really consent to live such shrunken lives? If so, mid-20th-century America and its assumptions of generational progress will be as lost to us as the Great Ziggurat of Ur was to 19th-century Mesopotamian date farmers.\n\nGeorge Orwell, after attending a meeting of impoverished but passive miners, remarked sadly that \u201cthere is no turbulence left in England.\u201d The Democrats, and much of the Republican establishment, have made a bet that there is no turbulence left in America, and the citizenry will stand mute before Obamacare\u2019s wrecking ball.

Does it achieve its other goal of \u201ccontaining costs,\u201d already higher than anywhere else? No. Avik Roy reports in Forbes that Obamacare will increase individual-market premiums by 62 percent for women, 99 percent for men. In America, \u201cinsuring\u201d against disaster now costs more than you\u2019d pay in most countries for disaster.#page#\u00a0\n\nNo one has ever before attempted to devise a uniform health system for 300 million people \u2014 for the very good reason that it probably can\u2019t be done. Britain\u2019s National Health Service serves a population less than a fifth the size of America\u2019s and is the third-largest employer on the planet after the Indian National Railways and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, the last of which is now largely funded by American taxpayers through interest payment on federal debt. A single-payer U.S. system would be bigger than Britain\u2019s NHS, India\u2019s railways, and China\u2019s army combined, at least in its bureaucracy. So, as in banking and housing and college tuition and so many other areas of endeavor, Washington is engaging in a kind of under-the-counter nationalization, in which the husk of a nominally private industry is conscripted to enforce government rules \u2014 and ruthlessly so, as Michelle Malkin and many others have discovered.#ad#\n\nObama\u2019s pointless, traceless super-spending is now (as they used to say after 9/11) \u201cthe new normal.\u201d Nancy Pelosi assured the nation last weekend that everything that can be cut has been cut and there are no more cuts to be made. And the disturbing thing is that, as a matter of practical politics, she may well be right. Many people still take my correspondent\u2019s view: If you have old money well managed, you can afford to be stupid \u2014 or afford the government\u2019s stupidity on your behalf. If you\u2019re a social-activist celebrity getting $20 million per movie, you can afford the government\u2019s stupidity. If you\u2019re a tenured professor or a unionized bureaucrat whose benefits were chiseled in stone two generations ago, you can afford it. If you\u2019ve got a wind farm and you\u2019re living large on government \u201cgreen energy\u201d investments, you can afford it. If you\u2019ve got the contract for signing up Obamaphone recipients, you can afford it.\n\nBut out there beyond the islands of privilege most Americans don\u2019t have the same comfortably padded margin for error, and they\u2019re hunkering down. Obamacare is something new in American life: the creation of a massive bureaucracy charged with downsizing you \u2014 to a world of fewer doctors, higher premiums, lousier care, more debt, fewer jobs, smaller houses, smaller cars, smaller, fewer, less; a world where worse is the new normal. Would Americans, hitherto the most buoyant and expansive of people, really consent to live such shrunken lives? If so, mid-20th-century America and its assumptions of generational progress will be as lost to us as the Great Ziggurat of Ur was to 19th-century Mesopotamian date farmers.\n\nGeorge Orwell, after attending a meeting of impoverished but passive miners, remarked sadly that \u201cthere is no turbulence left in England.\u201d The Democrats, and much of the Republican establishment, have made a bet that there is no turbulence left in America, and the citizenry will stand mute before Obamacare\u2019s wrecking ball. Unless they\u2019re willing to accept a worse life for their children and grandchildren, middle-class Americans need to prove them wrong.\n\n\u2014 Mark Steyn, a National Review columnist, is the author of\u00a0After America: Get Ready for Armageddon. \u00a9 2013 Mark Steyn", "card": "summary", "title": "Worse Is the New Normal, by Mark Steyn, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Fri, 2013-09-27 17:45", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Worse Is the New Normal", "keywords": "Mark Steyn", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Worse Is the New Normal, Mark Steyn, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Mark Steyn, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Mark Steyn, a National Review columnist, is the author of After America: Get Ready for Armageddon.\nTo take only the most obvious example, President Obama has added six-and-a-half trillion bucks to the national debt, and has nothing to show for it.\nBritain\u2019s National Health Service serves a population less than a fifth the size of America\u2019s and is the third-largest employer on the planet after the Indian National Railways and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, the last of which is now largely funded by American taxpayers through interest payment on federal debt.\nUnless they\u2019re willing to accept a worse life for their children and grandchildren, middle-class Americans need to prove them wrong.\nIf you\u2019ve got a wind farm and you\u2019re living large on government \u201cgreen energy\u201d investments, you can afford it."}
