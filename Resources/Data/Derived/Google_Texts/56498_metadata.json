The baby needed a bath and bed, dinner needed made, etc.\u201d\n\n\"I really did panic because of all those things I could lose, that would be it. That'd be the only thing I cared about,\" Courtney said.\n\nEventually, the Barkers discovered that their camera went missing. It\u2019s not an unusual event, considering their close proximity to busy restaurants nearby. They\u2019re used to plenty of foot traffic on their block, in the 1800th block of Millington -- not far from 18th and Main.\n\nYet, Courtney said the loss of their camera is one they cannot replace. It has the only pictures of their baby, Blake. Other than a handful of pictures they\u2019ve already shared on social media, Courtney said it has infinite value.\n\n\u201cOh my heart just sank. I rushed outside but I was too late. It was gone,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cWe just celebrated his first birthday last week. Those and so many more cherished pictures and videos, gone.\u201d\n\nREWARD FOR RETURN OF PICTURES\n\nCourtney said she\u2019s hoping to get the memory card safely returned. Friends and businesses have rallied behind the family, offering a reward for her pictures. The reward includes at least $100 and a brand new in box TV stand\u2014valued at nearly $250.\n\nThe family also got an unexpected surprise at their front door this week.\n\n\"Somebody stopped by and had bought me a brand new camera,\" Courtney said. \"And they said 'I know I can't replace what was lost, but you should be able to take pictures of your baby.'\"\n\n\"Of all those things I could lose, that would be it. That'd be the only thing I cared about.\"A Winfield mom makes a...
