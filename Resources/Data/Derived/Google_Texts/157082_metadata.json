Yet in the vast majority of states in the US, tampons and pads are subject to sales tax. Now, two members of California\u2019s state assembly are trying to change that.\n\nAs the New York Times reported earlier this week, most states exempt necessities \u2014 like food and prescription drugs \u2014 from sales tax. But the definition of \u201cnecessity\u201d depends greatly on who you ask. In Cosmopolitan last fall, Prachi Gupta astutely noted that \u201cYes, in many states, there are even sales taxes on essential items like toilet paper and incontinence pads (some legislators are tackling that too). So no, there isn\u2019t some explicit anti-tampon conspiracy. But that should not detract from the argument for states to lift taxes from feminine hygiene products.\u201d And assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, who announced the introduction of the California bill to exempt tampons and pads from sales tax earlier this week, said in a statement that \u201cWomen have no choice but to buy these products, so the economic effect is only felt by women and women of color are particularly hard hit by this tax. You can\u2019t just ignore your period, it\u2019s not like you can just ignore the constant flow.\u201d\n\nBut Joseph Henchman of the conservative think tank the Tax Foundation thinks otherwise, telling the New York Times that \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if necessities weren\u2019t taxed, but necessity is subjective.\u201d He argues that removing taxes from items like tampons drives up taxes on consumer goods, \u201cworsening the budget crises that arise in recessions.\u201d And writing in the Ventura Star, Dan Walters, a person who likely has never had a period, muses, \u201cOne wonders how far we are willing to take the notion.\u201d He says that \u201cGarcia decries \u2018being taxed for being women,\u2019 but all of us are being taxed for being humans and needing certain necessities of modern life. The electricity and natural gas that keep us alive and functioning are taxed, for example, as are the houses, apartments, trailers and other dwellings we occupy. Is a home any less a necessity than a tampon?\u201d (And if you think it\u2019s contentious to suggest that feminine hygiene products not be taxed, you can imagine what happens when someone says they should be free. When writer Jessica Valenti did just that last year in the Guardian, making \u201cthe case for free tampons,\u201d she was met with a deluge of online abuse for \u201ctrying to score free tampons.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "California lawmakers are trying to classify period supplies properly \u2014 as a necessity that should be tax-exempt VIDEO", "title": "Time to end the tampon tax: Sales tax on feminine hygiene products unfairly penalize women", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "California lawmakers are trying to classify period supplies properly \u2014 as a necessity that should be tax-exempt VIDEO", "title": "Time to end the tampon tax: Sales tax on feminine hygiene products unfairly penalize women", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/08/time_to_end_the_tampon_tax_sales_tax_on_feminine_hygiene_products_unfairly_penalize_women/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/tampon2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California lawmakers are trying to classify period supplies properly \u2014 as a necessity that should be tax-exempt VIDEO", "title": "Time to end the tampon tax: Sales tax on feminine hygiene products unfairly penalize women", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/tampon2.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, California, menstruation, tampon tax, tampons, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Yet in the vast majority of states in the US, tampons and pads are subject to sales tax.\nAs the New York Times reported earlier this week, most states exempt necessities \u2014 like food and prescription drugs \u2014 from sales tax.\nTopics: aol_on, California, menstruation, tampon tax, tampons, Video, Life NewsIf you are or know women, you know that menstruation is for most not an optional thing.\nIn Cosmopolitan last fall, Prachi Gupta astutely noted that \u201cYes, in many states, there are even sales taxes on essential items like toilet paper and incontinence pads (some legislators are tackling that too).\nIs a home any less a necessity than a tampon?\u201d (And if you think it\u2019s contentious to suggest that feminine hygiene products not be taxed, you can imagine what happens when someone says they should be free."}
