You think there\u2019s something wrong with your voice all the time. \u2026 Women are shamed for having desire for anything \u2014 for food, for sex, for anything. We\u2019re asked to only be the object for other people\u2019s desire. There\u2019s nothing that directing is about more than desire. It\u2019s like, \u201cI want to see this. I want to see it with this person. I want to change it. I want to change it again.\u201d\n\nSoloway\u2019s creation, the Golden Globe and Emmy-winning \u201cTransparent,\u201d is a gorgeous exploration of gender, family and sexuality, hinging around the story of the Pfefferman family, in Los Angeles. The second season of \u201cTransparent,\u201d which was released en masse at midnight Thursday night, is easily one of the best shows of the year. But more than that, it is also a five-hour experiment in the female gaze, that visionary perspective that barely exists at all. For all that the phrase is used as the theoretical opposite of the male gaze, it\u2019s not clear what it would really look like. Melissa Silverstein (who quotes the same speech from Soloway that I just did) at Indiewire posits, \u201c I don\u2019t feel that the female gaze is simply the reverse of the male gaze,\u201d adding, \u201cThe female gaze to me is not about pleasure or even power; it is about presence. The female gaze is about women storytellers planting their feet down and shouting with a camera: I AM HERE. I AM PRESENT. I MATTER.\u201d There is furthermore a question of equality. Jenna Wortham, in the New York Times, finds artists who challenge the accepted \u201cinoffensive\u201d norms of platforms like Instagram, with either arty nude photo shoots or stains from menstrual blood. And as actress Kat Dennings memorably observed in W Magazine, the MPAA rates films as more \u201cobscene\u201d if they depict a woman orgasming.\n\nWhat is particularly thrilling about \u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d second season is how it serves as a canvas for Soloway\u2019s broadest imaginings on a feminist and/or progressive process of filmmaking\u2014from casting to script, from breaking stories to cinematography\u2014while also being incredibly, beautifully well done. Ideology and creative vision do not always create brilliant results, when mixed. In Soloway\u2019s hands, the ideology and the vision inform and enhance each other. \u201cTransparent\u201d is not didactic, but it does not pander, either; relatedly, it is both about the most intimate dealings between humans and also the grand ideas that move them. \u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d second season is a technical tour de force, and one that begins to forge what a cinematic female gaze would look and feel like. The result is not quite as purely id as something like \u201cMagic Mike XXL\u201d (which in addition to being over-the-top is also heteronormative), and not quite as inaccessible as a Marina Abramovi\u0107 show (which are generally in just one art gallery at a time). It\u2019s about more than just flipping the camera around, and about more than including female voices, stories and characters.\n\nAs Ariel Levy writes in the New Yorker, Soloway recruited writers from well outside the Hollywood industrial-complex for Season 2, and gave them a scriptwriting bootcamp to put them in shape. She called at least some of this mission \u201ctransfirmative action,\u201d in an attempt to incorporate a \u201ctrans-feminine perspective.\u201d It\u2019s brought the show its first trans writer, Our Lady J, and another trans actor, Hari Nef. Only one writer has worked on a show before, besides Soloway herself, and that\u2019s Bridget Bedard, previously of \u201cMad Men.\u201d In the terrifically mechanized world of television writing, especially for comedy\u2014especially for a network\u2019s flagship show, as \u201cTransparent\u201d has become\u2014this is unheard of; it\u2019s even more out there than the auteur model adopted frequently by HBO, where one writer churns out every script, because at least that has a basis in film.\n\nAnd Soloway\u2019s process for working with her crew is similarly idiosyncratic. Levy writes:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taught that the camera is male,\u201d she said, turning to walk uphill, backward, to tone a different part of her legs. \u201cBut I\u2019m not forcing everybody to fulfill something in my head and \u2018Get it right\u2014now get it more right.\u2019 \u201d Directing with \u201cthe female gaze,\u201d she asserted, is about creating the conditions for inspiration to flourish, and then \u201cdiscerning-receiving.\u201d\n\nEmmy winner Jeffrey Tambor affirmed this sentiment to Levy. \u201cI have never experienced such freedom as an actor before in my life. Often, an actor will walk on a set and do the correct take, the expected take. Then sometimes the director will say, O.K., do one for yourself. That last take, that\u2019s our starting point.\u201d\n\nBeyond process, \u201cTransparent\u201d also advances a type of storytelling that doesn\u2019t quite follow narrative convention. The second season offers a circularity that confounds the basic narrative arc, that thing that generally tracks from problem to climax to resolution. Primarily, this is through the show\u2019s sudden, brilliant, historical framing\u2014a semi-real, semi-imagined layer of history that the main characters never quite see clearly, but one that sits on top of and at times even infiltrates the present day. \u201cKina Hora,\u201d the premiere, and \u201cMan on the Land,\u201d episode 9, are both standout moments of the year in television for me, and it\u2019s because the characters in this bubble of 1933 Berlin somehow leach into Ali Pfefferman (Gaby Hoffman)\u2019s lived experience. Michaela Watkins, who plays the disapproving mother, shuffles past Ali and stares suspiciously after her; then Ali looks down and sees ugly shoes with bells on her own feet, shoes that she read might have been used by some societies to stigmatize and oppress Jewish women, in particular. It\u2019s extraordinarily moving; Soloway uses the same music cue for the end of both episodes, suggesting a circularity of not just the time in the show but even the season we\u2019re watching. In the finale, Maura visits her mother for the first time since her transition, and we are brought back to her painful birth, where her father was convinced they\u2019d have a girl, and the doctors saw it differently. If you hadn\u2019t put it together before, you will by the final scene\u2014the innocent young girl in 1933, whose brother transitioned into a sister, becomes the silent, embittered woman in 2015, who can barely keep her attention on her surroundings. Things come full circle, but also, things are a circle. Soloway told the New Yorker that \u201cthe untrustworthy vagina\u201d is \u201cdiscerning-receiving\u201d; in \u201cTransparent,\u201d time is, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new season of Jill Soloway's Amazon series is both incredibly beautiful and steeped in its feminist theory", "title": "This is what the female gaze looks like: \u201cTransparent\u201d returns for a thrilling second season", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The new season of Jill Soloway's Amazon series is both incredibly beautiful and steeped in its feminist theory", "title": "This is what the female gaze looks like: \u201cTransparent\u201d returns for a thrilling second season", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/13/this_is_what_the_female_gaze_looks_like_transparent_returns_for_a_thrilling_second_season/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/transparent4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new season of Jill Soloway's Amazon series is both incredibly beautiful and steeped in its feminist theory", "title": "This is what the female gaze looks like: \u201cTransparent\u201d returns for a thrilling second season", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/transparent4.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, amazon studios, Camille Paglia, Douglas Rushkoff, female gaze, Jill Soloway, Male Gaze, transparent, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: amazon, amazon studios, Camille Paglia, Douglas Rushkoff, female gaze, Jill Soloway, Male Gaze, transparent, TV, Entertainment News[Note: This review includes plot details for the entire season of \u201cTransparent,\u201d now streaming on Amazon Prime.]\n\u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d second season is a technical tour de force, and one that begins to forge what a cinematic female gaze would look and feel like.\nBut more than that, it is also a five-hour experiment in the female gaze, that visionary perspective that barely exists at all.\nThe second season of \u201cTransparent,\u201d which was released en masse at midnight Thursday night, is easily one of the best shows of the year.\nThe second season offers a circularity that confounds the basic narrative arc, that thing that generally tracks from problem to climax to resolution."}
