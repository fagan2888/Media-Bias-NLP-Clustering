Democrats question capitalism itself, saying Wall Street and the superrich are starving the middle class of hope.\n\nThe right has portrayed the southern border as something like a zombie movie, swarming with murderous Mexicans. On the left, illegal immigrants look like hard workers who deserve a path to citizenship.\n\nDEBATE CHART: Breaking down the Republican debate\n\nOne of the most striking takeaways from the first two Republican debates and Tuesday's first Democratic debate is that the two parties do not just disagree on solutions to domestic and foreign policy issues \u2014 they do not even agree on what the issues are. Offering radically different assessments of the challenges people face, and diametrically opposing policy agendas, the candidates could have been campaigning on different continents.\n\nHillary Clinton, a Democrat, described gun violence as a scourge that required tough government actions, like background checks and new restrictions on purchases. Jeb Bush, a Republican, framed gun violence as resulting from fractured families and weak sentencing laws. Democrats talked about criminal justice reform; Republicans dwelled on what they called the criminalization of a Christian county clerk who took a stand against same-sex marriage.\n\n\"The parties are definitely not talking about the same United States, which is really nuts, given that voters are so desperate for big solutions that will bring the nation together,\" said Christopher Durang, a playwright who specializes in political absurdism and social satire. \"You have Carly Fiorina still insisting that videos show babies being carved up, even though this has been disproved. You have the Democrats suggesting that people are doing well but could do better, when a lot of people feel they aren't doing well at all. You just wonder what country all these candidates live in.\"\n\nDEBATE CHART: Breaking down the Democratic debate\n\nThe jumble of policy differences and priorities reflects the lack of a single dominant issue galvanizing both parties in the 2016 race. The economy was the overriding issue in the presidential elections of 1992, 2008 and 2012, which Democrats won. The Iraq war was the fulcrum in 2004, when George W. Bush was re-elected. The 1996 and 2000 campaigns were largely referendums on Bill Clinton; a strengthening economy and a stolid Republican opponent helped him win re-election, while his vice president, Al Gore, struggled in 2000 to embrace Clinton's economic record but disown the scandal that threatened his presidency.\n\nThis time around, there is a political vacuum to fill. With no dominant issue to run on or against, and no incumbent seeking re-election, the candidates must first persuade voters to accept their diagnoses before selling them on their prescriptions.\n\nOn foreign policy, for instance, Republican contenders portray the United States as a weakling in the eyes of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin (although they don't have clear strategies for dealing with him beyond tough talk or the silent treatment). Democrats see Putin as overcompensating, exerting military might in Syria to save face for Russia's poor economy and misadventures elsewhere. (But they, too, are torn: Clinton said she would confront him like a bully; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont would wait for Russians to grow angry at Putin over their battlefield casualties.)\n\n\"Given that the Republicans are the party out of power and lack a single major issue, they are casting around for domestic problems and global threats to energize their voters and build enough support to win back the White House,\" said Linda L. Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth who studies political leadership.\n\nThis challenge is exacerbated by the size of the Republican field, with 15 candidates, she said.\n\n\"With so many people, voters can't easily make sense of the complicated political world,\" Fowler said. \"So the Republicans try to stand out with sharply worded sound bites because those are more memorable \u0097 even if they create more of a divide between candidates and parties.\"\n\nThe tone of the two parties' candidates is sharply at odds, too. Democrats on Tuesday were more optimistic, talking of clean energy and debt-free public college, while expressing impatience with the pace of progress on raising the minimum wage and changing campaign finance rules.\n\nRepublicans, who barely touched on those issues in their debates Aug. 6 and Sept. 16, sounded dark notes about gay marriage, China, the Iranian nuclear deal and the \"complete disaster\" that is the Affordable Care Act. And they were more likely than the Democrats to point fingers at one another \u2014 and to attack their leading candidate, Donald Trump \u2014 while finding fault with President Barack Obama and his policies.\n\n\"The Democrats are looking ahead toward tomorrow and trying to determine what we should do, while the Republicans are looking at today and talking about what's wrong,\" said Ben Barnes, a Texas Democrat and major party donor. \"There are understandable reasons for both. But the debates give off a feeling of deep division that isn't healthy for a strong country.\"\n\nFrank Luntz, a Republican strategist who conducted focus groups during the recent debates, said his participants, from both parties, shared \"a concurrent feeling of helplessness and the desire to have an impact on the presidential race and the country's future.\" He said Republicans were more critical of one another.\n\n\"As of now the Democrats are set to emerge from the primaries far more unified,\" Luntz said. \"If anything, the Democratic debate should be a wake-up call to Republicans to pay attention to just how divisive and negative they are acting.\"\n\nTony Kushner, whose screenplay about an earlier American divide earned him an Oscar nomination for the 2012 film Lincoln, said the bellicose language and anti-establishment themes at the Republican debates \u2014 that government is bad and elected officials are suspect \u2014 put the country \"in a very perilous place,\" because the candidates appeared to be abandoning policymaking and governing.\n\n\"Lincoln was effective in explaining war and sacrifice to Americans because of the lawyerly structure of his thought, the pithiness and clarity and wit and measured cadences of his pronouncements, and the lack of any kind of inflammatory rhetoric,\" Kushner said.\n\n\"Issues facing the country are always complicated,\" he added, \"but talking about them calmly and clearly is a crucial part of leadership.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "In one portrait of the nation put forward at the recent Republican presidential debates, America's moral core is rotting, its citizens tolerating rampant abortions and even the dissection of fetuses for profit.", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"url": "http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/its-clear-that-democrats-and-republicans-dont-even-agree-on-what-the/2250084", "image": {"width": 746, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2015/10/0436628935_16104605_8col.jpg", "height": 497}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "In one portrait of the nation put forward at the recent Republican presidential debates, America's moral core is rotting, its citizens tolerating rampant abortions and even the dissection of fetuses for profit.", "title": "It's clear that Democrats and Republicans don't even agree on what the issues are"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TB_Times", "image": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2015/10/0436628935_16104605_8col.jpg", "description": "In one portrait of the nation put forward at the recent Republican presidential debates, America's moral core is rotting, its citizens tolerating rampant abortions and even the dissection of fetuses", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "It's clear that Democrats and Republicans don't even agree"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#115220", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=988277045", "msapplication-TileImage": "/iwov-resources/images/ie10TBTpin.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "default", "keywords": "News,Politics,State Roundup,breaking-news,top-news,news-nav,app-news,nation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Politics, State Roundup, breaking-news, top-news, news-nav, app-news, nation"}, "article_summary": "Republican candidates say capitalism is buckling under high taxes, regulations and social welfare programs.\nIt's clear that Democrats and Republicans don't even agree on what the issues areIn one portrait of the nation put forward at the recent Republican presidential debates, America's moral core is rotting, its citizens tolerating rampant abortions and even the dissection of fetuses for profit.\nThe tone of the two parties' candidates is sharply at odds, too.\nDemocrats talked about criminal justice reform; Republicans dwelled on what they called the criminalization of a Christian county clerk who took a stand against same-sex marriage.\n\"Issues facing the country are always complicated,\" he added, \"but talking about them calmly and clearly is a crucial part of leadership.\""}
