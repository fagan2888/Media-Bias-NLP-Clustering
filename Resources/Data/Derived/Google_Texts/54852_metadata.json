Protesters shared pictures and tweeted about visiting four different Wal-Mart locations as well as a Target in Brentwood.\n\nProtesters walked through aisles of the busy stores, shouting \u201cHand up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d and \u201cShut it down!\u201d Other protesters tried to keep shoppers away from Wal-Mart locations, singing \u201cBack away from the Walmart, back away.\u201d\n\nThough police were called to at least one location and ordered the protesters to move, there were no immediate reports of arrests.\n\nDespite the Black Friday protests, unrest has been down in the wake of the Michael Brown verdict. Protesters angry that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson was not indicted for Brown\u2019s August shooting death sparked rioting for three consecutive days in Ferguson, but mostly remained home on Thanksgiving.\n\nTensions in the St. Louis suburb had appeared to have eased after two nights of violence and looting. National Guard troops patrolled the city for the fourth consecutive night, but the Thanksgiving holiday appeared to keep protesters in their homes. There were no reports of demonstrations in the St. Louis suburb, and for the first night since the Michael Brown verdict was announced, there appeared to be no arrests made.\n\nDemonstrations were also down nationwide. Despite threats of protests at the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, there were no major major disturbances. Police did arrest at least seven people during the event.\n\nProtesters arrested in California had mostly been released by Thanksgiving as well. Close to 500 people were arrested across the state as protests shut down highways in major cities, but the close to 90 remaining protesters still in jail in Los Angeles were released on Thursday in time for Thanksgiving.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ferguson protesters turned their attention to Black Friday shopping locations, disrupting stores around St. Louis on the busiest shopping day of the year.
