But they don\u2019t usually end up with death threats and claims of \u201cmurdered democracy.\u201d Jon Ralston, the go-to political reporter in Nevada, writes of the angry clash between Sanders and Clinton supporters that took place at the Nevada Democratic Convention in Las Vegas. He wonders if what happened in Vegas could spill over into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nInner turmoil\n\nMore problems for Democrats: It\u2019s labor vs. labor and labor vs. environmentalists as key Democratic activists clash in an attempt to raise $50 million for voter turnout in an effort to beat Donald Trump. Via The New York Times.\n\nPunting down\n\nThis is what an eight-justice Supreme Court looks like: Making what The Atlantic calls a \u201cnonsensical\u201d ruling on religious non-profits\u2019 challenge to the Obamacare contraceptive mandate.\n\nKoch World\n\nThe National Review writes that in Koch World, the big \u201crealignment\u201d means less money for national politics.

Via Vox.\n\nAttack plans\n\nJonathan Chait writes in New York Magazine that the way for Clinton to attack Trump is to claim that he\u2019s a fraud. You start with his tax returns \u2014 what is he hiding? \u2014 and go from there.\n\nShowing up\n\nWill the Megyn vs. Donald hype measure up in the debut of Megyn Kelly Presents? Politico\u2019s Jack Schafer is skeptical.\n\nGlobal economy\n\nA lesson in how the global economy works (sometimes): China took thousands of jobs from Maine, but now it\u2019s eating $20 million worth of its lobsters.
