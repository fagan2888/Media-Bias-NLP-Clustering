Your head will most likely explode.\"\n\nOn the Fourth of July, Fischer posted another picture of herself holding a Bible, an AR-15 assault weapon (the type of gun used at the Sandy Hook massacre) and an American flag.\n\n\n\nFischer added the caption: \"Biggest complaint I'm getting about my #HobbyLobby pic is there's no gun, bible, or flag. Tried to make up for it.\"\n\nIn response, some Internet users compared her gun picture to a very similar photo of Sherafiyah Lewthwaite, an Al-Shabaab Islamic terrorist known as the \"White Widow,\" holding a gun and the Quran.\n\nIn response, Fischer angrily tweeted on Monday: \"My new nickname is 'American Taliban' it seems. You know how I know the lefties don't really think I'm a terrorist? They hate me.\"\n\n\n\nFischer also tweeted, \"Jihad Barbie. That means they think I'm pretty, right?\" and \"I'm not a terrorist, but my husband has killed a few. #ftw.\"\n\nLast month on her blog, Fisher claimed that Obamacare had caused her family to lose access to her baby\u2019s pediatric cardiologist.\n\nHowever, as ATTP.org points out, it was actually the choice of Fisher's insurance company Cigna to raise her family's insurance rates. Also, because \"certain states and companies (West Virginia and Cigna specifically) applied for waivers that made them exempt from following the letter of the [Obamacare] law.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to RawStory.com, Fischer appeared on Fox News today where she claimed that her Bible and the AR-15 picture represented \"America\u2019s founding principles.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI expected less backlash with this than I did the first one because the picture is, like, America\u2019s founding principles,\u201d Fischer told Fox News. \u201cThat\u2019s all that\u2019s in the picture. And I really didn\u2019t think it would cause the uproar that it has.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not going to change any minds of liberals,\u201d Fischer added. \u201cAnd I accept that. I understand. Like, I\u2019m not hateful with people who don\u2019t agree with me, but I just want people to know that it\u2019s okay. Like, you\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nSources: Daily Mail, RawStory.com, ATTP.org", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Holly Fisher, a conservative Christian mom from West Virginia, has been posting pictures on Twitter in order t...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Christian Mom Says AR-15 and Bible are \u2018America\u2019s Founding Principles\u2019 (Video)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/religion/christianity/christian-mom-says-ar-15-and-bible-are-america-s-founding-principles-video", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ov-file-archive/piece/28/8/731328.0.HollyFisherGunFlagBible_featured.png", "type": "article", "description": "Holly Fisher, a conservative Christian mom from West Virginia, has been posting pictures on Twitter in order t...", "title": "Christian Mom Says AR-15 and Bible are \u2018America\u2019s Founding Principles\u2019 (Video)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-09T18:44:23+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2014-07-09T18:44:23+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 840527}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3417\"", "article_summary": "According to RawStory.com, Fischer appeared on Fox News today where she claimed that her Bible and the AR-15 picture represented \"America\u2019s founding principles.\"\nYou know how I know the lefties don't really think I'm a terrorist?\nThat means they think I'm pretty, right?\"\n\u201cI expected less backlash with this than I did the first one because the picture is, like, America\u2019s founding principles,\u201d Fischer told Fox News.\nAnd I really didn\u2019t think it would cause the uproar that it has.\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m not going to change any minds of liberals,\u201d Fischer added."}
