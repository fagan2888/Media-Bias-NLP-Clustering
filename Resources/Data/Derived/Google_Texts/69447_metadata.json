We can save about $600,000 a year in purchasing of supplies, equipment and other things. In return, we try to send our heart patients down there,\u2019\u2019 Boatright said.\n\nBoatright said the hospital facilities are still owned by Bacon County and operated by a board that includes members of the publicly appointed Bacon County Hospital Authority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still independent. We\u2019re haven\u2019t merged. We haven\u2019t sold,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn a press release, the two systems said Bacon County Hospital would have access to St. Vincent\u2019s \u201cleveraged supply and its Mission Point health analytics and Health Partners community health management resources.\u201d\n\nAs for referral of health patients, Boatright acknowledged that program has been going on for years, and in the release, Bacon County Hospital CEO Cindy Turner mentioned a couple of St. Vincent\u2019s cardiologists, Willie Bell and Joel Ferree.\n\n\u201cEmployed physicians from St. Vincent\u2019s HealthCare, doctors Bell and Ferree, have been in our community for several years now, which makes this a natural referral service for cardiac services,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nActually, Bell and Ferree have been in the area for decades working as cardiologists in Waycross and sending their patients to St. Vincent\u2019s for open heart surgery and other tertiary care.\n\nNot that it\u2019s been easy. They were among about a dozen St. Vincent\u2019s physicians who had their privileges at the Waycross hospital revoked or restricted in 2005 by Satilla Health Services, which was managing the hospital at the time. The cardiologists sued, were granted an injunction and won a court judgement in 2008.\n\nAt the time, Waycross had allied with Baptist Health in Jacksonville for cardiac services, but it is now the Mayo Health System Clinic in Waycross.\n\nBill Mayher, St. Vincent\u2019s vice president of regional development, couldn\u2019t lay out the full extent of the cooperation between the hospitals.\n\n\u201cThis is Day 1 of the affiliation. We don\u2019t have plans yet,\u2019\u2019 but both systems have ideas that will be fully explored, Mayher said.\n\nSt. Vincent\u2019s CEO Moody Chisolm said the health analytics program will help improve outcomes for the chronically ill and lower costs.\n\nThe program examines the treatment of the sickest and most frail to help educate those patients on how they can change diets or lifestyles to prevent repeated admissions to the hospital, Chisolm said.\n\nNot only will that help the patients, it will result in lower costs to the government, company insurance plans or whomever is paying the bills, he said.\n\nLike many rural hospitals, Bacon County has a need for primary care physicians and St. Vincent\u2019s will provide access to those in training in Jacksonville, Chisolm said.\n\nTurner said she was confident the alliance would help Bacon County Hospital expand clinical services in the community and help the hospital meet the \u201cchallenges that face the health care community with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSt. Vincents HealthCare is a member of Ascension Health, the country\u2019s largest Catholic, non-profit health system. It has more than 100,000 associates working in 70 general acute care hospitals.\n\nThe nonprofit Bacon County Hospital and Health is a 25-bed general, acute care hospital and provides adult and pediatric medical care, surgery and obstetrics.\n\nBoatright said Bacon County provides a lot of services that some larger hospitals don\u2019t and that he, the other board members and the management staff are dedicated to making more improvements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make the Alma hospital bigger and better,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTerry Dickson: (912) 264-0405", "article_metadata": {"description": "St. Vincent\u2019s HealthCare and Bacon County Hospital in Alma have formed a strategic alliance that the systems say will provide better health care and wellbeing for the residents in their Southeast Georgia and Northeast Florida services areas.The two hospital systems signed the agreement Friday and there\u2019s something in it for both, said Roger Boatright, chairman of the Bacon County Health Services Board.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "St. Vincent's HealthCare and Bacon County Hospital in Alma have formed a strategic alliance that the systems say will provide better health care and wellbeing for the residents in their Southeast Georgia and Northeast Florida services areas.", "title": "St. Vincent's and Bacon County hospital announce alliance", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2014-08-01/story/st-vincents-and-bacon-county-hospital-announce-alliance", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Georgia, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 617716, "publishtime": "2014-08-01T19:41:19Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0051\"", "article_summary": "Boatright said the hospital facilities are still owned by Bacon County and operated by a board that includes members of the publicly appointed Bacon County Hospital Authority.\nThe nonprofit Bacon County Hospital and Health is a 25-bed general, acute care hospital and provides adult and pediatric medical care, surgery and obstetrics.\nThe two hospital systems signed the agreement Friday and there\u2019s something in it for both, said Roger Boatright, chairman of the Bacon County Health Services Board.\nBill Mayher, St. Vincent\u2019s vice president of regional development, couldn\u2019t lay out the full extent of the cooperation between the hospitals.\nSt. Vincent\u2019s HealthCare and Bacon County Hospital in Alma have formed a strategic alliance that the systems say will provide better health care and wellbeing for the residents in their Southeast Georgia and Northeast Florida services areas."}
