Several young people were in the car. They yelled at the 15-year-old Jeremiah, taunting him.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if there was recognition or if this was a random, chance encounter between complete strangers.\n\nJeremiah yelled back.\n\nThe occupants of the car flashed gang signs.\n\nA witness saw Jeremiah also making a gang sign.\n\nThe driver of the red car spun the car around, got into the westbound lanes and drove past Jeremiah, did a U-turn and then sped down the sidewalk towards the boy.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Jeremiah did to try to get out of the way, whether he jumped or was frozen in fear.\n\nThe red car mowed him down.\n\nThe teen was snagged in the undercarriage of the car, which veered back onto East Colfax Avenue, speeding down the 4100 block of the street.\n\nPinned under the car, Jeremiah was dragged for several hundred feet.\n\nJeremiah was pronounced dead at the scene.
