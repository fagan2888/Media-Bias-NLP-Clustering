( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nSallie Overs' voice rises with emotion when she talks about the night her father's house washed away.\n\nYes, she's grieving the loss of his home of 30 years, all his possessions, the ashes of her late mother. She also feels relief that he survived Sept. 12 and 13, 2013, unhurt.\n\nBut mostly, she's angry.\n\n\"I was immediately mad the day of the flood,\" the Niwot resident said recently, six months after the raging Big Thompson River wiped away Frank Miller's home near Drake, leaving no trace.\n\n\"The whole flood day was just ridiculous for myself and my father. He wasn't notified of the dam being opened during the flood. He wasn't evacuated,\" she said.\n\nFrank Miller talks Tuesday about a map that shows where structures can be built on his property along the Big Thompson River where his home used to be that was washed away by flooding in September 2013. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"I was furious. I tried numerous times that day to get hold of the Larimer sheriff to tell them 'don't open the gates.' It's like throwing gasoline on a fire,\" Overs said.\n\n\"As you can see, I'm still distraught. This has just been awful,\" she said.\n\nOvers is one of three people who have filed tort claims against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, operators of Olympus Dam at Lake Estes.\n\nThe claimants say the bureau's actions during the record-setting rainfall of Sept. 12 and 13 exacerbated the flooding in the Big Thompson Canyon and that the government should reimburse them for their losses.\n\nClaims Denied\n\nThe federal government doesn't agree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three claims have been denied, according to Kara Lamb, the Loveland-based spokeswoman for the Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n\"We're really sympathetic to the community at large and all the people who suffered such horrible losses during the flood,\" Lamb said.\n\nBut Lake Estes and Olympus Dam never were meant for flood control, she said \u2014 the dam isn't designed for it, and the bureau isn't authorized to use it that way.\n\nThe dam, completed in 1949 as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson water-diversion project, is designed to hold water that is piped over from the headwaters of the Colorado River on the west side of the Continental Divide.\n\n\"On any given day of an average year, roughly 98 percent of the water in Lake Estes is C-BT water, Colorado River water,\" she said. Any \"native water\" that flows into the lake from the Big Thompson River just passes through, she said \u2014 the bureau releases the same amount through the dam, and it flows down the canyon.\n\nSo when the Big Thompson, which had been flowing into Lake Estes at 75 to 100 cubic feet per second before the peak of the flooding, suddenly swelled to 5,300 cfs in a 24-hour span, Lamb said the bureau did what it always does \u2014 let the water pass through.\n\n'We Had No Choice'\n\n\"We had no choice,\" she said. \"We don't have anywhere else to put that water. We have to pass it through the dam.\"\n\nLake Estes, which can hold 3,060 acre-feet of water, normally is kept 70 to 85 percent full, Lamb said. At one point during the flooding, it was at 100 percent, she said.\n\nThe highest level of release was 5,280 cfs, she said, starting about 11:30 p.m. Sept. 12 and lasting about 45 minutes.\n\nAlthough flow gauges were washed out in the canyon, water engineers have used high-water marks in the canyon to estimate that at the peak of flooding on Sept. 13, the North Fork of the Big Thompson River poured water at a rate of 18,400 cubic feet per second into the Big Thompson at Drake, and the Big Thompson peaked at 29,000 cfs below Drake, according to a report from the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the state Department of Transportation.\n\nA photograph of Frank Miller's home along the Big Thompson River that was washed away during flooding in September of last year. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nLamb said when bureau employees saw the rate at which water was flowing into Lake Estes, they shut off the flow of Colorado River water through the Alva B. Adams Tunnel at 12:30 a.m. Sept. 12.\n\nThey also tried to lessen the amount of water being released into the canyon by sending as much as possible through tunnels and canals to reservoirs such as Pinewood, Flatiron and Horsetooth. But that maximum flow was only 550 cfs, she said, and they had to reduce the amount because the canals were filling up with rain runoff.\n\nIf the bureau hadn't released all that water into the canyon, the lake could have overflowed and the dam failed \u2014 \"the absolute worst scenario,\" Lamb said.\n\nThe bureau actually did hold the water back for one brief period \u2014 from 10 to 11 a.m. Sept. 12. \"We staved off on raising the gates a little higher, simply to buy the Larimer County Sheriff's Office more time in the canyon doing evacuations,\" she said.\n\n\"We didn't dare go longer than an hour because of the rate of rise in the river that was coming into Lake Estes,\" she said.\n\nSuing the Government\n\nAn expert in tort law says it's no surprise that the government denied the claims against the Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nThomas Russell, a professor at the University of Denver's law school and a lawyer in private practice, said tort law \"tries to hold people who've acted unreasonably, accountable.\"\n\n\"But it shouldn't surprise anyone that it's very difficult to sue the federal government for neglect,\" he said.\n\n\"The old, old idea is that you couldn't sue the king; it's called sovereign immunity,\" he said. \"Now, grudgingly, the 'king' allows some lawsuits.\"\n\nBut he said the Federal Tort Claims Act, which provides for monetary payments from the government, doesn't cover negligent policies. \"You have to show that the federal government has performed an action in a negligent way,\" he said.\n\nThe claimants \"failed to show how the federal government acted unreasonably by releasing water from a dam that's supposed to release water,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm a plaintiffs' lawyer, but sometimes you have to say, there's not a claim here,\" he said.\n\nCabins Lost\n\nJoetta Toland had spent 3 \u00bd years renovating three cabins on the bank of the river just east of the mouth of the Big Thompson Canyon.\n\nAs the river roared out of the canyon those September days, it scoured away two of her cabins on West County Road 22H, an acre of her 2.4-acre property and 150 trees, she said. Just downstream, the flooding caused severe damage at Sylvan Dale Guest Ranch.\n\n\"I have a movie of one of my houses falling in, from a neighbor,\" she said.\n\nToland, who was in the process of moving out of the largest home, which survived, now lives in Centennial. She lost the income from the rental of the two cabins and had to find a different job.\n\n\"Financially, this has been devastating to me,\" she said.\n\nShe filed a claim against the bureau because \"it seems to me that the choices they made, the decisions on when and how to hold the water, were very much involved in the loss of my land.\"\n\nToland said she doesn't know what she's going to do with her property.\n\n\"I'm just trying to move on, but it does not seem fair, I'll tell you that.\"\n\n'Own Up to the Mistake They Made'\n\nFrank Miller's house washed away about midnight. In that darkest of nights, he watched it go in the beam of the headlights of his neighbor's car.\n\nLate in the afternoon of Sept. 12, Miller was on the phone with his daughter, Sallie Overs. They both heard his deck rip away from the house, and he felt the house begin to shake. Then the line went dead, and she didn't know what had happened to her 78-year-old dad.\n\n\"I didn't know if I had five seconds or five minutes or five hours to get out of there,\" Miller said. So he threw a few things in a laundry basket \u2014 \"important things like my checkbook, my guns and my cigarettes ... and my tax information\" \u2014 and fled across U.S. 34 to a neighbor's house.\n\nHe said if he'd known it would take a few more hours for his home to wash away, he might have saved a few more possessions, although he really couldn't lift anything because he'd just had cataract surgery.\n\nMiller sheltered at the home of the neighbor, who turned on the headlights every once in a while to check on Miller's house and Wendy's Cottages just downstream.\n\nSometime after midnight, they all washed away. When the river started creeping across the highway, they climbed the hillside and spent the rest of the night in a small shed above the house.\n\nThe next day, Miller was evacuated in a military helicopter along with six other residents and four dogs. He was able to call his daughter to pick him up. \"He had a tear in his eye,\" she said.\n\nNo sign remains of the house, garage and trees that were on Miller's property.\n\n\"A flood's one thing, but you would have thought a nuclear bomb went off there,\" Overs said.\n\nLast week, the county sent Miller a letter with an aerial photo of his former home, showing where structures will be allowed to be rebuilt.\n\nThe do-not-build line runs right through where his house stood.\n\nBut he wasn't hoping to rebuild, anyway.\n\n\"No. I'm almost 80 years old. I'm too old for that crap,\" he said.\n\nBut he wouldn't mind an acknowledgment of what he's gone through.\n\n\"My best case? Well, have the county or someone buy this property from me and have the Bureau of Reclamation own up to the mistake they made and give me a little settlement,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Reclamation hasn't even said they're sorry.\"\n\n'This Flood Just Won't End'\n\n\"I just wanted to get some compensation for him because that house would not have washed away if they hadn't opened the gates,\" his daughter said. \"I just couldn't believe it was denied.\"\n\nOvers' letter from the Office of the Solicitor at the U.S. Department of the Interior says she can resubmit her claim or file a lawsuit against the government if she's not satisfied with its determination.\n\nShe said she's in the process of strengthening her claim and plans to refile it.\n\n\"This flood just won't end,\" she said.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Craig Young at 970-635-3634 or cyoung@reporter-herald.com.
