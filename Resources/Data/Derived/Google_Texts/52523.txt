– A crowd of over 4,500 got its first look at the Mississippi State men’s and women’s basketball teams Friday night during Maroon Madness at Humphrey Coliseum.

Both teams were introduced to the ecstatic fan base, followed by first-year men’s coach Ben Howland and SEC Coach of the Year Vic Schaefer, who entered the arena driving a Harley.

Both teams competed in a 3-point contest, with Johnny Zuppardo edging Kayla Nevitt in the finals.

The men wowed the crowd with a dunk contest. Senior Craig Sword won with a dunk that saw him leap over 6-11 Fallou Ndoye.

Schaefer’s Bulldogs closed the night as they continued their tradition of performing a dance routine with the MSU pom squad.

Both MSU teams open the 2015-16 campaign at home Nov. 13. The women face Samford at 5:15 p.m. on SEC Network +, while the men follow at 8 against Eastern Washington on the SEC Network.
