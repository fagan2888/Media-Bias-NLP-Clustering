(Source: Northeastern Arizona Public Information System)\n\nFirefighters have gained ground against a human-caused wildfire that is burning in the Apache-Sitgreaves forest near the rural Navajo County town of Aripine in northeastern Arizona.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service said in a press release midday Tuesday the \"Phoenix Fire\" is about 30 percent contained. The flames have burned 592 acres, fire crews said. Firefighters on Monday used a bulldozer and burning operations to build a line around the fire.\n\nStrong winds and dry conditions initially helped the fire grow when it started Sunday north of Highway 260, South of Highway 277 in the Phoenix Park Wash. The fire grew to 500 acres Monday.\n\nThere are 58 firefighters from local, state and forest service units on scene. That includes 2 hand crews, 4 engines, 1 water tender, 1 bulldozer.\n\nThe Forest Service said the fire's cause is under investigation but the Navajo County Sheriff's Office says it was started by target shooting.\n\nThe wind-driven fire is burning mostly grassy fuels in the old Rodeo-Chediski burn area.\n\nThe fires momentum slowed significantly overnight allowing a bulldozer to get a line around approximately two-thirds of the Phoenix fire.\n\nThe National Weather service said there is a 20 percent chance for precipitation Tuesday along with windy conditions.\n\nAripine is near Heber-Overgaard, about an hour east of Payson.\n\nThe Navajo County Sheriff\u2019s Office said within the past 10 days residents in Navajo County have experienced three large human-caused fires.\n\nWith the absence of the El Nino, conditions are dry and the month of March is the start of the windy season.\n\nThe forest conditions are extraordinarily dry for this time of year.\n\nNavajo County officials are asking everyone in the White Mountains to use caution when using fire to burn weeds, or other material.\n\nPeople should be aware of the weather conditions as well as the dryness of the land. Sheriff Kelly \"KC\" Clark advised, \"the difference between a controlled burn and a wild fire is 30 seconds.:\n\nPhoenix fire- Lat 34.24.59 Long 110.28.12.
