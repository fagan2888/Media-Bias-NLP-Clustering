I just sent the following to Senator Sanders website:



Dear Senator Sanders:



We have the utmost respect for you and your ideas. You have added a necessary boost to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.



However, you have been outvoted by Hillary in the popular vote and delegate count notwithstanding the super-delegates.



Now is the time to exit gracefully and get behind Hillary before we all submerge into Republican Hell.



Tell your dedicated and serious supporters that they need to unify behind Hillary or everything will go down the drain, starting with a new right-wing Supreme Court justice, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, protections for the environment, etc., etc.



Dont be remembered as the Ralph Nader of this election cycle.



Go out with finesse and not with bitterness.
