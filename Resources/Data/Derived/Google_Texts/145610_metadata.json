And only 22% say they will buy an exchange plan next year.\n\nThat same week, a Reuters poll found that 56% of the uninsured oppose ObamaCare. Just 44% view it favorably. In other words, the uninsured are, if anything, more opposed to the law than are the public at large.\n\nGiven the mounting fury over millions of policy cancellations and the federal exchange website debacle, these findings garnered little public attention.\n\nBut they should.\n\nThey are evidence that, in addition to Obama\u2019s \u201ckeep your plan\u201d promise, he appears to have misled the public about the scale of the uninsured problem and ObamaCare\u2019s ability to help. In fact, there\u2019s increasing reason to believe that ObamaCare could actually swell the ranks of the uninsured next year.\n\n\u2018Underlying Moral Basis\u2019\n\nWhen President Obama was selling the Affordable Care Act back in 2009, he repeatedly claimed that the \u201cunderlying moral basis\u201d for reform was to help the uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured,\u201d he said in a June 2009 speech before the American Medical Association. Later that year at a town hall, he promised that \u201cif you\u2019re one of the nearly 46 million people who don\u2019t have health insurance, you will finally have quality, affordable options.\u201d\n\nJust this Thursday, Obama said that \u201cI\u2019m not going to walk away from 40 million people who have the chance to get health insurance for the first time.\u201d\n\nBut early indications are that the uninsured are unenthusiastic about the law meant to help them. Even those states running their own exchange websites \u2014 which generally have suffered fewer glitches than the federal Healthcare.gov site \u2014 have seen few people signing up.\n\nIn Maryland, which has 785,000 uninsured and was one of the first states to enthusiastically embrace ObamaCare, just 4,700 had enrolled as of Nov. 10, according to Avalere Health. Connecticut\u2019s exchange has enrolled only 4,100, although it has more than 340,000 uninsured. Washington, D.C., home to 63,000 uninsured, has signed up just 300 people since Oct. 1.\n\nUninsured Figure Inflated\n\nExperts have long known that the number of uninsured bandied about by reformers was misleading. But a careful look at the uninsured populations also reveals that ObamaCare may not help them much.\n\nFirst, most uninsured spells are relatively short. A Congressional Budget Office report found that 71% regain coverage they\u2019ve lost within a year, and almost half get it back in four months or less. Only 16% of those went more than two years.\n\nSuch short-term gaps will likely continue under ObamaCare, since people will still be prone to lose coverage between jobs, and can go up to three months without insurance and still avoid paying the mandate penalty.\n\nIn addition, the young and healthy are far more likely to be uninsured than any other age group. According to the Census Bureau\u2019s latest report, more than 27% of those between 19 and 34 are uninsured, compared with 16% of those 45 to 64.\n\nThese are the \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d that Obama needs to sign up for ObamaCare to keep rates from spiraling upward. But those not buying relatively cheap insurance available today aren\u2019t likely to pay more for it in the exchanges.\n\nCensus data also show that almost a quarter of the uninsured have household incomes of more than $50,000, which means that many of them won\u2019t be eligible for ObamaCare\u2019s tax subsidies.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the official number of uninsured is exaggerated.\n\nAs many as 6 million who claim to lack coverage are actually enrolled in Medicaid, and another 4 million are eligible for Medicaid but haven\u2019t enrolled, according to one analysis. And 9.5 million aren\u2019t even U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nCombined, these groups account for 42% of the 46 million said to be uninsured. And none of them will benefit from ObamaCare.\n\nThe law is expected, however, to cover many currently uninsured through Medicaid in the 25 states that agreed to expand eligibility for that program. ObamaCare tried to force every state to sharply raise the Medicaid income threshold, but the Supreme Court ruled the mandate unconstitutional.\n\nEven the White House has admitted that the 46 million figure was an exaggeration, saying at one point it was more like 30 million.\n\nObamaCare will still leave about 30 million uninsured by 2023 despite spending $1.8 trillion in subsidies, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nWhile ObamaCare may not do a very good job of covering the uninsured, it could very well increase their ranks.\n\nBy some estimates, 11 million people nationwide will have their individual policies canceled. In California alone \u2014 a state with 7 million uninsured \u2014 more than 1 million are getting cancellation notices, according to the state\u2019s insurance commissioner.\n\nAnd 40-plus million workers could find their rates leap upward because their employers had existing insurance policies canceled and had to buy more expensive ObamaCare-approved plans.\n\nIn other words, far more people could lose their current plans this year than are officially counted as uninsured. If only a fraction of these opt not to buy because of high costs \u2014 as many are telling the press they will \u2014 there could be millions more without insurance next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just 18% of the uninsured have bothered to go on an ObamaCare exchange website, according to a recent Gallup survey.
