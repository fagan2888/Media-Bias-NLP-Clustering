A better headline would have been, \u201cTax-exempt hospitals spend just as little on charity care as for-profits, study finds.\u201d The Post\u2019s Robert Gebelhoff describes a study from the University of California San Francisco, coauthored by UCSF professor Renee Y. Hsia, UCSF medical student Sidney Le, and Alameda County Medical Center resident Erica Valdovinos, that showed that the mean proportion of total operating expenses spent by nonprofit hospitals on charity care (free care for patients unable to pay) was 1.9 percent compared to 1.4 percent for for-profit hospitals.\n\nOne might debate whether 0.5 percent is a significant difference. However, an equally important finding of the study is that a third of the nonprofit hospitals spent less than 0.9 percent for charity care compared to roughly 40 percent of the for-profit hospitals. The study involved 264 California hospitals, because California is the only state that requires all hospitals, nonprofit and for-profit, to report on their provision of uncompensated care.\n\nThe public debate around charity care delivered by nonprofit hospitals often focuses on whether these institutions merit their local property tax exemptions, but Hsia, the lead author of the study, reframed the issue more appropriately: \u201cThe takeaway is not that we should not be giving tax breaks, but that there should be a little more accountability.\u201d\n\nThe real question is just how \u201cnonprofit\u201d nonprofit hospitals actually are. In the questions that legislators are raising about nonprofits, sometimes with real justification, nonprofit hospitals often stick out like sore thumbs, closely followed by nonprofit colleges and universities. The nonprofit sector has to own up to a legitimate debate about whether some\u2014or many\u2014nonprofit hospitals are not living up to mandates of service to people in need.\n\nSince the investigations of the Senate Finance Committee under Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), there have been serious questions about nonprofit hospitals. Not wanting to criticize nonprofit hospitals lest questions get raised about other kinds of nonprofits, sector leadership organizations have been reluctant to criticize rates and amounts of charity care expenditure and delivery. Times are different, however. Since the enactment and operationalization of the Affordable Care Act, alleviating many hospitals of what they would have otherwise had to spend on charity care, nonprofit hospitals should be taking a hard look at what they are doing for their communities. Actually, that\u2019s the importance of the ACA-required Community Health Needs Assessment process, but there\u2019s little evidence that CHNAs are getting the kind of community critiques that have accompanied other federally mandated needs assessments such as the housing-oriented Consolidated Plans for the HOME Investment Partnerships and CDBG programs.\n\nNonprofit hospitals and the nonprofit sector in general will not be harmed by doubling down on what nonprofit hospitals should be doing to earn their status. It\u2019s not just for them; it\u2019s for the people nonprofit hospitals should be serving.\u2014Rick Cohen", "article_metadata": {"description": "Public debate around charity care delivered by nonprofit hospitals often focuses on tax exemption, but this study reframes the issue to center accountability.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/08/07/nonprofit-hospitals-no-better-than-for-profits-on-charity-care/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "Public debate around charity care delivered by nonprofit hospitals often focuses on tax exemption, but this study reframes the issue to center accountability.", "title": "Nonprofit Hospitals No Better than For-Profits on Charity Care", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2010/10/newswire_icon21.png", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/08/07/nonprofit-hospitals-no-better-than-for-profits-on-charity-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2010/10/newswire_icon21.png", "description": "Public debate around charity care delivered by nonprofit hospitals often focuses on tax exemption, but this study reframes the issue to center accountability.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nonprofit Hospitals No Better than For-Profits on Charity Care - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/08/07/nonprofit-hospitals-no-better-than-for-profits-on-charity-care/", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Healthcare", "published_time": "2015-08-07T08:49:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy,  charity care,  nonprofit hospitals, Healthcare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce35c\"", "article_summary": "Nonprofit hospitals and the nonprofit sector in general will not be harmed by doubling down on what nonprofit hospitals should be doing to earn their status.\nIt\u2019s not just for them; it\u2019s for the people nonprofit hospitals should be serving.\u2014Rick Cohen\nSince the investigations of the Senate Finance Committee under Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), there have been serious questions about nonprofit hospitals.\nHowever, an equally important finding of the study is that a third of the nonprofit hospitals spent less than 0.9 percent for charity care compared to roughly 40 percent of the for-profit hospitals.\nAugust 4, 2015; Washington PostThe Washington Post headline reads, \u201cTax-exempt hospitals spend just as much on charity care as for-profits, study finds,\u201d but that seems a little off."}
