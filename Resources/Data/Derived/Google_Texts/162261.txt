Conservative author Brad Thor brings a thriller-novelist’s eye to the current fears sparked by reports of the Ebola outbreak in Africa and the arrival of the infection in the United States.

When he combines the news with the distrust engendered by the Obama administration’s cavalier approach to the truth – whether the issue is Obamacare, ISIS or the slaughter in Benghazi – the conclusions aren’t reassuring.

In a series of Twitter postings, Thor makes the point crystal clear. And he’s got no shortage of followers.

He starts by noting how pop culture has made Americans suspicious about government in general.

If I was a cynic, I’d be pointing 2 the fact that every zombie movie starts w/ a “don’t worry, everything is under control” press conference — Brad Thor (@BradThor) September 30, 2014

Then he gets very specific about how President Obama’s previous lies about Obamacare.

If you like your Dr. you can keep your Dr. & there’s only one case of #Ebola inside the United States & we totally have it under control… — Brad Thor (@BradThor) October 1, 2014

Yes, we totally handed out lab coats to bamboozle you re: #Obamacare, but you need to believe us now re: #Ebola pic.twitter.com/p8iO3OqK8X — Brad Thor (@BradThor) October 1, 2014

@BradThor Unlike the Dr.’s , this case will have others. He was not isolated before interning country. Public health in Texas is petty good. — Christine Smith (@mamaristine) October 1, 2014

But it’s not just the health care debacle. The Ebola scare is coming at the same time, of course, that Americans are witnessing Islamist savages beheading fellow Americans in the desert sands.

And doing it without any fear of a United States president who can’t even admit he screwed up by underestimating the threat because it didn’t fit his political agenda.

That’s a point Thor hits with biting sarcasm.

We didn’t see #ISIS coming, but we totally saw Muslim terrorists using #Ebola as a bio-weapon and have sealed our borders up super-tight! — Brad Thor (@BradThor) October 1, 2014

And his readers get it.

@TwitchyTeam This is one perfect example of why we need to be able to trust our leaders. Who can trust them when they say anything? #panic — Dennis (@drgon466) October 1, 2014

Who indeed?

Even liberals have to be asking themselves this — if they don’t admit it on MSNBC.
