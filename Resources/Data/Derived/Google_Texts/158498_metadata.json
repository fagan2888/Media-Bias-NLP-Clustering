The man was tested Saturday and showed no signs of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s listening right now, we want to be sure to address his needs,\u201d said Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the state health department. \u201cWe want to be careful and compassionate.\u201d\n\nJenkins stressed that the missing man has not committed a crime and is not in trouble. The county judge said the man, when found, will be placed in an unspecified location that will allow for easier testing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to find a great place to monitor you as well,\u201d Jenkins said, as though the man might be listening to the conference.\n\nThe ambulance was effectively quarantined last week after Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola. The emergency medical services crew who transported him has been asked to stay home for 21 days or so. All of them have tested negative for Ebola so far.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue officials have said little about the incident. Officials with other EMS agencies noted that it\u2019s standard practice to decontaminate ambulances after they transport a patient.\n\nCenters for Disease Control officials have repeatedly emphasized that Ebola only spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has symptoms of the virus.\n\nStaff writer Sherry Jacobson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzEwL3BvbGljZS1jb3VudHktc2hlcmlmZnMtZGVwdXRpZXMtbG9va2luZy1mb3ItbWFuLXdoby1yb2RlLWluLWFtYnVsYW5jZS1hZnRlci1lYm9sYS1wYXRpZW50Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tristan Hallman", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 2 p.m.: Lauren Trimble, Jenkins chief of staff, said the man has been located and is now being monitored.
