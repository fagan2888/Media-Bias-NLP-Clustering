Can he unite conservatives?\n\nDr. Ben Carson was the director of pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center for nearly 40 years. Now, he\u2019s giving speeches about politics. In an interview with Fusion\u2019s Jorge Ramos, Carson discussed the grassroots effort to draft him for a 2016 presidential run.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be president. Why would any sane person want to do that?\u201d Carson said, though he admitted to noticing the campaign groundswell. \u201cI think I have to consider that, with so many clamoring for me to do it.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s sparkling surgery career included the first separation of twins conjoined at the back of the head in 1987. It even got the made-for-TV-movie treatment, featuring a Cuba Gooding, Jr. version of Carson completing the famous operation:\n\nBut Carson left it all behind last year, retiring at age 61. Now he\u2019s a pundit, a speaker, and a conservative star. The big shift began with one speech in February 2013. At the National Prayer Breakfast, where speakers usually avoid addressing politics directly, Carson criticized Obamacare while offering alternative solutions. And the president was sitting only a few feet away:\n\nThe speech became a sensation on Youtube and in Washington. Carson continues to speak his mind, particularly when it comes to domestic challenges and President Obama\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s been going on for an extended period of time,\u201d Carson told Ramos. \u201cAnd I think he certainly threw some gasoline on the fire with a lot of the divisive rhetoric.\u201d\n\nCarson has also come under fire for calling Obamacare the worst thing to happen in the U.S. since slavery and for comparing liberal sensibilities and the U.S. political climate to Nazi Germany.\n\nHis supporters can\u2019t get enough of the straight-shooting doctor. The National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee has raised more than $10 million and Carson\u2019s name has repeatedly popped up at or near the top of conservative 2016 straw polls.\n\nIt\u2019s way too early to say whether Carson\u2019s medical oath will give way to a presidential one. But as he told the Conservative Political Action Conference last year, he doesn\u2019t mind being underestimated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost laughable, some of the things I hear people say,\u201d Carson observed. \u201cThey say, \u2018He\u2019s a neurosurgeon, so he couldn\u2019t know anything about economics.\u2019 It\u2019s not brain surgery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "He separated conjoined twins.", "title": "Ben Carson on a 2016 Presidential Run: \u201cI Think I Have to Consider That\u201d", "url": "http://fusion.net/video/23335/ben-carson-separated-conjoined-twins-can-he-unite-conservatives/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/454743676.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He separated conjoined twins.", "title": "Ben Carson on a 2016 presidential run: \u201cI think I have to consider", "url": "http://fusion.net/video/23335/ben-carson-separated-conjoined-twins-can-he-unite-conservatives/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/454743676.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/fusionamerica"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "He separated conjoined twins."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd166e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is something that\u2019s been going on for an extended period of time,\u201d Carson told Ramos.\nIn an interview with Fusion\u2019s Jorge Ramos, Carson discussed the grassroots effort to draft him for a 2016 presidential run.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost laughable, some of the things I hear people say,\u201d Carson observed.\nDr. Ben Carson was the director of pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center for nearly 40 years.\n\u201cThey say, \u2018He\u2019s a neurosurgeon, so he couldn\u2019t know anything about economics.\u2019 It\u2019s not brain surgery.\u201d"}
