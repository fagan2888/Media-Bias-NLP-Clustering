Now, less than a month later, the IRS has issued new proposed regulations governing the penalties for noncompliance. The nation\u2018s tax-collection agency is tasked with enforcing the rules.\n\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) \u2013 the massive 2010 legislation often referred to as \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 individuals are required to acquire \u201cminimum essential health insurance\u201d if they don\u2019t already have such coverage.\n\nFor purposes of the individual health insurance mandate, \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d is generally defined as:\n\nCoverage under certain government-sponsored plans.\n\nEmployer-sponsored plans for employees.\n\nPlans in the individual marketplace.\n\nGrandfathered health insurance plans.\n\nAny other health benefits coverage, such as a state health benefits risk pool, recognized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe penalty for failing to have minimum essential coverage is relatively mild at first, but will be amped up in later years.\n\nFor 2014, the penalty is equal to the greater of $95 per person ($47.50 per child under the age of 18), or 1 percent of household income. The maximum penalty for a family is $285. In 2015, the fee increases to $325 per person ($162.50 per child), up to a family maximum of $975, or 2 percent of household income. Then, in 2016, it leaps to $695 per person, with a family maximum of $2,085, or 2.5 percent of household income. After 2016, the fees will be indexed for inflation.\n\nIf someone is uninsured for only part of the year, one-twelfth of the yearly penalty applies to each month without coverage. An individual who is uninsured for less than three months doesn\u2019t have to make a payment.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nTechnically, an individual has until the end of the current enrollment period, which is March 31, 2014, to avoid a penalty. If you sign up before the enrollment period ends, you won\u2019t have to make a payment for any month before your coverage began. For example, if you enroll in a state marketplace plan on March 31, your coverage begins on May 1, and you aren\u2019t liable for a penalty for any of the previous months of 2014.\n\nIn the new proposed regulations, the IRS addresses several \u201cloopholes\u201d in the law. For instance, limited coverage is allowed through certain government-sponsored programs, such as Medicaid-based programs, as well as two military health programs. Also, individuals are exempted from the Obamacare mandate if they can\u2019t afford minimum essential coverage, or the plan\u2019s costs exceed 8 percent of the individual\u2019s household income for 2014. Furthermore, hardship exemptions may be available to individuals who are unable to attain coverage.\n\nThe IRS is inviting public comment on the new regulations. Final comments may be made as late as April 28.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNew Final Regulations Clarify Obamacare Tax Rules\n\nDelay in Obamacare Rules Stirs Political Cauldron", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Ken Berry"}, "dcterms.title": "IRS Proposes Regs on Obamacare Penalties for Individuals", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "IRS"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "IRS Proposes Regs on Obamacare Penalties for Individuals", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-proposes-regs-on-obamacare-penalties-for-individuals", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2014-01-27T20:30:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-proposes-regs-on-obamacare-penalties-for-individuals", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS Proposes Regs on Obamacare Penalties for Individuals"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-proposes-regs-on-obamacare-penalties-for-individuals", "dcterms.creator": "Ken Berry", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-27T20:30+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Government\",\"Affordable Care Act\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"IRS\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"IRS\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_17964\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-27T20:30:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T21:01:24+00:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "IRS", "sft-tag": "Government", "sft-date": "Jan 27th 2014", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-17964", "publishtime": "2014-01-27T20:30:37:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Ken Berry", "sft-title": "IRS Proposes Regs on Obamacare Penalties for..."}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For purposes of the individual health insurance mandate, \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d is generally defined as:Coverage under certain government-sponsored plans.\nAt long last, the much-publicized health insurance mandate for individuals went into effect on January 1.\nRelated articles:New Final Regulations Clarify Obamacare Tax RulesDelay in Obamacare Rules Stirs Political Cauldron\nGrandfathered health insurance plans.\nAlso, individuals are exempted from the Obamacare mandate if they can\u2019t afford minimum essential coverage, or the plan\u2019s costs exceed 8 percent of the individual\u2019s household income for 2014."}
