Bainbridge, GA - Memorial Hospital and Manor in Bainbridge continues to face financial challenges on a day-to-day basis. However, the rural hospital is making strides when it comes to getting out of a financial bind.

Cheryl Miller has to come to Memorial Hospital and Manor every day. She says she's grateful for the hospital. She says, "My Coumadin was 9.1 and it dropped down to 2.3. So, they're doing a really good job for me."

Also dropping down, is the hospital's financial deficit. Administrators report total expenses have dropped by $719. 741 for the month of April.

Last fiscal year, which ended March 31st, hospital C.E.O. Billy Walker says the hospital was $1.5 million in the hole.

Walker says it was partly due to the high rate of uninsured patients in Decatur County, and the Affordable Care Act. He says, "The way they're paying for that is cutting reimbursement through the Medicare and Medicaid program to providers, both hospitals and physicians. Our hospital alone had our reimbursements reduced by $700,000 this past year."

To better improve the financial status administrators say they're improving staffing and investing in new software.

Glennie Bench, the chairperson of the hospital authority, says, "One of the strategies that we've implemented was to affiliate with Stratus. The goal of Stratus is to develop a clinical integration platform that will allow to be more efficient in the providing of care to our patients. All of that drives unnecessary costs out of the system without impacting the quality to the patient."

Administrators want to point out that Memorial received four out of five stars by CMS and is ranked in the top third hospital in Georgia for quality of care.
