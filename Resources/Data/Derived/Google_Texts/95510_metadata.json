It was 4:46 p.m. on a Saturday and I\u2019d been staring \u2014 face contorted with confusion \u2014 at the buzzer directory of 12 East 14th St. None of the names on the fourth floor suggested I was in the right place.\n\nIt was then that I spun around to see a tall man in his mid- to late 30s leading a baby-bearing stroller into what it was now clear to me was an apartment building.\n\n\u201cI think I have the wrong address,\u201d I stammered.\n\n\u201cSometimes people\u2026\u201d the English dad started to say before trailing off. Recalibrating, he got to the point: \u201cThe welfare center is West 14th Street.\u201d\n\nI felt the blood rush to my face; I could no longer meet his eyes. I mumbled something quick about being on assignment, then thanked him before scurrying across Fifth Avenue.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t explain to that English dad was that, as part of the story I was writing, I had decided to experience for myself what it\u2019s like to survive on money from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistant Program (SNAP), better known to most as \u201cfood stamps.\u201d To apply, one must go to one of 16 food-stamp centers for an application and interview. I wondered how many of the 1.8 million people in the city who are on SNAP \u2014 including a full third of Brooklynites \u2014 felt as sheepish as I did at being pegged needing what that dad had called \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nIt has been 50 years since President Lyndon B. Johnson \u2014 the architect of the modern food stamp \u2014 set out to \u201cconquer poverty\u201d in America. Some, like Rep. Paul Ryan, are ready to declare the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d a failure, and gut funding for things like food stamps. What their objections ignore, however, is that SNAP is vitally important to 47 million Americans \u2014 one sixth of our country, from rural plains to swelling cities. And the program works.\n\nDuring the recession, SNAP \u201ckept about four million people above the poverty level and[\u2026] prevented millions more from sinking further into poverty,\u201d Ron Nixon reported in the New York Times, citing Census Bureau figures. However, fueled by popular mischaracterizations about \u201ctakers\u201d and \u201cwelfare,\u201d the House of Representatives voted in September to cut almost $39 billion over a 10-year period from SNAP. While that proposal generated significant blowback from Democrats, a tentative compromise still leaves much to be desired: The final deal \u2014 quietly negotiated while the political sphere focused on Chris Christie \u2014 includes $9 billion in cuts from the program over a 10-year period.\n\nThe basic, flawed assumption of SNAP\u2019s critics is that those who need food stamps to eat are voluntarily out of work, and that, by removing these programs, \u201ctakers\u201d are forced to find jobs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re able-bodied, you should be willing to work,\u201d House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said about the SNAP cuts.\n\n\u201cThis bill makes getting Americans back to work a priority again for our nation\u2019s welfare programs,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nRep. Stephen Fincher (whose district receives millions in farm subsidies) even quoted the Bible to make his anti-SNAP point: \u201cFor even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat.\u201d\n\nCantor et al. would be wise to know that 41 percent of SNAP recipients are in a household generating income. Yet, for some \u201cable-bodied\u201d workers, a meager income is still not enough to put food on the table. Employees of Wal-Mart and McDonalds, for example, are major beneficiaries of SNAP. (A 2012 Daily Kos article reported that 80 percent of Wal-Mart\u2019s employees benefit from SNAP. One Wal-Mart in Canton, Ohio, even held a food drive for their fellow employees struggling to afford the cost of Thanksgiving dinner.) Those SNAP beneficiaries who are not employed include children, the disabled and the elderly. It is estimated 25 percent of households that benefit from SNAP include an elderly family member, and 72 percent of such households include children. In fact, at some point in their childhood, a full half of America\u2019s children will be fed with food stamps. In 2011, only 11 percent of food-stamp recipients in New Jersey were single, childless, non-disabled, non-elderly adults.\n\nTaking away the social safety net, which feeds struggling Americans, is not going to suddenly force 47 million people into finding high-wage paying jobs. Or as Dave Johnson, fellow and blogger for Campaign for America\u2019s Future, wrote, \u201cRepublicans are picking on the poorest citizens[\u2026] saying that $133 a month is keeping them from bothering to look for a job.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThe average amount that a family on food stamps gets per month is $133. That is $133 for 93 meals. For three meals a day, $133 breaks down to less than $1.50 per meal.\n\nFor New Yorkers this number is slightly higher. The brochure from 12 West 14th St. informed me that a single New Yorker making less than the Gross Monthly Income Limit of $1,245 would qualify for maximum $200 a month (before November 1, 2013 cuts; currently one would receive $189 per month). As you increase the number of people in a household, the monthly allotment raises accordingly.\n\nIn my own trial, which would last a week, I decided to split the difference between the $50 weekly allotment that a New Yorker would get through SNAP with the national average of $33. Thus, I would only buy $41 worth of groceries. My plan was to rely solely on these groceries, and to avoid supplementing my SNAP-purchased goods with food already in my pantry. The exceptions would be sauces (like soy sauce, and BBQ) and cooking materials like oil, salt and pepper, which many household kitchens have.\n\nAt first, $41 seemed like a lot of money for a week\u2019s worth of food, but this was $41, full stop \u2014 not $41 (unless I\u2019m running late for work and need to stop by a coffee shop for a muffin) and not $41 (and then ordering from Seamless because the temperature has dropped and I wanted to cozy up with some hot soup). This was $41 to pay for three meals a day for seven days. This was going to require some planning.\n\nLuckily, the New York City Department of Human Resources\u2019 website has guides available for SNAP participants, including a one that explains how to \u201cCut the Junk\u201d and another with recipes for healthy and cheap meals on it. (Most of these are bean/chili based.)\n\nCurrently, SNAP benefits cannot be used to buy prepared food, fast food or alcohol. (Supporters of the program would like to see more restrictions on junk food items and soda.) In all 50 states SNAP benefits can be spent at farmer\u2019s markets in spite of the fact that the USDA website\u2019s map of SNAP-accepted vendors excludes farmer\u2019s markets from its list.\n\nWalking around New York I began to notice store signage informing potential customers that SNAP dollars were accepted: 7-Eleven had a large A-frame sign outside, and Walgreens reminded customers about SNAP in the junk food aisle, and even the upscale Union Market had a placard at the register. It isn\u2019t surprising that companies like PepsiCo, Kraft and Coca Cola have lobbied to keep SNAP benefits.\n\n* * *\n\nThis was my plan of attack: One or two large dishes that I could eat for many meals, a main breakfast food that would last me an entire week, and snacks. I also wanted to attempt a healthy diet.\n\nMy final menu: a baked pasta dish with whole wheat rigatoni ($1.59), lean turkey sausage ($4.99), two cans diced tomatoes ($1.89 per can) and mozzarella cheese ($4.59); a stir fry with chicken ($6.10), brown rice ($2.59), Green Giant vegetable medley ($2.99) and a red bell pepper ($1.55).\n\nAnd breakfast: Key Food instant oats ($1.99) and Tropicana OJ ($2.99), a splurge item that I purchased because it was on sale for about half off. I also purchased eight Yoplait Light yogurts as part of a \u201cbuy 4 get 4 free\u201d promotion ($0.99 each), baby carrots ($2.00), organic chicken broth on sale ($2.99) for cooking, and a small bag of ground coffee ($1.99 on sale).\n\nI purchased all of this on Nov. 10, a little over a week after $5 billion was automatically cut from SNAP due to the expiration of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus package. This loss of funds meant average monthly benefits went down $36. That means my $41 weekly allotment would have actually been $35.75.\n\nIn December, I spoke to Diane Riley, the director of advocacy at Community FoodBank of New Jersey, which collects donations and provides food to affiliated pantries throughout the state. \u201cYou have no idea how often, how close a budget people are on.\u201d She explains. \u201cThey\u2019re on a close budget to begin with, so while it might not seem like a lot, $36 \u2014 that\u2019s a lot to people.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke to Riley, only a month had passed since the automatic SNAP cuts, but food pantries were already noticing more people coming to them for aid.\n\n\u201cMost of our pantries I\u2019ve talked to said that definitely more people came in this month than last year, or even last month,\u201d Riley tells me. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a little bit more data, but looks to me like it\u2019s a 20% to 30 % increase.\u201d They also experienced an increase in phone calls asking where they could get food, and who was serving meals.\n\nShe tells me that most SNAP beneficiaries run out of food after the second or third week of the month; some of them cope by turning to local food pantries like the ones Community FoodBank of New Jersey runs.\n\n\u201cWe see it as the critical nutrition program without which we\u2019d have bread lines.\u201d Riley says about SNAP. She tells me with the recent cuts, New Jersey will lose $90 million in SNAP benefits money. \u201cThey\u2019re critical to a workforce. They\u2019re critical to children learning,\u201d Riley says. \u201cWe really have to start talking about it that way.\u201d\n\nAt the SNAP office, I encountered resignation. \u201cYou gotta respect it,\u201d one woman said of the cuts. A single man told me his benefits went from $200 to $189 per month. For a family, the cuts are even more catastrophic: A household of three would see their monthly allotment go from $526 to $497 \u2014 a cut nearly equalling what I spent on a week\u2019s worth of food.\n\nA mother in her twenties told me she received $367 per month before the cuts, but that she\u2019ll now see $20 less per month. \u201cWill you be able to make do?\u201d I asked. She gave me an exasperated look.\n\n\u201cNothing is not doable,\u201d she replied as she stepped out of the elevator to the third floor.\n\n* * *\n\nTrying to stretch my meager food budget, I found that while some healthy items were expensive \u2014 anything organic or gluten free jumped in price, and meat prices are very high \u2014 fruits, veggies and oatmeal were far less expensive than frozen meals or cereal. The most difficult part was preparing and portioning out my meals.\n\nI made the baked pasta dish for my first SNAP dinner with the hope that it would last me at least seven non-breakfast meals. It only lasted me six: three days worth of lunch and dinner. At that point, I started to panic. Would rice, eight mini-chicken tenders, a pepper, and a small bag of Green Giant stir-fry veggies really last me eight more meals? I had no choice but to plan differently. Rather than cook giant batches, which I proved inept at rationing for long periods of time, I\u2019d have to cook in waves of one or two meals at once.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have their sights set on food-stamp cuts that would devastate lower-income Americans", "title": "What I learned from a week on food stamps: Paul Ryan couldn\u2019t be any more wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans have their sights set on food-stamp cuts that would devastate lower-income Americans", "title": "What I learned from a week on food stamps: Paul Ryan couldn\u2019t be any more wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/what_i_learned_from_a_week_on_food_stamps_paul_ryan_couldnt_be_any_more_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/paul_ryan6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans have their sights set on food-stamp cuts that would devastate lower-income Americans", "title": "What I learned from a week on food stamps: Paul Ryan couldn\u2019t be any more wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/paul_ryan6.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Food Stamps, Paul Ryan, SNAP, social safety net, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, War on Poverty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9f6\"", "article_summary": "Some, like Rep.
