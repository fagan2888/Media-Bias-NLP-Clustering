The latest is Lower Oconee Community Hospital in southeast Georgia, which had financial problems For the fourth time in two years, a rural hospital in Georgia is permanently closing its doors. The latest is Lower Oconee Community Hospital in southeast Georgia, which had financial problems it could not overcome\n\nThe 25-bed \u201ccritical access\u201d hospital in Glenwood, in Wheeler County, is looking to restructure, its CEO said in a statement. [\u2026] Jimmy Lewis of HomeTown Health, an organization of rural hospitals in Georgia, said Thursday that Lower Oconee suffered from high rates of unemployed and uninsured patients, coupled with heavy demands on staff time to handle claims processing from multiple insurance programs.\n\nIf local residents face a medical emergency, they\u2019ll now have to travel an additional 30 miles for care.\n\nThe Macon Telegraph noted some of the possible solutions to the problem, including the most obvious: Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which would \u201chelp rural hospitals by turning many of their uninsured patients into paying patients.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) and the state legislature\u2019s Republican majority have ruled out the possibility, \u201cciting the cost to the state.\u201d Indeed, just this week, GOP policymakers took steps to make approval of Medicaid expansion even more difficult , just in case Deal loses his re-election bid.\n\nThe real-world effects of such partisan obstinacy aren\u2019t pretty. Indeed, the idea that Georgia won\u2019t consider the policy because of \u201cthe cost to the state\u201d is very hard to understand.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government covers 100% of the costs of Medicaid expansion through 2016, and then 90% going forward. That can fairly be described as an amazing deal for states, a fact that even many conservative Republican governors \u2013 Arizona\u2019s Jan Brewer, Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, et al \u2013 decided they couldn\u2019t responsibly turn down.\n\nSo what\u2019s Deal\u2019s excuse, rejecting the policy even as his state sees rural hospitals closing their doors? He doesn\u2019t seem to have one.\n\nHomeTown Health\u2019s Jimmy Lewis added this week that if the state doesn\u2019t pursue a solution, the result will be a \u201c Third World nation \u201d level of medical care in rural Georgia.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Georgia's rural hospitals keep closing.
