Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, his stump speech could be summed up as bad news, worse news.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really surprised people haven\u2019t run me out of town on a rail, because the news we\u2019ve got is not good,\u201d Stevens said in a talk Tuesday at the Homer Chamber of Commerce and Visitor Center\u2019s monthly meeting. Stevens also held a town hall meeting Monday afternoon and then spoke Monday night at the Homer City Council meeting.\n\nThe bad news? Revenue for the next fiscal year will be $2.2 billion, Steven said.\n\n\u201cIf we take the top three issues we have to spend money on \u2014 education, Medicaid and our debt reimbursement \u2014 there\u2019s nothing left,\u201d he said.\n\nPut another way, that\u2019s also the current personnel budget.\n\n\u201cIt is very, very bad. If we were to fire everyone who works for the state of Alaska, including me and the governor, we would only solve half our problem,\u201d he told the council.\n\nAnd the worse news?\n\nStevens said Gov. Bill Walker has said that unless oil revenues get better, there will be spending cuts this year, more spending cuts next year and after that, the state will have to look at other sources of revenue, like income taxes or dipping into the Alaska Permanent Fund. A 20-percent tax based of the federal income tax rate would only raise $1 billion, Stevens said.\n\n\u201cHow do we talk about revenue? This is not a campaign speech,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too negative, but things are bad right now.\u201d\n\nWell, not totally bad. The one hope in the current revenue situation is that with previous high oil prices, the state socked away $16 billion in savings.\n\n\u201cThat happened when I was Senate President. I take full credit for that,\u201d Stevens said, joking. \u201cThe reality is, we only have that money because we had high oil prices.\u201d\n\nOil revenues could improve, but no one can be sure if and when that would happen, Stevens said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going. I have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it returns. It would be a lot easier for us.\u201d\n\nFalling revenues mean cities can\u2019t expect anything in legislative grants.\n\n\u201cThis is not the year for it,\u201d Stevens said. We\u2019re going to have to tighten our belts and get through this.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives already has done some belt tightening. Stevens noted proposed cuts to education programs like the Parents as Teachers program and Best Beginnings. Vocational education programs also have been cut.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about that,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything we can agree on, we really have to provide for our children\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nThose cuts might be restored, but if so, the money would have to come from elsewhere. Alaskans also can expect to see cuts of about $25 million in the Alaska Marine Highway system. That could mean no local ferry service for three months while the M/V Tustumena is out of service, Stevens said.\n\nAside from fiscal gloom, Stevens also spoke on other issues. He noted the intense focus on writing regulations for commercial marijuana production, processing and sales. Stevens acknowledged the strong support for Ballot Measure 2 in Homer precincts.\n\n\u201cMarijuana got 1,000 more votes than I did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news for me was that marijuana got 2,000 more votes than Walker did.\u201d\n\nMoving toward writing commercial marijuana rules will be complex, Stevens said, and look at questions like \u201cIs there going to be a (cannabis) store in downtown Homer? What\u2019s going to be the impact on our kids?\u201d\n\nAnother issue is Medicaid expansion as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. Stevens said he supports Walker\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid to low-income Alaskans. That could lead to some cost savings, like Medicaid paying for prisoner health-care costs, now paid for by the state. Alaskans pay for people not covered through higher hospital bills, Stevens noted.\n\nSome legislators want to tie Medicaid expansion to Medicaid reform.\n\n\u201cI think we can do both,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI think we can do Medicaid expansion before we do Medicaid reform.\u201d\n\nLooking toward the future, a proposed large-pipe natural gasline to Nikiski and a liquid natural gas export facility could mean huge economic growth for the Kenai Peninsula and Homer. As many as 200 LNG ships could be coming into Cook Inlet a year, with support facilities like spill prevention boats and tugs. Supplies like pipe could come through Homer, too.\n\n\u201cI think the impact on Homer could be enormous,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI hope you\u2019re aware that if this happens, it could be a different Homer than you\u2019re used to.\u201d\n\nWalker supports the LNG project but not a small in-state pipeline to supply natural gas to the Railbelt.\n\n\u201cThe governor has said it doesn\u2019t make sense to do in-state,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe have to have some export at the other end to make it work.\u201d\n\nThe House leadership and Walker have been in disagreement over that.\n\n\u201cYou just want to say, \u2018Grow up and take a deep breath,\u2019\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThe comment we have in the Senate is that in the House, \u2018Everything has been said, but not everybody has said it.\u2019\u201d\n\nStevens praised Walker\u2019s performance so far, noting his support by Homer in the election.\n\n\u201cI think the governor is doing a great job,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe\u2019s honest, he\u2019s Alaskan, he wants to make things work. I think we made the right choice. I hope he\u2019s there for the next eight years.\u201d\n\nMichael Armstrong can be reached at michael.armstrong@homernews.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Homer, Kasilof, Nikiski, Sterling, Anchor, Point, Seward, Seldovia, Newspaper, News, Weather, Sports, Obituaries, Real Estate, Jobs, Classifieds, Cars, Homes, Fishing, Outdoors, Local News, MICHAEL ARMSTRONG", "og": {"url": "http://homernews.com/homer-news/local-news/2015-03-11/stevens-visits-homer", "type": "article", "image": "http://homernews.com/sites/default/files/NEWSmastevens0120150312.jpg", "site_name": "Homer News", "title": "Stevens visits Homer"}, "description": "In visits this week around Homer by Sen.
