So, on Wednesday, he did what, these days, any ambitious Republican must, and pledged allegiance to charlatans and cranks.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the phrase, \u201ccharlatans and cranks\u201d is associated with N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor at Harvard who served for a time as George W. Bush\u2019s chief economic adviser. In the first edition of his best-selling economics textbook, Mr. Mankiw used those words to ridicule \u201csupply-siders\u201d who promised that tax cuts would have such magic effects on the economy that deficits would go down, not up.\n\nBut, on Wednesday, Mr. Walker, in what was clearly a rite of passage into serious candidacy, spoke at a dinner at Manhattan\u2019s \u201c21\u201d Club hosted by the three most prominent supply-siders: Art Laffer (he of the curve); Larry Kudlow of CNBC; and Stephen Moore, chief economist of the Heritage Foundation. Politico pointed out that Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, attended a similar event last month. Clearly, to be a Republican contender you have to court the powerful charlatan caucus.\n\nSo a doctrine that even Republican economists consider dangerous nonsense has become party orthodoxy. And what makes this political triumph especially remarkable is that it comes just as the doctrine\u2019s high priests have been setting new standards for utter, epic predictive failure.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about the fact that supply-siders didn\u2019t see the crisis coming, although they didn\u2019t. Mr. Moore published a 2004 book titled \u201cBullish on Bush,\u201d asserting that the Bush agenda was creating a permanently stronger economy. Mr. Kudlow sneered at the \u201cbubbleheads\u201d asserting that inflated home prices were due for a crash. Still, you could argue that few economists of any stripe fully foresaw the coming disaster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou can\u2019t say the same, however, about postcrisis developments, where the people Mr. Walker was courting have spent years warning about the wrong things. \u201cGet ready for inflation and higher interest rates\u201d was the title of a June 2009 op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal by Mr. Laffer; what followed were the lowest inflation in two generations and the lowest interest rates in history. Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore both predicted 1970s-style stagflation.\n\nTo be fair, Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Laffer eventually admitted that they had been wrong. Neither has, however, given any indication of reconsidering his views, let alone conceding the possibility that the much-hated Keynesians, who have gotten most things right even as the supply-siders were getting everything wrong, might be on to something. Mr. Kudlow describes the failure of runaway inflation to materialize \u2014 something he has been predicting since 2008 \u2014 as \u201cmiraculous.\u201d\n\nSomething else worth noting: as befits his position at Heritage, Mr. Moore likes to publish articles filled with lots of numbers. But his numbers are consistently wrong; they\u2019re for the wrong years, or just plain not what the original sources say. And somehow these errors always run in the direction he wants.\n\nSo what does it say about the current state of the G.O.P. that discussion of economic policy is now monopolized by people who have been wrong about everything, have learned nothing from the experience, and can\u2019t even get their numbers straight?\n\nThe answer, I\u2019d suggest, runs deeper than economic doctrine. Across the board, the modern American right seems to have abandoned the idea that there is an objective reality out there, even if it\u2019s not what your prejudices say should be happening. What are you going to believe, right-wing doctrine or your own lying eyes? These days, the doctrine wins.\n\nLook at another issue, health reform. Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, conservatives predicted disaster: health costs would soar, the deficit would explode, more people would lose insurance than gain it. They were wrong on all counts. But, in their rhetoric, even in the alleged facts (none of them true) people like Mr. Moore put in their articles, they simply ignore this reality. Reading them, you\u2019d think that the dismal failure they wrongly predicted had actually happened.\n\nThen there\u2019s foreign policy. This week Jeb Bush tried to demonstrate his chops in that area, unveiling his team of expert advisers \u2014 who are, sure enough, the very people who insisted that the Iraqis would welcome us as liberators.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on climate change.\n\nAlong with this denial of reality comes an absence of personal accountability. If anything, alleged experts seem to get points by showing that they\u2019re willing to keep saying the same things no matter how embarrassingly wrong they\u2019ve been in the past.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to those economic charlatans and cranks: Clearly, failure has only made them stronger, and now they are political kingmakers.
