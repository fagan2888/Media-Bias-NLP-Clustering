Sure. But bribery?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even close to bribery,\u201d Zucker says.\n\nIt\u2019s a technical distinction \u2014 and it may end up being too clever for federal election officials \u2014 but it\u2019s one that could be very important for Zucker, a Washington, D.C.-based campaign finance attorney who has made a quietly lucrative career out of finding new ways to raise money online for political candidates.\n\nZucker\u2019s new website If.Then.Fund \u2014 which allows people to give small donations to any lawmaker who votes a certain way on a bill \u2014 is an unexpected new idea for combating the influence of big-money donations in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping people you want to keep in Congress and getting rid of the ones you don\u2019t want,\u201d Zucker says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really about the individual votes. It\u2019s not like we want the American people to influence the Senate on whether they approve the Attorney General nominee,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about average Americans using their dollars in the aggregate \u2014 this is crowdfunding \u2014 to change who is in Congress through campaign finance.\u201d\n\nZucker is among a small community of D.C.-based consultants who are using sometimes-old technologies in new ways to help candidates raise money and get elected. It\u2019s a different kind of innovation in the tech world, since there\u2019s nothing particularly new about much of the technology that\u2019s being used.\n\nEmail acquisition, direct marketing to consumers and geo-targeted ads are things that consumer products marketers use all the time. What is different about political technology, however, is that when it comes time to seal the deal \u2014 getting money from a donor \u2014 federal and state campaign finance rules must be followed.\n\nThat\u2019s where Zucker, a pony-tailed, yoga-loving, live-theater aficionado, comes in.\n\nUnlikely path into fundraising\n\nZucker, 43, is walking slowly on a new treadmill desk that was recently installed in the corner of the living room in his two-bedroom apartment in an up-and-coming neighborhood in Washington, near Howard University, the historically black college. He\u2019s still recuperating from surgery to repair two herniated disks in his back that he thinks probably got injured because he wasn\u2019t doing his yoga headstands correctly.\n\nHe runs his online campaign finance business facing away from a fourth-story view of the D.C. skyline, favoring instead a view encompassing his living room, complete with a six-foot-high climbing tower for his two Russian Blue cats, Alexei and Anastasia, and an extensive collection of Star Wars Lego models he\u2019s assembled. There\u2019s a Millennium Falcon atop his granite kitchen island, and a Super Star Destroyer on a sideboard. Nearby, vintage posters from a local theater where he often does lighting design for plays are stacked on a desk, waiting to be framed.\n\nHe is not what comes to mind when you envision a campaign finance attorney with a political science degree from Yale and a law degree from Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cEverything about Jonathan is surprising,\u201d says Nathan Daschle, the son of former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, and the co-founder of Ruck.us, a DIY campaign website builder. \u201cYou say, \u2018I\u2019m going to bring in this Yale and Georgetown grad from the DNC,\u2019 and then Jonathan comes up on his bike. It\u2019s not at all what you\u2019ve pictured.\u201d\n\nZucker\u2019s current career isn\u2019t what he pictured himself doing when he came to D.C. after graduating from Yale. He grew up in St. Louis, and after college he landed an entry-level job at the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which was then at the height of its popularity, thanks in large part to President Clinton\u2019s embrace of its centrist ideas for the Democratic party.\n\nHe worked in the DLC\u2019s fundraising department, tinkering with the organization\u2019s proprietary database of donors. He left after a few years to go to law school part-time at Georgetown, while also working as a field organizer for several queer-rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown in 2000, he began an organization called the \u201cAllies Project,\u201d which was designed to get heterosexual people involved with queer rights. But funding for the project fell apart after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and donations dried up.\n\nDemocracy for all\n\nThus began Zucker\u2019s career in campaign finance. Mostly because a job in the finance department at the Democratic National Committee in 2003 \u201cfell in my lap,\u201d Zucker says, thanks to a friend who was working there. A few years later, he left and joined ActBlue, a then-new Democratic fundraising site which had just begun to make it easier for people to make small-dollar donations to candidates.\n\n\u201cI thought it was brilliant,\u201d he says. He stayed at the fundraising site for the next four years, as it expanded to allow donations in all 50 states and became a major powerhouse in Democratic fundraising.\n\nZucker eventually became the site\u2019s executive director, and wrote many of the briefs approved by the Federal Election Commission that paved the way for ActBlue\u2019s donation system, which fundamentally changed how candidates raise money.\n\nActBlue has helped candidates raise $739 million since its inception in 2004. It basically streamlined the campaign finance reporting process for candidates \u2014 something that ActBlue took care of \u2014 and made it easy for them to raise small amounts of money from supporters. Such donations have become increasingly important for candidates \u2014 particularly Democrats who don\u2019t attract deep-pocketed supporters \u2014 as the courts have made it easier for companies and individuals to funnel millions of dollars into the campaign system through Super PACs.\n\nZucker left at the end of 2008 because, he says, he wanted to build a nonpartisan site that would make it easier for any candidate to raise money online. ActBlue declined to comment on Zucker, other than offering a statement that, \u201cas an innovator in the digital space with 10 years of experience and counting, ActBlue welcomes any and all efforts to get small donors engaged in the political process.\u201d\n\nZucker quickly launched Democracy Engine, which offers basically the same service as ActBlue \u2014 a streamlined process for collecting small-dollar donations \u2014 but can be used by candidates of either party as well as nonprofits.\n\nZucker began the company in 2009, selling his D.C. condo to help get the company off the ground. It runs in the background, essentially acting as a payments processor for companies including NationBuilder and Salsa Labs, which build campaign and nonprofit fundraising sites, respectively. It\u2019s also built into Crowdpac, the nonpartisan campaign data site for users who want to donate to listed candidates. It collects payment either through licensing fees or through a small cut from every transaction it processes.\n\nThe company is still tiny compared to ActBlue. While it\u2019s a private company, Zucker says it collected about $29.8 million in 2014 for candidates and nonprofit clients. By comparison, Democratic candidates raised $67 million in 2014 using ActBlue, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. (Update: Candidates raised $237 million on ActBlue in 2014, a spokesman said, noting the federal figures don\u2019t include all donations made via the site.)\n\nZucker\u2019s nonpartisan approach doesn\u2019t always sit well with some Democrats, who think they should try to use any technological advantages they have over Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always taken the opposite stance of ActBlue. There is no front end for Democracy Engine. It\u2019s a service,\u201d says Dave Leichtman, a Virginia-based campaign tech executive and former vice president of client services at Salsa Labs, a Democracy Engine client.\n\n\u201cHe wants his technology to be nonpartisan even if he is a Democrat,\u201d Leichtman says of Zucker.\n\nIf then, what?\n\nOur top-line goal is shifting the balance of power from those who have a lot of money to those who have a lot less,\u201d says Joshua Tauberer, who co-founded If.Then.Fund with Zucker last year, after talking about the idea for more than a year before that.\n\nTauberer, 33, a leader of Washington\u2019s \u201copen gov\u201d community, is a \u201ccivic hacker\u201d who for the past 11 years has been operating a site, GovTrack.us, which makes it easier to track and understand legislation moving through Congress.\n\nHe began tinkering with the idea while he was an undergrad studying psychology at Princeton University, and kept refining it as he continued to get a masters and a PhD in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania. The site continues to be a well-used resource by bloggers, journalists, lobbyists and anyone else trying to figure out what Congress is up to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coding my whole life,\u201d says Tauberer, who got his start at age 7 at home in Long Island, NY, thanks to his dad, a civil engineer. Tauberer built the If.Then.Fund site and has been manually adding legislation to it, while working on automating the process so users can eventually pick bills to back themselves.\n\nIf.Then.Fund is a low-budget operation. It\u2019s not exactly a hobby for Zucker or Tauberer, but it\u2019s not paying the bills, either.\n\nThe pair figure they\u2019ve probably spent about $10,000 on the site so far, and about two-thirds of that was setting up the company legally and for a 15-page legal brief detailing why the site isn\u2019t running afoul of federal bribery or anti-corruption laws.\n\n\u201cIt took awhile to do the research to figure out exactly how to make it work without violating anti-corruption laws,\u201d Zucker says. \u201cThere are certainly some things we considered, but discarded because they skirted too close to the line.\u201d\n\nWhen someone makes a donation at If.Then.Fun, the money is divvied up among all members who voted the way the donor wanted. That could mean that 45 senators get 22 cents from someone\u2019s $10 donation. That amount seems ridiculously small, but the idea is that enough people will pledge donations that the total amounts will be high enough to make lawmakers eventually take note.\n\nThe site launched in February, and it has been off to a slow start. Only $60 was pledged on an April Senate vote for confirming Loretta Lynch as the U.S. Attorney General. The most popular vote on the site \u2014 another bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has attracted $3,100 from 224 donors.\n\nHowever, there has been no marketing budget so far, and Zucker and Tauberer have mostly been relying on word of mouth to get people to the site. They got both the the New York Times and the Washington Post to write about the site because Tauberer personally knows the reporters thanks to his open-government work.\n\nThey\u2019re putting together a \u201csmall round\u201d of investments to start a marketing campaign soon.\n\n\u201cWe have a great idea \u2026 we\u2019ve got a proof of concept that it works,\u201d Zucker says. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking for a new way to get people engaged. It\u2019s clearly new, it\u2019s novel.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "If.Then.Fund offers a novel way to try to lessen the influence of big-money donors.", "author": "Amy Schatz", "og": {"site_name": "Recode", "description": "If.Then.Fund offers a novel way to try to lessen the influence of big-money donors.", "title": "Small Dollars, Big Impact for D.C.
