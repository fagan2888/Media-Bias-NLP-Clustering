A man was forced to don a life vest, jump in the Ohio River and swim to shore after his boat caught fire Saturday.

The man was talking to police, paramedics and firefighters once he was out of the river. He was placed on a stretcher and taken to UPMC Mercy in an ambulance for treatment of minor smoke inhalation. Police said he was in his 40s.

Thick black smoke billowed from the boat just downstream from the West End Bridge in Pittsburgh. Firefighters on a ladder truck sprayed water on the wreckage.

The fire started just before noon. River Rescue and Pittsburgh firefighters were putting the fire out, public safety spokeswoman Emily Schaffer said.

“Once it gets going, it's very hard to put it out,” said fire Battalion Chief Doug Praskovich.

The department did not have a fire boat. Firefighters had to wait until the boat was near docks to finally spray water on it.

Praskovich said he did not yet know what started the fire.
