If you're looking for a way to celebrate Veterans Day, here are a few events happening Monday.

The Annual Bay County Veterans Day Parade begins at 9:30 Monday morning, and features a new route this year.

Bay County Commissioners and the Bay County Vet Council are hosting the parade which will start at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and West 13th Street and then make its way to the Bay County Government Center on 11th Street.

A ceremony will immediately follow the parade.

The Panama City Rescue Mission is honoring veterans at 11:00 am in the Mission Courtyard, with a special POW and MIA Recognition Ceremony.

A local girl scout troop will help pin ribbons on each veteran in honor of their service, followed by a presentation of the colors by the men and women of the honor guard at Tyndall Air Force Base and the ROTC Color Guard from Bay High School.

The Anderson family is hosting its annual Veterans Day celebration also at 11:00 Monday morning.

In previous years, they offered rides on the Lady Anderson, but since she's gone, they're taking vets and families on some of the other sightseeing boats.

And Callaway's Big Veterans Day Parade will begin at 2:00 Monday afternoon and will travel by the Vets Memorial on Cherry Street.
