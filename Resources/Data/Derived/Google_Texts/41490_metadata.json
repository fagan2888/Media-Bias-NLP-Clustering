This tough assessment comes after more than a decade of U.S. efforts to train and equip the Afghan Army and police -- at a cost of roughly $65 billion.\n\n\u201cWe have years to go\u201d before Afghanistan\u2019s forces can successfully execute many kinds of missions, including air support, intelligence gathering and special operations, Army Lt. Gen. John \u201cMick\u201d Nicholson told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for a Third US Front Against ISIS\u2014This Time in Libya\n\nThe cost of the U.S. effort since 2001 was put forward late last year by Gen. John Campbell, who Nicholson hopes to replace, and the price tag promises to keep rising.\n\nNicholson said Washington is spending about $3.5 billion annually on the war effort in Afghanistan. That\u2019s in addition to $1 billion from other countries and about $500 million from Kabul itself, \u201cwith an objective of course, of that increasing over time.\u201d\n\nThe three-star general agreed with panel chair John McCain (R-AZ) that security conditions in Afghanistan are deteriorating despite the presence of about 9,800 U.S. troops in the country.\n\nPresident Obama last year withdrew his plan to reduce troop levels to about 1,000 by the end of 2016, and instead now plans to keep 5,500 soldiers there at least through the end of this year.\n\nRelated: Where Did $800 Million in Afghan Aid Go? The Pentagon Shrugs Its Shoulders\n\nHowever, Nicholson said if confirmed he would conduct his own review troop levels and make a fresh recommendation to the president within his first 90 days on the job. He could suggest that Obama maintain the current level of 9,800 troops until January 2017 and pass the decision to the next administration.\n\n\"This is Afghanistan,\" he told the committee. \"There will always be some level of violence in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe idea of abandoning Obama\u2019s timetable altogether garnered bipartisan support, as senators worried about Afghanistan becoming a haven for terrorist groups.\n\nMeanwhile, a new audit released Thursday morning by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found that American forces were unable to achieve the self-imposed goal of making the Afghan National Army\u2019s National Engineer Brigade (NEB) \u2013 envisioned as the country\u2019s natural disaster emergency response unit \u2013 \u201cpartially capable\u201d by the end of 2014.\n\nRelated: The Most Corrupt Countries in the World Include Iraq, Afghanistan\n\nThe Defense Department spent at least $29 million in engineering equipment and vehicles for the brigade, including bulldozers, tractors and cranes, the audit shows.\n\nLast year the Pentagon noted that the brigade was still missing much of its required equipment and a defense official told told SIGAR that the Afghan Central Supply Depot, which is managed by the national army, couldn\u2019t account for all of the NEB\u2019s equipment, according to SIGAR.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s pick to lead American military forces in Afghanistan has a sobering message for Capitol Hill lawmakers: despite up to $65 billion in U.S. investments to train and equip the Afghan Army and police, local forces they remain nowhere near ready to stand up on their own.", "title": "US Has Spent $65 B Training Afghan Forces \u2014 but They're Still Not Ready", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/28/US-Has-Spent-65-Billion-Train-Afghan-Security-Forces-Theyre-Still-Not-Ready", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-security_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/28/US-Has-Spent-65-Billion-Train-Afghan-Security-Forces-Theyre-Still-Not-Ready", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-security_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s pick to lead American military forces in Afghanistan has a sobering message for Capitol Hill lawmakers: despite up to $65 billion in U.S. investments to train and equip the Afghan Army and police, local forces they remain nowhere near ready to stand up on their own.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s nominee to lead American military forces in Afghanistan has a sobering message for lawmakers on Capitol Hill: Security forces there are not yet ready to stand on their own.\nThis tough assessment comes after more than a decade of U.S. efforts to train and equip the Afghan Army and police -- at a cost of roughly $65 billion.\nRelated: Where Did $800 Million in Afghan Aid Go?\n\u201cWe have years to go\u201d before Afghanistan\u2019s forces can successfully execute many kinds of missions, including air support, intelligence gathering and special operations, Army Lt.
