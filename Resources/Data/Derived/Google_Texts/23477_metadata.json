It\u2019s been a National Historic Landmark since 2008.\n\nPipeline Green Light\n\nFederal regulators have given the go-ahead to a pipeline project that aims to bring cheap natural gas into New England from Pennsylvania. The $700 million Constitution pipeline would run through western Connecticut to connect to the Iroquis pipeline. If the project also gets the approval of state regulators, its backers want to see it up and running by next winter.\n\nHartford Wage Protest\n\nDowntown Hartford was again one of almost 200 venues for a protest over low wage workers\u2019 pay Thursday. About 200 people staged a demonstration calling for pay of $15.00 an hour. It\u2019s the latest in a series of protests that was begun by fast food workers two years ago. This time home care workers joined the demonstration.\n\nWomen Lead at Quinnipiac\n\nQuinnipiac University\u2019s School of Business has launched a new center for Women and Business.
