A police officer on the scene said he had seen at least three dead bodies.\n\nMedical aid group Emergency, which runs a hospital in Kabul, said it was receiving wounded at its surgical center.\n\nA spokesman for the Taliban, which has often issued exaggerated casualty figures, said dozens of foreigners had been killed or wounded.\n\nThe Taliban, which has stepped up its insurgency since foreign forces ended combat operations last year has claimed a series of attacks on foreign targets in and around Kabul although most casualties have been Afghan civilians.\n\nOn Friday, a suicide bomber attacked a French restaurant popular with foreigners and well-off Afghans, killing a 12 year old boy and a security guard.\n\nEarlier on Monday, a suicide bomber blew himself up near a police checkpoint without causing any other casualties.\n\nMonday's attacks occurred as special forces in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif fought to suppress a small group of insurgents holding out after an attack on the Indian consulate on Sunday night.\n\nThe attacks have coincided with renewed efforts to restart stalled peace talks with the Taliban.\n\n(Reporting by Hamid Shalizi, writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Ralph Boulton)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban claimed responsibility for a truck bomb attack on a comp", "title": "Taliban claim suicide attack on contractor camp in Kabul", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/04/Explosion-reported-near-Kabul-airport-police-official", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/04/Explosion-reported-near-Kabul-airport-police-official", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban claimed responsibility for a truck bomb attack on a comp", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Earlier on Monday, a suicide bomber blew himself up near a police checkpoint without causing any other casualties.\nOn Friday, a suicide bomber attacked a French restaurant popular with foreigners and well-off Afghans, killing a 12 year old boy and a security guard.\nMedical aid group Emergency, which runs a hospital in Kabul, said it was receiving wounded at its surgical center.\nA spokesman for the Taliban, which has often issued exaggerated casualty figures, said dozens of foreigners had been killed or wounded.\nKABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban claimed responsibility for a truck bomb attack on a compound for civilian contractors near Kabul airport on Monday, hours after a suicide bomber blew himself up in the latest in a series of attacks in the Afghan capital over the past week."}
