The segment recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5% during the review period (2009-2013), the highest growth of all the industry's segments.\n\nThis growth can be attributed to rising per capita healthcare expenditure, a rapidly growing aging population, and growing domestic demand for healthcare products. It was further supported by the country's insufficient public healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Such factors, coupled with new healthcare reforms, are projected to enable the segment to record a CAGR of 2.3% over the forecast period (2013-2018).\n\nKey Highlights\n\nPersonal accident and health insurance accounted for 35.3% of the industry's gross written premium in 2013.\n\nThe US personal accident and health segment registered the industry's highest review-period CAGR of 3.5% in terms of gross written premiums.\n\nThe segment is highly competitive, and firms face competition from other insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and third-party administrators (TPAs).\n\nHealth insurance dominated the segment in 2013, with 97.9% of the gross written premium.\n\nHealthcare expenditure accounted for around 16.9% of the country's GDP in 2012, higher than the OECD average of 9.3% (OECD health insurance statistics 2014).\n\nThe growth in the personal accident and health insurance segment can be attributed to various factors such as rising healthcare expenditure, decreasing unemployment, the growing aging population and the implementation of ObamaCare reforms.\n\nThe Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 - an amendment of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) - came into force in January 2014.\n\nThe country's personal accident and health insurance segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% over the forecast period.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1 Key Facts and Events\n\n2 Executive Summary\n\n3 Introduction\n\n4 US Insurance Industry Attractiveness\n\n5 Personal Accident and Health Insurance Outlook\n\n6 Analysis by Distribution Channel\n\n7 Regulatory Policies\n\n8 Competitive Landscape and Strategic Insights\n\n9 Appendix\n\nCompanies Mentioned\n\nUnitedHealth Group\n\nAetna Inc.\n\nWellPoint Inc.\n\nHealthcare Service Corporation\n\nHumana Inc.\n\nHighmark Inc.\n\nAflac Inc.\n\nCigna Corporation\n\nMetLife Inc.\n\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cbjh2b/personal_accident", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cbjh2b/personal_accident) has announced the addition of the &quot;Personal Accident a", "og": {"image": {"width": 465, "identifier": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/bwlogo_square.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 225}}, "twitter": {"description": "Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cbjh2b/personal_accident) has announced the addition of the &quot;Personal Accident a", "title": "Research and Markets: United States Personal Accident and Health Insurance Market Report - Key Trends and Opportunities to 2018", "image": {"src": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20150109005224/en/371054/21/ResearchAndMarkets_800px.jpg"}, "site": "@businesswire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-09", "p": {"domain_verify": "95725e0359a14c2e1ccbd936e10d20d6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a65\"", "article_summary": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cbjh2b/personal_accident) has announced the addition of the \"Personal Accident and Health Insurance in the US, Key Trends and Opportunities to 2018\" report to their offering.\nThe country's personal accident and health insurance segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% over the forecast period.\nKey HighlightsPersonal accident and health insurance accounted for 35.3% of the industry's gross written premium in 2013.\nThe US personal accident and health insurance segment was the second largest in the country, accounting for 35.3% of the industry's gross written premium in 2013.\nThe US personal accident and health segment registered the industry's highest review-period CAGR of 3.5% in terms of gross written premiums."}
