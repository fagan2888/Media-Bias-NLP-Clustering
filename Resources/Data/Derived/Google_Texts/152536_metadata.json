He is part of a research team exhuming ice cores from Greenland to better understand the past interglacial period known as the Eemian. ( / University of Colorado )\n\n\"Do you believe in climate change?\"\n\nIt's a common question, and after being posed the question, most of us would probably pause, try to assess our questioner to judge how ugly or pleasant this conversation might soon get, and then possibly offer an answer. But to a climate scientist, it's a rather strange, even bizarre question.\n\nThe obvious answer is no, but not because climate is not changing, which it is, and not because humans are not a cause, which we are. The problem is that word, \"believe.\" To climate scientists, climate change is not a question of belief, but rather one of physics. It's a physical reality that gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb the radiation emitted by the Earth and in doing so trap energy in the atmosphere. It's physics that trapping energy in the atmosphere changes climate.\n\nThe Daily Camera's Roundtable Series The Daily Camera's occasional feature Roundtables will bring together multiple commentaries by experts on a single subject.

Often, this feature will mine the varied and considerable expertise in residence at the University of Colorado. Following is the Camera's Roundtable on Climate Science: The dead speak: Long-dead tundra plants tell us that current warming cannot be explained by Earth's natural climate variability Do you believe in climate change?\n\nPhysics is simply physics, and whether you or I believe in it or not will have absolutely no impact on the outcome. I've never been asked if I believe in gravity, for example, yet like gravity, the absorbing of energy by greenhouse gases is a matter of physics and something humans cannot alter. Have you ever woken up, and thought to yourself, \"I sure hope I don't have one of those no-gravity days. I hate it when I float around the room.\" Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality is we expect gravity to work all the time and we know very well we can't change that. Somewhere deep in our core we understand that gravity is gravity and we might as well just accept it. So why would molecules cease to vibrate, or change their frequency of vibration, and thus cease to absorb the earth's radiation? The fact is they won't, anymore than you might float off your chair while reading this. The fact is, if we put large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we have, climate will change. And that's not a question of belief, but one of physics.\n\nWhile we are discussing reality, let's ponder another physical reality we can't change: Our planet's surface is mostly water. That simple fact imposes some hard physics on us. Water can absorb a lot of energy (a watched pot never boils ... well, not never, but it sure takes awhile), much more than the atmosphere, and so we should expect that global warming is really ocean warming.\n\nIn fact, about 90 percent of the extra heat from global warming thus far has been ocean warming. The atmosphere that we breathe and care so much about is only a small piece of the surface environment, and one that can experience periods of rapid warming and periods of little warming. But that large ocean out there continues to warm, and if we focus only on the atmosphere, we are once again missing the lessons of physics.\n\nAnd that poses the second physical reality on us that we need to better grasp. It will take many decades for the earth's climate to catch up with the changes we have already made to the atmosphere because it will take the ocean that long to warm up. We have increased carbon dioxide to a level, about 400 parts per million, last seen on Earth about three million years ago.\n\nAt that time the Earth was 4 to 6 degrees F warmer on average, with trees growing in northernmost Canada, and sea level was 60 feet or so higher. So why don't we have that climate and sea level today? Be patient. It will take time for the ocean to warm up and the land ice to melt. Put another way, physics tells us that what one generation does to the atmosphere, the next generation has to live with.\n\nLiquid water gives us life, but when it comes to climate change, all that liquid water in the oceans also forces us to think of the next generation in our actions today. The trouble is, we're not doing that. Unfortunately, we have reached a point where there is already so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it's going to be difficult for us to limit our impact on the planet.\n\nOur kids and grandkids are going to look back and shake their heads at the inaction of our generation. We are burning the lion's share of oil and natural gas to benefit our lifestyle, and punting the responsibility for it. Simply put, until one generation is willing to forego short-term profits in favor of the long-term benefits of its children and grandchildren, the problems of climate change will never be solved. And that's what I believe.\n\nJim White is a professor in CU-Boulder's department of geological sciences and director of its Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research.
