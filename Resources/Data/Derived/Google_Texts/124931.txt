Sioux City, IA

After a week of damaging weather, one community has been spared from an expected flooding of the Big Sioux River.



Residents of McCook Lake have been working hard this week to prepare their homes for expected floodwaters. However, our meteorologists tell us the Big Sioux River crested at 1:00 a.m. at nearly 106 feet, which is lower than expected. Instead of worrying about flooded basements, people who live at McCook Lake can now enjoy the weekend.

"Up and down the street, there are, people are having parties, and celebrating the good news," McCook Lake Resident Jim Fowler said.

Many homes out here at McCook Lake, like the one behind me, still have sandbags set up, but thankfully, they will be able to take them down later today.

Thursday, this area was filled with volunteers hard at work sandbagging homes. Even though it turned out the bags weren't needed, Jim Fowler is thankful for the help he and his wife received.

"It was unbelievable. We would go get a palette of sand bags, comer over here, we'd have 10, 15 people right here, ready to unload them for us,‚Äù Fowler said.

The news isn't only good for homeowners, but for workers as well. Many organizations have been working tirelessly to build a makeshift dike over Interstate 29, which is being taken down today.

"We more or less made the Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service swear under oath that this is not going to come back up, and come back at us from the rear," South Dakota Department of Transportation Area Engineer Ron Peterson said.

Meaning both homeowners and workers can enjoy the weekend.

In a press conference, Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels says Interstate 29 was opened at 2:30 p.m. on Friday.
