Because of work-related and other discrimination, transgender people are statistically more likely to find themselves without coverage and thus stand to benefit from the general increase in access to health care that the ACA provides.\n\nAs part of its duty to provide appropriate, quality care, the medical establishment should include transgender-sensitive care in all medical education \"as has been done with other cultural competencies.\"\n\nTo back this up, Dr. Stroumsa calls for federal grants to help fund educational programs teaching postgraduate-level medical care of transgender patients, including sex reassignment surgery. She notes that the ACA \"has taken a first positive step in that direction\" by providing funding for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) cultural competency training. Such training has already been implemented in some \"big-city\" health departments, and is underway for staff of the National Health Service Corps.\n\nAmong the study's other recommendations:\n\nEstablish more health centers dedicated to caring for transgender patients as well as strengthen those already in operation.\n\nDraft clear guidelines for all federally funded health centers, including appropriate language, adoption of gender-neutral bathrooms and health records that respect transgender patients' preferred names and gender pronouns.\n\nInclude questions regarding gender identity in health surveys to help monitor the progress and effects of new transgender health care measures.\n\nHelp overcome the high rates of unemployment in the transgender population by hiring transgender people in the health care workforce. This would also offer an important avenue to address some of the challenges and barriers this population faces in the health care system.\n\nA final recommendation of the study is that those who care for transgender patients should collect and publish data with the goal of improving that care. \"It goes without saying that all such research must be conducted with sensitivity and respect toward participants,\" Dr. Stroumsa concludes.\n\nExplore further: A first-of-its-kind study of transgender health", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Discrimination against transgender people \u2013as many as one million Americans identify themselves as transgender \u2013 should immediately be addressed by the medical establishment, backed by policy change at the national level ...", "og": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-02-transgender-patients-discriminated-health.html", "image": "http://cdn.medicalxpress.com/tmpl/v5/img/medx308px.png", "type": "article", "description": "Discrimination against transgender people \u2013as many as one million Americans identify themselves as transgender \u2013 should immediately be addressed by the medical establishment, backed by policy change at the national level to provide equal access to quality health care.", "title": "Transgender patients discriminated against for health care services"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-02-transgender-patients-discriminated-health.html", "title": "Transgender patients discriminated against for health care services", "description": "Discrimination against transgender people \u2013as many as one million Americans identify themselves as transgender \u2013 should immediately be addressed by the medical establishment, backed by policy change ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 287568380}, "ROBOTS": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 325486637469240}, "Keywords": "Medicine Research News, Medicine Research, Health Research News, Health Research, Health Science, Medicine Science", "viewport": "width=1024"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf5f\"", "article_summary": "Include questions regarding gender identity in health surveys to help monitor the progress and effects of new transgender health care measures.\nHelp overcome the high rates of unemployment in the transgender population by hiring transgender people in the health care workforce.\nA final recommendation of the study is that those who care for transgender patients should collect and publish data with the goal of improving that care.\nThis would also offer an important avenue to address some of the challenges and barriers this population faces in the health care system.\nAmong the study's other recommendations:Establish more health centers dedicated to caring for transgender patients as well as strengthen those already in operation."}
