An international symposium focusing on river science

is coming to La Crosse tomorrow.

The 4th Biennial Symposium of the International Society

for River Science.

or I-S-R-S.

is being hosted by the U-W La Crosse River Studies

Center at Riverside Park.

Every two years scientists from around the world gather

to learn about the effects and well-keeping of rivers

and streams.

The other three symposiums were held in Florida.

Germany.

and China.

This year's event focuses on the connectivity of river

communities and how the river affects local economies

and cultures.

We all sort of superficially appreciate the Mississippi

River, but there are so many aspects of the Mississippi

River that often times are not well conveyed, or well

understood by most people, and this is an opportunity

for people to get down here and again experience some

of those aspects and ask questions about it.

One of the main displays for tomorrow is life on a

tow boat.

You'll be able to tour a tow boat and get an up-close

look at how everything works.

and even talk with professionals about their daily

life.

A lot of different people really see the boats out

on the river, but they have no idea what the boats

are about, and once you get on the boat you really

get to see the size of things and it's deceiving.

The symposium will be free and open to the public.
