BALTIMORE (AP) — Officers arrested a man who appeared to be armed with a handgun in the same neighborhood where riots have broken out over the death of a man injured in police custody, but no one was hurt during the confrontation, authorities said Monday.

Lt. Col. Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun. Police said the man was taken into custody after a brief chase, during which the sound of a gunshot was heard.

Russell said that police never fired their weapons and that no one was shot. Russell said police recovered a handgun loaded with three rounds, one of which was spent. The suspect was not injured and did not want to be transported to a hospital but was taken to the hospital anyway in an ambulance, he said.

Live television coverage and photos tweeted from the scene showed medics putting a man in an ambulance and a large police presence, with officers lining up to apparently block one street.

The activity is taking place in the same area where police first spotted Freddie Gray on April 12. He was arrested and fatally injured in police custody. Six officers were charged Friday in Gray’s death.

A few dozen police officers wearing helmets and carrying shields formed a line across North Avenue as crowds gathered across the street, occasionally shouting “control the police” at the officers. Minutes after police briefed reporters, the line of officers left the street and police began to allow traffic to get through the intersection.
