In the process, we\u2019re turning science fiction into science fact.\n\nSpeaking at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral Florida, the president challenged our nation to leap into the future. \u201cBy 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space,\u201d he explained. \u201cBy the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And a landing on Mars will follow.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nToday, NASA, our country, and humankind are firmly on a journey to Mars.\n\nAfter the president stood in front of a mock-up of the Orion Spacecraft \u2013 the technological foundation for future deep space missions \u2013 and pledged it would be readied for flight, Orion has now flown farther into space than any spacecraft built for human passengers has flown in more than four decades, bringing home with it critical data for future crewed missions to deep space.\n\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will someday carry American astronauts to deep space has moved from concept to development and it\u2019s hitting critical benchmarks.\n\nMeanwhile, we\u2019re moving forward with an Asteroid Redirect Mission that will test new capabilities (like advanced propulsion systems) that will be needed for future human expeditions to Mars.\n\nTo move our Journey forward, the president called for extending the life of the International Space Station (ISS) for five years. We\u2019ve now extended it for ten. This means that we\u2019re able to test and improve our capabilities in space, and study how the human body responds to extended periods of time off our planet.\n\nAmerican Astronaut Scott Kelly recently began a one-year mission aboard the space station, and we continue to use the ISS to fulfill Obama\u2019s vision for conducting advanced research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on Earth.\n\nAs we increase Earth-based observation (NASA currently has 20 spacecraft orbiting our planet and gathering data) we\u2019re gaining a better understanding of our climate and how it is changing. Ultimately, this will help us leave a healthier planet to our children and grandchildren.\n\nWe\u2019re also accelerating the pace of private-sector innovation \u2013 another critical part of the president\u2019s vision. Our American industry partners are now launching cargo missions to the ISS \u2013 and they\u2019re doing it from U.S. soil. And last September we announced the selection of Boeing and SpaceX to transport our astronaut crews to the Station, bringing those launches back to America in 2017 and ending our sole reliance on the Russians to get into space.\n\nAs we approach the 25th anniversary of the deployment of the Hubble Telescope \u2013 a mission I was proud to pilot \u2013 we are answering the President\u2019s call to succeed Hubble with an advanced telescope that will allow us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before. When it launches in 2018, the James Webb Space Telescope will be placed in orbit about a million miles from Earth, allowing us to observe the most distant objects in the universe, and see unexplored planets around distant stars.\n\nWe\u2019re also ramping up exploration of the solar system, including \u2013 as Obama said \u2013 the sun, the closest star to Earth, and a key to unlocking mysteries about stars, the Milky Way galaxy, and the universe itself.\n\nTechnology drives exploration, and we\u2019re getting closer to remarkable new technological breakthroughs; advances like Low Density Supersonic Decelerators that will allow heavier spacecraft to land safely on places like Mars \u2013 all part of the president\u2019s plan to invest in new, advanced technologies that will not only take Americans farther into space than ever before, but will provide spin-off benefits and create high-paying jobs here on Earth.\n\n\u201cWe will not only extend humanity's reach in space -- we will strengthen America's leadership here on Earth,\u201d the president said at the Kennedy Space Center. \u201cFor pennies on the dollar, the space program has improved our lives, advanced our society, strengthened our economy and inspired generations of Americans \u2026 the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something. I choose to believe it was only the beginning.\u201d\n\nFive years later, the progress is tangible, the promise is real, and possibility is endless. We are leaping into the future and turning the one-time dreams of science fiction into science fact.\n\nBolden, a former astronaut is administrator of NASA.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "NASA, our country, and humankind are firmly on a journey to Mars.", "description": "NASA, our country, and humankind are firmly on a journey to Mars.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "NASA, our country, and humankind are firmly on a journey to Mars.", "title": "In space, a lot can happen in five years", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/238981-in-space-a-lot-can-happen-in-five-years", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/238981-in-space-a-lot-can-happen-in-five-years", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-16T11:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Charles Bolden", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-16T11:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/238981-in-space-a-lot-can-happen-in-five-years", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "NASA, our country, and humankind are firmly on a journey to Mars.", "card": "summary", "title": "In space, a lot can happen in five years"}, "dcterms.title": "In space, a lot can happen in five years"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca63c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe will not only extend humanity's reach in space -- we will strengthen America's leadership here on Earth,\u201d the president said at the Kennedy Space Center.\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will someday carry American astronauts to deep space has moved from concept to development and it\u2019s hitting critical benchmarks.\nSpeaking at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral Florida, the president challenged our nation to leap into the future.\nTo move our Journey forward, the president called for extending the life of the International Space Station (ISS) for five years.\n\u201cBy 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space,\u201d he explained."}
