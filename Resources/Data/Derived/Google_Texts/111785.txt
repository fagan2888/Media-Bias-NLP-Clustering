Police are searching for the owner of two reportedly aggressive pit bulls, one of which was shot and killed by a Wichita officer.

Police and an animal control officer responded around 5 p.m. Saturday to the vicious dog report in the 2800 block of North Grove. When they arrived, one of the dogs tried to bite the animal control officer, Sgt. Brian Sigman said.

The officer was able to distract the dogs, finding their attention focused on him. He used his baton to fend off the dogs. That worked until one of them "started aggressively toward the officer," Sigman said.

The officer shot and killed the dog.

The other dog was caught and both were taken taken to animal control.

It's unknown who owns the two dogs.

The vicious dog incident was near a new playground dedicated last week at Dr. Glen Dey Park.
