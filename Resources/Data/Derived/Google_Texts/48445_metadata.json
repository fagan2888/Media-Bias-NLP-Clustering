So after a lot of discussion, they provided roughly three million dollars to be spread among the smaller rural hospitals. But some thought that was not enough, so two legislative committees are looking into what else can be done to help.\n\nBefore they crafted a solution lawmakers needed to know how much hospitals were on the hook for uncompensated care. Hospitals lose money if people access the emergency room instead of a standard provider like a doctor\u2019s office or clinic, because the costs can be three to four times higher. During a recent legislative meeting in Casper, Gillette Representative Eric Barlow said that this is a big issue.\n\n\u201cIn this rural state many of the entry points, especially in the smaller communities to health care is an emergency room\u2026period. They don\u2019t have the opportunities for walk-in clinics, they don\u2019t have the opportunities for doctors\u2019 offices, especially after hours.\u201d\n\nHospitals in Wyoming also lose money if Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance does not pay the amount they want to be reimbursed. They also lose money if people don\u2019t have insurance and don\u2019t pay their bill.\n\nHospitals are in trouble and we are taking care of our community members and some of those community members don't have the ability to pay. But we continue to care for them, it's the right thing to do.\n\nThe lack of insurance is the biggest culprit. The legislative service office recently surveyed hospitals in the state and heard from roughly half of them. They said that in 2013 they lost almost 100 million dollars. This can be especially harmful to smaller hospitals in the state.\n\nState Senator Charles Scott of Casper says he\u2019s worried that this debt will one day force the closure of a small hospital.\n\n\u201cSome of those where they are isolated and away from other hospitals, they are the only one in a significant area of population, the state cannot afford to be without a facility there.\u201d\n\nSo the committee is trying to find a way to work with counties and hospitals to find a solution. Barlow is proposing working with county commissioners, hospitals, and others to find ways to develop clinics or alternatives to hospital emergency rooms in rural places. He thinks providing them grants could work. Scott is a long believer that changing the habits of those who use Medicaid would help.\n\nRick Schroeder is the CEO of the North Big Horn Hospital, a 15-bed critical access facility that\u2019s always struggling to make ends meet. Schroeder agrees that emergency room use is big, but he says the problem for small hospitals like his is hardly Medicaid patients. It\u2019s people who don\u2019t have coverage at all.\n\n\u201cHospitals are in trouble and we are taking care of our community members and some of those community members don\u2019t have the ability to pay. But we continue to care for them, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nSchroeder said his hospital takes care of a lot of people who fall through the cracks.\n\n\u201cWe have a fairly high underemployed and unemployed community and I think that contributes to it.\u201d\n\nAt Memorial Hospital in Converse County, things are much better. CEO Ryan Smith says the recent energy boom has helped as has the fact that the hospital took the unique approach of getting doctors in the area to work for the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe pay the salaries of those physicians and have been successful in creating enough volume for those providers to make the whole system work well.\u201d\n\nSmith says a high volume of surgeries also helps pay their bills. But if the economy were to turn or something happens to the affordable care act, Smith says things could change. Smith has been watching legislators try to find ways to help hospitals. He says the solution is fairly simple.\n\n\u201cI think it would make a lot more sense to just pass Medicaid Expansion.\u201d\n\nThat would mean an additional 500-thousand dollars to his hospital alone.\n\nIf the state did expand Medicaid, the federal government would pay Wyoming 100-million dollars, which would make up for the total hospital debt in the state. But that is currently a non-starter for most legislators. That\u2019s why the committee is looking at other solutions. But House Appropriations Committee Chairman Steve Harshman notes that these approaches cost money.\n\n\u201cFor us to step in and thing that we can throw ten, 20, 30 million dollars at it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. We don\u2019t have that kind of budget.\u201d\n\nHarshman also strongly opposes Medicaid Expansion. So what should the state do? He says nothing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just some problems state government just can\u2019t solve.\u201d\n\nLawmakers will continue working on the issue and Senator Charles Scott believes they will be able to provide some help.
