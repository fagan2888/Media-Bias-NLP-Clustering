Re “Justices Block the Obama Administration’s Limits on Power Plant Emissions” (news article, June 30):

After two wonderful, historic landmark decisions — upholding gay marriage and continuing federal subsidies for the Affordable Care Act — the Supreme Court has fallen back to its usual small-minded opinions. Particularly disappointing was the decision to block the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit power plant emissions.

Of all the problems facing the United States and the rest of the world, continuing to pollute the planet must rank at or near the top of the list. Long after there is peace in the Middle East, and the Islamic State is defeated, and poverty and genocide are distant memories, climate change, caused mainly by humankind’s pollution and overpopulation, will take a horrible and devastating toll on planet Earth.

President Obama has outlined a definitive, unilateral plan to curb America’s pollution, and the Supreme Court and Congress should wholeheartedly support it.

This is a win for the Everyman. Yes, we should be addressing climate change and pollution, but with consideration to all the costs we’ve been asked to front. The solution to our environmental problems shouldn’t be extremes of either tens of billions paid for by me and you, or no action at all. Instead, this problem requires a carefully charted course of change, and it requires the development of alternatives that can effectively function on our power grid. Entrepreneurs, start your engines!

In using cost assessment to overrule the Environmental Protection Agency’s restrictions on coal plant emissions, the Supreme Court’s ruling reflected the lament of the novelist Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote: “The good Earth — we could have saved it, but we were too damn cheap and lazy.”

It’s a good thing the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act subsidies. We’ll all need health insurance now that the same court expects us to endure a toxic atmosphere. Apparently the court’s majority opinion on the cost-benefit ratio works like this: We bear the costs, while power companies and mining concerns get to enjoy the benefits.
