Can't believe she actually said this...sounds like a candidate trying to lose OH, PA, VA in the fall. https://t.co/ZkKILFIOiQ \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 14, 2016\n\nOhio, Virginia and Pennsylvania are three of the country\u2019s major coal-producing states. A 2014 ranking put Pennsylvania in fourth place, Ohio in 11th and Virginia in 15th. Outside of these three, other coal-producing states are not likely to forgive Clinton for her statement, like Texas. The Dallas Morning News predicts that clip will fuel many negative ads should she be the Democrats\u2019 nominee.\n\nAmericans who live in coal-producing regions are already concerned about President Obama's regulatory Clean Power Plan. They're not about to vote for someone who just pledged to forward his legacy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes..05/26/2016 12:16:47PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Yes.", "title": "Could Hillary\u2019s Coal Comments Hurt Her Swing State Chances?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/14/could-hillarys-coal-comments-hurt-her-swing-state-chances-n2133519", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/72/0af8ea2f-34b8-4c85-8c23-c83f3042baf4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Yes.", "title": "Could Hillary\u2019s Coal Comments Hurt Her Swing State Chances?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/14/could-hillarys-coal-comments-hurt-her-swing-state-chances-n2133519", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/72/0af8ea2f-34b8-4c85-8c23-c83f3042baf4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Could Hillary\u2019s Coal Comments Hurt Her Swing State Chances?, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2221\"", "article_summary": "Outside of these three, other coal-producing states are not likely to forgive Clinton for her statement, like Texas.\nAmericans who live in coal-producing regions are already concerned about President Obama's regulatory Clean Power Plan.\nOne social media user noted that Clinton\u2019s jarring comments are likely to threaten her support in key swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, where coal is still an important industry.\nhttps://t.co/ZkKILFIOiQ \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 14, 2016Ohio, Virginia and Pennsylvania are three of the country\u2019s major coal-producing states.\nAwkward opening line to answer: \"We're going to put a lot of coal miners out of business.\""}
