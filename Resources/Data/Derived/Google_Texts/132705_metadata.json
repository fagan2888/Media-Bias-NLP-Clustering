If it produces a familiar depression, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen what happens when Republican leaders in the House have used the identical tactics, and most people have little interest in seeing Washington return to battle stations.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, Mr. McConnell, the minority leader, promised to govern through extortion if his party picks up enough seats in November to make him the majority leader come January. He plans to attach provisions to must-pass spending bills that would roll back the administration\u2019s policies, and dare President Obama to veto them.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pass spending bills, and they\u2019re going to have a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s something he won\u2019t like, but that will be done. I guarantee it.\u201d\n\nWhen a spending bill is vetoed, the resulting impasse leads to a shutdown of the affected departments. If no spending bills can pass, the result is a government shutdown like the one that lasted for 16 days last October, after the House tried to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNo one expected Congress to get much done during Mr. Obama\u2019s final years, but Mr. McConnell apparently intends to escalate the level of confrontation. By promising to resort once again to the use of extortion \u2014 and presumably that would extend to raising the debt ceiling \u2014 Mr. McConnell demonstrates that his party lacks positive ideas, and is beholden to its most reactionary elements. Many Republican leaders, including Mr. McConnell himself, seemed to have learned how unpopular the shutdown technique was, and had vowed not to use it again. But the party\u2019s base, as best embodied by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has become addicted to the very act of confrontation, and wants to engage in showdowns whether or not they are fruitful in political or policy terms.\n\nMr. McConnell, the opposite of a firebrand, needs those kinds of voters in Kentucky to survive his current challenge from the Democrat in his race, Alison Lundergan Grimes. That\u2019s probably why the example he gave in his interview was to add restrictions to the Environmental Protection Agency, which has become unpopular among some voters in the state because of its proposed limits to coal-plant emissions.\n\nEven if it\u2019s just a veneer of toughness for campaign purposes, it\u2019s the wrong kind of message to send to voters who are weary of seeing Washington on the brink. It raises expectations among extremists, and will embolden other candidates to make the worst kinds of threats. It also sends a clear message to Democratic voters who are thinking of sitting November out. The midterms matter a great deal.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140821165309, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "McConnell, Mitch", "keywords": "McConnell Mitch,Shutdowns (Institutional),Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/How Mitch McConnell Would Rule the Senate ( 20140821 )", "news_keywords": "Closings,Mitch McConnell", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "David Firestone", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "David Firestone", "byl": "David Firestone", "twitter": {"description": "The minority leader gave the country a glimpse of confrontations to come.", "creator": "@fstonenyt", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/how-mitch-mcconnell-would-rule-the-senate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "title": "How Mitch McConnell Would Rule the Senate", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003068453, "description": "The minority leader gave the country a glimpse of confrontations to come.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "August 21, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1408654389, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-08-21T23:09:40-04:00"}, "utime": 20140821230940, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140821, "pdate": 20140821, "des": "Shutdowns (Institutional)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "The minority leader gave the country a glimpse of confrontations to come.", "title": "How Mitch McConnell Would Rule the Senate", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/how-mitch-mcconnell-would-rule-the-senate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/how-mitch-mcconnell-would-rule-the-senate/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How Mitch McConnell Would Rule the Senate", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "August 21, 2014"}, "article_summary": "PhotoSenator Mitch McConnell gave the country a glimpse this week of what Republican control of the Senate would look like.\nNo one expected Congress to get much done during Mr. Obama\u2019s final years, but Mr. McConnell apparently intends to escalate the level of confrontation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pass spending bills, and they\u2019re going to have a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\nIn an interview with Politico, Mr. McConnell, the minority leader, promised to govern through extortion if his party picks up enough seats in November to make him the majority leader come January.\nHe plans to attach provisions to must-pass spending bills that would roll back the administration\u2019s policies, and dare President Obama to veto them."}
