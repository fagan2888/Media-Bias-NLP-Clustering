Michael Burgess, R-Texas, chairman of the Congressional Health Caucus, has introduced legislation that would expand the use of HSAs and has said Carson\u2019s focus on the issue served as his inspiration.\n\nThe main problem Carson sees with the Affordable Care Act, besides the loss of control by doctors and patients, is that it\u2019s not affordable for many Americans.\n\nCarson said HSAs put people in charge of their own health instead of government bureaucrats and insurance companies.\n\n\u201cThere are a variety of mechanisms for funding it, but basically, with every American having a health savings account, they begin to take part in the financial responsibility for their health,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSo you sprain your ankle? You, along with your health-care provider decide, do I want to get an X-ray? It\u2019s coming out of your HSA. You need a physical exam for a new job? That\u2019s coming out of your HSA. Birth-control pills? Your HSA. No Hobby Lobby situation. There are very few things that are coming out of your major medical or your catastrophic health insurance, so what happens? It drops the price tremendously. And, of course, we make it possible to get your catastrophic health care anywhere in the U.S.\u201d\n\nCarson explained how the HSAs can be structured for maximum flexibility.\n\n\u201cYou also allow flexibility by allowing family members to shift money within their HSAs, so if you fall $500 short, your wife can give it to you out of hers, or your daughter or your grandfather, anybody within the family, which provides enormous flexibility to cover almost any situation that\u2019s going to come up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then if you have a major thing, that comes out of your major medical, which is easily affordable, through your HSA. This makes so much sense, and there are a number of places in the country where large groups of people use HSAs. They are very, very happy with them.\u201d\n\nCarson said there are even examples of countries that have successfully adopted HSAs, such as Singapore.\n\n\u201cThey call them medical savings accounts; they\u2019re all mandatory,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily make it mandatory, because this is America. People get to do what they want. But I think when you make such a compelling argument on something that works so well, you won\u2019t have to force people into it. They will flock to it.\u201d\n\nUnder Obamacare, HSAs are restricted. They can only be purchased under certain insurance plans, and contributions are limited to levels that are often substantially lower than deductibles.\n\nBurgess\u2019 Health Savings Act of 2014 attempts to level the playing field and allow HSAs to be used more broadly.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the so-called Affordable Care Act limits HSAs because, I think, deep in their hearts, they know this is the antidote for the silliness that they\u2019re proposing,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSo, let\u2019s suppress it. Let\u2019s put it back in the box.\u201d\n\nInstead, the government should recognize that when people are responsible for their own health care, \u201cthey are looking for good use of their money,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt brings the whole health-care system back into the free-market realm. That\u2019s what controls quality. That\u2019s what controls pricing.\u201d\n\nAmerica could become \u2018Greece overnight\u2019\n\nObamacare is just one new mandate adding to the debt that is strangling the United States economy, he said.\n\nThe only reason the U.S. is able to continue its out-of-control deficit spending is because the dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and the Fed is able to monetize that debt by printing money.\n\n\u201cWe have to explain to people what this debt means. Seventeen-and-a-half trillion dollars, nobody can understand that,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAt $10 million a day, you\u2019re talking almost 5,000 years (to repay the debt). That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\n\u201cAnd the only reason we can sustain that level of debt is because we can print money; and the only reason we can print money is because we are the world\u2019s reserve currency, a status that generally accompanies the world\u2019s No. 1 economy, which we have been since the 1870s, a designation we are likely to lose in the relatively near future to China.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration likes to talk about the unemployment rate. But, like a doctor reading a thermometer, Carson looks at another statistic that he considers much more reflective of the nation\u2019s economic health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the labor force participation rate. We should have charts we can show the people. It\u2019s been going down steadily, and it\u2019s at its lowest point in 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to educate people about what that means.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a number of countries, including Russia and China, have been pushing for the U.S. dollar to lose its vaunted status as the world\u2019s reserve currency.\n\nThe idea is to develop a \u201cbasket currency,\u201d he noted, in which a number of different currencies would form the basis.\n\nWith the level of debt and unfunded mandates facing the U.S., continuing to print money is a prescription for disaster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at Greece overnight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be chaos in the streets. Occupy Wall Street will be a walk in the park compared to what will be going on as people begin to panic and recognize that they\u2019ve lost everything they\u2019ve ever worked for,\u201d Carson said.\n\n\u201cOf course, they don\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ll tell you who does talk about it: Vladimir Lenin. One of the ways to destroy the United States (according to Lenin)? Unsustainable debt. I just say, people, you\u2019ve got to wake up. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s intentional or not, but whether it\u2019s intentional or not doesn\u2019t matter; we\u2019ll still be destroyed.\u201d\n\nFarah pointed out that, on this particular issue, both parties share the blame.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no responsibility exercised on the Republicans\u2019 part,\u201d Farah said.\n\n\u201cI agree. I\u2019ve been talking to a number of them,\u201d Carson responded. \u201cI think they\u2019re starting to get it. I\u2019m encouraged. I think you\u2019ll start to see some things over the next several months that will begin to pleasantly surprise you. I think they\u2019re actually starting to understand the gravity of the situation. We can\u2019t be playing around anymore. It can\u2019t be business as usual.\u201d\n\nGet Carson\u2019s \u201cOne Nation: What We Need to Do to Save America\u2019s Future\u201d or his \u201cAmerica the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great\u201d at a special price today only!", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is the second of a three-part series that began with \u201cBen Carson uncorks on what\u2019s wrong with America.\u201d Dr. Ben Carson may be retired from the operating room in which he spent so many hours as a brain surgeon, but he\u2019s putting in lots of overtime on fixing America\u2019s broken health-care system.
