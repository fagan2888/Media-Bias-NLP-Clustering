The result has been months-long delays for people \u2014 including mothers of newborns and people with chronic illnesses \u2014 trying to sign up for coverage.\n\nThe state\u2019s situation has drawn federal criticism, and three advocacy groups filed a lawsuit against TennCare last month.\n\nState lawmakers questioned Gordon during a joint fiscal review committee meeting, pressing him for details about the $35.7 million contract with Northrup Grumman to create the computer system.\n\nIt was the first time Tennessee lawmakers have publicly questioned TennCare about the issue, which began to surface early this year.\n\nGordon said he was frustrated with Northrop Grumman, and said the state so far has paid the company only $4.7 million for what has actually been accomplished, he told lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost some faith in their ability to accurately predict when this system will be ready to go,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nBut he added that late federal guidance on how to create the new enrollment systems \u2014 the \u201cmost significant change in Medicaid eligibility since the beginning of the program\u201d \u2014 contributed to the delay. Some rules came as late as July before the October deadline, he said.\n\n\u201cThese are complex systems being implemented in a very tight time frame,\u201d Gordon said, adding that other states have faced similar struggles.\n\nRep. Brenda Gilmore, D-Nashville, asked how the delays were affecting hospitals, saying that she is receiving calls from hospitals, doctors and others complaining about losing money over the delays.\n\n\u201cWe cannot bury our heads in the sand and say this system being delayed a year \u2026 that has not had some impact on our health care infrastructure,\u201d said Gilmore.\n\nGordon said that unlike other states, TennCare did not have an application backlog.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we hear in our communities and neighborhoods,\u201d Gilmore replied.\n\nOther lawmakers appeared sympathetic to TennCare\u2019s situation, blaming the federal government for its own delays. Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis, said the \u201cfederal government put a burden on states to do this,\u201d and called the pending lawsuit a \u201cshame.\u201d\n\nCommittee Chairman Bill Ketron, R-Murfreesboro, criticized the federal health law, saying \u201cmaybe we should call it the affordable cluster act.\u201d\n\nOther states have struggled with implementing Affordable Care Act requirements, but Tennessee has received some of the harshest criticism from federal officials. The state failed to meet six out of seven requirements for the new enrollment process. That\u2019s the most of any state, said Michele Johnson, director of the Tennessee Justice Center, one of the three advocacy groups suing TennCare.\n\nJohnson said Tuesday\u2019s presentation stressed the need for the state to find temporary solutions to bring coverage to people who have been without it for months, including newborns and the elderly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear TennCare is going to have to start from scratch, and that is pretty terrifying,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cHow long can these folks wait?\u201d\n\nSeveral lawmakers asked the same question, but Gordon said he could not give a firm date for the new system to go online. He said the state has hired a third-party auditing firm, KGMT, to review how long completing the system will take.\n\nThe review itself will take 14 weeks and cost $1.2 million.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Northrop Grumman spokeswoman Liz Shrum said the company \u201cremains committed to the success of the TennCare program for our customer and the citizens of Tennessee. We continue to work in conjunction with our customer to implement this complex system.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s federal hearing in Nashville will be the next key development for the lawsuit filed by the TJC, Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Health Law Program.\n\nU.S. District Judge Todd Campbell will determine whether the lawsuit against the Medicaid agency will take on class-action status, and whether the 11 plaintiffs, and potentially hundreds of other Tennesseans, will get quicker access to coverage while the lawsuit is argued \u2014 a process that could take months.\n\n\u00a92014 the Chattanooga Times/Free Press (Chattanooga, Tenn.)", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "The unfinished system, called the \u201cTennessee Eligibility Determination System,\u201d or TEDS, was supposed to begin handling Tennesseans\u2019 Medicaid enrollment last October under the Affordable Care Act.", "pubDate": "2014-08-27", "og": {"title": "TennCare Computer System Delay Draws Federal Criticism"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9865\"", "article_summary": "The state\u2019s situation has drawn federal criticism, and three advocacy groups filed a lawsuit against TennCare last month.\nIt was the first time Tennessee lawmakers have publicly questioned TennCare about the issue, which began to surface early this year.\nState lawmakers questioned Gordon during a joint fiscal review committee meeting, pressing him for details about the $35.7 million contract with Northrup Grumman to create the computer system.\nBecause the system is late, state officials have directed people signing up for TennCare to go through the federal HealthCare.gov site, which isn\u2019t set up to handle it.\nGordon said that unlike other states, TennCare did not have an application backlog."}
