Jack Kingston seems to be the least crazy of the various House Republicans running to replace retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss in Georgia. Why? Ha, I don\u2019t really know; he got into some sort of fight with Real Conservatives recently for suggesting it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cresponsible\u201d to \u201clet Obamacare fall to pieces on its own.\u201d Sometimes he goes on annoying liberal TV shows. Mostly, he\u2019s not Rep. Paul Broun, who is nuts.\n\nAnyway, not-Paul-Broun had a really awful idea the other day! It involves poor children and lunch. Children from families below 130 percent of the federal poverty line can receive free school lunches, children from families between 130 percent and 185 percent of the FPL get reduced prices. This disturbs Jack Kingston, and he believes something must be done.\n\nBut on Saturday, Kingston came out against free lunches, saying that children should have to pay at least a nominal amount or do some work like sweeping cafeteria floors. \u201cBut one of the things I\u2019ve talked to the secretary of agriculture about: Why don\u2019t you have the kids pay a dime, pay a nickel to instill in them that there is, in fact, no such thing as a free lunch? Or maybe sweep the floor of the cafeteria \u2014 and yes, I understand that that would be an administrative problem, and I understand that it would probably lose you money. But think what we would gain as a society in getting people \u2014 getting the myth out of their head that there is such a thing as a free lunch,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what he means about an \u201cadministrative problem\u201d and \u201cit would probably lose you money.\u201d Maybe he and Newt Gingrich can flesh these out in a more developed white paper outlining all of the untapped growth potential in the poor children\u2019s labor force.\n\nA few problems with this do instantly come to mind, though.\n\nOne: Forcing the children from poor families to stick around the cafeteria to sweep up while their better-off friends hitch off to recess would be unnecessarily traumatic to the kid\u2019s psyche, especially as the other kids would make fun of that kid for being so poor. Have you ever seen what children are like? God, they\u2019re awful. The well-off ones would dump their whole lunch trays on the floor and say to the poor kid, \u201cHey, Rags, clean \u2018er up, because ha ha ha, your parents have a low income.\u201d Not only would you be scarring poor kids for life; you\u2019d also give a whole new generation of non-poor kids ample practice time to develop into assholes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
