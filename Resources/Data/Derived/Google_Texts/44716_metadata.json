Opponents of the law say the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, allows for subsidies only in states that run their own exchanges.\n\nThe court's decision could affect an estimated 7 million people who receive subsidies to help pay for the plans and may not be able to afford insurance otherwise. Industry experts say insurers would probably need to raise their rates further if many people do not buy medical coverage after losing subsidies.\n\nAetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said the company had been submitting proposed rates based on the assumption that the subsidies will stay in place. Even if the Supreme Court rules against them, the government or legislators may be able to keep them in place with a new law or administrative rule.\n\n\"If that doesn't happen, then we would need to revisit our rates, and most of the regulators clearly understand that,\" Guertin said in an interview after the company reported its quarterly earnings.\n\nAetna expects the individual exchange business to account for about 6 percent of revenue in 2015, up from about 5 percent last year, and to be \"moderately profitable\" for the year, Guertin said.\n\n\"Right now we are assuming that status quo will prevail for the balance of this year,\" he said. \"Obviously if that changes, then we would change our outlook.\"\n\nAetna said it had 950,000 individuals signed up for Obamacare plans, beating its expectations. More than half were new customers, and about 90 percent of its individual customers receive subsidies, it said.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. insurer, said earlier this month that it had signed up 570,000 Obamacare exchange customers for 2015, also beating expectations.\n\nLeerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said investors expect insurers to face only a small hit to their businesses if the Supreme Court rules against the subsidies.\n\n\"I'm sure that would disrupt their strategic outlook and their business operations and they'd have to rethink it,\" she said, \"but it's not financially very material.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Aetna Inc, the third-largestU.S. health insurer, is submitting 2016 individual insurancerates to state regulators but said it might need to reexaminethem after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the legality of mostObamacare exchange subsidies.", "title": "Aetna submits 2016 Obamacare rates with eye on Supreme Court", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.tags": "AETNA, RESULTS/OBAMACARE", "sailthru.title": "Aetna submits 2016 Obamacare rates with eye on Supreme Court", "keywords": "AETNA,RESULTS/OBAMACARE,United States,Americas", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "AETNA;RESULTS/OBAMACARE;United States;Americas", "sailthru.description": "Aetna Inc, the third-largestU.S. health insurer, is submitting 2016 individual insurancerates to state regulators but said it might need to reexaminethem after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the legality of mostObamacare exchange subsidies.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "Intel", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-28T18:11:29+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everything;AllianzInsurance;AllianzInvestments;Allianz;cfaglobal;aa48hours;MBenz;ubs;Intel;PFG;Fidelity2014;TCS_IN;ABG_IN;CathayPacific_US;MOC_US;USLegal", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Aetna+submits+2016+Obamacare+rates+with+eye+on+Supreme+Court", "DCSext.ContentID": "USL1N0XP2BM20150428", "description": "Aetna Inc, the third-largestU.S. health insurer, is submitting 2016 individual insurancerates to state regulators but said it might need to reexaminethem after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the legality of mostObamacare exchange subsidies.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.ContentID_Intel": "USL1N0XP2BM20150428", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-Intel", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Aetna Inc, the third-largestU.S. health insurer, is submitting 2016 individual insurancerates to state regulators but said it might need to reexaminethem after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the legality of mostObamacare exchange subsidies.", "title": "Aetna submits 2016 Obamacare rates with eye on Supreme Court", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/aetna-results-obamacare-idUSL1N0XP2BM20150428", "article": {"tag": "AETNA,RESULTS/OBAMACARE,United States,Americas", "published_time": "2015-04-28T18:11:29+0000", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T18:11:29+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Apr 28 18:11:29 UTC 2015", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd99\"", "article_summary": "Even if the Supreme Court rules against them, the government or legislators may be able to keep them in place with a new law or administrative rule.\nLeerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said investors expect insurers to face only a small hit to their businesses if the Supreme Court rules against the subsidies.\nNEW YORK Aetna Inc, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, is submitting 2016 individual insurance rates to state regulators but said it might need to reexamine them after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the legality of most Obamacare exchange subsidies.\nUnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. insurer, said earlier this month that it had signed up 570,000 Obamacare exchange customers for 2015, also beating expectations.\nOpponents of the law say the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, allows for subsidies only in states that run their own exchanges."}
