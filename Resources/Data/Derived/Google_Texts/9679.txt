Actress Megan Fox has filed for divorce from actor Brian Austin Green after five years of marriage.

The "Transformers" star cited irreconcilable differences for the breakup.

The pair has two sons together, and the 29-year-old actress is seeking joint custody.

Fox and Green began dating in 2004 and married in 2010. She listed June 15 as their date of separation, and her filing indicates they do not have a prenuptial agreement.

The 42-year-old Green starred on the television series "Beverly Hills, 90210" and appeared on the FX series "Anger Management."

Fox starred in 2014's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" movie and its upcoming sequel.
