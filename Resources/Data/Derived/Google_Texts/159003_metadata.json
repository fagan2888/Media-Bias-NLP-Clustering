Here are some things to watch.\n\nFirst, Republicans are looking to flex their muscles in Congress. So expect President Obama to dust off the veto pen. He\u2019s only used it twice. That\u2019s the least of any president in 130 years since James Garfield. But Garfield had a pretty good reason for not issuing any vetoes. He was shot just four months into office.\n\nSo, what will be the hot issues? First, health care. Republicans like Mitch McConnell, the man who will control the Senate, have said things like this.\n\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, Minority Leader: Look, the American people hate, detest and despise Obamacare. Virtually all of us would like to see it pulled out root and branch. We understand that the president obviously is not sympathetic with that point of view.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO: McConnell knows the White House would block any attempt to overturn the law. What congressional Republicans might pass instead are significant changes, like ending a tax on medical devices, changing the definition of full-time work, so employers would have to cover fewer people, and eliminate an advisory board overseeing Medicare costs.\n\nBut the most important building to watch on health care may be this one, the Supreme Court. The justices will decide by this summer whether people who sign up for Obamacare through a state exchange are allowed to get money from the federal government to lower the cost of their coverage. If the court rules they can\u2019t, the amount people pay would go up, and that would leave the law on life support.\n\nNext issue to watch, the Keystone pipeline.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I want to make sure that if, in fact, this project goes forward, that it\u2019s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO: The president has delayed his decision on whether to approve the pipeline. It would move oil from Canada to the Southern U.S., but environmental groups strongly oppose it.\n\nBefore the president decides on Keystone, Congress may try to force his hand. Republicans want to pass legislation mandating the pipeline\u2019s approval.\n\nBut \u2019tis the season of joy and merriment, even at the Capitol. Is there anything the two sides can do to work on together? One area where McConnell and a Republican Senate could actually help the president, trade.\n\nRemember this fall when President Obama went to Beijing for that Asian economic summit? He\u2019s been trying to pass a trade deal with Pacific Rim countries, but Democrats like outgoing Senate Leader Harry Reid have blocked it. They fear it would outsource jobs.\n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s all the eggnog talking, but some are even thinking about tax reform. But that\u2019s been dangled out there before. If those deep issues aren\u2019t what you political junkies were hoping for, have no fear, 2016 campaigning will soon be here.\n\nHow soon? We will likely see candidates declare this spring. And by the summer, the presidential campaign will be in full swing.\n\nDomenico Montanaro, \u201cPBS NewsHour.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the 114th Congress in place, Obamacare and the Keystone Pipeline are expected to be two of the hottest issues in 2015.
