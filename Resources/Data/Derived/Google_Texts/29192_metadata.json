A dog was killed and a firefighter suffered a minor burn in the blaze.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue and Dallas police narcotics detectives were called to the 9900 block of Carnegie Drive, near Peavy Road, about 2:50 p.m. Smoke was coming from the eaves of a one-story house.\n\nNo people were at home at the time of the fire. Two dogs were in the house, and one died. A firefighter also had a minor burn injury, but was treated at the scene and continued working, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said.\n\nThe fire was extinguished in about 30 minutes and the majority of fire damage was contained to the attic, but Evans said there was smoke damage throughout the house.\n\nInvestigators determined the fire started from an unspecified electrical short in the attic, above the garage.\n\nEvans said it appeared that the home\u2019s circuits were overloaded by multiple power inverters that were being used to run growing lights and a ventilation system for the marijuana plants.\n\nThe plants were turned over to law enforcement, he said.\n\nA Dallas police spokeswoman said she was not aware of any arrests late Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL21hcmlqdWFuYS1wbGFudHMtZm91bmQtZHVyaW5nLWZhci1lYXN0LWRhbGxhcy1ob3VzZS1maXJlLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
