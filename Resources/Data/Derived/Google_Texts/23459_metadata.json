Social issues distracted voters from the winning Republican economic message \u2013 at least that\u2019s what most people believe.\n\nA new report released by American Principles in Action, a 501c4 organization based in Washington, D.C., states that this theory, while widely held, is incorrect.\n\nThe problem with this belief is two-fold. First, the social issues, if played on offense, actually help Republicans win elections. And secondly, the GOP economic message failed to connect with middle class voters immediate economic concerns.\n\nWhen George W. Bush ran for re-election in 2004, the Left never accused him of wanting to ban contraception, redefine rape, or criminalize abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. Why? Because the Left was too busy playing defense. They were too busy explaining why John Kerry supported taxpayer-funded, partial-birth abortions.\n\nIn 2004 the GOP embraced a strategy of playing offense on social issues, instead of a so-called \u201ctruce\u201d on social issues.\n\nFast forward to 2012 and it\u2019s a completely different story.\n\nThe GOP embraced a \u201ctruce\u201d on social issues across the country. And instead of putting Democrats on defense, by forcing them to explain why they sought to roll back health standards on abortion clinics, increase taxpayer funding of abortions, and allow abortions up until the moment of birth, Republicans chose to spin it all back to their economic platform.\n\nBut it really wasn\u2019t a \u201ctruce.\u201d After all, a truce is when there\u2019s a ceasefire on both sides. In this case, it was an unconditional surrender, with the left hammering the right on ridiculous accusations like wanting to make birth control illegal. The GOP waved the \u201cwhite flag\u201d anytime the social issues came up, instead of fighting back and exposing the extremism of Obama and his fellow cronies on the Left.\n\nNational Democrats have never seen an abortion that they didn\u2019t want taxpayers to pay for, and their social agenda is extremely out of touch with voters. In fact, Gallup shows that outside of rape, incest, and first trimester abortions, abortion is extremely unpopular. We\u2019re talking 64% to 24% of Americans saying second trimester abortions should be illegal. The gap grows even more when you ask about third trimester abortions, with 80% to 14% saying these abortions should be illegal.\n\nIn fact, Gallup has consistently shown that only 26% of Americans support the National Democratic platform of \u201cabortion on demand and without apology.\"\n\nSo why surrender on an issue that Republicans consistently win on? Why allow the left to have an open net to score as many goals on social issues as possible, especially when Democrats are much less in sync with voters? It makes absolutely no sense. And this is why the GOP continues to lose elections.\n\nThe truce on social issues isn\u2019t a truce, it\u2019s a suicide pact.\n\nBut for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say that social issues did distract from the GOP\u2019s economic message in 2012. What was that message?\n\nPut simply, it was that America needed to lower taxes and address the growing national debt to create a better environment for \u201cjob creators\u201d, so they could hire more people and expand their businesses\u2014 thus growing the economy.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that this statement is false. It\u2019s actually very true. The problem is that this statement doesn\u2019t connect with the immediate economic concerns of the middle class, aka the large majority of voters.\n\nIn fact, this economic platform isn\u2019t really aimed at the middle class at all. It\u2019s aimed at giving immediate and direct help to employers and business owners, and rather quite indirect help to workers.\n\nRepublicans need a message that focuses on the immediate economic concerns of the middle class. They have obvious openings to start doing this, and they need to start \u2013 right now.\n\nThey should tie Obamacare to workers\u2019 shrinking standard of living. Many workers are losing their jobs, losing their health care, their hours are being cut below 30 hours a week, and they are watching their paychecks remain stagnant as a direct result of Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans should also tie deficit spending to the stagnation and decrease in workers wages over the past few years. After all, from 2009-2012 the median wage for workers aged 25-64 has fell by as high as 9.7%. Over the same period we saw record deficits and massive pumping from the Federal Reserve.\n\nTalking more about workers and families will help the GOP immensely. Coupled with fighting the good fight on social issues and exposing the Left as the extremists they are, we could see a Republican resurgency in 2014 and beyond.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone knows why the GOP lost in 2012.
