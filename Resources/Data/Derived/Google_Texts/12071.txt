David Palmer is home.

Palmer is the 77-year-old man with dementia who was missing since leaving Nogales, AZ Wednesday afternoon. Police suspected he was in Mexico because his credit cards had been used to make small purchases that were less than $50 at a time.

"God was his co-pilot," his wife Norma said in an interview, adding that Palmer was in some "dangerous places in Mexico."

After the Pima County Sheriff's Department held a press conference Friday, Norma Palmer received a phone call from him while the case detective was seated beside her. Palmer was using someone else's cell phone to call from a gas station in Mexico. The detective was able to speak to the owner of the phone and determined Palmer was in Yecora, Mexico, a remote part of the country about four hours' drive southeast of Hermosillo, according to a PCSD media release.

Detectives contacted Mexican authorities, who found Palmer and drove him to Hermosillo, where he spent the night before the FBI picked him up and helped facilitate his return to his family, according to the release.

Norma Palmer said she is grateful to the PCSD and FBI as well as to KOLD reporter Som Lisaius for his coverage and said the family requests privacy at this time.
