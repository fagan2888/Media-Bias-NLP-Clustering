(Pet peeve: You can\u2019t win \u201cthree Stanley Cups.\u201d While it has been reconfigured over the years, there is only one, the one that has been both maltreated and revered for more than a century, and that\u2019s part of the charm.)\n\nEven if the Tampa Bay Lightning comes back to win Games 6 and 7 in the NHL Final, the path the Lightning will have taken to win its second championship in 11 years includes lessons \u2014 or encouragement \u2014 for the Avalanche.\n\nThe Blackhawks and Lightning tore down and rebuilt too.\n\nThey took advantage of early first-round picks to land stars, savvily found strong players in the second round and beyond and made other sound organizational moves to land key contributors.\n\nThe Blackhawks also managed to pare in the salary cap age, adjust and not slip \u2026 at least not much or for long.\n\nAvalanche coach Patrick Roy, such a crucial part of Colorado\u2019s championships in 1996 and 2001, often has cited the Blackhawks as an organization to emulate.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the Avalanche\u2019s regular-season achievement in 2013-14, when it won the Central Division with 112 points and finished five ahead of the Blackhawks in Roy\u2019s first season as an NHL coach, even more remarkable in retrospect.\n\nThen came last season\u2019s first-to-last slide in the Central Division. That led to the curious sight of four Avalanche players \u2014 Matt Duchene, Ryan O\u2019Reilly, Nathan MacKinnon and Tyson Barrie \u2014 playing key roles in Canada\u2019s championship at the IIHF World Championship in the Czech Republic rather than helping lead Colorado deeper into the NHL playoffs.\n\nSome conclusions about the Colorado regression were indisputable, including the defense\u2019s weakness at moving the puck, spending way too much time in the defensive zone, a puzzlingly horrible power play given the personnel and a lack of scoring capability beyond the top two lines.\n\nIt also would be unfair to completely dismiss the injury toll as excuse-making, because while much of it came after the season\u2019s tone was set, it still was extraordinary and lessened the chances of a stirring stretch-run recovery.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been watching the Stanley Cup Final, matching teams that landed cornerstones with high picks after lean years, it has struck me at times that we\u2019re overthinking this.\n\nThe Avalanche needs Duchene, Gabe Landeskog, O\u2019Reilly, MacKinnon and Erik Johnson, the No. 1 choice in the 2006 NHL draft who was having a career year before undergoing knee surgery in late January, to be stars.\n\nNot just be stars in streaks, but stars, period.\n\nThey need to be (or become) to the Avalanche what Jonathan Toews (age 27), Patrick Kane (26) and others are for the Blackhawks, and what Steven Stamkos (25), Victor Hedman (24) and others are for the Lightning. Stamkos doesn\u2019t have a goal in the Final, but he had 43 in the regular season while still at less than full strength after coming back from a broken tibia.\n\nThe biggest challenge there should be for Duchene, who went third overall in the 2009 draft, behind John Tavares of the Islanders and Hedman, the Swedish defenseman considered to be on the verge of greatness. It\u2019s past time for Duchene to step up among the elite. MacKinnon\u2019s slippage in his second year isn\u2019t a shocker, considering he\u2019s still a teenager \u2026 unless it\u2019s more a sign of things to come than his electrifying rookie season was.\n\nAbsolutely, Colorado should sign a top-flight defenseman in the free agency period. It also should sign O\u2019Reilly to a contract extension or trade him. But the biggest step would be for the core to answer the challenge and live up to the faith \u2026 and be great.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Avalanche can build team the same way Blackhawks, Lightning did", "title": "Frei: Avalanche can build team the same way Blackhawks, Lightning did", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/14/frei-avalanche-can-build-team-the-same-way-blackhawks-lightning-did/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-14T21:44:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:46:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "The Blackhawks and Lightning tore down and rebuilt too.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks, with former Avalanche coach Joel Quenneville behind the bench, are one victory from winning the Stanley Cup for the third time in six seasons.\nAvalanche coach Patrick Roy, such a crucial part of Colorado\u2019s championships in 1996 and 2001, often has cited the Blackhawks as an organization to emulate.\nThe Blackhawks also managed to pare in the salary cap age, adjust and not slip \u2026 at least not much or for long.\nThe Avalanche needs Duchene, Gabe Landeskog, O\u2019Reilly, MacKinnon and Erik Johnson, the No."}
