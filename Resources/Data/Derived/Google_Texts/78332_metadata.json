Jim Stansberry, executive director of Project Ninety, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program in San Mateo, received recognition for his longtime work to help others fight substance abuse. The county health services division presented Stansberry, 76, with the David Lewis Award this past week, bringing a crowd of those he\u2019s helped over the years, his friends, family and community members. The award is presented annually to an individual who has made a significant contribution to substance abuse recovery through successful programs, community education, stigma reduction or client advocacy. Lewis, an educator and leader in the field of substance abuse recovery and prisoner rehabilitation, was murdered outside Hillsdale Shopping Center in 2010. Stansberry, one of the co-founders of Project Ninety, became executive director of the organization July 1, 1989. Since its founding more than 40 years ago, more than 20,000 people have walked through the doors of organization. Lewis, who went through the Project Ninety program, is one of its success stories. \u201cThe aim of everything is recovery,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cTo correct their own lives and assist others. Addiction affects the addict\u2019s life, the community and the addict\u2019s family\u2019s lives.\u201d He notes that addiction affects five to 10 other people\u2019s lives other than his or her own. Stansberry himself dealt with his own alcoholism when he lived in New York years ago. He was arrested a few times as a result of being intoxicated and found himself living on the streets. From there, he met the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous and began recovery work there, as there weren\u2019t many established programs at the time. What are some of the challenges that face Project Ninety? \u201cWe deal with actual addiction,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cThen there\u2019s running the organization, having the financing and making sure we\u2019re financially sound. These are two separate types of challenges.\u201d At the moment, the nonprofit is trying to decipher changes with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe believe it will draw more people since more people will be able to get services,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people on our waiting list and we hope it will enable other people with addictions to come in.\u201d What does the future hold for Project Ninety? \u201cI want to keep what\u2019s already working and keep the same principles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d also like to make it available to more people.\u201d He has seen his share of success stories, but there are also those who slip away. \u201cYou learn you don\u2019t have control,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cThe drugs are sometimes stronger and it\u2019s a strong thing to change. Even for those who relapse \u2014 you\u2019ll hope they find their way down the road and that you\u2019ve planted a seed they\u2019ll utilize at a later time.\u201d He has been married to his wife Donna for 23 years and has two stepchildren, Grant and Shane. angela@smdailyjournal.com (650) 344-5200 ext. 105", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Nonprofit leader receives David Lewis Award: Jim Stansberry heads Project Ninety, a San Mateo substance abuse program -", "title": "Nonprofit leader receives David Lewis Award: Jim Stansberry heads Project Ninety, a San Mateo substance abuse program - San Mateo Daily Journal", "url": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2013-09-07/nonprofit-leader-receives-david-lewis-award-jim-stansberry-heads-project-ninety-a-san-mateo-substance-abuse-program/1774925.html", "image": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/adv_image/smdj-large.jpg", "ttl": 2592000, "type": "website"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000103315106, "app_id": 484828421538257}, "GENERATOR": "San Mateo Daily Journal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa12\"", "article_summary": "Jim Stansberry, executive director of Project Ninety, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program in San Mateo, received recognition for his longtime work to help others fight substance abuse.\nLewis, who went through the Project Ninety program, is one of its success stories.\nStansberry, one of the co-founders of Project Ninety, became executive director of the organization July 1, 1989.\nFrom there, he met the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous and began recovery work there, as there weren\u2019t many established programs at the time.\nWhat are some of the challenges that face Project Ninety?"}
