Carswell will be the first elected UKIP member of the House of Commons, an event UKIP leader Nigel Farage has claimed will \"shift the tectonic plates\" of British politics.\n\nCarswell\u2019s election comes at a pivotal time for UKIP, with the party\u2019s evolving ideological identity drawing increasing attention from commentators and supporters alike. Their changing identity has involved a slow abandonment of libertarian principles in favor of a strongly anti-immigrant form of populist nationalism.\n\nThis slow drift toward statism has previously been covered by Reason\u2019s Tom Clougherty, but recent reports from Brietbart London suggest that UKIP has now abandoned libertarianism altogether. Alex Wickham writes:\n\nA few months ago, UKIP\u2019s website offered a one line description of itself as \u201ca libertarian, non-racist party seeking withdrawal from the European Union\u201d. At some point between then and now, that description changed. It now reads: \u201cUKIP is a patriotic party that promotes independence: from the EU, and from government interference\u201d. A subtle difference, but a notable one. UKIP has abandoned its claim to represent a \u2018libertarian\u2019 political ideology. [emphasis added]\n\nWickham goes on to discuss how the party has reversed its opposition to Britain\u2019s National Healthcare System (NHS) and has even begun attacking libertarianism by name.\n\nThe article provoked a quick response from Tom Bursnall, a UKIP member of the Windsor and Maidenhead Council and of UKIP\u2019s National Executive Committee. Bursnall claimed that UKIP remained a \u201clibertarian party\u201d but that the change in branding was necessary for the party to appeal to a broader section of the electorate:\n\nDoes the average chap on the streets of Basingstoke or Bromley know the philosophical attractions of Neo Classical Liberalism? Probably not \u2013 so, best to communicate on a level we all understand\u2026In short we are appealing to a broader spectrum of voters than both the Tories and Labour.\n\nPutting aside his reference to \u201cNeo Classical Liberalism,\u201d a pejorative term generally used by progressives to create an artificial division between enlightenment-era (classical) liberalism and modern libertarianism, Burnsnall still fails to take into account the effect UKIP\u2019s change of strategy has had on the party\u2019s makeup.\n\nAs Wickham notes:\n\nThe party has lost a considerable amount of support from libertarian-leaning people in the last two years, people who made up an important core only a couple of years ago, who have now left the party in disgust.\n\nThis shouldn't come as a surprise. There has long been tension within UKIP between its embrace of libertarianism and its embrace of British nationalism. These two conflicting ideological viewpoints were mostly able to coexist while UKIP remained a predominantly EU-focused party. However, the pursuit of domestic electoral success has placed this coexistence under increasing strain.\n\nUltimately, the libertarianism that existed within UKIP was doomed the moment its leadership decided to base its electoral strategy on an anti-immigrant fearmongering campaign. Bringing new voters and members into the fold had a significant influence on the makeup of the party. From there, it was only a matter of time before the libertarian label, and certain libertarian polices, would start to be seen as electoral liabilities.\n\nIf their current approach continues, even UKIP\u2019s raison d'etre may be put at risk. The success of efforts to exit the EU will depend on garnering support from across the political spectrum\u2014support that will be far harder to attract if opponents are able to tie an EU exit to UKIP\u2019s anti-immigrant populism.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "", "title": "Is UKIP\u2019s Slow Abandonment of Libertarianism Now Complete?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/09/is-ukips-slow-abandonment-of-libertarian", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14128909583102.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The UK Independence Party\n(UKIP) looks set for a night of celebration, with \nthe likely victory of Douglas Carswell in the Clacton\nby-election.
