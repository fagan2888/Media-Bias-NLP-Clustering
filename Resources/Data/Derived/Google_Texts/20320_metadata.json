The vast majority of Americans eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare are able-bodied, working age adults with no dependent children.\n\n\u201cAs of October 2014, approximately 9.7 million additional Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP \u2013 a 17 percent increase over the average monthly enrollment for July through September 2013, the months before the Marketplaces first opened,\u201d Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services director Cindy Mann boasted.\n\n\u201cEnrollment in Medicaid and CHIP happens year-round and states can expand their Medicaid programs to cover more people at any time,\u201d Mann said. \u201cAnd, even more Americans could access affordable coverage if all states take the Medicaid expansion option.\n\n\u201cCoverage for newly eligible adult beneficiaries is fully federally paid for under the Affordable Care Act through 2016, and never less than 90 percent for the years following. This is a good deal for states.\u201d\n\nMann is a former research professor at the left-wing Georgetown University Health Policy Institute and a former policy director at the leftist Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is working, especially in states that expanded Medicaid,\u201d Judy Solomon, CBPP vice president for health policy, said in an email to Watchdog.org. \u201cThose states are seeing dramatic drops in the share of people without insurance and are experiencing slower growth in their state Medicaid costs than states that have failed to expand.\n\n\u201cThe most important further Medicaid eligibility change would be for more states to adopt the expansion.\u201d\n\nConservative groups are skeptical both of adding millions to Medicaid and of the Obamacare funding promised to compliant states.\n\n\u201cObamacare is turning into basically a Medicaid expansion,\u201d Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Ed Haislmaier told Watchdog in a phone interview. \u201cThere are people who actually think that\u2019s a good thing, of course, including the people running HHS.\u201d\n\nIn October, Haislmaier coauthored a Heritage report showing 71 percent of Obamacare\u2019s health insurance coverage gains through the first half of the year resulted from Medicaid expansion.\n\nMedicaid expansion is, in Mann\u2019s words, \u201ca good deal for states\u201d because Obamacare includes a much higher Federal Medical Assistance Percentage than states receive for the children, elderly, disabled and impoverished families that Medicaid formerly was restricted to.\n\n\u201cI think Congress taking the expansion FMAP back down to normal FMAP should absolutely be on top of their agenda, both for fiscal reasons and for reasons of equity and fairness,\u201d Haislmaier said.\n\nRepublicans have indicated their interest in doing just that.\n\n\u201cWhy should a state get more money from the federal government for insuring, through Medicaid, an able-bodied working age adult who isn\u2019t working very much, but get less money from the federal government for taking care of, through Medicaid, a poor child who has no control over their circumstances, or a disabled adult who can\u2019t work?\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 inclusion of an enhanced Medicaid FMAP in Obamacare was purely political, Haislmaier said.\n\n\u201cThe only reason the enhanced match rate was in there was to effectively bribe the states against suing and getting their unconstitutional action overturned; the states went ahead and did it anyway. The states won,\u201d Haislmaier said.\n\nObamacare was written to withhold traditional Medicaid funding from any state refusing to expand Medicaid to everyone with income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. This provision was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2012.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for an enhanced match rate for this population and it\u2019s completely unfair to have the enhanced match rate for this population when, for the population that most needs Medicaid, the state is getting half as much from the federal government \u2014 and is encouraged to put them at the back of the line,\u201d Haislmaier said.\n\n\u201cThink about it. If a state is getting more money for enrolling newly eligibles than for the traditional population and the state has to save money, what do you do? You cut pediatricians. Why? Because you don\u2019t get as much to pay for the pediatricians, because your population there is kids and they\u2019re at the normal match rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unjustifiable, and it\u2019s money the federal government doesn\u2019t have and can\u2019t afford to spend anyway.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's administration began celebrating Christmas early by announcing 9.7 million Americans have enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in the past year.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "President Obama's administration began celebrating Christmas early by announcing 9.7 million Americans have enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in the past year.", "title": "Obama administration celebrates Medicaid enrollment explosion - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/barack-obama-white-house-2014-11-27.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-20T15:19:46+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/188419/obama-admin-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "President Obama's administration began celebrating Christmas early by announcing 9.7 million Americans have enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in the past year.", "title": "Obama administration celebrates Medicaid enrollment explosion - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/barack-obama-white-house-2014-11-27.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2014-12-23T04:00:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T15:19:46+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, HHS, CMS, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare Medicaid expansion, Ed Haislmaier, Heritage Foundation, Obamacare FMAP"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEnrollment in Medicaid and CHIP happens year-round and states can expand their Medicaid programs to cover more people at any time,\u201d Mann said.\nThe vast majority of Americans eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare are able-bodied, working age adults with no dependent children.\n\u201cThose states are seeing dramatic drops in the share of people without insurance and are experiencing slower growth in their state Medicaid costs than states that have failed to expand.\n\u201cObamacare is turning into basically a Medicaid expansion,\u201d Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Ed Haislmaier told Watchdog in a phone interview.\n\u201cAnd, even more Americans could access affordable coverage if all states take the Medicaid expansion option."}
