Founder and chief executive Michael Dellid a day after Dell Inc. shareholders approved his $25 billion buyout bid that taking the company private will help give it “long-term focus.”

In an interview on CNBC, he said: “It’s really about changing our focus from a quarterly focus to more of a longer term, five-year, 10-year focus, doubling down on the investments that are really needed for this company to be able to serve its customers.”

He said Dell’s “next billion customers” would come from extending its reach into emerging markets, and that the company would continue to make acquisitions and expand its sales force.

Emphasizing the company’s main business was its enterprise business, Mr. Dell said the company was focused on “powering those clouds that are being fueled by this enormous explosion of mobile devices.”

Dell will participate in tablets and other client devices, he said, but “won’t be getting into the mobile phone business.”
