I mean \u201cmad as hell\u201d as seen here in some YouTube scenes from the 1976 film \u201cNetwork.\u201d It\u2019s OK to be anchorman, vein popping, red-faced, trembling, just this far from a CVA, angry. Because the Republican Party and their despicable proxies, the Koch brothers, deserve every blood pressure point of that anger. And you don\u2019t have \u201cto take it anymore.\u201d\n\nSouthern Democrats never get Beale angry with Southern Republicans. They just shake their hands at the local Rotary club. And that\u2019s why the Southern Democratic Party is, for the most part, politically impotent. There is one exception to the Southern Democratic repression of their anger. While said Democrats never get angry with people who are destroying the South and most other regions of America, they do manage to vent their hostility on the rare Democrat who does get righteously angry.\n\nWell, be prepared Southern Democrats; \u2019cause I\u2019m about to let loose. A couple of things have happened recently that got my blood boiling. I\u2019ve written about the capitulation of both the University of South Carolina Upstate and the College of Charleston over the issue of books and discussions of what it\u2019s like to be gay in the south (miserable) and an ongoing symposium at USC-Upstate on essentially the same subject. The chancellor of USC-Upstate forced the academic director of the symposium to pull a segment that two local state senators, Lee Bright and Michael Fair, in particular didn\u2019t like. I\u2019ve already written about the intimidating \u201cvisit\u201d to the chancellor to force his hand. The chancellor then proceeded to put the head of the Symposium under the bus by announcing from the podium the first day that \u201cWE\u201d agreed\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe College of Charleston rolled over completely. They\u2019re going to change their whole approach to the question of educating incoming freshmen about one of the great societal problems of our time; the ongoing discrimination and mistreatment of the gay population. Now, the inescapable conclusion is that students at the school have heard the last of anything substantive, sympathetic or relevant to the ongoing gay issue other than, I\u2019m sure, some subtle demonizing.\n\nThe awesomely homophobic Republican majority in the legislature responded by demonstrating what happens when you play nice to ignorant dictators. An amendment suddenly popped up in the general assembly, rewarding the College of Charleston\u2019s reversal of its initial reasonable approach to the gay issue, with the new and potentially lucrative designation as a research university, created within the college itself. There\u2019s only one other official research university in the state.\n\nThat\u2019s how it works. Bow to the narrow-minded power brokers and the dollars come raining down on your institution of higher learning. Sass, and funding won\u2019t budge from the budget.\n\nThe second thing that fired me up was an AP story of the human detritus called the Koch brothers, who are taking advantage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) for their own selfish benefits while funding every conceivable negative commercial slamming Democratic senate candidates supporting ACA in critical states. AP quotes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as noting that Koch Industries \u2018Early Retirement Program\u2019 benefited from a temporary provision in the health care law. The provision actually \u201chelped the company pay health insurance costs for its retirees who are not covered by Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe Koch brothers are a throwback to the Robber Baron era of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Baron\u2019s with such easily recognizable names as Astor, Carnegie, Mellon, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. The term was first coined by Atlantic Monthly magazine. The Robber Baron\u2019s modus operandi involved controlling the government, cheating wherever possible, paying absurdly low wages and acquiring (with no DC resistance) enough companies to constitute monopolies so large as to quell any meaningful competition, plus the control of natural resources (oil and natural gas anyone?).\n\nJust a word about the Vanderbilts, past and present. The money flow started with perv (he married his first cousin) Cornelius \u201cCommodore\u201d Vanderbilt. A string of inheritances enabled a bunch of Vanderbilts to swim in money. They loved homes and one decided to build a summer home nestled in Asheville, North Carolina\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains. What\u2019s not to like? Here are some mind-blowing stats. The \u2018home\u2019 totals nearly 180,000 square feet, just shy of a Walmart Supercenter and about 100 times larger than your humble domicile. There are 250 rooms that sit on 8,000 acres compared to your 1/3rd of an acre, if you\u2019re lucky. The original acreage was 125,000. It\u2019s called the Biltmore Estate.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got around $60 to blow for the pauper\u2019s tour of Biltmore House (guideless, you\u2019re on your own), have at it. It\u2019ll take about 3 \u00bd hours or so, then you can wander the grounds and figure out other ways to give the Vanderbilt\u2019s your money. They still run the operation.\n\nAnd what has changed since the robber baron days? Nothing for the better. Capitalism has run even more amuck. When 8 people make as much as 3.6 million people, we\u2019ve almost reached the point of no return. And when the McCutcheon v. FEC 5-4 decision by the corporate-controlled anti-American wing of 5 radical Supreme Court justices commits the near-treasonous, money laundering (as described by ThinkProgress) act of giving our country over to a handful of billionaires and corporate monopolies, we\u2019re finished as a viable, reasonable nation and have entered an era of economic slavery where we\u2019re all black and we all serve the man!\n\nWhat drives people like the Koch brothers? They\u2019ve made their money. They\u2019re now worth $40 billion apiece. These two are sick puppies. I wouldn\u2019t offend those challenged by mental illness, by saying the Koch brothers are mentally challenged. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re sick; greedy egomaniacs who don\u2019t give a tinker\u2019s damn about anybody but themselves and maybe their families. They\u2019re laughingly described in many quarters as philanthropists. Any money they give away, is either to lower an already non-existent tax bill, a strategic corporate move or to deflect attention away from their true purpose in life, the destruction of a meaningful existence for those making less than a million a year.\n\nDavid Koch will be 74 in May; Charles 79 in November. I want them to go away. I want America to change direction, or to put it another way, I want my country back. I don\u2019t want to be personally beholden to the likes of the Kochs and their pernicious posse. I want people with stagnant wages to rethink their absurd and totally uninformed objections to ACA, financial regulations, unions, clean air and water, public education, women and minorities rights. When they\u2019re finally informed, please win the day back for the good guys at the polls.\n\nI want Democratic men and women, using whatever communications available to \u2018out\u2019 the likes of the Kochs and their ilk. We\u2019re fast approaching the last roundup.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I want Democratic men and women, using whatever communications available to 'out' the likes of the Kochs and their ilk.
