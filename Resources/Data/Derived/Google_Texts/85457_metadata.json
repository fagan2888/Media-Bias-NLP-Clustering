I was drinking coffee, and if you want to know the truth, I was probably wearing pajamas, or at least leggings. Someone had retweeted the ad with a dismissive remark about Obama or man-boys or something, and I sighed and moved on.\n\nBut apparently a lot of people haven\u2019t moved on. Apparently to a number of people, the biggest problem with this ad is that it represents everything that\u2019s wrong with American masculinity today.\n\nLet me say at first that there are certainly problems with this ad \u2014 mostly that it\u2019s just not good advertising. In the San Francisco Chronicle, ad exec Jeff Goodby \u2014 an Obama supporter and the man behind the \u201cGot Milk\u201d ads \u2014 says that Pajama Boy doesn\u2019t work because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in it for you. There\u2019s nothing in it for the person to respond to except that you should get on with your day and don\u2019t forget to apply for your healthcare. They have to make an incentive for people to sign up early \u2014 they have to make it worth their while. And right now, no one is doing it and it\u2019s dead in the water. It\u2019s a real problem for the program.\u201d\n\nBut there are bigger problems with Obamacare than just the ad: So far, it\u2019s not working well, and if it doesn\u2019t get the healthy 20-somethings to sign up, it won\u2019t ever function the way it should.\n\nSo a bad ad isn\u2019t just a poor use of money; it\u2019s actually dangerous. If poor marketing means young people fail to recognize that they need healthcare coverage, then the nation will have an even bigger problem than the one we already have with the dysfunctional Obamacare website.\n\nClearly, there are problems with this ad, and with the healthcare reform as it\u2019s functioning now. But this ad is not about manhood. Full stop. Let me repeat. This is an ad about healthcare, not about masculinity. Nothing in this ad is trying to tell us what it means to be a man.\n\nIf the accompanying text said, \u201cMan up \u2014 get health insurance!\u201d or \u201cEven whiny mamas\u2019 boys can get off their parents\u2019 health insurance now!\u201d or \u201cReal men get health insurance,\u201d then maybe we could have that talk.\n\nBut this is an ad about insurance, not manhood.\n\nThe articles popping up comparing this ad to other ads or pictures of men from past generations as a way to decry the decline of manhood are agenda-driven \u201canalysis.\u201d Phil Cooke has done this, comparing the ad to an iconic Life magazine cover, and Tim Wright has as well, comparing the man in the ad to the Marlboro Man. (To be fair, Wright seasoned his argument with plenty of caveats, unlike Cooke, who seems to believe the images he\u2019s manipulated speak for themselves.)\n\nBut this kind of argument is easy enough to refute. Choose two pictures that support your thesis! Decide they are icons of masculinity! Create a meme that many people will instinctively agree with, based upon stereotypes of manhood! Use it to your personal and political advantage!\n\nIt\u2019s poor stewardship of your time and your platform to try to turn this serious problem about healthcare into a false problem of \u201cmanhood.\u201d Thousands of uninsured (who, let me assure you, do not all fit your stereotypes) desperately need this \u2014 or some kind of reform \u2014 to work.\n\nThe real problem with these responses to the ad for Obamacare is that they obfuscate an important issue in favor of a made-up problem. The made-up problem is easier to understand, catchier, and fun to get self-righteously upset about. The real problem is complex, hard to imagine unless you\u2019ve lived without health insurance, and complicated to solve. But I tend to think that if we Americans could actually listen to each other \u2014 and if we could work together instead of just talking past each other to the people who already agree with us \u2014 well, then we might be able fix it.\n\nInstead we waste our time getting up in arms about a man in pajamas.\n\nAnd let me just say for the record that it doesn\u2019t do anyone any good \u2014 least of all, men \u2014 for us to reduce manhood to looking tough, or to being a fighter or a rugged individualist. If this was, in fact, about manhood, so what?\n\nConsider the setting. It\u2019s Christmas vacation. And the place where I want my father, my husband, my brothers and my son to be on Christmas morning is not riding off into the mythic west or toting a gun in a distant land. I want them pajama-clad. And cocoa-drinking. I want them in front of a roaring fireplace while we open gifts. I want to be talking about our lives, our faith, and sure, why not?
