HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d from last year, is an adaptation of a 1985 play that starts its storytelling in 1981. \u201cBehind the Candelabra,\u201d made in 2013, ends with Liberace dying of AIDS in 1987. The Oscar-nominated 2009 film \u201cPrecious\u201d was based on the novel \u201cPush,\u201d published in 1996; the similarly lauded \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d (2013) is set in the mid-\u201880s, and the script was first drafted all the way back in 1992. Whether it\u2019s remakes of milestones in activist theater, like \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and \u201cAngels in America,\u201d or a new depiction about a past event, like \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d or last year\u2019s British dramedy \u201cPride,\u201d the implication is the same: The time when AIDS mattered is in the past.\n\nExcept on HBO\u2019s original series \u201cLooking,\u201d a half-hour slice-of-life show about the gay male community in San Francisco. (It\u2019s worth noting that outside of HBO, television would not be saying anything about AIDS at all; both TV movies above are also from the network.) This season, one of the show\u2019s protagonists has met and fallen in love with an HIV-positive man named Eddie, played by Daniel Franzese (who before this role made his reputation on the iconic 2004 film \u201cMean Girls\u201d). The second season, which concludes Sunday night, has charted Eddie\u2019s romance with Agust\u00edn (Frankie J. Alvarez), following the ups and downs not just of their commitment to each other but of the particular issues linked to a mixed-status relationship\u2014the rhythm of drug dosages, the technicalities of precautionary measures, and of course, the anxiety of possible infection.\n\nEddie stands very alone. The last character on television to be HIV-positive in their present-day timeline was Ron Rifkin\u2019s character Saul Holden on ABC\u2019s \u201cBrothers and Sisters,\u201d in a story line that unfolded from 2009 to 2011. Before that, Adam Brody had a role in 2009 on FX\u2019s \u201cThe League\u201d as an HIV-positive character whose status is played up for laughs (the self-absorbed protagonists wonder if his medication makes him better at fantasy football than they are). In the past decade, the number of HIV-positive characters on American TV is so small you can count it on one hand, depending on whether you count animated characters (\u201cSouth Park\u201d) or teen soap operas (\u201cThe Best Years\u201d).\n\n\u201cLooking\u201d offers a very rare portrait of modern-day infection, one overlaid with both worry and a great deal of hope\u2014Eddie is living a life that would have been unthinkable for most HIV-positive people just a few short years ago. I sat down with Franzese, who is himself an ambassador for the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to talk about the unique challenges of playing an HIV-positive character who is in the process of falling for someone negative.\n\nWhat is very poignant about this story line is this very terrifying disease lurking underneath what is otherwise the stuff of regular life\u2014 breakups and making up and going out and whatever. It\u2019s a challenge to translate both the run-of-the-mill concerns and the very real, dangerous stuff, and a lot of that has come through in your performance.\n\nI have such a gracious scene partner in Frankie J. Alvarez. He really was just as committed to telling this story as I was, and telling our [characters\u2019] identity as a couple. We knew the potentially shielding effect that this would have on audience members; I definitely think people who aren\u2019t in this sort of mixed-status relationship could still take away from a romance from this but what I\u2019ve been most happy about is the response that I\u2019ve gotten from people who are in mixed-status relationships who have seen this.\n\nI think just in general, regardless of status, everybody feels sometimes that they\u2019re in a position where something like that in a relationship is a deal breaker. People have a little trepidation sometimes letting their heart let go, for some reason, and I felt this story line would have to be a mix of that and this issue, but in every relationship, everyone has something that makes them hold back.\n\nI just came back this weekend from being a special guest at this bear convention, Texas Bear Roundup in Dallas, and so many people would come up to me privately and say, I\u2019m positive and my partner is negative and I can\u2019t tell you how many times we\u2019ve had a scare or how many times I\u2019ve been through that with other men.\n\nThe feedback that I got was, I wish I could\u2019ve watched this season with my partner when we first started liking each other, so we could have had an idea of the things we might encounter. I would know how PrEP can help and how it\u2019s natural to be afraid sometimes, and how to deal with that. I think watching that play out is going to help a lot of couples in the future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon spoke to Franzese about his groundbreaking role and Hollywood's outdated approach to HIV/AIDS", "title": "Daniel Franzese on HBO\u2019s \u201cLooking\u201d: Finally, an HIV-positive character living in the here and now", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon spoke to Franzese about his groundbreaking role and Hollywood's outdated approach to HIV/AIDS", "title": "Daniel Franzese on HBO\u2019s \u201cLooking\u201d: Finally, an HIV-positive character living in the here and now", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/daniel_franzese_on_hbos_looking_finally_an_hiv_positive_character_living_in_the_here_and_now/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/looking4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon spoke to Franzese about his groundbreaking role and Hollywood's outdated approach to HIV/AIDS", "title": "Daniel Franzese on HBO\u2019s \u201cLooking\u201d: Finally, an HIV-positive character living in the here and now", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/looking4.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AIDS, daniel franzese, Editor's Picks, HBO, HIV, Looking", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9ea\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AIDS, daniel franzese, Editor's Picks, HBO, HIV, Looking, Entertainment NewsMost films and TV shows made in recent years that address HIV are period pieces.\nExcept on HBO\u2019s original series \u201cLooking,\u201d a half-hour slice-of-life show about the gay male community in San Francisco.\nHBO\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d from last year, is an adaptation of a 1985 play that starts its storytelling in 1981.\nI sat down with Franzese, who is himself an ambassador for the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to talk about the unique challenges of playing an HIV-positive character who is in the process of falling for someone negative.\nBefore that, Adam Brody had a role in 2009 on FX\u2019s \u201cThe League\u201d as an HIV-positive character whose status is played up for laughs (the self-absorbed protagonists wonder if his medication makes him better at fantasy football than they are)."}
