Prentiss County Sheriff Randy Tolar says two inmates who escaped on Christmas are back in jail.

He says in a news release that U.S. marshals caught Dustin Shook and Chad Strange on Saturday in a neighboring county.

Guards found they were missing from the Prentiss County Detention Center early Friday.

The Daily Journal reports that Strange is awaiting trial on robbery charges and Shock is in custody for drug court.

Further details were not available.
