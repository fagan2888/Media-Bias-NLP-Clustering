Levin summarized the results by asking \"Hillary Clinton's gender? Do they mean her genitalia is her top 2016 selling point? Is that what that means?\" Levin later said \"But the key is it's her genitalia. That's why so many people would vote for her. I wonder if Bill Clinton would vote for her because of that. He seems to -- well, he likes genitalia but maybe not hers\":\n\nLevin has a long history of offensive commentary on his radio show. He has accused President Obama of abusing children, compared marriage equality to incest, polygamy, and drug use, compared supporters of the Affordable Care Act to Nazi \"brown shirts,\" and advocated for Obama to be impeached.\n\nDespite this rhetoric, prominent conservatives have given tacit approval to Levin's views by appearing on his show. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) called into his show as recently as February. Levin hosted House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) to talk about the new budget agreement reached in December. Levin criticized Ryan's budget deal with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) later that month.\n\nLevin's hateful rhetoric has also earned him praise from the conservative community -- he was recently named the winner of the Conservative Political Action Conference's Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award. He is also listed as one of the speakers on the NRA's \"Leadership Forum\" in April, speaking alongside other prominent conservative GOP leaders like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R-LA) and Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "Will Mark Levin's vulgar analysis of Hillary Clinton finally be enough to keep top GOP officials off his show?\nOn the March 21 edition of his radio show, Levin highlighted a&nbsp;Gallup poll&nbsp;showing that the majority of respondents, 18 percent, feel Clinton's gender is the most positive aspect of her potential presidency.
