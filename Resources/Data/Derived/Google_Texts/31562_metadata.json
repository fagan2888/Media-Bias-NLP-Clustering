I live here, so any money I make or any steps we take genuinely get put back into the community.\u201d\n\nWord of mouth is often essential in building the engine, as the high cost of advertising limits what upstart stores and restaurants can do.\n\n\u201cWord of mouth is number one,\u201d said Whaley, owner of The Bar-B-Q Shack, located at the intersection of Fortner Street and Brannon Stand Road . \u201cWithout that, you don\u2019t have a chance. You can advertise all you want to, but without that, you\u2019ve got nothing. We have a lot of customers say, \u2018I don\u2019t go to chains. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to get.\u2019 I have no problem showing them exactly where my food comes from.\u201d\n\nThe challenges of building a brand are real.\n\nWhen Whaley opened his restaurant in 2003, it took years to build up the reputation needed to survive.\n\nOnce that success came, though, it brought its own troubles.\n\nWhen The Bar-B-Q Shack opened, there were only about three restaurants within a three-mile radius.\n\n\u201cBut since I\u2019ve been here, there\u2019s probably in the neighborhood of 25 different restaurants in that three-to-four-mile radius. It\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world now. Every dollar that goes that way is a dollar that comes away from here, potentially. So long as we continue to climb, we can hang in here, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nChalker\u2019s biggest challenge early on was building a customer base.\n\n\u201cThat was our biggest challenge was just properly marketing the game store and making sure we connect with new people so they weren\u2019t unsure of what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the most challenging thing for small businesses is usually finding the market, because they don\u2019t have the resources like a big box store has to dump into newspapers and radio.\u201d\n\nSmall business owners also face an exceptional workload.\n\nWhaley employs about 15 people but still works 13-hour days, and the Chalkers run their Dothan store by themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still tiring,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cThat\u2019s the luxury that a chain does have that we don\u2019t have: they\u2019ve got two managers. Their volume is so high they can actually afford that. If my volume was twice what it is now, I\u2019d have a nighttime manager and I\u2019d go fishing.\u201d\n\nWhen Chalker decided to expand Fanatix into comic books and open a store in Enterprise, it meant any hope of reducing his workload went out the window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been just me and my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve had help from friends and family here and there, luckily, if one of us gets sick. Employment, fees and spending money on payroll is always a challenge for small business, especially with rising cost of minimum wage and benefits. We don\u2019t hire people. I wish we could, but between what we want to grow the store at in terms of putting comics on the shelves, these are all new expenses. It does get tiring, but we love it.\u201d\n\nWhat ultimately drives these businesses, though, is the passion of those who start them.\n\nWithout that passion, the engine that drives the Dothan economy is bound to fail.\n\n\u201cSmall business owners will know that. You\u2019re married to it, and especially in retail, you\u2019ve got to know your product,\u201d Chalker said. \u201cThese types of businesses don\u2019t survive unless the people selling it also enjoy it. We\u2019re not selling lawnmowers and we don\u2019t cut grass. We\u2019re not selling stuff we don\u2019t connect to. This is genuinely what interests us. That\u2019s key to any small business.\u201d\n\nWhaley also has some advice for those looking to start their own businesses.\n\n\u201cCheck out the demographics and find out how many people are in that area,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can get 10 percent of the demographics, you can make it. Don\u2019t think that you can do it all by yourself, (but) don\u2019t think there\u2019s no work involved. It\u2019s all work. If you\u2019re going to make it, you\u2019ve got to be there.\u201d\n\nAnd when the worst happens, ego needs to be left at the door.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is be willing to walk away from it,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cSet you a goal \u2013 either you\u2019ve got a six-month goal, a two-year goal or whatever \u2013 and if it\u2019s not doing a certain amount of business in a certain amount of time, walk away from it. Be man or woman enough to walk away from it.\u201d\n\nBut for those who succeed, hustle is key .\n\n\u201cStan Lee said that with great power comes great responsibility. If you want to be powerful and make your way in the small business world, you have to first have that responsibility, and the responsibility means doing the work,\u201d Chalker said. \u201cThere\u2019s always more work to be done, whether it\u2019s marketing the business yourself or making sure you connect with your audience. Someone who puts the work first in anything they do will be successful.\u201d\n\nThe Eagle will be offering more detailed explorations this week of the many aspects of small businesses and their relationship with the community.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Dothan Eagle", "description": "This coming week is dedicated to showing appreciation and raising awareness of people like Phillip Chalker and Jackson Whaley.", "title": "Small businesses \u2018the engine\u2019 of the local economy", "url": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/business/small-businesses-the-engine-of-the-local-economy/article_2c82607a-f108-11e4-9543-eb4423841df5.html", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/f6/1f614344-f03f-11e4-9250-7b6bf4e8db94/5543df66c533c.image.jpg?resize=700%2C467", "height": 467}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dothaneagle", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "This coming week is dedicated to showing appreciation and raising awareness of people like Phillip Chalker and Jackson Whaley.", "fb": {"app_id": 127957210797}, "keywords": "business,editors_pick,spotlight", "google-site-verification": "FxOwTsXWtkxruLdkniwmNFEqAZKSYYIapDcokfzL5E4", "news_keywords": "business,editors_pick,spotlight"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba32\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSmall businesses are really the engine of our economy, if you\u2019re talking Dothan or anywhere else in the country,\u201d said Judy Callin, director of Troy University\u2019s Small Business Development Center.\nThe sheer number of people employed by small businesses is staggering compared to larger businesses.\nAbout 85 percent of Wiregrass jobs are provided by small businesses, according to Dothan Area Chamber of Commerce President Matt Parker.\nThe relationship between small businesses and the community is often symbiotic.\nWithout a connection to your target audience, he said, it\u2019s difficult for a small business to survive."}
