Dayton-area hospital system Premier Health is also making the change.\n\nKonecranes Region Americas at 4401 Gateway Blvd. in Springfield is the company\u2019s headquarter offices for operations in North, Central and South Americas. The Finnish company also has assembly and warehouse operations in Springfield and a crane assembly plant in Franklin.\n\nThe company has 261 employees in Springfield, 36 in Franklin and more than 2,700 in the Americas, Gilbey said.\n\nNearly 40 percent of employers anticipate making changes to their health plans for 2014 due to the increase in employee health care costs, according to benefits consultant Towers Watson.\n\nOne area that employers are focusing on is coverage for spouses and dependents.\n\nNationwide, 20 percent of nearly 600 large employers in a survey completed earlier this year charged a spousal surcharge on premiums in 2013. An additional 13 percent plan to do so next year, according to the study, which was conducted by Towers Watson and the nonprofit National Business Group on Health.\n\nThe study also found that 4 percent of companies excluded spouses from their health plans when similar coverage was available through the spouse\u2019s employer. And another 8 percent planned to do so next year.\n\n\u201cCompanies are facing rising health care costs and must make some tough decisions in light of that reality,\u201d said James Haubrock, shareholder and chairman of employee benefit plan services, for regional public accounting firm Clark Schaefer Hackett.\n\n\u201cThey have to balance their desire to manage costs, their need to attract and retain a high-quality labor force, and the requirement to comply with the (Affordable Care Act). Some employers will see eliminating coverage for spouses as a viable option to meet those competing needs,\u201d Haubrock said.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act does not require employers to cover spouses or domestic partners, Haubrock said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crane equipment manufacturer Konecranes will stop providing health insurance coverage to employees\u2019 spouses who are eligible for insurance through their employers, said Scott Gilbey, company spokesman.", "og": {"url": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/konecranes-stops-health-coverage-of-working-spouse/nbRwr/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/10/18/d4/55/sns051212Konecranes3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Crane equipment manufacturer Konecranes will stop providing health insurance coverage to employees\u2019 spouses who are eligible for insurance through their employers, said Scott Gilbey, company spokesman.", "title": "Konecranes stops health coverage of working spouses"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/10/18/d4/55/sns051212Konecranes3.jpg", "title": "Konecranes stops health coverage of working spouses", "site": "@springfieldnews", "card": "summary", "description": "Crane equipment manufacturer Konecranes will stop providing health insurance coverage to employees\u2019 spouses who are eligible for insurance through their employers, said Scott Gilbey, company spokesman."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "springfieldnewssun", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/konecranes-stops-health-coverage-of-working-spouse/nbRwr/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2106854/news/news/konecranes-stops-health-coverage-of-working-spouse/nbRwr/", "keywords": "springfield,snsnewsletter,SNShomepage,health", "google-site-verification": "8vJEEijbdFqCz5Jlhv2SIUUb093Tw1ZWl6RD1VU7ZsU", "news_keywords": "springfield,snsnewsletter,SNShomepage,health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce214\"", "article_summary": "Konecranes will continue to cover spouses who do not have access to a health plan, Gilbey said.\n\u201cIt is a trend with many companies as everybody works to interpret the implication of the new health care act,\u201d he said.\nThe change is driven by rising health care costs, he said.\nBy Chelsey LevingstonStaff WriterCrane equipment manufacturer Konecranes will stop providing health insurance coverage to employees\u2019 spouses who are eligible for insurance through their employers, said Scott Gilbey, company spokesman.\nThe study also found that 4 percent of companies excluded spouses from their health plans when similar coverage was available through the spouse\u2019s employer."}
