Gov. Chris Christie said Wednesday he supports limiting the number of candidates participating in the first Republican presidential primary debate.

During a morning interview on “Fox and Friends,” Mr. Christie said he backed Fox News’s decision to limit the first GOP primary debate in August to the top 10 candidates based on standing in national polls.

The New Jersey governor, who currently would make the cut in the crowded 2016 field, is the first official or likely 2016 presidential contender to come out in favor of the debate restriction.

“I think you have got to have some sense of limit on it, because no one will have a chance to speak if you have too many people up there,” Mr. Christie said.

Asked to comment on several GOP hopefuls, Mr. Christie said he liked Sen. Marco Rubio and former Fla. Gov. Jeb Bush, and he has known Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker “for a long time.” He said Carly Fiorina was “an important voice in this race.”

And he reiterated that he will announce a decision on whether he will run for president in June

Also Wednesday, Mr. Christie criticized the U.S. Senate for blocking reauthorization of the Patriot Act.

A former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Mr. Christie has sought to insert himself into the debate over the renewal of the Patriot Act and the National Security Agency’s bulk telephone call data collection program. The law expires at the end of the month, and the Senate will resume debate over it on May 31.

On Saturday, Mr. Christie stated that the Senate’s blocking of the reauthorization was “the unfortunate result of misguided ideologues who have no real world experience in fighting terrorism.”

His potential 2016 rivals Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz have criticized the NSA’s metadata collection program.
