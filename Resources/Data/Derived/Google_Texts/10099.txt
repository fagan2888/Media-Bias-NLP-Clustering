Ted Cruz Trolls Obama's Planned Internet Takeover in the Most Brilliant Way Possible

You can't demonstrate the dangers of President Obama's plan to regulate the internet and reclassify broadband as a Title II common carrier more clearly than this video, courtesy of Sen. Ted Cruz.

Cruz said on his website that the Obama administration is trying to impose 1934 rules on the Internet, which will stifle innovation. "The FCCâ€™s net neutrality plan will drive up the cost of consumer Internet plans, impose billions of new taxes on the Internet, and allow a panel of five unelected bureaucrats to regulate and control every aspect of the Internet," Cruz said.

FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, one of two Republicans on the unelected board, held a press conference earlier this week to warn about the dangers of the 332-page plan that will not be released to the public until after the FCC's vote on February 26.

"The American people are being misled about President Obama's plan to regulate the Internet," Pai said. "Last week's carefully managed rollout was designed to downplay the plans of a massive intrusion in the Internet economy."

"I have now read the 332 page plan. It is worse than I had imagined," said Pai.

He warned that reclassifying broadband would open the door to new internet taxes and intrusive regulations and would give the FCC "broad and unprecedented discretion to micro-manage the internet."
