Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio that heaped praise on each of the candidates.\n\n\u201cCruz, Paul, and Rubio are the real deal,\u201d said Club for Growth President David McIntosh. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at their records and their rhetoric, and they give us hope for the future of the GOP on fiscal policies.\u201d\n\nThe verdicts weren\u2019t a surprise. The Club backed each of the candidates in their campaigns for the Senate, and all three have amassed staunchly conservative voting records during their short stints on Capitol Hill. But the rave reviews were a reminder that conservative interest groups are poised to play a kingmaker role in the 2016 nominating contest, pulling candidates to the right in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Club has long been known for spending large sums to oppose candidates who stray on economic issues. But it is considering a more aggressive role in this year\u2019s GOP primary, including a possible endorsement. In late February the group drew a range of presidential hopefuls \u2014 including Cruz, Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 to address a donors\u2019 conclave in Florida.\n\nThe group found quibbles with each of the first three candidates, from Cruz and Paul\u2019s support of special tax credits for NASCAR to Rubio\u2019s proposed top marginal tax rate. But overall, it spared little praise for the Senators. \u201cCruz has shown extraordinary determination in the fight against Obamacare,\u201d McIntosh said. \u201cPaul\u2019s budget proposals are a blueprint for limited government, and Rubio has drafted a massively pro-growth tax cut and reform plan.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the 2012 presidential race, when the group was lukewarm or worse on candidates ranging from Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty to Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum. And there will surely be 2016 candidates who don\u2019t fare as well. (Keep an eye out for a withering assessment of Mike Huckabee.) But the first batch of reviews was a early sign that this cycle\u2019s crop of candidates will produce a far more competitive \u2014 and potentially just as conservative \u2014 race after the yawner of four years ago.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The Club for Growth, a network of economic conservatives, praised the voting records of Sens.
