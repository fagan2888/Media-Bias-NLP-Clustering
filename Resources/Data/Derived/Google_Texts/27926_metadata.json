Such hidden costs can throw a wrench into planning efforts, but if approached correctly, waste need not remain hidden.\n\nFor instance, Sharp Health Care in San Diego identified excess waste in their telecommunications spending with help from SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, a medical cost reduction consulting firm.\n\nOne of the best ways to find hidden areas of focus is to involve the organization in process redesign.\n\n\u201cWe were able to benchmark their pricing against other industries while also finding some redundancies that shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d said Dan Schneider, CEO of SIB Fixed Cost Reduction. \u201cBut when you look at a multi-million dollar spend like that, we\u2019re really analyzing every invoice not just total spend to be able to spot things and to say well, you are paying this, but for this type of broadband or this level of phone line this is what best-in-class pricing should be.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nMiami-based Jackson Health System has saved $317,000 annually in medical waste expenses and $250,000 annually in cable TV expenses, Schneider said, simply by finding errors and inefficiencies in their existing billings and by negotiating best-in-class pricing for those services moving forward.\n\nSchneider said third party providers like his differ from a group purchasing organization (GPO) since they focus on monthly recurring bills such as phone, internet, waste removal, bank fees, etc.\n\n\u201cThe spend categories that we look at or the monthly recurring bills, usually they\u2019re not part of a GPO or there isn\u2019t one national provider that can handle the entire fit,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cFor instance, very rarely are there GPO deals that cover all forms of medical waste from pharma to red bag to sharps. Usually there are maintenance contracts, bank fees, utilities and things like that the GPO doesn\u2019t really cover.\u201d\n\nWhat makes hiring external consultants attractive to hospitals is their contracts typically only require compensation if savings are found.\n\nTodd Nelson, director of healthcare finance policy and operational initiatives at the Healthcare Financial Management Association, said most hospitals have already spent a significant amount of time reducing expenses in areas like supply chain management, labor management and contract management.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to find hidden areas of focus is to involve the organization in process redesign, which takes a significant organizational commitment of resources, intellectual understanding and process improvement,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt is not necessarily a particular area, but more of a methodology that is beyond the normal routine renegotiation of services.\u201d\n\nSee how Miami-based Jackson Health System has saved $317,000 annually in medical waste expenses. - Tweet this\n\nNelson added that perhaps the greatest benefit an external consultant offers is the time and manpower to find areas of waste. \u201cI believe that third party assistance brings scale and expertise, and maybe most importantly, time to work on these [hidden] areas,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cFor many organizations, the time to devote to understanding these unique areas just isn\u2019t there so they often go overlooked. It\u2019s possible to do some of this on your own, but you would need to find the time to make it a priority and involve the various departmental areas within those conversations.\u201d\n\nAngela Zotos, principal, Healthcare Advisory Services, Ernst & Young, said the reason why there are still opportunities for savings in hospital expenses is because healthcare is continually changing how care is delivered. \u201cWe are becoming more mobile, and we now have better visibility into use rates which allow us to improve inventory and purchasing strategies,\u201d Zotos said.\n\nZotos said hiring external consultants could prove beneficial since they allow organizational resources to focus on issues that are core to the business.\n\n\u201cOff site storage is not a core attribute of a hospital system, while physician preference items typically are,\u201d Zotos said. \u201cUtilizing external support frees up resources to focus on opportunities that will \u2018move the needle\u2019 on overall performance, quality and safety.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitals-look-slash-wasteful-expenses", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Jackson-Memorial-Health-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Experts say providers should look outside the organization to help free up resources for performance improvement.", "title": "Hospitals look to slash wasteful expenses"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Jackson-Memorial-Health-feature.gif"}, "description": "Experts say providers should look outside the organization to help free up resources for performance improvement.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hospitals look to slash wasteful expenses"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Despite years of focusing on driving out excess operational costs, hospitals are still finding hidden waste in their recurring expenses.
