Erdogan says, 'Jump!' and Obama asks, 'How high?'

Obama’s BFF and an admirer of the Nazis. Adam Taylor of the Washington Post reports: In the wake of a shooting in Chapel Hill, N.C., that left three young American Muslims dead, Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan made an unusual public criticism of American domestic policy Thursday, specifically challenging President Obama. "If you stay silent when faced with an incident like this, and don't make a statement, the world will stay silent towards you," Erdoğan said during a state visit to Mexico on Thursday, according to Al Jazeera. “I ask Mr. Obama, where are you, Mr. President?" Local police have stressed that there has been no determination of a hate crime, but Eric Holder’s Justice Department has dispatched the FBI to try to dig up something. But in the meantime:

By Friday afternoon, Obama had addressed the shootings, releasing a statement that called the deaths “brutal and outrageous." These comments were quickly portrayed by Turkey's pro-government media as being linked to Erdogan's outrage: #UPDATE #Obama condemns 'outrageous' murders of #Muslim students after #Erdoğan's call http://t.co/yObehvGg43 pic.twitter.com/An2fnVOLAO — DAILY SABAH (@DailySabah) İşin özü Obama'nın açıklamasındaki içerik değil, Cumhurbaşkanı'mızın haykırışına ses vermek zorunda kalmasıdır. — Şamil Tayyar (@samiltayyar27) February 13, 2015 — DAILY SABAH (@DailySabah) February 13, 2015 The idea that Obama has to comment on the death of three Muslims while Erdogan gets a pass on the anti-Semitism he is spreading throughout the word, as well as the murder of Jews in Turkey, is offensive. It’s pretty clear who’s in charge here. Welcome to the fundamental transformation promised by Obama.
