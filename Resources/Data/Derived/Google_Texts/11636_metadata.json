Organizers say Trail Life USA will be an outdoor scouting-like program designed for boys ages 5-17 that will focus on adventure, character, and leadership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to honor the legacy of the Boy Scouts of America,\u201d said radio personality Bill Bunkley, master of ceremonies for the event. \u201cBut now, quite frankly, we are called in a new direction.\u201d\n\nThis meeting is the culmination of intense planning that began just over two months ago when a steering committee gathered in Louisville, Ky., to discuss the feasibility of starting a new organization after the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) changed its membership policy in May to allow openly homosexual youth to participate in its program. Since then, the new group has created a constitution and bylaws, a logo, and other organizing documents and procedures.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

We honor the legacy of the Boy Scouts of America and the contributions it has made to us and our families. The men and boys we have left behind are not our opponents. They are our brothers and our friends. I encourage you to interact with them with charity and good faith.\u201d\n\nHe added, though, \u201cMany of us feel anger and betrayal.\u201d Stemberger said charity requires him to \u201ccontinue to expose the real dangers and risks that the [BSA\u2019s] new membership policy poses to boys. Real men value integrity above institutions.\u201d\n\nHe said Trail Life USA would be open to boys of all religious faiths, but it would be an explicitly Christian organization.\n\n\u201cAdults must sign a statement of faith and submit to a background check,\u201d Stemberger said. \u201cWe will have a strong outdoor component, and ranks from the Boy Scouts will be transferable.\u201d\n\nThe top award in Trail Life USA, the equivalent to the BSA\u2019s Eagle Award, would be the Freedom Award.\n\n\u201cOur vision will be to become the premier national character development organization for young men,\u201d Stemberger said, \u201cwhich produces godly and responsible husbands, fathers, and citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "RELIGION | Organizers of a Christian alternative to the Boy Scouts unveil their program", "title": "WORLD | A new direction | Warren Cole Smith | Sept. 7, 2013", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2013/09/a_new_direction", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/traillifeusa0907.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "RELIGION | Organizers of a Christian alternative to the Boy Scouts unveil their program"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d5b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re here to honor the legacy of the Boy Scouts of America,\u201d said radio personality Bill Bunkley, master of ceremonies for the event.\nOrganizers say Trail Life USA will be an outdoor scouting-like program designed for boys ages 5-17 that will focus on adventure, character, and leadership.\nWe honor the legacy of the Boy Scouts of America and the contributions it has made to us and our families.\n\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not an anti-BSA organization,\u201d Stemberger said.\nReal men value integrity above institutions.\u201dHe said Trail Life USA would be open to boys of all religious faiths, but it would be an explicitly Christian organization."}
