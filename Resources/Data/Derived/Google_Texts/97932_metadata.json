Telling them, 'I'm sliding!' And the guy sent him down anyway.\"\n\n\"I just want him to come home,\" continues Stevenson. \"And I want people to know how dangerous those rides are. That ride has no straps. Nothing holding those kids in.\"\n\nThe 10-acre Castles N' Coasters amusement park is located at 9445 N. Metro Pkwy E. in Phoenix.\n\nThe general manager of the park sent us an email that read, in part:\n\n\"We have multiple people who witnessed the boy stand up at the last second and try to get out of the boat at the top of the ride. The ride operator at the top of the ride was able to have communication with the boy before the incident and the boy said he was \"ok\" and to not stop the ride... There was no malfunction on the ride. Unfortunately, If he had followed the safety rules he would be fine.\"\n\nThe family disputes that account. And they say after the incident.. No staff members came to help.\n\nEarlier Saturday afternoon, park management had issued this statement:\n\n\"We at Castles N' Coasters are devastated by this unfortunate incident, and our sincere condolences and prayers go out to this young boy and his family.\n\n\"We have offered family fun at our parks for over fifty years and this is the first incident of this nature that we have encountered. We want everyone who comes to Castles N' Coasters to enjoy a safe and fun experience.\n\n\"We have an impeccable safety record, one of the best in the industry. We hold regularly scheduled Safety Meetings on all of our rides which are meticulously inspected on a daily basis before the public is allowed to participate on any ride.\n\n\"We have policies and procedures in place for the safety of our guests and are continually training our staff.\n\n\n\n\"We feel horrible that this happened.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
