The board will ask the County Commission for another $15 million to avoid further cuts.\n\nResponding to The Commercial Appeal\u2019s report Monday about possible benefit changes, Memphis Shelby County Education Association president Keith Williams asked the board Tuesday to seek input from the teachers union before moving ahead.\n\n\u201cWe ask if there\u2019s going to be a conversation about lowering or altering the insurance benefits of retirees or employees, that we be a part of that conversation before any decisions have been made,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe do not know what you have planned. We\u2019ve heard lots of things.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hopson assured radio listeners that any changes will include discussions with district employees.\n\n\u201cWe want to engage the employees before we make the change like this,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore your alarm bells go off, take a deep breath and know we\u2019re going to do this in a thoughtful way.\u201d\n\nShelby County Schools is one of the largest employers in Greater Memphis, with a payroll that includes about 10,000 educators and staff.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chalkbeat", "description": "The superintendent of Shelby County Schools says he will ask the Board of Education to end health insurance benefits for district retirees ages 65 or older to help reduce pension obligations.", "title": "Hopson to propose benefits changes for some retirees of Shelby County Schools", "url": "http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/tn/2015/04/23/hopson-to-propose-benefits-changes-for-some-retirees-of-shelby-county-schools/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dorsey-board.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-23T21:39:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T04:05:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dorsey-board.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Superintendent Dorsey Hopson has overseen Shelby County Schools since the 2013 merger of Memphis City Schools and the legacy Shelby County district.\nShelby County Schools Superintendent Dorsey Hopson said Thursday he will ask the Board of Education to end health insurance benefits for district retirees ages 65 or older to help reduce pension obligations.\n\u201cSomeone made a decision 40 to 50 years ago to offer more benefits to employees,\u201d Hopson said.\nResponding to The Commercial Appeal\u2019s report Monday about possible benefit changes, Memphis Shelby County Education Association president Keith Williams asked the board Tuesday to seek input from the teachers union before moving ahead.\nWe\u2019ve heard lots of things.\u201dOn Thursday, Hopson assured radio listeners that any changes will include discussions with district employees."}
