Matt Gaetz knows voters are angry. He\u2019s angry too.\n\nInvective against \u201cspineless politicians\u201d and \u201clawless bureaucrats\u201d peppered the Ft. Walton Beach Republican\u2019s campaign kick off tour around Northwest Florida on Saturday.\n\nThe 33-year-old lawmaker is seeking to succeed U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, whose announced retirement from Congress has set off a chain reaction of electoral maneuvering across the 1st Congressional District.\n\nIn his \u201cFight Washington Bus Tour\u201d over the weekend, Gaetz seized on the visceral frustrations many voters \u2014 particularly Republicans \u2014 have expressed in the 2016 Presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cIt almost seems like sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter which party wins national elections,\u201dsaid Gaetz. \u201cThe politicians come to Washington, D.C. and basically become valets, catering to the whims of the same powerful interest groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not who I am,\u201d he added emphatically.\n\nGaetz hopes to capitalize on sentiments like that in order to get past Sen. Greg Evers in what is shaping up to be a heated GOP primary in August.\n\nGaetz said he voted for Donald Trump in the Florida GOP primary, and repeatedly sounded notes similar to the New York real estate mogul\u2019s populist-tinged brand of politics.\n\nAs his father, former Senate President Don Gaetz, watched on across four stops in Miramar Beach, Ft. Walton Beach, Navarre, and Pensacola, Gaetz decried illegal immigration from Mexico and Islamic terrorists who seek to \u201cdestroy our way of life,\u201d along with liberal politicians, including President Barack Obama, who he said sit back and watch those threats advance unabated.\n\nGaetz also attempted to seize the most coveted political mantle of 2016 \u2014 that of the outsider.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running because I want to go to Washington, D.C. \u2014 I\u2019m running because we can\u2019t trust Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Gaetz in his stump speech, a theme he would reiterate throughout.\n\nThe day of campaigning was also replete with deeply emotional appeals to Red America\u2019s gravest fears. Testifying on Gaetz\u2019 behalf, for example, was a woman who was kidnapped at gunpoint several years ago. The upshot of her story was that had she been armed with a weapon and the kind of open-carry legislation favored by Gaetz, she would have stood a better chance against her attacker.\n\nMore to the point, she would have \u201cunloaded my gun\u201d into her assailant, typifying the red meat rhetoric largely on offer Saturday.\n\n\u201cIn Northwest Florida, the most conservative candidate wins and I\u2019ve got the most conservative record in this race without question,\u201d Gaetz told FloridaPolitics.com\n\nThough most observers would say Gaetz and Evers are roughly equivalent in their political orientation, Gaetz pointed towards Evers \u201ccozy relationship with big labor\u201d and past support for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act as guideposts which will show voters Gaetz is the more reliable conservative vote.\n\n\u201cSenator Evers has been a good friend of mine for 15 years, but we do have disagreements on issues,\u201d said Gaetz. \u201cHe supported expanding Obamacare expansion; I led the fight against it.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that rift \u2014 wherein the Senate \u201cFHIX\u201d plan ultimately lost out to a hard-right House that was \u201cnot dancing\u201d when it came to expanding Medicaid \u2014 would be a \u201cmajor issue\u201d in the CD 1 primary.\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.6 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "SaintPetersBlog", "description": "Rep.\u00a0Matt Gaetz\u00a0knows voters are angry.
