After a day of rest and treatment, he declared the problem was nothing serious.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time that we increased the minutes a little bit; it was the first back-to-back,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cThe knee was not used to it for a while. So it got a little sore.\u201d\n\nGallinari said he will take a wait-and-see approach to playing in upcoming back-to-back games, but he hasn\u2019t been ruled out for those. The Nuggets\u2019 next set of back-to-back games comes Monday and Tuesday, when they\u2019re at Utah and home against the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nGallinari didn\u2019t sound worried.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how the knee responds,\u201d said the forward, who came off the bench Friday against the Suns. \u201cBut I think the more we get through the season, the more I\u2019ll be able to play back-to-backs. It\u2019s just the first one, and the first one after playing a lot more minutes in the last few games.\u201d\n\nLawson\u2019s minutes. The minutes haven\u2019t gotten out of control for Nuggets guard Ty Lawson, but he did enter Friday night\u2019s game averaging a career-high 36.1 minutes per game.\n\nBalancing having Lawson, the team\u2019s most important player, on the court with not wearing him out is of high importance for Nuggets coach Brian Shaw.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to burn him out, especially early on in the season,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cAnd especially in light of now Randy (Foye) is out, so in terms of point guards there\u2019s not a whole lot of options. So I am concerned about him getting the minutes that he\u2019s getting. Maybe what I\u2019ll have to do is sub Ty out a little bit earlier, get someone else to finish the first quarter and start the second quarter, and then bring Ty back with about eight minutes to go in the half and finish the half, and work it that way.\u201d\n\nLawson has played 40 or more minutes three times, going into Friday, but one of those was an overtime game in Los Angeles against the Lakers.
