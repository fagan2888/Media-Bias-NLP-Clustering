In both cases, though, he\u2019s following the same rule: Even if the policy isn\u2019t good, the politics are, and that makes it worth doing.\n\nIt\u2019s a logical corollary to his push to raise the minimum wage. If, in the name of fairness and income equality, we can tell businesses how much to pay their lowest-ranking employees, we should also tell them how much to pay their middle managers, no?\n\nUnder current federal regulations, workers who are deemed executive, administrative or professional employees can be denied overtime pay under a so-called white-collar exemption. Under the new rules that Mr. Obama is seeking, fewer salaried employees could be blocked from receiving overtime, a move that would potentially shift billions of dollars\u2019 worth of corporate income into the pockets of workers\u2026 In addition, Mr. Obama will try to change rules that allow employers to define which workers are exempt from receiving overtime based on the kind of work they perform. Under current rules, if an employer declares that an employee\u2019s primary responsibility is executive, such as overseeing a cleanup crew, then that worker can be exempted from overtime.\n\nCurrently management can avoid paying you overtime if your duties are \u201cexecutive\u201d (i.e. supervisory) and if you make more than $455 per week. O wants to raise that salary cut-off so that lower-ranking \u201cexecutives\u201d get time and a half just like the people they\u2019re supervising. New dilemma for businesses, then: Do they bite the bullet and pay extra to middle managers who work overtime? Or, in the name of keeping costs down, do they decide to be sticklers about hours?\n\nFirst of all, nobody is guaranteed a pay increase as a result. Back when I was briefly in the Newspaper Guild, an older employee explained his real view of the utility of overtime laws: They force managers to schedule more carefully, to avoid cost overruns. As a relatively highly paid young reporter with zero control over my schedule, that made sense. But that also means non-exempt employees will be watched more closely to avoid tripping the sort of litigation threat that increasing numbers of labor lawyers are looking out for. Working at home could become taboo, since the employer has more difficulty monitoring hours and working conditions. Employees who harbor the perhaps foolish idea that by working hard and taking on greater responsibilities they can move up in the organization will instead be told to go home and relax.\n\nLess work \u2014 except for labor lawyers, who\u2019ll be litigating these new regs to the last dotted \u201ci\u201d. Actually, \u201cless work\u201d is a nifty summary of Obamanomics to date: On top of massive long-term unemployment that\u2019s persisted throughout our \u201crecovery,\u201d Obama\u2019s minimum-wage hike would cut 500,000 people from the work force and his pet health-care law would encourage another 2.5 million to shake off the shackles of \u201cjob-lock\u201d and ease themselves out the door. Hopefully Jared Bernstein\u2019s right that there\u2019ll actually be extra hiring because of this move as managers look to avoid overtime costs for one \u201cexecutive\u201d by bringing more \u201cexecutives\u201d onboard to fill out shifts. But then that assumes that there\u2019ll be no offsetting cost-cutting, including payroll, as the new hires are brought on.\n\nLike I said, though, good politics. Nothing\u2019s going to save Democrats in November but maybe the extra income for some middle managers will soften the blow at the polls. And it pays for O to do something splashy occasionally to polish the Dem brand as the party of the middle class. Republicans with megaphones like Mike Lee and Rubio are looking to make inroads with blue-collar voters. The guy with the bully pulpit can do more to bigfoot them than anyone else.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Executives.", "title": "Obama to force businesses to pay more employees overtime", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/12/obama-to-force-businesses-to-pay-more-employees-overtime/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-12T21:21:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-12T19:05:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "executive, labor, managerial, Obama, overtime, time and a half, worker,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "New dilemma for businesses, then: Do they bite the bullet and pay extra to middle managers who work overtime?\nUnder current federal regulations, workers who are deemed executive, administrative or professional employees can be denied overtime pay under a so-called white-collar exemption.\nIf, in the name of fairness and income equality, we can tell businesses how much to pay their lowest-ranking employees, we should also tell them how much to pay their middle managers, no?\nNothing\u2019s going to save Democrats in November but maybe the extra income for some middle managers will soften the blow at the polls.\nObama to force businesses to pay more employees overtimeposted at 5:21 pm on March 12, 2014 by AllahpunditUnlike his various \u201cfixes\u201d for ObamaCare, there actually is some statutory basis for this move."}
