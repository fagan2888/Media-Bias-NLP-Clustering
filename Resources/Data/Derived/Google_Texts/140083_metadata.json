It follows a father\u2019s journey to protect his supernaturally gifted son from the federal government and a zealous religious group who thinks the young boy is their savior. It may be a paranormal plot, but the story behind the script is one that is all too real for Director Jeff Nichols. In an exclusive interview with Townhall, he shares how his own relationship with his son inspired his newest \u2013 and most ambitious \u2013 film yet.\n\nBeing a director means he is \u201cnarcissistic\u201d by default, Nichols jocosely said.\n\nHe kind of has to be. Whether it\u2019s telling the actors where to stand or pointing the direction of the cameras, there is a clear designation of roles that gives the director a powerful sense of control. In essence, he owns the movie set.\n\nThat is, until Nichols became a father and realized not every aspect of life is quite as orderly as that.\n\n\u201cWhen I compare that to being a parent, obviously those roles are totally blurred,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSometimes I feel like my son\u2019s in charge. Whose job is what? The clarity that comes from a film set is not in my everyday life.\u201d\n\nFatherhood, Nichols shared, is \u201ca complete role reversal\u201d from directing. \u201cYou stop putting yourself in front of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was pretty floored by the experience of fatherhood,\u201d he shared. \u201cI still am. My son is five and half now and I think in that first year, my wife and I were just zapped. We were sleep deprived, thinking a lot about ourselves, how much our lives had changed. We could no longer leave the house to see a movie.\u201d\n\nThen, a medical emergency that brought his 1-year-old son to the hospital changed his whole perspective.\n\n\u201cWithin that experience then this thing happened and it kind of shocked my system and pulled me out of this kind of selfish mode of thinking and I think I woke up thinking just how attached I was to my son and it really scared me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt scared me because I realized how little control I had over the bigger picture and that how devastated I would be if something truly serious ever happened to him.\u201d\n\nWith the fear, however, comes a tremendous amount of love, of joy, fulfillment, and hope for the future.\n\n\u201cWhen you try to inject that into a film, it becomes even harder,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cGetting away from the fear, putting it through these filters and despite all that, that was the goal to try and get some sense of what happened, what this feeling is.\u201d\n\nNichols\u2019 newfound emotions that come from being a dad are clearly visible in Midnight Special. In the film, the young boy, Alton Meyer, does not seem to fear the future. His dad, however, played by Michael Shannon, a consistent presence in Nichols\u2019 films, is obviously terrified throughout the two-hour chase. Not only is he worried for his son\u2019s safety, but he\u2019s terrified of disappointing him.\n\nNichols\u2019 personal connection to his films has become his signature style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become kind of an operating procedure of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cTo turn them back on to my own life\u2026You have some entertainment value, but also something more personal to attach themselves too.\u201d\n\nNichols had more resources to work with than previous films to make his ambitious sci-fi idea reality. Midnight Special is his fourth film, but the first in which he used a studio. The use of a studio, coupled with a budget that double his last film, proved to be both daunting and freeing.\n\nThe financial freedom gave him the opportunity to film those thrilling car chases and shootouts, but the upgrade really started to kick in when he glanced at his surroundings.\n\n\u201cHere I was every day going to the place Clint Eastwood makes movies,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cI would get goose bumps going to the Warner Brothers gate.\u201d\n\nAs for the person who inspired his new film, he may not be an audience member for some years yet. His son needs to get through The Good Dinosaur first.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s five and a half and there\u2019s literally no filter between him and the thing she sees on TV,\u201d Nichols shared. \u201cWe watched The Good Dinosaur. He asked when the dad dinosaur comes back and when I said he wasn\u2019t, he just put his head on my shoulder and sobbed. So, we\u2019re not ready yet. Not for Midnight Special.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just in his directing Nichols has found inspiration in his son.\n\n\u201cIt is a complete kind of role reversal in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just stop putting yourself in front of everything. It\u2019s not about a future of your own trajectory \u2013 it\u2019s about the trajectory of his.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just resets your lens,\u201d he added. \u201cMy eyes were looking out five years ahead, now they\u2019re looking out 50 years ahead.\u201d\n\nNichols beamed about his son one last time before we ended our phone call.\n\n\u201cThe way he sees the world is really beautiful and I think that it starts softens the edges of the cynicism.\u201d\n\nMidnight Special is in theaters now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeff Nichols offers a vulnerable look at father-son relationship in new film..05/26/2016 20:42:22PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Nichols offers a vulnerable look at father-son relationship in new film.", "title": "'Midnight Special\u2019 Director Shares How Fatherhood Squashed His \u2018Narcissism\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/10/midnight-special-director-shares-how-fatherhood-squashed-his-narcissism-n2145981", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/10/2.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Jeff Nichols offers a vulnerable look at father-son relationship in new film.", "title": "'Midnight Special\u2019 Director Shares How Fatherhood Squashed His \u2018Narcissism\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/10/midnight-special-director-shares-how-fatherhood-squashed-his-narcissism-n2145981", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/10/2.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Exclusive: \u2018Midnight Special\u2019 Director Shares How Fatherhood Squashed His \u2018Narcissism\u2019, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Midnight Special is an edge-of-your-seat sci-fi thriller.\n\u201cHe\u2019s five and a half and there\u2019s literally no filter between him and the thing she sees on TV,\u201d Nichols shared.\nMidnight Special is his fourth film, but the first in which he used a studio.\nThe clarity that comes from a film set is not in my everyday life.\u201dFatherhood, Nichols shared, is \u201ca complete role reversal\u201d from directing.\nIn an exclusive interview with Townhall, he shares how his own relationship with his son inspired his newest \u2013 and most ambitious \u2013 film yet."}
