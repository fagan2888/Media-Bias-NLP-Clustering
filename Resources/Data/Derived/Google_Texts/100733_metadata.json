People with new or multiple sex partners, who use condoms inconsistently or who exchange sex for money or drugs are also at high risk.\n\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for the infections with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) at primary care visits for young women and older women with extra risk factors at least once, and then again if a woman\u2019s sexual history changes to include risk factors.\n\nThese tests, which are very sensitive and specific, require a urine sample for men and a vaginal swab for women, Mark said.\n\nAntibiotics can treat the infections, but gonorrhea is resistant to all but one class of antibiotics \u2013 cephalosporins \u2013 and even the effectiveness of that drug is dwindling, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are antibiotic treatments that are safe to use in pregnant women, and it is important for pregnant women to get treated, to prevent passing an infection on to her baby before and during the baby\u2019s birth,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Gorwitz, medical epidemiologist in the Division of STD Prevention in the CDC.\n\nPrompt treatment is important for infected women and also for their sex partners, she told Reuters Health by email.\n\nIn the same issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, the USPSTF also published a recommendation that doctors should offer or refer patients to high-intensity behavioral counseling if they have a current or recurring STD or engage in risky sexual practices, and for all sexually active adolescents.\n\nCounseling involves providing basic information about the infections and how they\u2019re passed from person to person, assessing an individual patient\u2019s risk, providing education about condom use, and teaching ways to communicate with partners about safe sex.\n\nPrevious research has shown that when adults or adolescents spend at least two hours talking about these issues with a counselor, including hands-on practice with condoms, condom use increases and STD cases decrease. Less-intensive counseling did not affect outcomes, however.\n\n\u201cThese types of interventions are generally not feasible in a typical primary care visit, but they could be feasible in an integrated care setting that included a behavior specialist who was trained to provide sexual risk-reduction counseling,\u201d the authors write.\n\nBy Kathryn Doyle\n\nSOURCES: http://bit.ly/1qpWMiT, http://bit.ly/1rix43C Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 22, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "test, young, women, gonorrhea, and, chlamydia, experts, say", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Sexually active women under age 24 and older women at risk, like those who are pregnant, should be tested for the sexually transmitted diseases Chlamydia and gonorrhea.", "title": "Women Under Age 24 Should Be Getting Tested For The Clap", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/test-young-women-gonorrhea-and-chlamydia-experts-say-304470", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/std.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sexually active women under age 24 and older women at risk, like those who are pregnant, should be tested for the sexually transmitted diseases Chlamydia and gonorrhea.", "title": "Women Under Age 24 Should Be Getting Tested For The Clap", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/test-young-women-gonorrhea-and-chlamydia-experts-say-304470", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/std.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/std.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-09-23T12:02:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T12:01:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sexually active women under age 24 and older women at risk, like those who are pregnant, should be tested for the sexually transmitted diseases Chlamydia and gonorrhea."}, "article_summary": "Sexually active women under age 24 and older women at risk, like those who are pregnant, should be tested for the sexually transmitted diseases Chlamydia and gonorrhea.\nMost new Chlamydia and gonorrhea infections happen among women aged 20 to 24.\n\u201cThere are antibiotic treatments that are safe to use in pregnant women, and it is important for pregnant women to get treated, to prevent passing an infection on to her baby before and during the baby\u2019s birth,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Gorwitz, medical epidemiologist in the Division of STD Prevention in the CDC.\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Sexually active women under age 24 and older women at risk, like those who are pregnant, should be tested for the sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Chlamydia and gonorrhea, according to new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\nPrompt treatment is important for infected women and also for their sex partners, she told Reuters Health by email."}
