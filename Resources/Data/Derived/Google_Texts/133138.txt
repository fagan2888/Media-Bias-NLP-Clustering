A snowstorm parked over central Colorado that brought heavy snow to parts of the state and Wyoming and rain to Oklahoma and Texas is dumping more snow in the Rocky Mountains.

Forecasters say the ongoing storm will linger Sunday as the center moves slowly toward the Colorado-Wyoming border.

The Colorado Avalanche Information Center is warning of possible danger from avalanches as new snow continues to pile up.

The National Weather Service says 4 feet of snow has fallen between Denver and the Continental Divide, and a winter storm warning remains in effect for southeastern Wyoming, where up to 20 inches of snow was expected along the southern Laramie Range.

The storm system has already dropped more than 7 inches of rain in Frederick in far southwestern Oklahoma.
