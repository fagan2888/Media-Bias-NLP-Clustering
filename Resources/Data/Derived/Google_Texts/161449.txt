Morris, 72, was commanding a strike force during the Vietnam War in 1969 when it came under attack.

Morris is one of three of the 24 Medal of Honor recipients still alive to receive the honor.

Morris received the Distinguished Service Cross in 1970 for extraordinary heroism during the battle.

The Army says Morris retired at Fort Hood, Texas in May 1985 and currently lives in Cocoa, Florida.
