And the likelihood Democrats will realize their goal of raising the minimum wage and renewing benefits for the long-term unemployed don\u2019t seem much better.\n\nCongressional negotiators have a good chance to cut a deal early this year on a long-delayed farm bill impacting agriculture policy and food stamps.\n\nAnd a bipartisan budget agreement that President Obama signed in December is expected to ease passage of spending bills and, at least, avert another government shutdown in 2014.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a lead author of the Senate-passed immigration-reform bill, said he hopes recent cooperation \u201cwill lead the way to more in 2014, including the passage of immigration reform through the House.\u201d\n\nBut many lawmakers privately see little chance for the passage of major immigration reform.\n\nHouse Republicans are too concerned about primary challenges from Tea Party-backed opponents to support back any bill that includes a potential path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nNorm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said it is conceivable lawmakers will pass \u201cone or two\u201d notable bills, \u201cbut you would have to be truly outside the normal range of optimism to imagine this being a probability.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hope to gain seats in the midterms by focusing on the botched roll-out of Obamacare.\n\nDemocrats, eyeing recent results like Bill de Blasio\u2019s populist win in New York City\u2019s mayoral election and polls that show deep frustration about economic mobility, want to campaign on economic inequality, an issue President Obama recently called his top priority.\n\n\u201cIssues like job creation, minimum wage and unemployment insurance are going to weigh on the minds of voters far more than Obamacare by the time the 2014 elections roll around,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nWithin a few months, lawmakers are likely to shift fully into election mode, dropping real attempts to legislate in favor of posturing for campaign advantage in November, when the Democrats will try to keep control of the Senate and Republicans will try to retain their majority in the House.\n\n\u201cA lot of issues will be voted on just to make election-year attack ads,\u201d said John Hudak, a fellow in governance studies at Brookings Institution, a center left think tank.\n\n\u201cYou are going to see less legislation passing in 2014, if you can imagine that, and more bills being voted on just for political gain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAN FRIEDMAN", "twitter": {"description": "Congress passed just 58 bills in 2013, the fewest since the institution began counting in the 1940s.
