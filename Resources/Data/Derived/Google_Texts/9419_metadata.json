It\u2019s going to cost some money,\u201d said Michael Petrilli, executive vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that in 2012 published \u201cPutting a Price Tag on the Common Core: How Much Will Smart Implementation Cost?\u201d\n\nThe short answer to that question: It depends.\n\nThe analysis estimates the implementation cost for each of the 45 states and the District of Columbia that had adopted the standards as of last year depends on how the states approach the rollout.\n\nTeacher development, educational materials, testing contracts won\u2019t come cheap.\n\nBadger State bill\n\nWisconsin school districts could be on the hook for more than $250 million combined, according to a recently released report by the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That report draws heavily on the Fordham Institute analysis, which lays out aggregate costs based on student and teacher counts.\n\nThe fiscal bureau projects another $23 million in state and federal spending on pupil assessments, including testing beyond the new standards, in 2014. Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Public Instruction spent tens of millions of dollars, contracted, to develop and administer its current testing regime.\n\nFordham Institute\u2019s estimates are based on three models of implementation \u2013 a \u201cBare Bones\u201d rollout plan, a \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d traditional plan (the priciest) and a hybrid or \u201cBalanced Implementation\u201d combining the most and least expensive elements.\n\nFordham estimates costs in Wisconsin could range from $62.3 million for the \u201cbare bones\u201d approach to $256.1 million for the most expensive, traditional model. The price tag for a hybrid plan, using at least some technology to facilitate the Common Core, is pegged at $106.5 million.\n\nThe Legislative Fiscal Bureau cautions that, \u201ccalculating such figures specifically for Wisconsin, given the decentralized system of school government and the lack of data\u201d on planned expenditures, is \u201cnot possible.\u201d\n\nCore Savings?\n\nPatrick J. Murphy, politics professor at the University of San Francisco who co-authored the Fordham Institute report with Elliot Regenstein, who was with EducationCounsel LLC at the time of the study, agreed that estimating the expense of the Common Core is tricky because of the fluid nature of the numbers and needs.\n\nBut Murphy believes the costs to implement the Common Core, on average, will be on par with current curriculum and testing expenditures.\n\nPetrilli asserts much of the money that will go into launching the Common Core Standards would have been targeted to the same educational elements, anyway.\n\n\u201cAny education system worth its salt should be doing these things regularly, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily cost more money, and in some ways it may cost less.\u201d Wisconsin and other states, Petrilli said, will be able to tap into shared resources in teacher development and online materials.\n\nBut much depends on a district\u2019s size and available resources. The little school district of Gilman, in Wisconsin\u2019s Taylor County, is taking small steps in its transition into the Common Core.\n\n\u201cWe have been updating our textbooks a little bit at a time,\u201d said Georgia Kraus, Gilman principal. \u201cWe make sure that the new textbooks align with Common Core.\u201d\n\nThe district is updating its high school and middle school English textbooks, Kraus said. Beyond that project, textbooks will be added \u201cby a need basis.\u201d\n\nWith new textbooks running at $50, and the teacher editions up to $139, the costs for educational materials for any school district can be a challenge. But Kraus said she doesn\u2019t believe the Common Core will be any more expensive to set up in a district that has long been prudent with its limited budget.\n\nIn the New Berlin School District, the preliminary 2013-14 budget calls for $450,000 in spending for new instructional materials that align with curriculum changes.\n\nEilene Depka, curriculum director for the district, estimates the cost to implement new curriculum at around $100 per student, but she asserts the Common Core will not cost the district \u201cany more or any less.\u201d\n\nBig money\n\nElsewhere, states such as Arizona expect a pretty hefty bill. Statewide, costs for \u201cessential elements\u201d of Common Core implementation this school year are projected to be $156.6 million, according to a survey by the Arizona School Boards Association.\n\nThe Washington state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction last year estimated the new Common Core standards will cost taxpayers in the state more than $300 million. Those projections arrived as the state faced a multi-billion dollar budget deficit.\n\nMurphy and Petrilli acknowledge that the Fordham Institute study does not factor in the potentially expensive technology needed to administer the testing, among other applications.\n\nCalifornia taxpayers are looking at a $1.25 billion bill to prepare the way for the Common Core.\n\nMurphy puts California in the Cadillac category of standards implementation. He said the Golden State has more money to spend. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make the plan better, the professor said.\n\n\u201cI hope it will be used prudently,\u201d said Murphy, a California resident, of the line item. \u201cI think there would have been different ways to approach it. If I tell you that you\u2019ve got $20 a week for lunch, you are going to behave differently than if I give you $100 a week.\u201d\n\nOpponents see nothing prudent in nationalized standards that they believe are a waste of taxpayer money and a threat to local control.\n\nKaren Schroeder, president of Advocates for Academic Freedom, earlier this summer testified before state Senate and Assembly committees on education, citing multiple examples of educational standards that she believes are much more rigorous than the Common Core.\n\n\u201cCitizens must commit time and energy to demand that federal dollars spent on education be reallocated to the state and that local control of schools be reinstated. States must reclaim their right to shape a curriculum that meets the academic needs of their students,\u201d Schroeder, a retired school teacher and education consultant, wrote in a column for Wisconsin Reporter.\n\nPetrilli said it was inevitable supporters of Common Core, such as the Fordham Institute, would see some resistance from an initiative led by the nation\u2019s governors and wholly endorsed by the Obama administration, and bolstered with federal funding. The far Right, he said, is opposed to anything national, and the far Left balks at standardized testing.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that conservatives will agree that having solid standards is better than what we have now,\u201d Petrilli said. \u201cWisconsin has had some of the worst academic standards and the easiest tests in the country. Common Core is significantly better.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Hertig contributed to this story.\n\nContact M.D. Kittle at mkittle@wisconsinreporter.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The cost of implementing sweeping new educational standards could be costly for the Badger State\u2019s school systems.", "title": "How much will Common Core cost you? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/CommonCoreWordle.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-05T04:17:52+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/104325/how-much-will-common-core-cost-you/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Education", "tag": "Arizona,California,Common Core State Standards,Department of Public Instruction,Education,Fordham Institute,legislative fiscal bureau,Obama,standards,teacher", "published_time": "2013-09-05T04:00:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05T04:17:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The cost of implementing sweeping new educational standards could be costly for the Badger State\u2019s school systems.", "title": "How much will Common Core cost you? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/CommonCoreWordle.jpg"}, "creator": "@wiswatchdog", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb73\"", "article_summary": "The Washington state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction last year estimated the new Common Core standards will cost taxpayers in the state more than $300 million.\nThe price tag for a hybrid plan, using at least some technology to facilitate the Common Core, is pegged at $106.5 million.\nBut Murphy believes the costs to implement the Common Core, on average, will be on par with current curriculum and testing expenditures.\nCalifornia taxpayers are looking at a $1.25 billion bill to prepare the way for the Common Core.\nThe little school district of Gilman, in Wisconsin\u2019s Taylor County, is taking small steps in its transition into the Common Core."}
