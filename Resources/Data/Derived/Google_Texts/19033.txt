A judge has ruled that a doctor’s defamation lawsuit against CVS Pharmacy can proceed, denying the chain’s argument that alleged comments from pharmacy employees were protected by a recognized privilege.

In June, Redouane Goulmamine, MD, filed a $20 million defamation lawsuit against CVS. Goulmamine alleges that some employees of CVS pharmacies in Virginia told his patients that he overprescribed painkillers and was being investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The chain also refused to fill his prescriptions.

CVS attempted to quash the lawsuit, but U.S. District Judge Robert Payne of the Eastern District of Virginia recently denied most of the arguments in CVS’ motion to dismiss.

Goulmamine operates The Spine Center in Petersburg, Va. He specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation musculoskeletal-spinal medicine, and provides pain management services for his patients. In October 2014, CVS sent Goulmamine a letter questioning his prescribing patterns.

A March 2015 follow-up letter to Goulmamine stated: “Despite our attempts to resolve the concerns with your controlled substance prescribing patterns these concerns persist. Thus, we are writing to inform you that effective March 24, 2015, CVS/pharmacy stores will no longer be able to fill prescriptions that you write for controlled substances.”

According to Goulmamine’s lawsuit, several CVS pharmacy employees made defamatory remarks about him before and after the chain stopped filling his prescriptions for controlled substances.
