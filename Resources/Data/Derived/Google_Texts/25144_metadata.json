I can\u2019t imagine why any law student would admit that hearing about a seemingly unjust legal decision incapacitates them; how would such people function as lawyers, given that many verdicts deeply disappoint advocates for one side or the other?\u201d asks David Bernstein, professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law and also a Yale Law alumnus.\n\nAnd he importantly points out: Meanwhile, to the extent that Columbia students take advantage of delaying their exams, they are getting an unfair advantage - that is, more time to study - over students who don\u2019t claim the delay.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is a new educational phenomenon: Ivy League law students at three major universities - Columbia, Harvard and Georgetown University - are now exempt from taking final exams if they feel \"traumatized\" by the grand jury decisions made in Ferguson and New York City.
