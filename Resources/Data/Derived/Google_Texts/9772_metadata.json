Patients at Northwest waited an average of 67 minutes before seeing a doctor, according to a propublica.org report of Medicaid data collected from April 2012 to April 2013.\n\nHowever, wait times have now been shortened to about a half-hour over the past several months, Crawford said.\n\n\u201cAnd we could do better,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nA major factor affecting emergency departments across the country is overcrowding caused by patients seeking treatment for nonemergency conditions. Low-priority injuries and illnesses fill emergency departments while high-priority trauma conditions are continuously moved to the front of the line. So while a patient with a sore throat might not cause a delay for a heart attack patient, he or she might cause patients with less serious maladies to wait for treatment, Crawford said.\n\n\u201cIt clogs up the whole system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first step will be to expand operations at three clinics the system runs in Amarillo:\n\n\u25a0 J.O. Wyatt Community Health Center, 1411 E. Amarillo Blvd.\n\n\u25a0 Northwest Texas Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Center, 814 Martin Road;\n\n\u25a0 Northwest Texas Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Center, 1900 S.E. 34th Ave.\n\nEach clinic will be open an additional 11 hours each week, according to the plan.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to increase access (and) to reduce unnecessary utilization of the emergency room, therefore reducing the cost of care within the market,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nNorthwest has identified 1,400 people who used the hospital\u2019s emergency room four or more times a year, effectively using it as a primary care provider, Crawford said.\n\nAnother problem is the inability of many people to discern a serious medical condition from symptoms of common conditions, Northwest Emergency Director Dr. Stephen Newman said.\n\nTo combat these problems, the hospital is implementing a patient navigation system to direct patients to the proper care providers. The system is a hotline where nurses will be trained to diagnose a patient\u2019s symptoms and send them to the correct clinic or emergency room for treatment.\n\n\u201cBasically you\u2019re doing the same thing as a 911 operator might do,\u201d Crawford explained. \u201cThey go through a triage process to see how urgent it is and how emergent it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be like having your own nurse on call,\u201d Northwest Chief Financial Officer Gene Winters said.\n\nThe patient navigation system will be directed at the 1,400 patients Northwest identified as frequent emergency room visitors, but Crawford said the program would be expanded later on. The program is set to be operational by Sept. 30, but it could be online earlier, Winters said.\n\nNorthwest also plans to open new urgent care clinics attached to or housed within its three existing clinics.\n\nSome new construction is expected, but some buildings already have extra space available, Winters said. The first clinic, housed within J.O. Wyatt Clinic, will be opened before the end of September and another, attached to the Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s location on 34th, will be open by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as possible,\u201d Winters said. \u201cIt depends on what we run into with permits and construction.\u201d\n\nA new seniors\u2019 clinic will round out the expansion. The location of the clinic has not yet been selected, but Winters said potential sites have been identified. The clinic should be operational by the end of 2014, he said.\n\nThe programs are not based on any set model; Northwest has developed the expansion project from scratch. Proposals had to be approved by the government before they were funded.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act spurred the hospital\u2019s clinic expansion project, Crawford said.\n\n\u201cI think it was more of a punch in the gut in the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s making us rethink how we deliver care. I mean, that\u2019s what these four projects are all about.\u201d\n\nHealth care is beginning to shift toward preventative medicine and treating people before they get sick, he said.\n\n\u201cIt has caused us to think outside of the box more than we were before,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: Northwest Texas Healthcare System", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Latest News, Local News, News, Business, JC CORTEZ, Gene Winters, John McDonald, Mark Crawford, Medicare, Northwest Emergency, Stephen Newman, Texas Department of Health and Human Services", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "Northwest Texas Healthcare System is planning a $17.5 million clinics upgrade to reduce emergency room overcrowding and delays that can keep patients waiting for a doctor for over an hour, according to recent Medicare data.", "title": "Northwest plans $17.5M overhaul", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2014-08-09/northwest-plans-175m-overhaul", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/13604327.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Northwest Texas Healthcare System is planning a $17.5 million clinics upgrade to reduce emergency room overcrowding and delays that can keep patients waiting for a doctor for over an hour, according to recent Medicare data.At a recent Amarillo Hospital District board of managers meeting, Northwest Chief Operating Officer John McDonald presented documents detailing the projects."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bbe\"", "article_summary": "\u25a0 Northwest Texas Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Center, 814 Martin Road;\u25a0 Northwest Texas Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Center, 1900 S.E.\nAnother problem is the inability of many people to discern a serious medical condition from symptoms of common conditions, Northwest Emergency Director Dr. Stephen Newman said.\nSource: Northwest Texas Healthcare System\nNorthwest also plans to open new urgent care clinics attached to or housed within its three existing clinics.\nThe projects are expected to reduce wait times and costs associated with emergency room visits; areas the hospital has been focusing on, Northwest CEO Mark Crawford said."}
