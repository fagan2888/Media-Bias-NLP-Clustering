To him, it\u2019s a win-win situation: The customer gets a tailor-made car and the dealership doesn\u2019t have the headache of inventory that it might never sell. All thanks to 3-D printing.\n\nRogers has already produced the world\u2019s first 3-D printed car, the Strati, a small two-seater that was unveiled to the world last month at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago.\n\nRelated: 10 Hottest New Cars for 2015\n\nIn fact, Rogers, who is not shy, says he\u2019s moved beyond Tesla Motors\u2019 Elon Musk in the development of the electric car. \u201cTesla made the electric drive train famous, we\u2019re changing the whole car,\u201d Rogers told the technology website Mashable.\n\nRogers acknowledges that Local Motors can\u2019t take complete credit for the new car. The company encourages others to produce and share design ideas. These groups submit their finished designs to Local Motors, which then sells them both online and in retail stores.\n\nThe design for the Strati \u2013 which means \u201clayers\u201d in Italian \u2013 was submitted by Michele Anoe in Italy, one of more than 200 auto designers who responded to Local Motor\u2019s call in June 2013 for workable designs for 3-D printed cars.\n\nRogers says Anoe\u2019s design was ideal for Local Motors because it included the two manufacturing techniques his company wanted to use: 3-D printing, which builds up a part, and subtractive machining, which pares material from a large piece of material into a smaller part.\n\nFor the printing, Local Motors teamed up with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Oak Ridge Laboratory. Oak Ridge Labs found a company with a large laser printer, then retrofitted the device with a 3-D extruder. Oak Ridge says the upgraded machine, capable of \u201cBig Area Additive Manufacturing\u201d or BAAM, can build parts 10 times larger and hundreds of times faster than existing technologies.\n\nFor the subtractive machining, Local Motors used a special routing or grinding machine from Thermwood Corp. to smooth out the car\u2019s rough edges.\n\nRelated: What If You Could Print What You Eat ...\n\nAll told, the 3-D printing took 44 hours and the subsequent milling took a day longer. Then Local Motors employees spent four days assembling the parts.\n\nThe big question, of course, is: How does it drive? Probably the best example of an electric car today is theChevrolet Volt. It has a range of 40 miles but can achieve speeds to make it keep up with other vehicles on a high-speed freeway.\n\nThe Strati has three times the Volt\u2019s range, but can\u2019t go faster than 40 mph. And, unlike the Volt, it still requires plenty of testing before it can hit the road.\n\nThis article originally appeared in OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more at OilPrice:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If Jay Rogers had his way, car buyers would be able to order a vehicle at a dealership", "title": "This 3D Printed Car May One Day Be Yours", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/17/3D-Printed-Car-May-One-Day-Be-Yours", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/local-motors-strati-001-1500x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/17/3D-Printed-Car-May-One-Day-Be-Yours", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/local-motors-strati-001-1500x1000.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If Jay Rogers had his way, car buyers would be able to order a vehicle at a dealership", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: What If You Could Print What You Eat ...All told, the 3-D printing took 44 hours and the subsequent milling took a day longer.\n\u201cTesla made the electric drive train famous, we\u2019re changing the whole car,\u201d Rogers told the technology website Mashable.\nAll thanks to 3-D printing.\nRogers has already produced the world\u2019s first 3-D printed car, the Strati, a small two-seater that was unveiled to the world last month at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago.\nThese groups submit their finished designs to Local Motors, which then sells them both online and in retail stores."}
