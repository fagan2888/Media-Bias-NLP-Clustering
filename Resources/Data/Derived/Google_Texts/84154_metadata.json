Not only are we releasing unknown illegal aliens onto American streets, but we are allowing them to travel commercially using paperwork that could easily be reproduced or manipulated on any home computer. The Notice to Appear form has no photo, anyone can make one and manipulate one. They do not have any security features, no watermark, nothing. They are simply printed on standard copy paper based on the information the illegal alien says is the truth.\u201d\n\nSpokesman Garza continued, \u201cWe do not know who these people are, we often have to solely rely on who they say they are, where they say they came from, and the history they say they have. We know nothing about most of them, ICE releases them into the American public, and now they are boarding aircraft at will with a simple paper document that anyone can easily alter or reproduce themselves.\u201d\n\n[...]\n\nBreitbart Texas also spoke with Shawn Moran, the vice president of the NBPC and he stated, \u201cWhy waste money and effort transporting people from the RGV if we are only going to release them with no real way to track them? Why are we allowing them to travel commercially using paperwork that could easily be reproduced or manipulated on any home computer.\u201d\n\nSpokesman Garza highlighted the significance of the NBPC\u2019s assertions regarding security threats posed to the American public and stated, \u201cThe threat this poses from terrorists upon the American people is absolutely unacceptable. Central Americans are not the only people crossing our border and being released. Does anyone actually think that cartels and others criminal or possible terrorist organizations are not taking advantage of the fact that we are having to leave our border wide open while we reassigning the majority of our agents to process family units and minors? Of course this situation is being exploited by such threats.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/07/tsa_allowing_illegal_aliens_to_fly_without_verifiable_id.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: TSA allowing illegal aliens to fly without verifiable ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0101\"", "article_summary": "Not only are we releasing unknown illegal aliens onto American streets, but we are allowing them to travel commercially using paperwork that could easily be reproduced or manipulated on any home computer.\n\u201cThis is not the CBP [Customs and Border Protection] or another federal agency renting or leasing an aircraft, these are the same planes that the American public uses for domestic travel,\u201d said Garza.\nThe Notice to Appear form has no photo, anyone can make one and manipulate one.\nCentral Americans are not the only people crossing our border and being released.\nOf course this situation is being exploited by such threats.\u201d"}
