Circuit declared that the agents were protected from those suits because the actions took place overseas and during a terrorism investigation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s up to either Capitol Hill or the Supreme Court to determine whether people like New Jersey resident Amir Meshal can file their lawsuits, Judge Janice Rogers Brown concluded \u2014 not her court.\n\n\u201cIf people like Meshal are to have recourse to damages for alleged constitutional violations committed during a terrorism investigation occurring abroad, either Congress or the Supreme Court must specify the scope of the remedy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMeshal traveled to Somalia in 2006, but fled to neighboring Kenya when violence broke out in the war-torn country.\n\nIn January of 2007, he was arrested in a joint-U.S.-Kenyan operation and then subjected to a lengthy FBI interrogation about suspected connections to al Qaeda over the next four months. During that time, Meshal claimed to have been transferred between Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, where he was denied access to a lawyer and kept in frightening cave-like conditions.\n\nWhile he was imprisoned, Meshal lost approximately 80 pounds. He was never charged with a crime.\n\nMeshal tried to sue the FBI agents that he says violated his constitutional rights to privacy and due process. However, a lower court tossed that case out last year.\n\nCourts \u201chave tread carefully\u201d when asked to determine whether people can sue federal officials \u201cin new contexts, especially in cases within the national security arena,\u201d Brown wrote in her Friday opinion upholding the lower court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cMeshal asks us to paddle upstream against this deep current of authority.\u201d\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Judge Nina Pillard wrote that there is \u201cno dispute that [Meshal] could have sought redress\u201d if the actions had happened in the U.S.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u201cposition is that an American citizen who ventures beyond our borders has no legal remedy against arbitrary and prolonged detention and mistreatment at the hands of FBI agents \u2014 so long as those agents were sent overseas to protect United States interests,\u201d Pillard added.\n\n\u201cI cannot conclude that either the Supreme Court or our court has ever read the Constitution and laws of the United States to support that result.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A New Jersey man had tried to sue FBI agents over a prolonged detention overseas.", "description": "A New Jersey man had tried to sue FBI agents over a prolonged detention overseas.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A New Jersey man had tried to sue FBI agents over a prolonged detention overseas.", "title": "Court prohibits lawsuit against FBI for alleged abuse", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/257954-court-prohibits-lawsuit-against-fbi-for-alleged-abuse", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/fbi_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-25T06:15:14-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-25T06:15-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/257954-court-prohibits-lawsuit-against-fbi-for-alleged-abuse", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-23T16:41-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Amir Meshal,FBI", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-23T16:41:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-25T06:15:14-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/257954-court-prohibits-lawsuit-against-fbi-for-alleged-abuse", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A New Jersey man had tried to sue FBI agents over a prolonged detention overseas.", "card": "summary", "title": "Court prohibits lawsuit against FBI for alleged abuse"}, "dcterms.title": "Court prohibits lawsuit against FBI for alleged abuse"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI cannot conclude that either the Supreme Court or our court has ever read the Constitution and laws of the United States to support that result.\u201d\nAn American citizen imprisoned abroad cannot sue the FBI agents who allegedly threatened to torture him, a top federal court ruled Friday.\nMeshal tried to sue the FBI agents that he says violated his constitutional rights to privacy and due process.\nADVERTISEMENTIt\u2019s up to either Capitol Hill or the Supreme Court to determine whether people like New Jersey resident Amir Meshal can file their lawsuits, Judge Janice Rogers Brown concluded \u2014 not her court.\nA split ruling from a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C."}
