This year, that seems especially true. As we near the general election, polling suggests both leading candidates will be -- by far -- the least popular party nominees in decades. What does that mean for the rest of the race?\n\nTrump's billions\n\nEverybody knows presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is an extremely wealthy man, but does he have a history of inflating his own prosperity for public consumption?

The number of employees suing for discrimination related to pregnancy or family care is soaring, highlighting a growing cultural challenge -- and legal risk for companies.\n\nMore top news:\n\nU.S.\n\nNew blow to homeowners hit by massive L.A. gas leak\n\nSuspect in killing of Mass. cop killed in shootout\n\nFla. police officer fatally shoots car burglar\n\nWorld\n\nBombs, rockets tear through Syrian regime strongholds\n\nObama reverses 5-decade arms policy on Vietnam\n\n2 climbers die, 2 still missing on Mt.
