This was his explanation: \u201cAnd what I mean by that is that I go into these high school gyms, I watch these kids, and the first thing they do is they run to the 3-point line. You are not Steph Curry. Work on the other aspects of the game.\u201d\n\nUnderstood.\n\nJackson is right and wrong at the same time.\n\nThere is, in fact, more to basketball than the 3-point shot that earns Curry nightly raves and highlights. But it isn\u2019t a bad thing that shooting is en vogue. It\u2019s a great thing. No other league, no other sport rips itself as much as basketball does, which is a shame. When Michael Jordan dominated sports shows, the issue then was all kids were working on were their hops and attacking the rim. Who was working on shooting?\n\nNow, a new generation has fallen in love with the 3-point shot. And so they are working on \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 shooting. That is an extraordinarily good thing. Next to dribbling, it\u2019s the most fundamental skill in basketball.\n\nCurry is putting well-rounded performances on film. Sure, there are long-range 3-point shots. But there also are pull-up, midrange shots. There are drives to the rim, where he finishes with both his right and left hand. His handles are so tight, the basketball looks attached to his hand. He gets off crisp passes with both his right and his left hand. He can finish with an array of shots in the lane.\n\nAbout the only thing that will get young players in trouble when they emulate it, is Curry\u2019s shot selection. Many times it\u2019s not ideal, but he makes both bad and good shots, so it works for him. That, however, can be coached out of a less-skilled player\u2019s game.\n\nYoung players\u2019 ability to see more than just the 3-pointers is being taken for granted. Some have tunnel vision. The vast majority won\u2019t. They see the tireless ball-handling drills. Everyone saw Curry play under control and set up teammates time and time again for open shots Friday in the 89-83 win over Cleveland.\n\nNBA coaches and older players complain about the lack of skill in the league. AAU generation, they say. Too worried about the flashy highlight, they say.\n\nCurry has made skilled basketball all the rage. Every kid who works on shot-making twice as much as he does plyometric jumping is a win for the NBA. Every kid who comes down the court able to quickly diagnose a defense and make the right decision with the basketball \u2014 because they saw Steph Curry do it \u2014 is a win for the NBA.\n\nIn about 10 years we will start to see the impact of it all. Curry will be every bit as game-transforming a player as Jordan was. Book that. We are celebrating Kobe Bryant this season, the closest player we have seen to being Jordan as there ever was. Bryant idolized and took pages from Jordan\u2019s playbook. We will see a player do the same with Curry.\n\nHe will stand before media and explain how, when he was little, he ran around in a Curry jersey, how he worked endlessly on ball handling, how playing basketball at a pro level seemed more attainable to him because it no longer looked like a club open only to athletic monsters.\n\nAnd, most of all, these young players will have seen how a professional should act \u2014 on and off the court. Curry is The Associated Press 2015 male athlete of the year. His jersey is the top seller in the NBA now. He was the driving force behind a 28-1 start for his team, the best start in NBA history.\n\nThis was Curry\u2019s year, the year he rose to stardom, the year skills reassumed the driver\u2019s seat in a game built on them.\n\nEnvious coaches poked at Curry and his team for being lucky to win last season\u2019s NBA title.\n\nThe NBA should be so lucky as to see more end up just like him.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Stephen Curry is helping basketball more than ever", "title": "Dempsey: Stephen Curry is helping basketball more than ever", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/dempsey-stephen-curry-is-helping-basketball-more-than-ever/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T19:16:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:39:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd44d9\"", "article_summary": "And, most of all, these young players will have seen how a professional should act \u2014 on and off the court.\nThere is, in fact, more to basketball than the 3-point shot that earns Curry nightly raves and highlights.\nYoung players\u2019 ability to see more than just the 3-pointers is being taken for granted.\nAbout the only thing that will get young players in trouble when they emulate it, is Curry\u2019s shot selection.\nSure, there are long-range 3-point shots."}
