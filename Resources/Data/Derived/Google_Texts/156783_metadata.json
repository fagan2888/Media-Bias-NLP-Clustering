But less than three months later, things look very different. During and after the shutdown, public approval of the Republican Party bottomed out at the lowest levels seen in more than two decades. In one survey, 70 percent accused the party of putting its political agenda ahead of the public good. Congressional races that were supposed to be safe Republican seats started to look winnable for Democrats, and Democratic candidates came out of the woodwork to contest them. In Omaha, Nebraska, a Democratic city councilman who\u2019d previously refused his party\u2019s entreaties to try for a seat the party hadn\u2019t held since 1992 suddenly announced he was willing, on account of \u201cthe dysfunction.\u201d He was featured in the New York Times. House Speaker John Boehner began to look like the man who killed the GOP. A CNN poll in mid-October, right after the shutdown ended, found Americans preferring to vote for Democrats for Congress by an 8-point margin. CNN took the same poll in mid-December and got a different result: Republicans favored by 5 points. The Democrats\u2019 great Nebraska hope dropped out of the race. Boehner, who spent the year trying and failing to bring his caucus to heel, has finally solidified some measure of control. Given the way things have turned out, maybe it\u2019s worth revisiting who actually won the shutdown. Not only do Republicans lead the congressional ballot for the first time in more than a year, they rallied behind the year-end budget deal that funds the government into 2015, and they\u2019ve finally decided to call an end to the pointless repeal-Obamacare votes. Boehner, who spent the year trying and failing to bring his caucus to heel, has finally solidified some measure of control. In the end, after all the dust settled, did Boehner win the shutdown?\n\nObviously, Republicans' current good fortune is partly thanks to the problems Obamacare has encountered, which they didn't create and couldn't have fully predicted. But Boehner's strengthened position is also the result of strategy on his part. He chose to prolong the shutdown and take the short-term pain in order to increase the prospects of order down the road. When the shutdown hit on October 1, Boehner had a choice. He could have overruled the small but vocal group of House Republicans who were refusing to fund the government unless Obamacare was defunded. He could have put the \"clean\" continuing resolution passed by the Senate up for a vote. It probably would have passed, with mostly Democratic votes. As the shutdown went on for two and a half weeks, Boehner faced increasing pressure, including from his own worried advisers, to put the clean CR on the floor. But Boehner knew that even if he did that, when the country hit the debt ceiling, on October 17, there would be another confrontation, this one threatening to put the country in default. And after that, there would be another confrontation after the short-term CR expired, and another one after that, and another one after that. He didn\u2019t want a deal that ended the shutdown without resolving the more serious matter of the debt ceiling, and he wanted his unruly caucus to learn a lesson. So he waited. The agreement that ended the shutdown on October 17 also raised the debt ceiling. Additionally, it required the House and Senate to start negotiating a budget agreement, with a December 13 deadline. Nobody thought this would actually happen; since 2009, the government had been operating under \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d instead of budget agreements, essentially treading water at the same level of government spending (or less, after this year\u2019s sequestration cuts). When the Senate finally passed a budget this year, it was so far from the tax-cutting, Medicare-reforming plan the House had approved that any talk of compromise seemed laughable. The pre-shutdown House GOP refused to even send negotiators to try to harmonize the two.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things looked bad for Republicans after they refused to fund the government, but they&#39;re a lot better now\u2014and the House speaker deserves some credit.", "author": "Molly Ball", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Things looked bad for Republicans after they refused to fund the government, but they&#39;re a lot better now\u2014and the House speaker deserves some credit.", "title": "Did John Boehner Win the Shutdown in the End?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/RTX162O0/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/did-john-boehner-win-the-shutdown-in-the-end/282810/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mollyball"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In the end, after all the dust settled, did Boehner win the shutdown?\nHe could have overruled the small but vocal group of House Republicans who were refusing to fund the government unless Obamacare was defunded.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner began to look like the man who killed the GOP.\nDuring and after the shutdown, public approval of the Republican Party bottomed out at the lowest levels seen in more than two decades.\nWhen the Senate finally passed a budget this year, it was so far from the tax-cutting, Medicare-reforming plan the House had approved that any talk of compromise seemed laughable."}
