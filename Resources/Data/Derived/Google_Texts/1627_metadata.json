His shunning of Castelgandolfo led to a drastic decline in tourism that hurt the local economy.\n\nOpening the palace doors \u201cwas the pope\u2019s initiative,\u201d said Antonio Paolucci, head of the Vatican Museums. \u201cFrancis said \u2018I won\u2019t go to Castelgandolfo because I have too much to do at the Vatican\u2019 and so he told me to open the palace and the grounds to the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of Castelgandolfo were certainly disappointed that the pope decided to not spend his summers here. This is a chance to draw attention to the city again and help the economy,\u201d Paolucci said.\n\nA special train will run on Saturdays from the Vatican to Castelgandolfo, about 35 km (20 miles) south of Rome.\n\nTourists can see the Vatican Museums and gardens and then take the train to the Castelgandolfo estate and the satellite museum.\n\nFor the inaugural run on Friday, Italy\u2019s state railways used a 100-year-old, coal-powered locomotive that belted out dark clouds of smoke as it left the Vatican pulling antique carriages, including one used by Pope John XXIII in 1962.\n\nAt 136 acres (55 hectares) the Castelgandolfo estate is about 25 percent larger than Vatican City, with woodlands and a working farm with about 100 cows producing 1,300 liters of milk a day.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Castelgondolfo, Italy, Pope Francis, Rome, Vatican", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "The Vatican has turned part of lavish Castelgondolfo - which the frugal Pope Francis has avoided - into a museum and linked it to Rome via a train.", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 unused summer palace adds a museum", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/12/pope-francis-unused-summer-estate-adds-a-museum/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/thumbRNSPOPESUMMER062209a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/12/pope-francis-unused-summer-estate-adds-a-museum/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/12/pope-francis-unused-summer-estate-adds-a-museum/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The Vatican has turned part of lavish Castelgondolfo - which the frugal Pope Francis has avoided - into a museum and linked it to Rome via a train."}, "article_summary": "The Vatican has turned part of the lavish papal summer estate south of Rome \u2013 which the frugal Pope Francis has never used \u2013 into a museum and linked it to Rome via a train.\nTourists can see the Vatican Museums and gardens and then take the train to the Castelgandolfo estate and the satellite museum.\nPope Francis, a workaholic who has also renounced the papal apartments in the Vatican in favor of a suite in a guesthouse, does not take vacations.\nCASTELGANDOLFO, Italy (Reuters) \u2013 If you\u2019ve ever wanted to see the world from the viewpoint of a pope, now you can.\nA special train will run on Saturdays from the Vatican to Castelgandolfo, about 35 km (20 miles) south of Rome."}
