A new report found that depression among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is much higher than previously believed.\n\nPeople living with RA are twice as likely to be depressed than others. Over a long period of time, the autoimmune disorder, which causes swelling of the knees and other joints, can lead to excruciating chronic pain, as well as an inability to move about or walk easily. Not being able to partake in daily activities due to constant pain is one of the reasons why RA patients are likely to develop depression over time.\n\nAccording to the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS), depression often goes unreported in RA patients because many of the symptoms, such as fatigue or poor sleep, can often be attributed to the disease itself.\n\nThe team of researchers was led by Professor Anne Barton, a member of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Manchester Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, and reviewed 322 patients who were living with severe rheumatoid arthritis. These patients were waiting to be placed on biologic treatments for RA, which are a class of drugs that recreate the effects of natural substances made by the body\u2019s immune system. The study focused on the current measure of the disease \u2014 a test called DAS28 \u2014 which produces a score that estimates the number of swollen joints in the body as well as inflammation levels.\n\nThe DAS28 is somewhat of a \u201csubjective\u201d approach, since patients who take the test are able to self-report how they are feeling. The researchers found that such subjective measures of the disease were more likely to be influenced by mood and other psychological factors.\n\n\u201cThis may seem obvious but has not been reported before and is important because without treating the depression, the patient\u2019s DAS28 score might not improve as much as it should on a biological drug, and doctors may assume the drug is ineffective,\u201d Dr. Lis Cordingley, a health psychologist and a lead author of the study, said in a press release. Essentially, doctors and rheumatologists treating patients with RA should be aware that depression is a very real side effect of the disease, that may have a significant impact on the overall well-being of the patient depending on how severe the symptoms are.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study of its kind in patients with high levels of active disease,\u201d Barton said in the press release, \u201cand suggests that routinely assessing a patient\u2019s moods and beliefs \u2014 separate to their physical state \u2014 would be useful in guiding patient management. As rheumatologists we need to be aware that depression may occur more commonly in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis than we had realized.\u201d\n\nDespite the seemingly bad news, another recent study released last year actually took a positive spin on RA patients\u2019 quality of life. The authors of the study found that overall, people with rheumatoid arthritis have better psychological well-being than they did several decades ago. The researchers pinpointed improvements in treatment and medications, as well as physical and psychological services, as being the main reasons behind improved quality of life. \u201cThe results of our study relay the hopeful message to patients that today, in spite of having rheumatoid arthritis, they have a better opportunity to live a full and valued life than 20 years ago,\u201d C\u00e9cile Overman, a doctoral student in healthy psychology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, told Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, the authors of the most recent study believe health care professionals should review each self-reported component of the DAS28 test carefully in order to be able to adjust therapies and treatments based on psychological needs of the patient. \u201cBy reporting individual DAS28 components, clinicians may be better able to assess the impact of therapies on each component, adjusting approaches according to patients\u2019 needs,\u201d the authors wrote in the conclusion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rheumatoid arthritis depression, arthritis, joint pain, das28", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Those who suffer from severe joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis may also be at a much higher risk for developing depression.", "title": "Depression Among Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Much Higher Than Previously Reported", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/depression-among-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients-much-higher-previously-reported-267639", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/22/arthritis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Those who suffer from severe joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis may also be at a much higher risk for developing depression.", "title": "Depression Among Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Much Higher Than Previously Reported", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/depression-among-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients-much-higher-previously-reported-267639", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/22/arthritis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/22/arthritis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-01-22T15:21:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-22T15:21:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Those who suffer from severe joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis may also be at a much higher risk for developing depression."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ce9\"", "article_summary": "A new report found that depression among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is much higher than previously believed.\nRheumatoid arthritis \u2014 though not a life-threatening, fatal disease \u2014 can become a heavy burden on those suffering from it.\nThe authors of the study found that overall, people with rheumatoid arthritis have better psychological well-being than they did several decades ago.\nAccording to the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS), depression often goes unreported in RA patients because many of the symptoms, such as fatigue or poor sleep, can often be attributed to the disease itself.\nNot being able to partake in daily activities due to constant pain is one of the reasons why RA patients are likely to develop depression over time."}
