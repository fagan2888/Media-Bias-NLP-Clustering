The 11-year-old boy seen standing alongside and gazing at President Obama during the historic White House signing of Obamacare into law is now a 17-year-old transitioning into a girl.

“Marcelas Owens … was the chubby 11-year-old African=American boy who stood next to President Barack Obama as he signed Obamacare into law at a White House ceremony on March 23, 2010. He was the miniature health care activist in the black vest dwarfed by powerful lawmakers in a famous photo of that moment.

He’s “starting to tell family and friends what [he’s] long known: Though born male, he’s long identified as a female.”

And thanks to Obamacare, it won’t be so expensive for him to obtain the hormone treatments.
