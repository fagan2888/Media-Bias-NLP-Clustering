President Obama on Sunday memorialized the firefighters who sacrificed their lives this year “serving their neighbors, their communities, our nation with courage, and fortitude and strength.”

“We can never repay them fully for their service,” the president said in his speech at the 34th Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service in Maryland.

The president offered condolences to the families of the 87 firefighters who have died in recent months.

“You remember them as moms and dads, siblings and spouses, friends and neighbors,” Obama said. “Today we remember them and salute them as the heroes that they were.”

He commended the firefighting brotherhood for their willingness to “leave their homes and their families so they might save the lives of people that they’ve never met.”

“It’s hard to think of a more selfless profession than firefighting,” Obama said. “There’s a reason why firefighting occupies a special place in our imaginations; why little boys and increasingly little girls say, I want to be a fireman, I want to be a firefighter. They understand instinctually that there’s something special about it.”

The president also called for action to prevent wildfires before they start, and to ensure firefighters are properly fitted with the best available equipment.

“So far this year, nearly 50,000 wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres – an area larger than the entire state of Maryland,” Obama said. “At the season’s peak, 32,000 firefighters were battling blazes from California to North Carolina. Thirteen have lost their lives. And today, we honor them as well.”

The president unveiled a plaque at the ceremony with the names of the 87 fallen firefighters.
