John McCain. 'If anything, it fires me up' to run again, he said Monday.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nSenator John McCain, seen here at a 2011 Monitor Breakfast event in Washington, DC, has been censured by Arizona GOP leaders. On Saturday, they adopted a resolution saying that unless his attitude changes, the state party won\u2019t work or campaign for him.\n\nIs John McCain too liberal for Arizona? Yes, that question may sound a bit weird, given that he\u2019s the state\u2019s senior Republican and has won reelection as a senator four times. But the 2008 GOP presidential nominee has gotten crosswise with the Arizona Republican Party, apparently. On Saturday, a party meeting in Tempe censured Senator McCain for working too closely with Democrats on immigration and the federal budget, among things.\n\nMcCain \u201chas abandoned our values and has been eerily silent against Liberals, yet publicly reprimands Conservatives in his own Party,\u201d read a resolution adopted by party leaders on a voice vote.\n\nMcCain\u2019s caustic criticism of Sen. Ted Cruz (R) of Texas and other tea party conservatives whose push to defund Obamacare led to last year\u2019s government shutdown was another strike against him, in the eyes of Arizona critics. The resolution says that unless his attitude changes, the state party won\u2019t work or campaign for McCain.\n\nRecommended: So you think you know Congress? Take our quiz.\n\n\u201cOur complaint is that John McCain is always working on the other side of the aisle and he never lands on our side of the aisle,\u201d said Timothy Schwartz, an Arizona GOP district chairman, on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d Monday night.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? It\u2019s possible state conservatives are trying to wave McCain off a try for a sixth term in 2016. He hasn\u2019t yet said whether he\u2019s going to run for reelection.\n\nBut McCain handily defeated a conservative primary challenger, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth, in 2010, so grumblings from that side of the party may not bother him. And anybody who\u2019s met the man can figure out that poking him just might persuade him to run again out of irritation.\n\n\u201cIf anything, it fires me up,\u201d McCain said on Monday.\n\nMcCain said he\u2019s got polling showing he\u2019s an overwhelming favorite in Arizona. And he may be right, not just because of his long service, but because Arizona is not as conservative a state as some pundits might realize.\n\nSure, Arizona has Joe Arpaio, the self-described \u201cToughest Sheriff in America.\u201d (He\u2019s just put some prisoners on a bread and water diet for desecrating the American flag.) It has GOP Gov. Jan Brewer, who got some attention for maybe waving her finger in President Obama\u2019s face during his visit to Arizona in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, GOP candidate Mitt Romney handily defeated Mr. Obama in Arizona, 53 to 44 percent.\n\nBut last year, Gallup rated the relative conservative-liberal balance in all 50 states, by asking residents how they would describe their own political values. And Arizona came out ... almost exactly in the middle.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Arizona is not in America\u2019s top 10 conservative states, according to Gallup. It is not even in the top 20. It is just a tick more red state than Colorado and Virginia, both of which are former red states trending purpler with each passing electoral cycle.\n\nDid we mention that almost 30 percent of Arizona's population is Hispanic? That\u2019s not a GOP-leaning demographic group to put it mildly.\n\nPerhaps that is why Arizona is one of only six Republican-controlled states to agree to expand Medicaid, as called for in the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nMcCain is no Democrat\u2019s idea of a liberal. He fought against passage of Obamacare and is an enthusiastic voice pushing a muscular, interventionist US foreign policy around the world.\n\nBut it\u2019s likely he\u2019s more in tune with Arizona voters than his party leadership.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "73b7d3806a220af16e2d8e7f11a68fbc", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "Arizona GOP leaders adopted a resolution on Saturday saying that unless his attitude changes, the state party won\u2019t work or campaign for Sen.
