Just look at her glow!

Ever since announcing that they were having a baby, Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis have been enjoying life to the fullest!

The couple had a sporty date night on Friday and were laying the PDA on heavy at the Los Angeles Lakers game!

Olivia was wearing a loose white top, so it was hard to see her baby bulge, but it’s ok because look at how in love they are!!!

The actress already showed off the cutest little baby bump at the Courage In Journalism Awards and then she dressed up for a masquerade party with her baby daddy too!

We have a feeling she’s going to nail this whole “maternity style” thing!

And can we just point out one more time how impossicute these two are?!?
