This is an advertising campaign?

Or is it just some weird idea among Obama’s White House gurus of what they think white, middle class people do at Christmas?

In a ludicrous attempt to make a despised program popular, the geniuses who brought America Obamacare are offering a grown man dressed in a child’s pajamas as a role model for young people. Nerds, too, can be the suckers who pay for insurance they don’t need to benefit people they don’t know — once they’re old enough to get off their parents’ health insurance, anyway.

National Review’s Charles Cook describes him as “a metrosexual hipster in a plaid onesie who wants you to spend your precious Christmas days talking to him about the president’s vision for health insurance.”

To the world, he’s rapidly becoming known as “Pajama Boy,” a national joke introduced on President Obama’s own Twitter account.

The mockery didn’t take long to get to Twitter. Like this mash-up of the president admiring his latest creation.

In honor of #pajamaboy, President Obama tweeted this picture out… pic.twitter.com/f0Ou11Btqq — Matt (@Matthops82) December 18, 2013

Or a few of these from Twitchy.com.

Obama toured the world apologizing for America in his first term.

He can spend the first Christmas of his second term apologizing to the nerds of America for making them look bad. Even Democrat nerds don’t deserve this.
