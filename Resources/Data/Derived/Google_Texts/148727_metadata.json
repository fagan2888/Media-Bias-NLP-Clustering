Roughly close to 2,000 people showed up, many of them supporters who wanted to meet Carson and get a copy of his book \u201cA More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not your typical politician. He\u2019s a doctor. And I think he\u2019s speaking for the American people,\u201d said Abbey Cole, Pensacola.\n\n\u201cI think in every interview that I have seen him in he doesn\u2019t get super excited but I don\u2019t know I kind of like it,\u201d said Sarah Deshauteurs, Gautier, MS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of the corruption and would love someone that is an equal represent the rest of us,\u201d said Cliff Routley Pace, FL.\n\nHis visit comes as national polls show Carson neck and neck with Donald Trump, who had been leading for several months as the top Republican contender. Carson has now pulled ahead in Iowa, leading by double digits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to win all of the states, all 50 states,\u201d said Carson.\n\nThat excitement isn\u2019t only showing in polls but in donations. Carson recently raised $20 million this last quarter. That places him third behind Hillary Clinton, who raised $30 million.\n\n\u201cOver 800,000 donations. You know my campaign is not about me. It\u2019s about we the people and about time we put the people back on the forefront,\u201d said Carson.\n\nCarson is pro-life, he\u2019s campaigning to balance the budget, reform Obamacare, as well as funding for education. But we also asked him about his concerns over the Voter ID issue in Alabama.\n\n\u201cGo ahead and get whatever is necessary to vote and do it now, don\u2019t do it now don\u2019t wait till three weeks before the time so that you can make it into a big issue so that people can come in and say everybody is racist. This is craziness. Every country I\u2019ve been to and I\u2019ve been to 57 countries requires voter identification are we the only ones that are racist? It doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Carson.\n\nHe reiterated he wanted this job. And even as the polls show he is coming out on top \u2014 he says it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint, and he will stay committed.\n\nWe also checked to see if Carson would be making any stops in Mobile, and his business manager told us at this point they are still looking into it. He\u2019ll continue his book signing tour through November, with the last stop in Boca Raton, Florida.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Excitement builds as Ben Carson surges ahead in polls for GOP presidential bid.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_e95d0f97a6f7cb36caa1140d83db191f", "og": {"site_name": "WKRG", "description": "Excitement builds as Ben Carson surges ahead in polls for GOP presidential bid.", "title": "Ben Carson Draws Huge Crowds in Pensacola", "url": "http://wkrg.com/2015/11/01/ben-carson-draws-huge-crowds-in-pensacola/", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "https://mgtvwkrg.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ben-carson.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Excitement builds as Ben Carson surges ahead in polls for GOP presidential bid.", "creator": "@WKRG", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwkrg.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ben-carson.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Ben Carson Draws Huge Crowds in Pensacola", "site": "WKRG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "2016, ben carson, elections, Mobile, panhandle, pensacola, PRESIDENTIAL, REPUBLICAN, Local News, News, Top Videos", "msapplication-tooltip": "Mobile AL Breaking News, Weather for the Gulf Coast", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=560952787", "fb": {"pages": 275851267499}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkrg.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6d7cfadd1f58afc062fb45efdcb7413b?s=16", "application-name": "WKRG", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WKRG.News.5", "published_time": "2015-11-02T05:34:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T05:34:22+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "07e_JC57dQ2iJscG402lpVfZSJAuAxVAk3ZQn_FiexY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Despite terrible weather in Pensacola, turnout for Ben Carson\u2019s book signing event was huge.\nAnd I think he\u2019s speaking for the American people,\u201d said Abbey Cole, Pensacola.\nHe\u2019ll continue his book signing tour through November, with the last stop in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to win all of the states, all 50 states,\u201d said Carson.\nHis visit comes as national polls show Carson neck and neck with Donald Trump, who had been leading for several months as the top Republican contender."}
