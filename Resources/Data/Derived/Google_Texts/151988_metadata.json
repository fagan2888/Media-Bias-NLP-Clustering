Maybe it will be the whole country. Maybe it\u2019ll just be the elite-run GOP. Hopefully it will be whatever painfully white, elderly, socialist creep the Democrats nominate. But regardless, I\u2019m one of those many people who is so angry he just wants to see something burn.\n\nBoehner down, plenty to go. Now is this reasonable? Is this a smart, savvy strategy? I\u2019m not sure we even care anymore.\n\nSee, we\u2019ve been shafted too long\u2013 these hacks can\u2019t even keep the government from spending money on baby dismemberment \u2013 and someone or something has got to pay. I\u2019d prefer it be the Democrats, but I\u2019m happy to wreck unholy vengeance on the GOP elite that has lied to us, cheated us, and run away faster than Brave Sir Robin.\n\nWhich raises the question \u2013 what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow? Well, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s African or European; I just want to roast it on a spit.\n\nSo where do we go now? Walker and Perry are out, two great guys with impeccable records. And, while I am sorry to see them go, I am not sorry to see them go now, because it seems clear they weren\u2019t going to get the job done. And I want the job done, then I want the doer to take the cannoli.\n\nWe conservatives must choose between five categories of GOP candidates (with apologies to Hugh Hewitt, who started discussing his four categories about the time I first started drafting this column). We can throw caution and conservatism to the wind and sign on with the super outsiders, Trump or Carson. We can go with one of the true conservatives, like Cruz or Jindal. We can go down to glorious defeat with a certifiable loser, like Santorum or Huckabee or Paul. We can go with Team Squish and sullenly fall in line, as our elite donor class betters command, for Jeb! or that nattering churchlady John Kasich. Or we can go with the straddlers, Rubio, Christie and Fiorina, who might be able to bring both the moderates and conservatives on board.\n\nMight.\n\nThe outsiders shouldn\u2019t be president. Sorry. Dr. Carson is a nice man who has no instinct for ripping out his opponents\u2019 jugular. I want to hear some liberal womyn lamenting the crushing of our enemies, Doc, but you\u2019d probably go and comfort them.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Donald Trump, whose embarrassing debate performance started the trend of people saying, \u201cYou know, it was fun for a while but this guy has become tiresome.\u201d\n\nTrump has the aggression \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing I like about him \u2013 but it\u2019s also the only thing he has. The polls are showing that his novelty is wearing off; people can only deal with so much whining. He\u2019ll always have a hardcore set of minions, but for the first time in weeks I don\u2019t think we have to seriously contemplate the notion of Ivanka the veep.\n\nThen there are the true conservatives. I like Bobby Jindal, but unlike most Americans, I know who he is.\n\nI like Ted Cruz too. He\u2019s a lawyer and usually talks like one. But I\u2019m a lawyer and not a normal human being. I\u2019ve seen him up close in the past and he seems to lack charisma. He\u2019s not Gort in a pantsuit like Hillary, but he\u2019s off-putting to people who don\u2019t use words like \u201ctort\u201d in everyday conversation. Normal people may be repelled and frightened, though in his recent Colbert appearance he seemed uncomfortable but human. Still, as great as he is on policy (in fact, I don\u2019t think anyone is better), I just don\u2019t see him putting together 270 electoral votes in a country full of so many blithering idiots. Moreover, I expect the money he needs to beat Hillary will dry up because the treacherous GOP elite will collectively loosen its bowels if he\u2019s nominated.\n\nSorry. I don\u2019t see how Cruz wins, and crushing the Democrats is important. Now, if we gotta go down fighting, Cruz is a good hill to die on, but I\u2019d prefer we not die in 2016. More precisely, I\u2019d prefer my country not die, which I think a Hillary victory could very well lead to.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to spend time with the losers. Santorum and Huckabee are punchlines, and railing about sodomy is not a platform. Get a clue, Rick \u2013 no one likes you. Huckabee should stop acting like anyone cares about what Kim Davis thinks; all she does is prove that even annoying people can suffer injustice. Go back to covering \u201cFree Bird\u201d and hawking diabetes cures.\n\nAs for Rand Paul, well, whatever. Blame the Illuminati.\n\nWe come to the elite\u2019s choices, Jeb! and Kasich. Ugh. Since I prefer my Republicans to actually be Republicans, that kind of eliminates the GOPers who support amnesty, Common Core, Obamacare, and gun control. Sure, they\u2019ll deny all of that, but they lie. Sadly, Mitch McConnell and the French Army up on Capitol Hill ruined the squishes\u2019 \u201cTalk right, rule left\u201d scam. If the elite wants to bet we won\u2019t dare destroy the party and that we\u2019ll fall into line with their puppets, I\u2019ll see you and raise you the Whigs. I\u2019ll vote for Trump before I vote for either of these tools. No kidding; I don\u2019t think I can ever swallow voting for these jerks.\n\nOh, and what was the pre-debate thought process that led Kasich to steal Tom Skerrit\u2019s hairstyle from Top Gun?\n\nThat just leaves the three potential straddlers of the conservative/moderate divide. I\u2019m being kind by letting Christie in here. He\u2019s much more establishment, and his new-found love of conservatism can\u2019t erase the image of his Hurricane Sandy tonsil hockey tournament with Obama. So nope.\n\nMarco Rubio. I could write a whole column on him and might do it down the road. There\u2019s so much to like there, and so much that makes me want to slap him.\n\nI keep wanting to like him, but then I keep remembering that he lied to us about amnesty. I want to hear it from him: \u201cThe default for illegal immigrants is going home. You never, ever, ever, get to be citizens because you disrespected us by breaking our laws.\u201d Anything less, and he\u2019s weaseling, and he weaseled once on us already; he should be on his knees shouting \u201cI\u2019m not worthy\u201d in gratitude that we\u2019d even consider allowing him to beg our forgiveness after that shameful Gang of 8 episode.\n\nOh, and he needs to stop being so damn prissy. I know the consultants are telling you Americans want to hear a \u201chopeful message,\u201d but our definition of \u201chopeful message\u201d is \u201cI intend to destroy progressivism and crush its quasi-fascist adherents wherever they lurk.\u201d That\u2019s hope.\n\nAnd learn from Donald Trump \u2013 did I say that? Stop sucking up to the media. Let\u2019s practice:\n\nMedia Hack: \u201cSo, do you think Donald Trump should have corrected that random guy who thinks Obama is a Muslim?\u201d\n\nRubio: \u201cI think you liberal media hacks should stop asking me stupid questions. Why don\u2019t you scurry off to the Hillary-o-tron and start asking it while it didn\u2019t repudiate President Fail when he compared patriotic Americans to the mullahs for opposing his Iranian nuclear sell-out. Now get out of my face or I\u2019ll slug you. Jerk.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sick of Rubio coming across like the kid who reminds the teacher she forgot to assign the homework. But on the plus side, he knows foreign policy and his wife is hot, so there\u2019s that.\n\nWhich leaves Carly. She seems ticked off. I like that. She kicks tail. I like that too. She can put together a coherent sentence. Finally. I don\u2019t despise her. That\u2019s something new for a GOP candidate. And, best of all, I think the elite distrusts her and Hillary fears her \u2013 in fact, she could mop the floor with the Orange Pantsuit Lady.\n\nYeah, maybe Carly.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut if not her, and if there\u2019s no one else, then I\u2019m still ready to burn it all down.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Something is going to end up a smoldering ruin.
