Having traveled the world, Sam and Lamya Malhorta are using their hard-won knowledge as vintners to offer locals a direct doorway into Napa County\u2019s global fame.\n\nThe Malhortas have been part of the community\u2019s life along the lake for 19 years now, but it\u2019s their ownership of Work Vineyard in Calistoga that\u2019s continuing to elevate them from veteran wine sellers to artisan wine makers, as well as giving them the ideal tools to help vino connoisseurs build nuanced, elegant bottle collections.\n\nThroughout it all, the husband and wife duo say their experience with locals has helped them live the proverbial small business American dream.\n\nIn the introduction to his book \u201cWine and Dine Style,\u201d Sam Malhorta recalls that his childhood in India taught him that \u201cnothing comes in life by begging \u2013 everything comes through a \u2018style.\u2019\u201d He also learned from his own family that meals could be, or should be, spiritual celebrations of bringing friends, families and strangers together. With those core values, Sam found himself a young man working for the Indian government\u2019s Foreign Service in Baghdad. Whenever diplomats and dignitaries from around the world arrived in Iraq, and needed to speak with Indian officials stationed there, it was Sam\u2019s job to show them around the best restaurants and drinking holes within \u201cthe Cradle of Civilization\u201d had to offer. The assignment gave him the opportunity to begin tasting the greatest wines in the world.\n\nOne night in 1981, on a floating restaurant on the Tigris River, he got to know the Iraqi woman who would become his partner in life. Lamya worked in air travel in Baghdad and was a bit of an internationalist herself.\n\nSam and Lamya were eventually married, and though each had good careers in the East they eventually began to turn their gaze to the United States. In 1991 they arrived in Sacramento with a small stipend of cash and their one-year-old son, John.\n\n\u201cWe were starting from zero again,\u201d Lamya remembered.\n\nIn Baghdad, Sam had developed his wine palate for years on bottles from France, Italy and Spain. He decided it would be invigorating to open a wine and spirits store in Carmichael. After an established run of success, he and Lamya set their hearts on opening a similar business in Granite Bay.\n\nLakeside Beverage arrived in 1997 on Douglas Boulevard on the quiet side of the Folsom-Auburn Road intersection. By then the Malhorta family had grown to include a daughter, Zina. Sam soon had the novel idea of fusing his wine and spirits store with an in-house tasting bar. He saw a chance to allow locals to sample wine varietals from around the state and whiskeys from across the world. The idea stirred immediate excitement in Granite Bay.\n\n\u201cBefore you knew it, it was like a revolution,\u201d Lamya explained. \u201cPeople were loving it. The concept was incredibly well received.\u201d\n\nThe ever-flowing wine at Lakeside led young John and Zina to some star-struck moments as entertainers like Eddie Murphy and members of the Sacramento Kings\u2019 famed \u201cDream Team\u201d \u2013 including Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic and Brad Miller \u2013 began making the store a regular hangout. It was a fun experience, but for Sam and Lamya, getting to know multiple generations of South Placer families was the most rewarding aspect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people start learning about wine here, who used to come in with the store with their parents when they were children,\u201d Sam observed. \u201cWe\u2019re on our second generation of customers, and I can certainly say this area has been good to us.\u201d\n\nSam\u2019s years selling and recommending California wines had also brought him into the orbit of Napa County vintner Henry Work, who owned Work Vineyard in Calistoga. In 2007, Work decided to retire. If he was going to sell his vineyard, he wanted to sell it to a friend and wine expert he respected: Thus Sam and Lamya were allowed to purchase it. The couple threw themselves into every aspect of the wine-making process, and after 8 years of being immersed in it, they claim the benefits have transferred to their Granite Bay customers on numerous levels.\n\n\u201cIt was a platform we were always looking for from the other side of the fence,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIt really lifted us from the status of a retailer to someone who understands Napa from another perspective.\u201d\n\nLamya agreed, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s brought so much to our knowledge and expertise of the wine industry: We\u2019re involved in every aspect of wine now, from growing the grapes, the fermenting, tasting and the bottling process, to getting products on the shelves.\u201d\n\nNumerous Granite Bay wine lovers have now traveled to Work Vineyard, finding that quintessential Calistoga view of sunny, vine-studded valleys sprawling under the foot of rustic, California hills. They\u2019ve also found glasses of Work\u2019s highly acclaimed Sauvignon Blanc, which has consistently grabbed high marks from Wine Enthusiast Magazine. People ravenous for red wine can tip a glass of Work\u2019s Cabernet Reserve, a smooth flavor-swirl of deep, earthy hues and satin touches of liquorish. It\u2019s one Cab that doesn\u2019t have an over-the-top tannin bite.\n\nLakeside Beverage hosts wine tastings every Friday and Saturday evening, pouring selections not only from Work Vineyard, but from grape appellations across the Golden State. Sam samples wine varietals from more than 300 different vineyards every year. Of those, only a dozen end up getting showcased for customers at Lakeside Beverage. As Sam moves closer to having a decade of winemaking under his own belt, he says that in the rare cases when other vintners are trying to sell wines to him with a low-quality taste or nonsensical price point, the excuses just don\u2019t pass muster.\n\n\u201cEvery wine we sell at the store is good,\u201d Sam emphasized. \u201cCustomers come in and they tell us what they\u2019re looking for \u2013 what kind of meal they\u2019re pairing with, or dinner party they are hosting \u2013 and then they let us know their budget. We work with them on finding the right bottle from there, but we know that whether they are leaving with a $25 bottle or $200 bottle, they are going home with a wine selection they are going to like.\u201d\n\nScott Thomas Anderson can be reached at scotta@goldcountrymedia.com.
