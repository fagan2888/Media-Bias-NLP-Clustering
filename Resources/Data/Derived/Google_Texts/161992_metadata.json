The Senate Democrats seeking the crackdown were quick to say that the heavy hand of the tax agency should fall on \u201ceither side,\u201d but they pretty clearly are thinking about the conservative groups currently pummeling them for passing and preserving ObamaCare. And if the new rules sought by Obama Democrats were to work anything like the non-codified targeting that went on at the agency in the last two election cycles, liberal groups would have little to fear. Seventeen percent of the groups targeted for extra scrutiny may have been left-leaning, but when it came to actual audits, 100 percent of the targets were conservative. Despite that track record, the official line from Democrats remains that what happened at the IRS was neither corrupt nor politically motivated, but rather the result of unclear rules Team Obama is now in the process of rewriting. But what do you think?\n\nThey smell a rat - On Super Bowl Sunday, President Obama famously told Bill O\u2019Reilly that there was \u201cnot even a smidgen of corruption\u201d in the targeting. But a new Fox News poll found 64 percent of voters, including a bare majority of Democrats, thought the targeting was corrupt. Nine months after the scandal first went public, 71 percent still want Congress to continue investigating.\n\nOBAMACARE REMORSE: BAITED, SWITCHED AND UPSET\n\nA new Fox News poll finds 55 percent of voters wish ObamaCare had never passed. Fifty-one-percent of voters said the law would be bad for the country in the long run. Overall, 64 percent of voters believed the law wouldn\u2019t have passed in 2010 if Americans knew what they know today. Some 56 percent of respondents said the health law is more about the government \u201ccontrolling our lives\u201d than about \u201chelping individual Americans get the health care they want.\u201d\n\nMOODY\u2019S: OBAMACARE CHANGES WILL HIKE PRICES\n\nThe Hill: \u201cA leading credit rating agency is panning two proposed changes to ObamaCare\u2019s implementation as negative for health insurance companies. Moody\u2019s Investors Service said Thursday that requiring insures to expand their provider networks and allowing patients to keep non-compliant health plans for an additional two years could harm insurers and raise prices on the exchanges. The firm also characterized this week\u2019s second, partial delay of the employer mandate as frustrating and logistically complicated for the insurance industry.\u201d\n\nNo pay, no policy \u2013 Insurance industry officials tell Fox News that between 10 percent and 25 percent of ObamaCare enrollees have not paid their premiums, and thus, do not really have coverage. Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry has more.\n\nEndangered Dems dig for \u2018copper\u2019 plan - WSJ: \u201cSome backers of the 2010 health-care law are pushing to create a new kind of insurance coverage that the measure essentially had ruled out: policies offering lower premiums but significantly higher out-of-pocket costs than those now available. The plans, dubbed \u2018copper\u2019 because they would offer a lower level of coverage than the \u2018gold,\u2019 \u2018silver\u2019 and \u2018bronze\u2019 options on the government-run health-care exchanges, would be a departure from the minimum level of coverage that is one of\u2026 [ObamaCare\u2019s] core principles\u2026Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Warner of Virginia, both Democrats facing close re-election races this year, are sponsoring legislation that would allow people to buy copper plans on the exchanges. Moreover, insurance-industry officials have been talking up the idea with federal officials, though it is unclear whether the administration could make the change through regulations.\u201d\n\nHappy talk - President Obama will try to pep up House Democrats at their winter retreat today as his party faces a bleak election year in the lower chamber. While Obama has pledged to hold 18 more fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, his signature law and veering implementation of it have left the party grasping for ways to discuss the unwieldy scheme of regulations, entitlements, taxes and welfare. After the speech, Obama heads west for a golf weekend in California. \u2013 Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel is on the scene.\n\nTrolling for enrollments - First lady Michelle Obama used the White House email account for a mass message with a cryptic subject line worthy of a diet-pill vendor: \u201cI need you to see this:\u201d Inside was a plea for Americans to voluntarily comply with her husband\u2019s signature law before fines kick in.\n\nNever mind - Washington Examiner columnist David Freddoso looks back at the \u201cread the bill\u201d mania that surrounded the passage of ObamaCare. In hindsight, he argues, there was no reason for the furor: \u201cAt this point, it probably would not have mattered even if members of Congress had read Obamacare. It isn\u2019t actually a written law - it becomes the law whenever Obama decides, and with whatever changes he chooses.\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE MELTDOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS\n\nBoston Globe: \u201cJean Yang, the executive director of the Massachusetts [ObamaCare program], wept at a board meeting, where it was disclosed that 50,000 applications for health insurance are sitting in a pile, and have yet to be entered into a computer system. Each one of those applications requires two hours to process, adding to a mountain of work facing Connector staff as they scramble to prevent people from losing insurance, officials said. \u2018These people came here to lead and innovate, and instead they\u2019re doing manual workarounds, and they are embarrassed to tell friends and family that they work for the Health Connector,\u2019 Yang said at the board meeting.\u201d\n\n[\u201cThe people who need relief from the imposition of ObamaCare are the American families, and that\u2019s group that deserves to get some relief from this act and I think it has been very disappointing, and very revealing to see the president go through and make these changes...\u201d\u2014Former Gov. Mitt Romney, R-Mass., on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.]\n\nNot so golden in California - California\u2019s ObamaCare program is under fire for its myriad failings. Democratic Sen. Norma Torres introduced a bill aimed at fixing \u201cproblems experienced by consumers\u201d \u2013 lackluster customer service, a low Latino sign-up rate and inaccuracies in the provider directory, a news release stated. More.\n\n[NYT shares how ObamaCare\u2019s enrollment efforts among California\u2019s Hispanic population are falling flat.]\n\nAIDS patients in limbo in Louisiana - Reuters: \u201cThe only three insurance companies in Louisiana that sell healthcare policies under President Barack Obama's healthcare law throughout the state are rejecting payments from a federal program intended to help low-income HIV patients, advocacy groups said on Thursday.\u201d\n\nCRUZ: \u2018HELL WILL FREEZE OVER\u2019 BEFORE GOP LEADERS LISTEN\n\nBreitbart : \u201cSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told conservative radio host Mark Levin on Thursday evening that establishment GOP politicians will \u2018never\u2019 listen to the American people. \u2018If we wait on the entrenched politicians in Washington, hell will freeze over before that happens,\u201d Cruz answered when Levin asked whether Republicans will ever listen. \u2018This is nothing new. The answers come from America, from millions of people standing up and holding elected officials accountable\u2019\u2026 Cruz said earlier in the interview that many Republicans in the U.S. Congress wanted to increase the debt ceiling. \u2018Make no mistake about it,\u2019 Cruz said. \u2018This was their desired outcome. An awful lot of Republicans wanted exactly what Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid wanted, which is to raise the debt ceiling. But, they wanted to be able to tell what they view as their foolish gullible constituents that they didn\u2019t do it, and they\u2019re mad because by my refusing to consent to [a bare-majority vote] they had to come out in the open and admit to that.\u201d\u2019\n\n[\u201cForty-three of those Republican senators knew what had to be done\u2026 And we have two senators, let\u2019s face it, that are really, really upset that they weren\u2019t able to use this to raise a lot of money for their PACs and for their campaigns\u2026That\u2019s what this was all about. And everyone understood that. There was no game plan.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., to CNBC Thursday]\n\nSilent vote to hide debt hike supporters - AP: \u201cTypically, roll-call votes in the Senate play out in a very public manner. People watching from the galleries or tracking action from afar via C-SPAN can watch democracy unfold in all its messy wonder\u2026Each senator\u2019s vote is announced by the clerk; each time a senator switches sides, that\u2019s announced too. Onlookers can keep a running tally of how it's going. But not this time\u2026\u2018We are extremely concerned with the way the vote tally was handled yesterday on a pivotal debt-ceiling vote,\u2019 said Siobhan Hughes, chairwoman of the Standing Committee of Correspondents, which represents the interests of Capitol Hill\u2019s print media. \u2018When the vote tallies are not read aloud, it makes it harder for the media and therefore the public to get the information they need to hold lawmakers accountable.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nValentines may be fleeting, but 82-year-old Joann Seward of Pekin, Ill. has proof of one that stood the test of time. From the Pekin Times: \u201cJust before her mother died, Seward was given two Valentine\u2019s Day cards swapped between her maternal grandparents in 1895. Fittingly, her grandfather\u2019s name was Hope Love, and he even added a stroke of brilliance of his own by hunting down a card that began with \u201cLove\u2019s Offering.\u201d\u2026 Her grandmother, Lovina Love, responded to the first valentine with a heart-shaped one of her own. Based off the words at the end of the valentine \u2013 \u2018I\u2019d like, if anyone should ask you, your last name should be mine\u2019 \u2013 Seward deduced this valentine exchange doubled as a marriage proposal.\u2018I guess Grandpa had this notion in his head that he wanted to make sure Grandma stuck around for him.\u2019 Hope and Lovina wed two years later\u2026\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Gary Peters, according to a new poll by EPIC-MRA. \u2026 The poll of 600 likely voters, conducted Feb. 5 through Tuesday, shows Land of Byron Center leading Peters of Bloomfield Township 41%-38%. However, the numbers are within the poll\u2019s 4-percentage-point margin of error. Still, that\u2019s a turnaround from September, when Peters led Land 38%-37%.\u201d\n\nRUBIO RALLIES FOR COTTON\n\nSunshine State News: \u201cU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continues to go to bat for U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is running against U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., in one of the most competitive Senate races in the nation. Rubio sent out an email to supporters of his Reclaim America PAC on Thursday, urging supporters to back Cotton. \u2018It\u2019s official,\u2019 Rubio emailed supporters on Thursday. \u2018Democrats and their liberal interest group allies are going to spend whatever they can to try and stop Tom Cotton from being elected to the U.S. Senate. Right now, hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent on television ads attacking Tom.\u2019 Rubio insisted Cotton is \u201cthe kind of conservative we need in the U.S. Senate to help repeal and replace Obamacare and stand up to the big spenders in Washington.\u201d\n\nCOLLEAGUES COALESCE FOR SHANNON SENATE BID\n\nRepublican T.W. Shannon, who just stepped down as speaker of Oklahoma\u2019s House of Representatives to run for the U.S. Senate seat being left vacant by the retirement of Republican Tom Coburn, is getting the backing of several of his colleagues.

The event, hosted by Clinton supporter and bundler Michael Kempner, is slated for Feb. 27, according to an invitation obtained by Politico\u201d\n\nUNIONS SPEND BIG TO TRY TO SINK JOLLY\n\nWashington Free Beacon: \u201cIndependent expenditure filings with the Federal Election Commission show Patriot Majority USA spent more than $300,000 attacking Rep. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), who is running for Senate. House Majority PAC also disclosed more than $330,000 in independent expenditures attacking David Jolly, a Republican candidate in Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district\u2026House Majority also spent nearly $25,000 supporting Florida chief financial officer Alex Sink, Jolly\u2019s Democratic opponent. Patriot Majority and House Majority have received large contributions from labor unions, according to data on file with the Department of Labor. Patriot Majority USA and its sister organization Patriot Majority PAC have received $2.9 million from labor unions since 2012. House Majority PAC has received about $2.8 million from unions in that time.\u201d\n\n[The latest Tampa Bay Times/ Bay News 9/ WUSF poll finds Sink leads Jolly 42 percent to 35 percent]\n\nSink: less work under ObamaCare an \u2018exciting prospect\u2019 - The Tampa Bay Times reports: \u201cRepublicans across the country have seized on a recent Congressional Budget Office report that projects that the health care law will prompt many Americans to work fewer hours in order to qualify for a greater government subsidy of their health care. Sink, however, says the CBO report is actually good news that points to the \u2018exciting prospect\u2019 that Americans will have more choice and greater freedom in their lives.\u201d\n\nHASTINGS HEADS FOR RETIREMENT\n\nRep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., the head of the House Natural Resources Committee, announced he will not seek re-election.

Yet, so far in his second term, 53 percent of Mr. Obama\u2019s appointments have been political, according to the American Foreign Service Association. A third have been fundraisers for his campaigns. The bundlers are going not just to London, Brussels and Vienna, where their roles may be largely decorative, but also to countries where relations with the United States are troubled.\u201d\n\nCOURTS RULE ON SOCIAL ISSUES\n\nOne for the left - AP: \u201cA federal judge ruled Thursday that Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, making it the first state in the South to have its voter-approved prohibition overturned. U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen issued a stay of her order while it is appealed, meaning that gay couples in Virginia will still not be able to marry until the case is ultimately resolved.\u201d\n\nAnd one for the right - AP: \u201cA divided federal appeals court on Thursday struck down California's concealed weapons rules, saying they violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms. By a 2-1 vote, the three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said California was wrong to require applicants to show good cause to receive a permit to carry a concealed weapon.\u201d\n\n\n\nREAL GUN BEATS STUN GUN\n\nA 76-year-old South Carolina man was leaving his home early Sunday morning when a would-be robber approached him with a taser, pushing the homeowner down and trying to incapacitate him with the stun gun. The victim, whose identity police are protecting, told officers he was prepared for the moment because he had been robbed before. The older man was carrying a pistol and shot his attacker. From the man\u2019s call to 911, courtesy of WCSC: \u201cI shot about three times before I hit him because he had me on the ground trying to tase me. And I finally got one in him.\u201d The attacker, identified as a 25-year-old local man, was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cDemocrats are so scared. This is no abstract issue anymore. People are losing their insurance, they\u2019re losing their doctors, they\u2019re losing their hospitals, some of them are losing their jobs or losing hours as a result of [ObamaCare]. And it isn\u2019t as if people are waiting for another disaster on the Web site.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201dWatch here.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
