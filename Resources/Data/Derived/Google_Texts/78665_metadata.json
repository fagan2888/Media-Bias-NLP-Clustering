Since it appears the scalpel will be wielded for some time yet to come, how do gubernatorial candidates plan to stitch Louisiana\u2019s health care together?\n\n\u201dI would accept the Medicaid expansion, and I would do it very early in my administration,\u201d John Bel Edwards says, adding that it makes fiscal sense. \u201cThey\u2019re our tax dollars that are going to other states.\u201d\n\nDavid Vitter is more reserved about accepting the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI have not taken off the table \u2014 I\u2019ve been very clear about this \u2014 expanding coverage under the Medicaid program.\u201d But, Vitter says he would set conditions for doing so.\n\nJay Dardenne says he would set up a task force.\n\n\u201cUnder the current rules for the ACA, I would not take the federal dollars. But I will appoint a task force, charged with presenting to me a waiver proposal that we will submit to Washington to justify taking the money.\u201d\n\nScott Angelle isn\u2019t discounting the possibility of Medicaid expansion, either.\n\n\u201cI believe there are opportunities for us to create waivers to submit to the federal government.\u201d\n\nAnother complication is the privatization of the LSU Hospital System, which is not providing the cost savings initially promised. In fact, it appears to be needing an ever-increasing amount of the dwindling health care funding Louisiana has available.\n\n\u201cThe privatization scheme illegally used advance lease payments \u2013 a half billion dollars they\u2019re going to hold back out of future Medicaid payments,\u201d John Bel Edwards says.\n\nEdwards, a Democrat, fought the privatization plans when they were presented to the Legislature. Scott Angelle, a Republican and a former member of Governor Bobby Jindal\u2019s cabinet, defends the privatization.\n\n\u201cThese partnerships have restored in many cases and exceeded the level of services formerly provided by the state cash-strapped system,\u201d Angelle says.\n\nVitter believes the changes are beneficial.\n\n\u201cThe old Charity System\u2019s being transformed through public-private partnerships,\u201d Vitter says.\n\nBut Edwards also notes one of the partnerships is headed to court, for breach of contract.\n\n\u201cWe did it in a hurried fashion,\u201d Edwards says, \u201cResulted from dozens of blank pages in a contract approved by the LSU Board of Supervisors.\u201d\n\nDardenne says, at this point, the state has to make it work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re too far down the road to now stop and say we\u2019re going to redo this whole thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Health care funding bleeds the most when Louisiana\u2019s budget is in the red.
