If you were out hitting Black Friday deals, get ready for more discounts headed your way on Saturday.

Small Business Saturday is one way you can support local shops in town and it's one event they rely on for big business.

Stores in downtown Panama City are encouraging people to shop small this Saturday, and support our mom and pop shops in town.

"Small business Saturday was created to help and encourage people to shop in this small local businesses," said Christy's Closet owner Christy Carpenter.

Carpenter said days like Small Business Saturday bring in more business and new faces, some who've never even explored the shops in downtown.

"We have so many new businesses in cropping up with cute little stores and some neat little products and it's just a fun stroll on a pretty day to come downtown and pop in to all the different stores," said

"We hope to rebuild Panama City and get us back to the days that I remember that was so busy and everyone came to shop, you know it's not so commercialized we are small town," said RTA Designs Office Manager Emmie Wheat.

Store owners said shopping local is one way people find those one-of-a-kind items and hidden treasures.

For many shops, this time of year brings business they need to keep them going.

"We also are pretty much mom and pop stores usually and business and we don't have anybody backing us most of the time and I just think it's a good idea to shop local all the time if you can," said Estate Treasures owner Wanda Hicks.

Small business owners said another reason to shop local is the deals stores will have throughout the weekend.

"We have from 10% to 60% off on different things and different booths through our store and plus with the auction there's going to be some great deals in that, we've got all kinds of prices for all kinds of people," said Hicks.

RTA Designs is one shop who's giving back when you shop. They'll be hosting an auction tomorrow at 6 pm with 10% of sales going to charity.
