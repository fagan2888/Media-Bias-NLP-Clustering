Photo: MARK WILSON/GETTY IMAGES\n\nChris Jacobs is founder and CEO of Juniper Research Group, a policy consulting firm in Washington. He was an adviser to Bobby Jindal\u2018s presidential campaign. He is on Twitter: @chrisjacobshc.\n\nAs candidates in both parties focus on the general election campaign, some Republicans wonder if large premium increases related to the Affordable Care Act could be an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d that helps propel them to victory in November. The causes of the approaching premium increases vary, but some are rooted in a 2013 Obama administration proposal.\n\nIn reporting on premium increases by one Iowa insurer, the Des Moines Register noted that individuals who bought new plans that complied with Affordable Care Act regulations could face premium increases of 38% to 43% next year. \u201cAnother 90,000 Wellmark customers who hold older individual insurance plans are expected to face smaller increases, which will be announced in June,\u201d the paper said.\n\nThe disparity stems from a policy proposal in late 2013, when HealthCare.gov was not functioning, millions had received insurance cancellation notices, and President Barack Obama was being heavily criticized for pledging, \u201cIf you like your health-care plan you can keep it.\u201d The administration allowed states to extend existing plans for one year.\n\nSome states chose not to take this option. Those that implemented it did so for varying lengths of time. After extending the policy twice, the administration said this year that these temporary extensions would expire by the end of 2017.\n\nStates that implemented extensions created an actuarial problem for their health-care exchanges, the market where individuals not insured through their employer can buy their own plans. Enrollees seeking the enhanced benefits provided by Obamacare-compliant plans were the most likely to use them, while many people with little need for additional benefits preferred the status quo. In Iowa the problem is particularly acute: 90,000 residents have pre-Obamacare coverage, significantly more than the 55,000 who had signed up on the exchange as of February. By keeping these people, who tend to be healthier than those with ACA plans, out of the exchanges, the \u201cfix\u201d created another problem, laying the groundwork for the larger premium increases for next year.\n\nThe issue is more pronounced in Iowa, but other states are affected. This isn\u2019t the only component of Obamacare that could exacerbate premium spikes. One popular feature is that parents can cover their children up to age 26. At the same time, however, this policy point discourages those young people from buying a plan of their own. Enrollment among these \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d remains well below expectations three years into the exchanges. Data from 2014 had suggested that those young people enrolling in plans were incurring high medical costs\u2014which could also contribute to a trend of premium spikes.\n\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Political solutions from years past may materialize in the form of rate hikes this fall\u2013and could generate a distinct reaction among voters on Election Day.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Chris Jacobs: The causes of the approaching increases in health-insurance premiums vary, but some are rooted in a 2013 Obama administration proposal.", "title": "Will Health Insurance Premium Increases Related to Obamacare Sway Voters?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/22/will-health-insurance-premium-increases-related-to-obamacare-sway-voters/", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AT794_PW_P_20150625180050.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Will Health Insurance Premium Increases Related to Obamacare Sway Voters?", "description": "Chris Jacobs: The causes of the approaching increases in health-insurance premiums vary, but some are rooted in a 2013 Obama administration proposal.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Chris Jacobs", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Chris Jacobs: The causes of the approaching increases in health-insurance premiums vary, but some are rooted in a 2013 Obama administration proposal.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-05-22T14:01:45-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/22/will-health-insurance-premium-increases-related-to-obamacare-sway-voters/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-63358", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Chris Jacobs: The causes of the approaching increases in health-insurance premiums vary, but some are rooted in a 2013 Obama administration proposal.", "title": "Will Health Insurance Premium Increases Related to Obamacare Sway Voters?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/22/will-health-insurance-premium-increases-related-to-obamacare-sway-voters/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AT794_PW_P_20150625180050.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-63358", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-05-22T14:07:05-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18e4\"", "article_summary": "The causes of the approaching premium increases vary, but some are rooted in a 2013 Obama administration proposal.\nIn reporting on premium increases by one Iowa insurer, the Des Moines Register noted that individuals who bought new plans that complied with Affordable Care Act regulations could face premium increases of 38% to 43% next year.\nAs candidates in both parties focus on the general election campaign, some Republicans wonder if large premium increases related to the Affordable Care Act could be an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d that helps propel them to victory in November.\n\u201cAnother 90,000 Wellmark customers who hold older individual insurance plans are expected to face smaller increases, which will be announced in June,\u201d the paper said.\nAfter extending the policy twice, the administration said this year that these temporary extensions would expire by the end of 2017."}
