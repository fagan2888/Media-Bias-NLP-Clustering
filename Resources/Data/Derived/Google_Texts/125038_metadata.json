Sure, he\u2019s a walking conspiracy generator who\u2019s been wrong nearly every time he parts his lips: wrong about Obama\u2019s SS-like \u201ccivilian national security force,\u201d wrong about Obama\u2019s FEMA camps, wrong about Obama using the postal service as an evil spy network, wrong about the Boston Marathon attack being a Saudi affair, and the seemingly countless breathlessly alarmist warnings over the years. But, hey, even a broken doomsday clock is right once an apocalypse, and Beck\u2019s really done his homework on this one, a study of how Islam is going to destroy us all: \u201cIt IS About Islam: Exposing the Truth About ISIS, Al Qaeda, Iran, and the Caliphate.\u201d\n\nBeck chooses to end the nearly 300-page book with a three-word paragraph that serves as a tidy tl;dr to reveal his position once you\u2019ve already made the mistake of reading the whole thing. \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d concludes the book, as if the Christian nationalism throughout needed a final splash of racism. In a nice symmetry, the final white reactionary note recalls the scene on which the book opens: Thomas Jefferson prophetically consulting the Quran before he became \u201cthe first American president to go to war with Islamic radicals\u201d in the 1801 war with the North African Barbary states, essentially the United States\u2019 first foreign war.\n\nBeck shocks his readers with a revelation by the Barbary ambassador in 1786 to Jefferson and his eventual presidential predecessor, John Adams: the Islamic Barbary armies used Quranic scripture to permit the enslavement of a portion of enemies captured in battle. Africans enslaving Americans?! But that\u2019s the wrong way around! And relying on pro-slavery scripture that isn\u2019t the Bible? Beck, so eager to construct a narrative in which the Islamic hordes have always pounded the innocent American gates, casually overlooks the horror of the transatlantic slave trade, of which Jefferson was no small beneficiary, and the Biblical means of its defense. Instead, it\u2019s the North Africans who are presented as Quranic savages, while the far, far worse Christian savagery in America was at that very moment unleashing two world-historical horrors: genocide and the slave trade, both reliant on the era\u2019s white Christianist worldview. (Which isn\u2019t to say that Christianity is to be blamed for the twin horrors, any more than 9/11 and ISIS\u2019s crimes can be pinned on Islam, or Stalin\u2019s mass murder can be blamed on atheism. Tyrants and terrorists will use whatever is available in the cultural milieu to justify and buttress their actions.)\n\nThe pages in between those white Christian nationalist bookends present a sprawling mess of contradictions, not unlike a religious text itself, full of intense feeling and certitude but never quite explaining everything in any sort of way that satisfies reason. Beck emphasizes the title\u2019s verb: It is about Islam, not its errant practitioners, its misinterpretations or its crass use in the service of national power. No, Islam as a religion is the problem, asserts the book\u2019s cover. But the pages inside find Beck hedging against that blanket condemnation of 1.3 billion believers with qualifications, which he turns right around and negates with more absolutist indictments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a crucial distinction to be made between Islam and Islamism,\u201d he writes in the introduction. So it\u2019s about Islamism, not Islam? No, he returns to wholesale condemnation just two pages later: \u201cIn America we like to believe that all religions are equal. But that\u2019s not the truth.\u201d OK, it\u2019s about the whole religion again. This dance continues throughout the book, with Beck trying to exculpate some Muslims before returning them all to his critical crosshairs. The same vacillation between careful, measured statements and wholesale judgment of the religion finds Beck carefully delineating sectarian divides only to smear the lines into nothing when he returns to his thesis, it\u2019s all of Islam. He briefly touches on Iran\u2019s enmity with ISIS, the clear sectarian antipathy and both groups\u2019 designs on expanding their regional reach, only to fuse them together into the monster he really wants to describe: \u201cThe Islamic State and Iran are forcing the Islamic world into two camps, opposed to each other by virtue of a 1,300-year-old split but united in their embrace of radical Islamism and totalitarian, apocalyptic ideology.\u201d\n\nSo while it may be refreshing to hear a conservative correctly assign sectarian membership to the region\u2019s various nations, leaderships and non-state actors, the patina of scholarship and carefulness are, in the end, only window dressing on his project to make all of Islam into a bogeyman possessed only by a desire to destroy America, annihilate Israel and abolish human freedom. \u201cLet me say it again: It is about Islam,\u201d he writes to begin a series of 13 \u201clies\u201d about Islam (e.g., \u201cIslam is a religion of peace\u201d) that he \u201cdebunks.\u201d It is about Islam \u2014 not Sunnis or Shias or Wahhabis or moderates or imams or ayatollahs or rank-and-file believers. It is about Islam, the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right-wing media giant released his latest book last month.
