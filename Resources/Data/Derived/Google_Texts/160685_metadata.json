It pulled in profit of $175.6 million, even after excluding $22 million in gains from entities in which IU Health has a noncontrolling investment stake.\n\n\n\nThat was nearly four times as much profit as IU Health recorded in the third quarter a year ago, when it tallied $44.3 million in profit, excluding certain special items that were not repeated this year.\n\n\n\nIU Health\u2019s bottom line benefited greatly from smaller personnel costs. As of Sept. 30, it employed roughly 2,000 fewer full-time-equivalent employees than it did a year ago. About 80 percent of those staff reductions have occurred at IU Health\u2019s downtown campuses\u2014Methodist, University and Riley Hospital for Children.\n\n\n\nRevenue from operations totaled $1.41 billion in the quarter, a 13.6-percent rise from the same quarter last year.\n\n\n\nIU Health\u2019s management credited its improved performance to increased physician office visits, better collection of patient accounts, and a shift of self-pay patients to government-funded programs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Key parts of Indiana University Health\u2019s business bounced back in the third quarter, helping the hospital system boost its revenue and profit.
