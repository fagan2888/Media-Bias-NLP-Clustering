Here are the five mistakes she says employers make most:\n\n\u201cOne of the most common misperceptions employers have is that statutory entitlements are the extent of their obligations owed to a dismissed employee,\u201d reveals Crawford.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that unless the employee signed an employment agreement when they started employment that clearly limited their entitlement at the point of termination to the statutory minimums, employees are entitled to common law reasonable notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith few exceptions, the common law reasonable notice period will include continuation of group benefits, pension contributions, car allowances, bonuses and profit sharing,\u201d asserts Crawford.\n\n\u201cThese obligations can significantly increase the costs of the dismissal and are often overlooked by employers when assessing the pros and cons of letting someone go,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile it might sound unlikely, Crawford reminds employers that terminating a worker\u2019s benefits could have huge legal implications should that employee die or become permanently disabled during the notice period.\n\n\u201cEmployers who fail to continue group benefits essentially step into the role of insurer if entitlement to benefits is triggered during the notice period,\u201d she explains.\n\nNo matter how certain you are that you\u2019ve made the right decision, taking the position that legal cause exists to fire an employee is risky.\n\nThe employee will be severely affected by your decision \u2013 typically, they\u2019ll lose employment insurance benefits, could have a harder time finding reemployment and may face financial challenged since because they didn\u2019t get a severance package.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, courts will often come down hard on employers who take a cause position that cannot be defended at trial or before an adjudicator,\u201d says Crawford \u2013 damages for mental distress and punitive damages will likely be awarded courts are often more generous with the notice period assessment.\n\nEmployers enter dangerous territory when terminating a worker on protected leave and, according to Crawford, should consider all other alternatives.\n\n\u201cCourts and tribunals will scrutinize these dismissals to ensure that no part of the decision to dismiss was based on the fact that the employee took the leave,\u201d she explains \u2013 employers could even be forced to reinstate the employee with full back pay.\n\nMany employers may think they\u2019re protected if they pay out a severance package which exceeds an employee's statutory entitlements but it\u2019s simply not true, says Crawford.\n\n\u201cAlways get a full and final release from the employee,\u201d she advises. That way, the employee cannot come back at a later date seeking additional compensation for the loss of group insurance coverage, pension contributions or other fringe benefits.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive release can even protect an employer from allegations of discrimination and/or harassment being made at a later date,\u201d she adds.\n\nRead Crawford\u2019s full article\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/employee-dismissals-and-big-money-mistakes-5-things-to-remember-23144.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/f111r3d.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "One labor lawyer says employers often overlook the financial repercussions of firing an employee \u2013 here\u2019s what to remember.", "title": "Employee dismissals and big money mistakes: 5 things to remember"}, "twitter": {"description": "One labor lawyer says employers often overlook the financial repercussions of firing an employee \u2013 here\u2019s what to remember.", "title": "Employee dismissals and big money mistakes: 5 things to remember", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/employee-dismissals-and-big-money-mistakes-5-things-to-remember-23144.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/f111r3d.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "One labor lawyer says employers often overlook the financial repercussions of firing an employee \u2013 here\u2019s what to remember."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe135f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEmployers who fail to continue group benefits essentially step into the role of insurer if entitlement to benefits is triggered during the notice period,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cAll too often employers dismiss employees without fully appreciating the obligations and liabilities associated with their decision,\u201d says Susan Crawford, of.\nHere are the five mistakes she says employers make most:\u201cOne of the most common misperceptions employers have is that statutory entitlements are the extent of their obligations owed to a dismissed employee,\u201d reveals Crawford.\nWhile it might sound unlikely, Crawford reminds employers that terminating a worker\u2019s benefits could have huge legal implications should that employee die or become permanently disabled during the notice period.\nThe decision to dismiss an employee is rarely made in haste but \u2013 according to one labor lawyer \u2013 employers often overlook some of the important financial aspects."}
