That clearly hasn\u2019t happened with the CBO now predicting even more debt \u2013 an additional $9.4 trillion in the next decade alone,\u201d said Paul Winfree, director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, said in a statement. \u201c\u2019Blueprint for Balance\u2019 defines a clear path toward greater fiscal responsibility. Our plan would cut the FY17 deficit by over $400 billion and bring the budget into balance by 2023. It does this by driving down spending, without raising taxes or weakening our national defense.\u201d\n\nThe plan includes major reforms to the welfare system and entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Heritage said by raising the age of eligibility for Social Security and transitioning payments to \u201ca flat, anti-poverty benefit\u201d for those who need in most, in addition to adjusting cost of living using a chained consumer price index would save $500 billion by 2026.\n\n\u201cA federal budget should reflect the principles of the American people. Those principles include a commitment to economic freedom, religious liberty, equal treatment under law, federalism and a strong national defense. Our \u2018Blueprint for Balance\u2019 not only embraces those principles and values, but champions them,\u201d Winfree said. \u201cCongress should follow through on their promises to the American people and act on the bold reforms we have outlined. Ensuring once again that our economy will offer opportunity for all and favoritism to none.\u201d\n\nThe House Budget Committee said it will release their budget, which is slated to include several options for mandatory savings, in March.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has made restoring regular order to the budget process a priority, and has called on Congress to pass a budget at the spending levels agreed upon by former House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama last October to avoid another omnibus spending bill.\n\nConservative lawmakers have voiced their discontent with the increased spending levels in the bill passed last fall, calling for steeper spending cuts to avoid increasing the deficit.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
