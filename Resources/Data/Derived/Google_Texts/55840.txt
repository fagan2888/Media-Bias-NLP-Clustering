It’s not news that California’s economy is big. There are lots of people and businesses there.

But guess what…it’s actually really, really big. So big that its gross domestic product eclipses even Texas’s, the No. 2 state economy in the U.S., according to government data released Wednesday.

The Golden State’s real gross domestic product hit an annual rate of about $2.1 trillion at the end of 2013, up almost 50% from Texas’s $1.4 trillion economic girth, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.

The economy in California is so big that it’s 75 times the size of Vermont’s, the smallest state GDP in the U.S.

Here are the top five biggest state economies, ranked by annualized real GDP in the fourth quarter (in 2009 dollars):

California, $2.1 trillion

Texas, $1.4 trillion

New York, $1.2 trillion

Florida, $760 billion

Illinois, $676 billion

Here are the five smallest state economies:

Rhode Island, $50 billion

South Dakota, $41 billion

Wyoming, $41 billion

Montana, $40 billion

Vermont, $28 billion
