Corbett knows working Pennsylvanians won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him off the hook on this. He knows he must act, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re glad to see him taking the first steps.\n\nBy Antoinette Kraus\n\nSince June 2012, Gov. Tom Corbett has had a choice: use federal funding allocated to Pennsylvania in the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid and bring quality, affordable health care to 613,000 low-income people, or turn that funding down and leave those folks shut out, uninsured, with nowhere to turn.\n\nFor more than a year, the governor has heard how Pennsylvanians feel about this choice. He\u2019s heard from hospitals that need relief from the growing burden of providing \u201cuncompensated care\u201d to people who are uninsured, very sick, and unable to pay for the care they need.\n\nThe governor has heard from doctors and nurses who want their patients to have access to preventive care, checkups, and affordable prescriptions, so they don\u2019t wind up in the emergency room with undiagnosed cancer or uncontrolled diabetes.\n\nThe governor has heard from advocates for people with disabilities, children, and seniors who understand how hard it is for families to qualify for Medicaid today. He has heard stories of the toll it takes on a family when a loved one\u2019s mental illness goes untreated, or when a child misses checkups because a parent is uninsured and overwhelmed by medical bills.\n\nThe governor has heard from home health care aides, cashiers, childcare workers, and waitresses -- people who work on their feet day in and day out at jobs that don\u2019t come with health insurance. More than 75 percent of the Pennsylvanians who would qualify for coverage under Medicaid expansion have at least one full-time worker at home, and most are working themselves.\n\nAnd the governor has heard from voters, of all political stripes, who understand that it\u2019s time to put practicality before partisanship and action above ideology. A majority of Pennsylvanians support expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, recognizing that it makes sense to put our federal tax dollars to work meeting a huge need in our state.\n\nPennsylvania will receive $43 billion in federal funding to expand Medicaid -- dollars that will boost our state\u2019s economy over the next decade.\n\nThree different economic impact studies paint a positive economic picture for Pennsylvania, finding that Medicaid expansion will create over 35,000 good-paying jobs across the state, generate over $3 billion in new economic activity each year, and save taxpayers\u2019 money -- over $430 million annually over the next decade, according to Pennsylvania\u2019s Independent Fiscal Office.\n\nGov. Corbett knows working Pennsylvanians won\u2019t let him off the hook on this. He knows he must act, and we\u2019re glad to see him begin taking the first steps toward expanding health coverage. It\u2019s not clear, however, from the outlines of the Governor\u2019s plan that these first steps are leading Pennsylvania in the right direction.\n\nThe governor has proposed using Medicaid expansion funds to help Pennsylvanians earning below 138 percent of the poverty level buy private health insurance through the new Health Insurance Marketplace, which opens October 1. Two of the 25 states that have opted to expand coverage have gone this route, garnering approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which needs to sign off on a state\u2019s expansion plans.\n\nWhat\u2019s troubling about Gov. Corbett\u2019s \u201cHealthy PA\u201d plan are the changes he\u2019s looking to make to Pennsylvania\u2019s current Medicaid program, which covers children, people with disabilities, seniors, and a tiny group of working-age adults with very low incomes and other challenges.\n\nThe governor will ask many of these individuals to pay more through new monthly premiums and to jump through hoops to stay covered.\n\nGov. Corbett also proposes cutting benefits to some current Medicaid enrollees, claiming the program is too costly because benefits are too generous. The truth is Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid program has a larger share of seniors and people with disabilities, who are more costly to cover, than the national average. Cutting benefits will not change this.\n\nMedicaid also picks up the majority of long-term care costs for seniors, and Pennsylvania trails other states in the share of long-term care dollars going to less costly home and community based services. Moving more seniors toward that type of care would save Pennsylvania money.\n\nNearly three-quarters of every dollar Pennsylvania spends on Medicaid today goes to care for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicaid is providing critical services to the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians, and the governor should not use the opportunity to expand coverage for some to restrict coverage for others.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act intended for every state to expand Medicaid on January 1, 2014 to anyone earning below 138 percent of the poverty level (about $15,600 for an individual or $31,809. for a family of three). The law provides tax credits and financial protections to people earning above the poverty level, expecting that those earning less would be covered by Medicaid.\n\nThere are about 400,000 hardworking Pennsylvanians in this gap who will be left uninsured if the governor fails to act. Full federal funding is there to cover them in 2014, and that\u2019s when we need to start.\n\nHealthy PA or harmful delay? That\u2019s up to Gov. Corbett. We look forward to working with his administration, lawmakers, and our partners to expand coverage in the right way, without delay.\n\nAntoinette Kraus is the director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network.
