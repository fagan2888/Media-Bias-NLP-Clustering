President George W. Bush signed the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act five months later and USASpending.gov was born in 2007.\n\nWhile co-sponsor Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican, pushed for greater financial transparency until retiring in December 2014, many say the other co-sponsor, now President Obama, ran out of steam.\n\nUSASpending could not account for $600 billion in grants and awards, when last checked by federal auditors. The White House Office of Management and Budget balked at a legislative proposal to establish a new watchdog agency that would ensure agencies deliver all spending data in searchable formats.\n\nWhether due to disorganization or fear of disgrace, agencies to this day have not released financial information on the Web in formats that machines and people can understand, observers say.\n\nAt a time when the government is doling out $3.8 trillion annually, taxpayers are questioning where all that cash is going.\n\nObama once was\u2014and maybe still is\u2014one of them.\n\nScreeching to a halt?\n\nHe ran for president with a message: \u201cEvery American has the right to know how the government spends their tax dollars, but for too long that information has been largely hidden from public view.\u201d\n\nOnce elected, Obama\u2019s administration stood up the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to keep tabs on $840 billion in economic stimulus money intended for shovel-ready projects.\n\nBoard Chairman Earl Devaney and anti-pork Republicans saw to it that Recovery.gov did just that. When the board wound down in September, estimates pegged the amount of money recouped, forfeited or saved at $157 million.\n\nIn December 2011, Devaney retired after recommending that Obama extend the money-tracking technique to all government awards. \u201cHere\u2019s where things come to a screeching halt,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sad to say, I don\u2019t see much progress since the day I left.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the full story, \u201cEvery American Has the Right to Know...\u201d from the November-December issue of Government Executive magazine.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Aliya Sternstein", "description": "At a time when the government is doling out $3.8 trillion annually, taxpayers are still questioning where all that cash is going.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "At a time when the government is doling out $3.8 trillion annually, taxpayers are still questioning where all that cash is going.", "title": "Has the Obama Administration\u2019s Push on Transparency Run Out of Steam?", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2015/12/has-obama-administrations-push-transparency-run-out-steam/124751/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/24/122415ObamaNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/24/122415ObamaNG/open-graph.jpg", "description": "At a time when the government is doling out $3.8 trillion annually, taxpayers are still questioning where all that cash is going.", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Has the Obama Administration\u2019s Push on Transparency Run Out of Steam?"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-24T13:13:34Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/24/122415ObamaNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Has the Obama Administration\u2019s Push on Transparency Run Out of Steam?", "keywords": "data act, open government, transparency, usaspending.gov, recovery.gov, data transparency", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/12/24/122415ObamaNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "data-act,open-government,transparency,data-transparency,channel-nextgov->-cio-briefing,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "At a time when the government is doling out $3.8 trillion annually, taxpayers are still questioning where all that cash is going."}, "article_summary": "While co-sponsor Sen.
