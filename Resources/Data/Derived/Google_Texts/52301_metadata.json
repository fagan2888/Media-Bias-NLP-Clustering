Hodson acknowledged he is just \u201ca way station\u201d for the case as it likely heads to the Oregon Supreme Court over the legality of the Oregon Tort Claims Act limits for OHSU and other public bodies.\n\nHodson\u2019s decision came immediately after opposing lawyers offered arguments that examined past Oregon Supreme Court decisions.\n\nMany of the arguments focused on what legal claims people could have pursued before the adoption of the Oregon Constitution in 1857. The Oregon Supreme Court has long leaned on what was recognized under common law -- legal precedent when the state Constitution was established -- in determining the Legislature's latitude to cap damages or modify claims.\n\nOHSU lawyers argued that common law would not have allowed the negligence claim against Harrison, the surgeon, because government employees and officials were granted immunity for \u201cdiscretionary acts,\u201d including actions that \u201crequire any exercise of judgment.\u201d\n\nMaureen Leonard, arguing for the Hortons, disputed the idea that Harrison\u2019s admitted negligence \u2013 cutting vessels to the wrong side of the liver \u2013 could be considered a discretionary act. Discretion, she said, suggests doctors were analyzing the situation and weighing choices in light of a desired outcome.\n\nThat did not square with OHSU\u2019s admission in court documents that \u201cvessels were inadvertently transected,\u201d she said.\n\nHodson agreed, saying, \u201cHe did not exercise discretion. He cut the wrong vessel inadvertently.\u201d\n\nOHSU also argued the award should be reduced because it included money for Horton\u2019s future medical needs, which, attorney Roy Pulvers contended, would be covered under the Affordable Care Act. Pulvers brushed aside the family\u2019s concerns over potential changes and uncertainties, saying \u201cthe fact is the law is the law.\u201d\n\nBut Hodson turned aside OHSU\u2019s arguments to reduce the award, finding that such a steep discount from the $12 million would fall short of the constitutional clause that entitles plaintiffs to a remedy for injuries suffered personally, to their property or to their reputation.\n\nDavid Miller, an attorney for the Hortons, questioned why OHSU continues to fight the verdict, noting that the hospital\u2019s $35 million malpractice insurance policy \u201cis there to cover exactly this kind of occurrence.\u201d\n\nOHSU has paid the $3 million to the Hortons, but the family still faces another $2.6 million in bills to Stanford University\u2019s Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital for the transplant, Miller said. The money also will not cover the lifetime of medication, monitoring and the potential transplant he may need in the future, Miller said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, OHSU said, \"We deeply regret that a surgical error caused them harm.\" The hospital said it anticipates the case will go directly to the Oregon Supreme Court, and the hospital will await its decision.\n\nThe hospital reiterated an earlier statement that the Legislature chose the $3 million cap as \"an appropriate balance between the need for public institutions like OHSU and its practitioners to provide public services within the confines of limited budgets, while at the same time, ensuring that those who seek to obtain damages are treated fairly.\"\n\n-- Helen Jung\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "multnomah county courts, ohsu, oregon supreme court, news", "title": "OHSU lawsuit: Judge retains jury's $12 million verdict, despite hospital's push to reduce award", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"OHSU lawsuit: Judge retains jury\\u0027s $12 million verdict, despite hospital\\u0027s push to reduce award\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/11/ohsu_lawsuit_judge_retains_jur.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/portland_impact/photo/hortonsjpg-1bb9e80b5746b62f.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11699002\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-23T01:09:39Z\", \"author\": \"Helen Jung | hjung@oregonian.com\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@health\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@sw-portland\",\"multnomah county courts\",\"ohsu\",\"oregon supreme court\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/portland_impact/photo/hortonsjpg-1bb9e80b5746b62f.jpg", "creator": "@helenjung", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary", "description": "A Multnomah County Circuit judge entered a judgment for the full $12 million verdict, but it is likely to be reviewed by the Oregon Supreme Court."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, November 22, 2013,  5:09 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/portland_impact/photo/hortonsjpg-1bb9e80b5746b62f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"hjung\", \"author_nickname\": \"Helen Jung | hjung@oregonian.com\", \"author_id\": \"388\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Portland News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "A Multnomah County Circuit judge entered a judgment for the full $12 million verdict, but it is likely to be reviewed by the Oregon Supreme Court.", "title": "OHSU lawsuit: Judge retains jury's $12 million verdict, despite hospital's push to reduce award", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/11/ohsu_lawsuit_judge_retains_jur.html", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/portland_impact/photo/hortonsjpg-1bb9e80b5746b62f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, November 22, 2013,  5:09 PM", "article_author": "Helen Jung | hjung@oregonian.com", "Description": "A Multnomah County Circuit judge entered a judgment for the full $12 million verdict, but it is likely to be reviewed by the Oregon Supreme Court."}, "article_summary": "Hodson\u2019s decision came immediately after opposing lawyers offered arguments that examined past Oregon Supreme Court decisions.\nThe hospital said it anticipates the case will go directly to the Oregon Supreme Court, and the hospital will await its decision.\nA jury\u2019s $12 million verdict in favor of a boy severely injured by OHSU surgeons should stand despite the hospital's arguments to reduce the award to a $3 million liability cap established by state law, a Multnomah County Circuit judge ruled Friday.\nHodson acknowledged he is just \u201ca way station\u201d for the case as it likely heads to the Oregon Supreme Court over the legality of the Oregon Tort Claims Act limits for OHSU and other public bodies.\nThe Oregon Supreme Court has long leaned on what was recognized under common law -- legal precedent when the state Constitution was established -- in determining the Legislature's latitude to cap damages or modify claims."}
