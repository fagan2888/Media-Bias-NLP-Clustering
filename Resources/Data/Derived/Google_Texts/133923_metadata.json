On the Pill, almost 1 in 10 women gets pregnant each year, and for couples relying on condoms that number is 1 in 6! That may be better than the rhythm method or an abstinence commitment or no protection at all (annual pregnancy rate over 8 in 10), but it\u2019s still a big deal for couples who would rather avoid an abortion or another baby.\n\nBy contrast, state-of-the-art IUD\u2019s and contraceptive implants drop the annual pregnancy rate below 1 in 500. The key is this: Every-day and every-time methods have a big human error factor. The ordinary challenges of daily life\u2014things like forgetting, fights, finances and fumbling\u2014make it virtually impossible for couples to use Pills, condoms or intermittent abstinence with perfect consistency; and the more chaotic a person\u2019s life, the more likely he or she will end up facing a surprise pregnancy. Long acting contraceptives eliminate these factors, which means they work equally well for empowered women whose lives are secure and predictable, and for disempowered women whose lives are not.\n\nThree kinds of long acting contraceptives (hormone-free copper IUD\u2019s, hormonal IUD\u2019s, and implants) effectively flip the fertility switch to off until a woman wants it on, making pregnancy \u201copt in\u201d rather than \u201copt out.\u201d Depending on the method, they can last from 3 to 10+ years; but in each case a quick, easy removal restores normal fertility at any point. Bonus health benefits can include protection against some cancers and lighter less frequent periods.\n\nDespite these advantages, only 7.2 percent of women used a long acting contraceptive in the U.S. in the years from 2011-2013. IUD\u2019s and implants are rapidly gaining popularity thanks in part to Obamacare, which eliminates high upfront cost as a barrier. But for historical reasons, lack of knowledge remains an obstacle.\n\nOld History, Bad Information\n\nIn the 1970\u2019s, a defective IUD traumatized women and providers alike. Afterwards, fears and litigation drove long-acting birth control out of the U.S. market, putting North America decades behind Europe in solving unplanned pregnancy. In the intervening decades contraceptive technologies advanced, and today modern IUD\u2019s are the healthiest method available for most women, which has made them popular around the world.\n\nEven so, many American doctors and nurses still lead family planning conversations with familiar Pills and shots rather top tier long acting methods. In fact, research in the U.S. and Canada shows a dismaying level of misinformation about IUD\u2019s and implants among doctors. Lack of knowledge among providers creates lack of knowledge among members of the general public. In a 2013 survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, most young people between the ages of 18 and 29 said they had never heard of the implant.\n\nWhen women have full information about contraceptive options, things change. Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis provided comprehensive information and then offered 9000 women and youth the birth control of their choice for free. Three quarters chose a state-of-the-art IUD or implant, and the rate of teen pregnancy and abortion plummeted.\n\nHow can we ensure that the same excellent options become available to all women? The obstacles are legion: Receptionists sometimes offer outdated information, schedules are optimized for old ways of doing business, counselors omit key questions, providers tilt toward old familiar shots and Pills, billing offices use the wrong codes, and managers fret about losing money. . . . in sum, a host of factors make it easier for clinics to keep offering the same old same old.\n\nHalf-day Training Cuts Unplanned Pregnancy in Half\n\nBetween 2011 and 2013, Planned Parenthood and the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), conducted a study aimed at testing whether medical practices can be updated via an intensive training that engages the whole clinic staff. Forty Planned Parenthood affiliate clinics participated in the study. In 20, the entire staff, from receptionists to counselors to doctors, received a half-day training on how to provide excellent access to IUD\u2019s and implants. The primary focus was on ensuring that women get full information about all available birth control methods and that they can get the method of their choice in the same visit. The other 20 clinics continued business as usual.\n\nDramatic differences emerged during the following year. In the 20 clinics that received the training, 71 percent of providers discussed IUD\u2019s and implants with their patients, while only 39 percent did in the control group. Women responded to additional information by choosing IUD\u2019s and implants at a higher rate\u201428 percent in the clinics that received the intervention vs. 17 percent in the control group. In both settings 99 percent of women felt that the decision was theirs, meaning that providers maintained respect for patient autonomy and choices. Over the course of the following year, the rate of pregnancy among patients seeking contraception in the intervention clinics was half what it was in the control clinics.\n\nExpanding Training Expands Access\n\nAs America\u2019s largest and best known provider of family planning services, Planned Parenthood Federation of America participates in more than 70 research projects each year, often in collaboration with universities and pharmaceutical companies, with the goal of continuously updating and upgrading clinic practices. But independent clinics and systems that provide care for underserved populations sometimes find it more challenging to retool when new practices and technologies become available.\n\nA nonprofit, Upstream USA, launched in 2014 to provide expanded on-site training and technical assistance so that many health centers across the country can offer their patients the full range of contraceptive methods including implants and IUDs. Their goal, says co-founder Peter Belden, is to ensure that a woman can receive any family planning method she wants on the day she walks into the clinic. Belden\u2019s co-founder Mark Edwards has spent the last 20 years single mindedly focused on improving opportunity for disadvantaged youth, so some colleagues were surprised when he turned his focus to contraceptive training. But Edwards says he hasn\u2019t actually changed focus:\n\nHelping young women achieve their own goals and become pregnant only when they want to is central to improving high school graduation rates (82% of pregnancies to teens are unintended). A Gates Foundation survey found that 47 percent of girls who dropped out of high school listed pregnancy as a reason. Unintended pregnancy is a significant issue affecting community college completion. The intervention in the UCSF study cut the pregnancy rate in half. There are very few interventions in the field of economic opportunity and education that have this level of evidence behind them.\n\nDuring Upstream\u2019s one and a half day training, a swat team of consultants works with the clinic staff to upgrade every part of their service. Receptionists learn, for example, that IUD\u2019s and implants are safe for young women, those with multiple sexual partners, and even those who are HIV positive. The billing office learns which procedure codes to use to obtain reimbursement from insurance companies. Clinic managers review logistics and revenue flow. Counselors learn new client-centered techniques for exploring a woman\u2019s goals and objectives; and they learn how to coach women through the \u201cadjustment phase\u201d as a woman\u2019s body adapts to her chosen method. Providers learn from certified trainers so that they can place IUDs or implants in accordance with national guidelines; and practicing with computerized pelvic simulators makes this hands on part of the training more effective and saves time.\n\nThe training model draws on evidence-based \u201cbest practices\u201d from across the country:\n\n\u25aa Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health\u2019s \u201cOne Key Question\u201d integrates family planning into routine medical care and medical records by prompting doctors to annually ask all female patients, \u201cWould you like to get pregnant in the next year?\u201d and providing counseling about either pre-conception care or pregnancy prevention.\n\n\u25aa Motivational Interviewing draws out conflicting feelings and thoughts and helps women to clarify their own desires.\n\n\u25aa Tiered, client-centered counseling, the type of counseling that is recommended by the St. Louis Choice Project, which leads with the most effective method that fits a woman\u2019s objectives and health status.\n\n\u25aa Streamlined same day service as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ensures that busy women don\u2019t face the scheduling, travel and childcare obstacles that have prevented many in the past from getting IUD\u2019s.\n\n\u25aa Including removal costs in the insertion fee ensures that no woman will get a LARC and then face a financial barrier to getting it removed when she is ready.\n\n\u25aa Youth friendly posters and brochures from Bedsider.org http://bedsider.org go up on walls and in waiting rooms.\n\n\n\nUpstream USA recently provided their training to a family planning clinic in Amarillo, TX and a large Federally Qualified Health Center serving the community of Worchester, Massachusetts, which has high rates of unplanned pregnancy, pre-term birth, and even infant mortality. More trainings are scheduled in New York, Ohio and Illinois. Early results from the training in Texas are that the clinic has increased the number of IUDs and implants they provide seven fold. Now that all of the clinicians are able to offer all of the methods clients are no longer restricted to only accessing certain methods on certain days of the week.\n\nAll Options for All Women\n\nWe all count on our health care providers to recommend the best treatment options for whatever ails us and the best preventive care options. Good information leads to better care, better health, and more empowered lives. For those who are most in the know about family planning options, (meaning obstetricians and gynecologists), copper and hormonal IUDs are the most popular birth control methods. But without full information about the range of options, many other women have relied on Pills or other methods that leave them at risk of having their family plans and life plans derailed by a surprise pregnancy.\n\nWhen better birth control is available only to those who have privileged access and information, the personal and economic costs of unsought pregnancy disproportionately affect everyone else. Unless all methods are available to all women, improvements in contraception may worsen America\u2019s growing economic divide.\n\nMark Edwards finds that unacceptable: \u201cWomen should be able to achieve their own goals and become pregnant only when they want to. It is unconscionable that women are not offered the very best care, no matter how they enter the healthcare system. For a woman seeking contraception there should be no wrong door. We\u2019re working to create that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "science,technology,enhancement,genetic,nanotechnology,virtual,metaverse,future,bioethics,mp3,political,politics,policy,progressive,radical,radio,religion,science fiction,scientific,scifi,sex,university,technoprogressive,transhumanist,transhumanism,Bostrom,Hughes,Treder", "description": "A single half-day training that teaches medical clinics how to provide better birth control can radically improve outcomes for patients, cutting unplanned pregnancies by half according to research published in the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet.", "title": "Simple Intervention Cuts Unplanned Pregnancy by\u00a0Half"}, "article_summary": "Over the course of the following year, the rate of pregnancy among patients seeking contraception in the intervention clinics was half what it was in the control clinics.\nAfterwards, fears and litigation drove long-acting birth control out of the U.S. market, putting North America decades behind Europe in solving unplanned pregnancy.\nIUD\u2019s and implants are rapidly gaining popularity thanks in part to Obamacare, which eliminates high upfront cost as a barrier.\nBy contrast, state-of-the-art IUD\u2019s and contraceptive implants drop the annual pregnancy rate below 1 in 500.\nThe intervention in the UCSF study cut the pregnancy rate in half."}
