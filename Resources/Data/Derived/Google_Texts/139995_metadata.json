He knows if he\u2019s hanging round with teammates, especially guys he says are \u201cstereotypical\u201d football players, folks wonder why the little guy is hanging out with the football team.\n\nRecruited when Steve Fairchild was CSU\u2019s coach, Hansley was met with some curiosity when Jim McElwain came on campus. It happened again when Mike Bobo arrived. What all of them have found is the little guy \u2014 all 5-foot-10, 180 pounds of him \u2014 can play the game.\n\n\u201cI got used to it. In high school it was that way,\u201d said Hansley, who was the Colorado Gatorade and Scout.com prep player of the year after finishing his career at Highlands Ranch. \u201cPeople knew who I was in Colorado, but bigger schools outside Colorado didn\u2019t really recruit me, so I\u2019m pretty used to it. I guess it drives me a little bit when people overlook me. But when Coach Bobo came in, he was a new coach and I obviously wanted to show him what I had.\u201d\n\nWhich is what Hansley has done every step of the way. In his first preseason camp, he pushed his way into the rotation as a freshman, then turned a short pass into a 32-yard touchdown against CU in his first collegiate game, and he has been making big plays for CSU ever since.\n\nWhile he may have never been \u201cthe guy\u201d for the Rams, he has always been that guy for the team when it comes to making plays.\n\nHe has made so many of them that he\u2019s threatening to enter CSU\u2019s top 10 in career catches, receiving yards and touchdowns. He enters the final five games of the regular season with 126 catches for 1,699 yards and 11 scores. He needs 15 catches, 175 yards and three touchdowns, respectively, to enter the record book, lists that are filled with players who were the main target for part or most of their career with the Rams.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the old statement, you don\u2019t judge a book by its cover, and a football player is a football player; they come in all sizes,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cHe is that. I\u2019ve said it. He\u2019s dependable, he\u2019s got good hands, he runs great routes and he\u2019s tough. He\u2019s a tough football player. He\u2019s probably one of our best blockers.\u201d\n\nEye on\u2026 The Aztecs\n\nSan Diego State (5-3, 4-0 Mountain West) at Colorado State (3-4, 1-2), 1:30 p.m. Saturday, CBSSN\n\nFor the record: The Aztecs have a four-game winning streak. They are coming off a 48-14 victory over Utah State.\n\nStreaking: The Aztecs have held 11 consecutive conference opponents to fewer than 400 total yards. That\u2019s the longest active streak of allowing fewer than 400 total yards in major-college football.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Junior running back Donnel Pumphrey has four consecutive 100-yard rushing games and has rushed for a touchdown in six consecutive games. He is averaging 113.8 yards per game.\n\nWho\u2019s not: San Diego State\u2019s offense has struggled on third down this season, converting only 38 percent. That ranks 81st in the nation.\n\nKey stat: In their last four games, the Aztecs have outscored opponents 45-0 in the first quarter.\n\nFYI: Rocky Long is the only active head coach in major-college football to also have the title of defensive coordinator.\n\nIrv Moss, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joe Hansley is the guy CSU can always count on", "title": "Joe Hansley is the guy CSU can always count on", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/25/joe-hansley-is-the-guy-csu-can-always-count-on/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151025__joe-hansleyp1.jpg", "height": 474}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151025__joe-hansleyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-25T21:02:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:46:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s the old statement, you don\u2019t judge a book by its cover, and a football player is a football player; they come in all sizes,\u201d Bobo said.\nRecruited when Steve Fairchild was CSU\u2019s coach, Hansley was met with some curiosity when Jim McElwain came on campus.\nIf he\u2019s not wearing his Colorado State football backpack around campus, not many are going to think he plays football.\nHe\u2019s a tough football player.\nWhat all of them have found is the little guy \u2014 all 5-foot-10, 180 pounds of him \u2014 can play the game."}
