Host Seth Meyers took a “Closer Look” at Ben Carson’s inconsistencies on Monday evening’s “Late Night,” asking what many in country are calling a WTF Moment.

“Despite the fact that his closest competitor,” Donald Trump, danced like Drake in a “Hotline Bling” parody, Dr. Carson stole the news show by spending the weekend blaming the media for all of his campaign ills.

“Somehow, some way, Ben Carson pulled off the impossible, and had the craziest weekend of any GOP candidate,” Meyers said.

Carson is claiming that pre-President Barack Obama got a way easier go at it, but Meyers called BS, “I’m sorry, do you not remember the whole birth certificate thing?” Meyers said. “There’s literally no way to question a person’s background more than to say, ‘Prove you are who you say you are.'”
