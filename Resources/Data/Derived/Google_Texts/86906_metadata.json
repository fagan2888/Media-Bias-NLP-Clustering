He's an anesthetist and he pronounced the guy dead at 9.05am.\n\n\"I saw him wash up. He was missing his left arm and flesh off the right leg.\n\n\"The shark bit him and held him for about a minute. He was dead before the shark let go.\"\n\nThe man's body was removed from the beach by helicopter, because of difficult terrain.\n\nSearch for the shark\n\nThe Department of Fisheries has issued an \"imminent threat order\" for the shark.\n\nFisheries and Marine Officers are in the water with capture gear.\n\nA green and yellow surfboard has been recovered.\n\nThe Shire of Augusta-Margaret River and Department of Fisheries have closed a number of local beaches, from Umbies, to South Point and Huzzas.

The initial beach closures will be in place for 24 hours.\n\nHistory of attacks\n\nToday's death is the first fatal shark attack in WA in 2013.\n\nThe attack comes six weeks after abalone fisherman Greg Pickering survived a shark attack, 180 kms east of Esperance, on the state's southern coast.\n\nGracetown is the site of three fatal shark attacks in the past 10 years.\n\nSurfer Bradley Smith was taken by a great white at a beach near the town in 2004, and another surfer, Nicholas Edwards, was killed by a shark at nearby South Point in 2010.\n\nTom Jones, a Margaret River surfer, was surfing a nearby spot called Big Rock at the time of the attack\n\n\"I heard the sirens. You know if you hear a siren around here it's probably a shark,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope Fisheries start killing them. It's time. There is too many of them.\"\n\nAnother surfer, Marc Baldan said he kept surfing for two hours after the attack and saw the helicopter collect the body.\n\n\"It's such a clear day you can see through the water,\" he said.\n\nHe said the attack wouldn't put him off surfing, and he would return to the water tomorrow.\n\n\"It's a release. I don't know what I would do without it. It's not until you see one (a shark) that you think twice.\"\n\nA spokesman for WA Police said officers arrived at the beach, to find a man deceased.\n\nHe said inquiries were continuing into the circumstances surrounding his death and the report of a shark attack.\n\nThe Department of Fisheries has been advised and will also investigate the incident.\n\nThe attack came as some of the world's finest chefs, including Heston Blumenthal, gather in WA's southwest for the Gourmet Escape festival.\n\nIt's understood Blumenthal was surfing in waters near the site of the attack on Friday.\n\nMany school leavers are also holidaying in the area.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A MALE surfer, aged 35, has been killed in a shark attack near Gracetown, 270km south of Perth.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "PerthNow", "description": "A MALE surfer, aged 35, has been killed in a shark attack near Gracetown, 270km south of Perth.", "title": "Man killed in shark attack at Lefthanders Beach near Gracetown", "url": "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/man-killed-in-shark-attack-at-lefthanders-beach-near-gracetown/story-fnhocxo3-1226766778852", "image": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2013/11/23/1226766/805111-655f9b3e-53f1-11e3-9447-447e09e048d9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2013/11/23/1226766/805111-655f9b3e-53f1-11e3-9447-447e09e048d9.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@perthnow", "id": "@perthnow"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135447496484311}, "articleid": 1226766778852, "keywords": "initial beach closures, imminent threat order, capture gear, clear day, ,,Western Australia,, Department of Fisheries, shark attack, fatal shark, fatal shark attack, abalone fisherman, southern coast, medivac chopper, shark let, man deceased, yellow surfboard, called police, right leg, Greg Pickering, Ryan Scanlon, Tom Jones, Marc Baldan, Shark", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Nov 23 21:06:16 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Nov 23 21:06:16 EST 2013", "author": "Trevor Paddenburg and Fleur Bainger, with AAP"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0466\"", "article_summary": "Man killed in shark attack at Lefthanders Beach near GracetownVideoImage Man killed by shark near Margaret River A man has died after reportedly being attacked by a shark near Margaret River in Western Australia.\nPolice and St John Ambulance were called to Lefthanders Beach, south of Gracetown, shortly after 9am following reports of a shark attack.\nA MALE surfer, aged 35, has been killed in a shark attack near Gracetown, 270km south of Perth.\nHe said inquiries were continuing into the circumstances surrounding his death and the report of a shark attack.\nThe attack comes six weeks after abalone fisherman Greg Pickering survived a shark attack, 180 kms east of Esperance, on the state's southern coast."}
