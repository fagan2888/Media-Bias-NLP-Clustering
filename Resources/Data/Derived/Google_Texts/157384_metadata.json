(Photo: 2012 Getty Images photo)\n\nThe House voted to repeal the estate tax last week. However, the measure, which affects about 0.2% of Americans every year, is unlikely to pass because of a veto threat. Letter to the editor:\n\nThe piece \"'Death tax' punishes success: Opposing view\" got it right, and so did our Founding Fathers.\n\nThis confiscatory tax stifles the desire to improve one's life, a fundamental reason people live in America and want to come here. It also is a government overreach by taxing the same earned money more than once.\n\nRepealing the death tax would not be a windfall to the taxpayer but would be one for the government. Being such a small amount of all taxes collected also demonstrates the ineffectiveness of federal governance.\n\nVery rarely is a tax repealed that should never even have been on the books in the first place.\n\nRichard S. Trenkmann; Hayward, Wis.\n\nComments from Twitter and Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI see no reason the government should tax the transfer of wealth that has already been taxed.\n\n\u2014 @DLSermersheim\n\nGetting rid of the \"death tax\" sounds good as a headline for Congress, but it is just another tax break for the rich.\n\n\u2014 @Knoid2k\n\nWhy is this a priority now?\n\n\u2014 @mccull0817\n\nRepealing it is long overdue. Our government has to stop penalizing families for a lifetime of hard work.\n\n\u2014 @3rdMrsH\n\nThis is not about wealthy income earners paying taxes. It's about their kids who inherit more than $5.4 million (from an individual) paying taxes on the amount that exceeds the tax-exempt amount. Is it really too much to ask the heir to earn his or her own keep after receiving $5.4 million tax free?\n\n\u2014 Tom Kane\n\nMy children are my motivation in life and work. Nothing would burn me up inside more than the government taking a big proportion of the inheritance that I worked hard to leave to my children.\n\n\u2014 Juan Moore\n\nThe estate tax is double taxation and is punitive. If a person already has paid taxes on what he has accrued, why should his heirs have to pay another tax on the estate? One of the biggest problems in the U.S. tax code is the near impossibility of leaving assets to heirs without the government taking some huge tax.\n\n\u2014 Chris Palo\n\nDead people can't be taxed. Inheritance is unearned income.\n\n\u2014 Walter Lampton\n\nFor more discussions, follow @USATOpinion and #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1yJ114n", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We asked followers for thoughts on the House voting to repeal the estate tax.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "We asked followers for thoughts on the House voting to repeal the estate tax.", "title": "Is 'death tax' an unfair burden? #tellusatoday", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/19/inheritance-estate-death-tax-tellusatoday-your-say/26041585/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We asked followers for thoughts on the House voting to repeal the estate tax.", "title": "Is 'death tax' an unfair burden? #tellusatoday", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f576fe7e4db836c43d697b31e191b0182c44bc8/c=418-0-2581-2163&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Taxes", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Taxes", "title": "Is 'death tax' an unfair burden? #tellusatoday", "author": "USA TODAY", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c2b14e87cdef1494f245a8ea8b3cd220ee015690/c=689-0-2311-2163/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00abc50f4981b573594054d7fc4ffb4c0c25a0b7/c=418-0-2581-2163/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc74362325c9f399b200fae6c5f30c126eb9324a/c=62-0-2939-2163/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac1506c7e4ed2261199aa741108a1b16e8a1c1a9/c=0-234-3000-1929&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-19T18:12:49.490000-04:00", "shorthed": "Is 'death tax' unfair? #tellusatoday", "articleid": 26041585, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9920baed4f87c1d1a86af685990cfd119fad6909/c=0-234-3000-1929/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ccf408ef262623e4fb91503c09baa3f82e7a7d8f/c=894-0-2105-2163/local/-/media/2015/04/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635650622307201843-GTY-152248434.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "estate tax, death tax, inheritance, taxes, government, American Dream, IRS, heirs, family issues"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 @DLSermersheimGetting rid of the \"death tax\" sounds good as a headline for Congress, but it is just another tax break for the rich.\nLetter to the editor:The piece \"'Death tax' punishes success: Opposing view\" got it right, and so did our Founding Fathers.\nRepealing the death tax would not be a windfall to the taxpayer but would be one for the government.\nIs it really too much to ask the heir to earn his or her own keep after receiving $5.4 million tax free?\n(Photo: 2012 Getty Images photo)The House voted to repeal the estate tax last week."}
