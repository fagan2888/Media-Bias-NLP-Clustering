Despite a 28-point lead, they were wrong.\n\nPaul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and J.J. Redick staved off a rally fueled by the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 bench, and the Clippers won 94-84 on Friday night to end a three-game skid and win their eighth straight against their Staples Center co-tenants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to do that before,\u201d said Paul, who had 23 points and six assists. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about the starters having to come back in. It\u2019s about us as a team closing games out and we have to get better at that.\u201d\n\nKobe Bryant scored 12 points for the Lakers in his NBA-record 16th and final Christmas Day game. He played 26 minutes and sat out the entire fourth quarter while the Lakers outscored the Clippers 27-9.\n\nBryant announced on Nov. 29 that he will retire after this season, his 20th in the NBA. He has a record 395 points on Christmas Day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little mixed emotions, honestly,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m so used to playing on Christmas. It\u2019s kind of become a part of our family routine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very, very thankful to be able to play this many games on Christmas,\u201d he added. \u201cGrowing up and watching the Bulls and the Knicks and all those great games on Christmas Day, having been a part of this for so many years has been cool.\u201d\n\nRedick had 14 points and Jordan had nine points and 14 rebounds for the Clippers. They have won 12 of their last 13 meetings with the Lakers.\n\nRookie D\u2019Angelo Russell, the second overall pick in the draft, had a team-high 16 points off the bench for the Lakers.\n\nThe Clippers took an 85-57 lead into the fourth, and both coaches rested all of their starters until the Lakers started to make a move led by Russell, Julius Randle and Marcelo Huertas.\n\nRandle scored nine points in a 2:56 span \u2014 including a 3-pointer that cut the deficit to 87-72 with 7:50 to play. He finished with 11 points.\n\nThe Clippers missed 15 of their first 18 shots in the final period. Clippers coach Doc Rivers was forced to pull his reserves, while Lakers coach Byron Scott kept his out there and left Bryant on the sidelines \u2014 even as the Los Angeles crowd chanted Bryant\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAt that particular time, when it got to about the 6-minute mark, he had been sitting for quite a while,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t about to put him pack in then \u2014 pretty easy decision, to be honest.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers got within 89-82 on a pair of free throws by Randle with 4:01 remaining, but then the Clippers pulled away with a 3-pointer by Wesley Johnson and a 16-footer by Paul.\n\nHURTING ALL NIGHT\n\nBryant missed all three shots he took in the first quarter and then scored nine points in the second, including a pair of 3-pointers 29 seconds apart to help slice a 17-point deficit to 47-37 with 4:14 left.\n\n\u201cTonight, my bones just couldn\u2019t get loose,\u201d said Bryant, who turned 37 in August. \u201cI was hurting all night, but I still felt like I played well and played a solid all-around game for the minutes that I was in there. So that was encouraging.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\n-Clippers: Doc Rivers played for the Knicks on Christmas Day in 1992, making 1 of 4 shots and scoring seven points in an 89-77 loss at Chicago. He also coached the Celtics on Christmas every year from 2008 through 2013. \u2026 G Austin Rivers was bummed about missing his second straight game because of a sprained right ankle \u2014 and the timing of it.\u201d Man, I wanted to play so bad tonight, and I came this close,\u201d he said, holding two fingers close together. \u201cI\u2019ve never played in a Christmas Day game. But I just can\u2019t cut really quickly right now. It hurts.\u201d \u2026 F Paul Pierce has played on Christmas Day for four different teams in the past four years, including Boston, Brooklyn and Washington.\n\n-Lakers: Bryant\u2019s best game on Dec. 25 was in 2004, when he had 42 points in a 104-102 overtime loss to Miami at Staples Center. \u2026 The Lakers are 6-10 on Christmas when Bryant has played, including 0-4 against Miami. \u2026 Oscar Robertson held the previous career record for points on Christmas with 377 before Bryant broke it in 2012. He sat out the previous two years because of injuries. \u2026 This was the second time the Lakers played the Clippers on Christmas, having won 85-75 in 1991 at the Forum with 20 points from A.C. Green and 18 from Scott. \u2026 The Lakers have played on Christmas every year since 1998, when their season opener was delayed until Feb. 5 because of a lockout that reduced the schedule to 50 games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\n-Clippers: At Utah on Saturday night.\n\n-Lakers: At Memphis on Sunday night.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clippers hold off Lakers in Kobe Bryant\u2019s last Christmas game", "title": "Clippers hold off Lakers in Kobe Bryant\u2019s last Christmas game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/clippers-hold-off-lakers-in-kobe-bryants-last-christmas-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__f23b49adf08a9c398b0f6a70670043e9p1.jpg", "height": 475}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151226__f23b49adf08a9c398b0f6a70670043e9p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T14:02:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:13:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve never played in a Christmas Day game.\nIt hurts.\u201d \u2026 F Paul Pierce has played on Christmas Day for four different teams in the past four years, including Boston, Brooklyn and Washington.\nHe has a record 395 points on Christmas Day.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Chris Paul and the rest of the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 starters thought they were done after three quarters.\nHe played 26 minutes and sat out the entire fourth quarter while the Lakers outscored the Clippers 27-9."}
