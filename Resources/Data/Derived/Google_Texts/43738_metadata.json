Multiple hospitals have closed. Bristow Medical Center has been very fortunate to survive this long but if things don't change the system is going to start crumbling and failing even more.\"\n\nClark said she was hired to save Bristow Medical Center from closing its doors.\n\nShe worked with her team to open another facility in Jenks called the Center for Orthopedic Reconstruction and Excellence to keep Bristow's hospital alive.\n\n\"That's going to be our flagship hospital to then keep all of our rural entities open,\" she said.\n\nWhile some hospitals may not have the means to do this, the OHA is proposing to accept available federal health care dollars to expand the Insure Oklahoma program.\n\nThis would make health care more accessible to lower wage earners and part-time employees.\n\nClark agreed finding a solution is imperative for these rural hospitals.\n\n\"With the budget shortfalls that we have currently facing us I think it's time to really look at all avenues and all options that would provide funding to be able to care for all Oklahomans,\" said Clark.\n\nOHA officials also said expanding the Insure Oklahoma program will bring back billions to the state revenue and give thousands of Oklahomans health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rural hospitals in Oklahoma face struggles to stay open due to budget cuts, provider rates and issues with the Affordable Care Act.Since 2010, 67 rural hospitals across the country have closed their doors.Currently 673 rural hospitals in the United States", "title": "Rural hospitals struggle to keep doors open", "og": {"site_name": "KTUL", "description": "Rural hospitals in Oklahoma face struggles to stay open due to budget cuts, provider rates and issues with the Affordable Care Act.Since 2010, 67 rural hospitals across the country have closed their doors.Currently 673 rural hospitals in the United States", "title": "Rural hospitals struggle to keep doors open", "url": "http://ktul.com/news/local/rural-hospitals-struggle-to-keep-doors-open", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/fc040bd1-481d-469e-8dba-6193fa35c0e5-large16x9_ruralhos..JPG?1458168374780", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ktulnews", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/fc040bd1-481d-469e-8dba-6193fa35c0e5-large16x9_ruralhos..JPG?1458168374780", "description": "Rural hospitals in Oklahoma face struggles to stay open due to budget cuts, provider rates and issues with the Affordable Care Act.Since 2010, 67 rural hospitals across the country have closed their doors.Currently 673 rural hospitals in the United States", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rural hospitals struggle to keep doors open"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 402074386667907}, "keywords": "local,OK", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ktultv", "published_time": "2016-03-16T17:46:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "Since 2010, 67 rural hospitals across the country have closed their doors.\nCurrently, 673 rural hospitals in the United States are at risk of closing and 42 of those hospitals are in Oklahoma.\nRural hospitals in Oklahoma face struggles to stay open due to budget cuts, provider rates, and issues with the Affordable Care Act.\nIssues with the Affordable Care Act continue to impact Oklahoma rural hospitals.\nAndy Fosmire, the Oklahoma Hospital Association (OHA) Vice President for Rural Health said several factors have caused these issues."}
