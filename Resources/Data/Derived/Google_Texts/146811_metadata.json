The title-winning athlete, Kayla Montgomery, says her legs go numb, she loses control, and collapses every time she runs because she has multiple sclerosis (MS). After being diagnosed with the condition three years ago, the high school track star decided to race until otherwise unable because she considers her mobility a gift.\n\nKayla Montgomery, teen runner with MS, is 21st in the country.

I don't want to waste the fact that I'm able to right now,\u201d Montgomery told the NY Daily News. Before MS, the teen was one of the slowest runners on her team, but she channeled her energy to enhance her track career despite her diagnosis. Montgomery\u2019s motivation has led her to improve her race time by eight minutes in the last four years. She won the North Carolina state title in the 3,200 meters with a time of 10 minutes 43 seconds, ranking her as 21st in the country.\n\nKayla Montgomery running in a race.

Montgomery has also downplayed her condition, which has led to few people understanding her unusual racing finishes. According to The New York Times, in the national indoor 5,000-meter championship last year, the officials forgot to catch the teen, and she fell on her face, lying flat on the track until she was carried away. The announcers at the match originally thought she had a seizure, fainted, or was simply a \u201cwimp.\u201d\n\nKayla Montgomery collapsed after crossing the finish line.

WXII 12 News\n\nMontgomery\u2019s coach, Patrick Cromwell, recognizes his runner\u2019s tenacity, and recalled what she told him as soon as she was diagnosed with MS. \u201cCoach, I don\u2019t know how much time I have left, so I want to run fast \u2014 don\u2019t hold back,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I said, 'Wow, who are you?'\"\n\nThe runner can move at steady speeds and not feel the pain usually associated with running, which can give her an athletic advantage. This occurs because MS blocks the nerve signals from Montgomery\u2019s legs to her brain, which causes her legs to go numb while she races. Stopping, however, makes her lose control, triggering weakness and instability. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society says it\u2019s important for MS patients to improve their muscle strength and fitness to help with mobility or weakness problems \u2014 running can help with the range-of-motion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kayla montgomery, teen with ms, multiple sclerosis, high school track runner, race, state title, numbness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kayla Montgomery, teen with multiple sclerosis, wins North Carolina state title, despite collapsing after every race due to racing-induced numbness.", "title": "Teen With MS Collapses At Every Race, But Wins State Title [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-multiple-sclerosis-collapses-after-every-race-wins-state-title-how-running-helps-battle-ms", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/07/woman-running-beach.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kayla Montgomery, teen with multiple sclerosis, wins North Carolina state title, despite collapsing after every race due to racing-induced numbness.", "title": "Teen With MS Collapses At Every Race, But Wins State Title [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-multiple-sclerosis-collapses-after-every-race-wins-state-title-how-running-helps-battle-ms", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/07/woman-running-beach.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/07/woman-running-beach.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-07T11:21:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-07T12:12:21-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kayla Montgomery, teen with multiple sclerosis, wins North Carolina state title, despite collapsing after every race due to racing-induced numbness."}, "article_summary": "Kayla Montgomery, teen runner with MS, is 21st in the country.\nAfter being diagnosed with the condition three years ago, the high school track star decided to race until otherwise unable because she considers her mobility a gift.\nWXII 12 News\u201cI don't know how much longer I will be able to run.\nWXII 12 NewsThe high school runner does not receive any special treatment as she trains with the boys team at her school.\nKayla Montgomery running in a race."}
