The techie in me likes to see it light up and flash. But ultimately it's the kids that really drive me,\" Schumacher said.\n\nThe show blends visuals with Christmas tunes, all for a good cause. In its first 8 years, it's brought in over $180,000 for Make A Wish South Dakota. As a result, more than 36 children have had their wish realized.\n\n\"Events like this are really critical to making sure that each one of those wishes can come true,\" Make A Wish South Dakota President and CEO Paul Krueger said.\n\nThe show opens Thursday and will entertain daily between 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. through the end of the year. Santa Claus will make cameos on Saturday, Dec. 13, and Sunday, Dec. 21. This year, characters from the movie \"Frozen\" will be there on Friday, Dec. 19, and Saturday, Dec. 20.\n\nThe show takes in free-will donations from visitors. Just as the show is a marriage of music and lights, it's also a hybrid of Christmas tunes old and new, a medley of both familiar seasonal classics and songs you wouldn't typically associate with the season.\n\nIn between songs, stories of wishes granted remind the audience of the show's motivation.\n\n\"(I) got involved because there was a part of me that just wanted to see how it worked. And then I got a chance to meet some of the Make A Wish kids, and that sold me. Helping these kids out is the absolute reason why I do this,\" Schumacher said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Brian Schumacher has two motivations for engineering the lighting at Christmas at the Western Mall. &quot;Sure it&#39;s cool.
