In states that have already undergone rebalancing, actual new enrollment surpasses projections by an average of 91 percent.\n\nThe OHCA has revised cost estimates upward at least twice. State taxpayers will suffer harmful tax increases in order to pay a minimum of $390 million for the program over the first four years.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated that a similar plan as proposed by the OHCA, which is now in effect in Arkansas, would cost taxpayers nearly $800 million more than traditional Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe OHCA is trying to sell lawmakers on the idea that the new entitlement program won\u2019t see any enrollment growth or any medical cost growth over a four-year period.\n\nWhat the OHCA isn\u2019t telling policymakers, the most vulnerable Oklahomans, and taxpayers is even more concerning. Internal OHCA data reveals that a mere $10 million \u2013 at most \u2013 is needed to maintain provider rates for nursing homes to be sure vulnerable elderly Oklahomans are not displaced. So the OHCA and proponents are merely using the elderly as a human shield.\n\nSavings requires kicking 175,000 women and children off Medicaid in 2019. But that\u2019s unlikely; already some providers are admitting that, for political reasons, this part will never happen.\n\nA February 2015 SoonerPoll survey reveals 56 percent of Oklahomans oppose changing Insure Oklahoma to qualify for Obamacare dollars. The OHCA is pushing such a proposal. Based on a letter from the federal government to the OHCA and the experience of other states, Insure Oklahoma will have to be gutted of its most important features by removing enrollment caps, work or college requirements, and accountable cost sharing. This is not a surprise because the same experience happened to Indiana, which has now adopted Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in the manner OHCA wishes Oklahoma will do.\n\nThe OHCA proposal is out of balance. We must heed Gov. Mary Fallin\u2019s warning from 2014: \u201cBoth the president\u2019s (Medicaid expansion) plan and alternative proposals that rely on federal dollars in the Affordable Care Act amount to the same thing: a dramatic growth in unsustainable government spending.\u201d\n\nJonathan Small serves as president of the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs (www.ocpathink.org).", "article_metadata": {"description": "As details emerge about the Oklahoma Health Care Authority\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u201crebalance\u201d proposal, the most vulnerable Oklahomans, policymakers, and taxpayers should be very concerned.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Jonathan Small", "og": {"site_name": "The Journal Record", "description": "As details emerge about the Oklahoma Health Care Authority\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u201crebalance\u201d proposal, the most vulnerable Oklahomans, policymakers, and taxpayers should be very concerned....", "title": "Free Market Friday: Out of balance", "url": "http://journalrecord.com/2016/05/12/free-market-friday-out-of-balance-opinion/", "image": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2016/01/Small-Jonathan-WEB1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Free Market Friday: Out of balanceThe Journal Record", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "free market friday,jonathan small,medicaid,oklahoma health care authority", "google-site-verification": "vAy42WJoFK0to-yBz3axT36JMlFa0BIJdchVGi9IPXw", "y_key": "b211670718d8bd21", "thumbnail": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2016/01/Small-Jonathan-WEB1-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The OHCA proposal is out of balance.\nWhat the OHCA isn\u2019t telling policymakers, the most vulnerable Oklahomans, and taxpayers is even more concerning.\nAs details emerge about the Oklahoma Health Care Authority\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion rebalancing proposal, the most vulnerable Oklahomans, policymakers, and taxpayers should be very concerned.\nA February 2015 SoonerPoll survey reveals 56 percent of Oklahomans oppose changing Insure Oklahoma to qualify for Obamacare dollars.\nIn states that have already undergone rebalancing, actual new enrollment surpasses projections by an average of 91 percent."}
