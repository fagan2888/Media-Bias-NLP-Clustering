The CMA represents 38,000 of the roughly 104,000 doctors in California.\n\n\"We need some recognition that we're doing a service to the community. But we can't do it for free. And we can't do it at a loss. No other business would do that,\" he said.\n\nCalifornia offers one of the lowest government reimbursement rates in the country -- 30 percent lower than federal Medicare payments. And reimbursement rates for some procedures are even lower.\n\nIn other states, Medicare pays doctors $76 for return-office visits. But in California, Medi-Cal's reimbursement is $24, according to Dr. Theodore M. Mazer, a San Diego ear, nose and throat doctor.\n\nIn other states, doctors receive between $500 to $700 to perform a tonsillectomy. In California, they get $160, Mazer added.\n\nOnly in September did insurance companies disclose that their rates would be pegged to California's Medicaid plan, called Medi-Cal. That's driven many doctors to just say no.\n\nThey're also pointing out that Covered California's website lists many doctors as participants when they aren't.\n\n\"Some physicians have been put in the network and they were included basically without their permission,\" Lisa Folberg said. She is a CMA's vice president of medical and regulatory Policy.\n\n\"They may be listed as actually participating, but not of their own volition,\" said Donald Waters, executive director of the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association.\n\nWaters' group represents 3,100 doctors in the East Bay area that includes Oakland, with an estimated 200,000 uninsured individuals.\n\n\"This is a dirty little secret that is not really talked about as they promote Covered California,\" Waters said. He called the exchange's doctors list a \"shell game\" because \"the vast majority\" of his doctors are not participating.\n\nIndependent insurance brokers who work with both insurance companies and doctor networks estimate that about 70 percent of California's 104,000 licensed doctors are boycotting the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2013/12/trouble_in_obamacare_paradise_doctors_boycotting_state_exchange.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Trouble in Obamacare paradise: California doctors boycotting state exchange"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ea1\"", "article_summary": "\"It doesn't surprise me that there's a high rate of nonparticipation,\" said Dr. Richard Thorp, president of the California Medical Association.\n\"This is a dirty little secret that is not really talked about as they promote Covered California,\" Waters said.\nIn other states, doctors receive between $500 to $700 to perform a tonsillectomy.\nCalifornia offers one of the lowest government reimbursement rates in the country -- 30 percent lower than federal Medicare payments.\nIndependent insurance brokers who work with both insurance companies and doctor networks estimate that about 70 percent of California's 104,000 licensed doctors are boycotting the exchange."}
