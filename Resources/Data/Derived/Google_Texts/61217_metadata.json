For the 2015-2016 school year, 92.9 percent of kindergartners were up-to-date on their vaccines, an increase of 2.5 percentage points from last year.\n\nIn California, 2015 was the year of heated debate around vaccines. It started last January with the first reports of a measles outbreak tied to Disneyland. Then, in early February, lawmakers introduced a bill to eliminate the \u201cpersonal belief exemption\u201d (PBE) which allows parents to refuse vaccines on behalf of their children.\n\nThe law takes effect in July, but this school year the PBE rate declined slightly \u2014 it\u2019s now 2.38 percent, down from 2.54 percent last year. It\u2019s the second straight year of declines.\n\nWhile no one can say for sure exactly what\u2019s driving the increasing vaccination rates, it seems reasonable that all the focus on vaccinations \u2014 and those who choose not to vaccinate \u2014 last year had an impact.\n\nBut James Watt, chief of the division of communicable diseases with the state\u2019s department of public health, says another big factor is \u201cconditional admissions.\u201d These are children who arrive at school with some vaccines, but are not up to date.\n\nThis school year, 4.4 percent \u2014 about 24,000 \u2014 of the state\u2019s 550,000 kindergartners were admitted conditionally.\n\nThe problem, Watt explained to me in an interview, is that the rules around conditional entry are actually quite strict. It\u2019s not simply that a child has some vaccines and will get the rest at a later date. In other words, \u201cconditional entry\u201d is not for children whose parents haven\u2019t gotten them to the doctor\u2019s office or clinic for a shot.\n\n\u201cIf those children could get a dose \u2018today,\u2019 they\u2019re not supposed to be admitted to school,\u201d Watt says.\n\nTo say it in reverse \u2014 conditional entry is for children who cannot be vaccinated \u201ctoday.\u201d\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you be vaccinated \u201ctoday\u201d? Here\u2019s one example: Children are supposed to receive two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. But the second dose can only be given starting one month after the first dose. If school starts less than one month after the child has had the first MMR dose, then the child is eligible for \u201cconditional entry\u201d to school, until the month has passed and the second dose can be given.\n\nDepartment of public health estimates show that more than 90 percent of those 24,000 children with conditional entry do not meet the requirements of the policy and should not have been admitted to school.\n\nWatt says the criteria have been misunderstood and \u201ccan be confusing,\u201d so the state\u2019s health department has been working with local health departments to inform them about correct use of conditional entry. In addition, schools financial and compliance audits for the current school year \u201cwill scrutinize reimbursements for attendance at schools with higher rates of conditional entrance.\u201d\n\nThe department said it turned to approaches used successfully by the Alameda County Public Health Department. The state says Alameda had the biggest decrease \u2014 7.2 percent \u2014 of any California county in its conditional entry rate. Statewide, the rate declined 2.5 percent.\n\nWatt acknowledged \u201cthere is a tension\u201d between health requirements and school attendance, but even if children need vaccinations, there\u2019s \u201cno need to be out of school for more than a day,\u201d Watt said. \u201cThere should not be prolonged absences from school because of the immunization requirement.\u201d\n\nDespite the increases in the rate of kindergartners now fully vaccinated \u201ca number of schools and communities remain at risk of contagion,\u201d the state says. For the current school year, 20 of California\u2019s 58 counties have rates of fully-vaccinated kindergartners below 90 percent.\n\nHere are the counties with the lowest rates of fully vaccinated kindergartners this year:\n\nTrinity 77.0 percent\n\nNevada 77.1 percent\n\nTuolumne 77.7 percent\n\nMariposa 81.5 percent\n\nHumboldt 82.0 percent\n\nSiskiyou 83.8 percent\n\nMany of those counties also have high rates of personal belief exemptions. But individual schools even within counties with high fully vaccinated rates may have high personal belief exemption rates.\n\nYou can look up the personal belief exemption rate at your own school below.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see the school search tool on its own page.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bigger than the personal belief exemption is the change in the rate of kids with what's called \"conditional entry.\"", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Vaccination Rates Are Up Across California\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/20\\/why-vaccination-rates-are-up-across-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-20 13:31:44\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-22 10:00:11\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":140964,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Vaccines\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/RS16167_JV0A7557-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Bigger than the personal belief exemption is the change in the rate of kids with what's called \"conditional entry.\"", "title": "Why Vaccination Rates Are Up Across California", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/20/why-vaccination-rates-are-up-across-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/RS16167_JV0A7557-qut-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But individual schools even within counties with high fully vaccinated rates may have high personal belief exemption rates.\nVaccination rates are up in 49 out of 58 counties in California, according to data released Tuesday by state health officials.\nThe state says Alameda had the biggest decrease \u2014 7.2 percent \u2014 of any California county in its conditional entry rate.\nThe California Department of Public Health annually reports vaccination data for kindergartners at virtually all public and private schools statewide.\nThe problem, Watt explained to me in an interview, is that the rules around conditional entry are actually quite strict."}
