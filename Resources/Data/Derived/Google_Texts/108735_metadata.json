Silber, M.D., Ph.D., of the Center for Outcomes Research at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, compared 25,076 matched pairs of Medicare surgical patients at more than 300 hospitals. Each pairing underwent the same procedure and were also similar in terms of sex, age and other demographic information, as well as chronic illness or severity of condition.\n\nSilber and his team found better care value at hospitals with better nursing environments and above-average levels of nurse staffing, particularly for higher-risk patients. While these results do not necessarily mean an improved nursing environment improves care value on its own, they wrote, the data suggests that surgical care is higher-value within such environments.\n\nResearchers also found improved nurse staffing is not necessarily financially burdensome and moreover, often pays for itself. They found Magnet hospitals achieve lower mortality rates for the same amount or less simply because they admitted 40 percent fewer intensive care unit patients and reduced average lengths of stay.\n\n\"Magnet designation for nursing excellence offers a way for patients to easily identify hospitals where they are more likely to have good outcomes following surgery,\" study coauthor Matthew McHugh. Ph.D., of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, said in a statement.\n\nResearch has also found that patients are more satisfied with care at Magnet hospitals, and that providers with the designation lead in nursing outcomes, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Nurse staffing levels, too, have a significant effect on hospital outcomes, particularly for in-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPatients more satisfied with care at Magnet hospitals\n\nNurse staffing key to higher survival rates of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients\n\nSatisfied nurses improve hospital outcomes, mortality\n\nHospitals that apply for Magnet status improve nurse, patient outcomes\n\nStudy credits nurse work environment for better outcomes\n\nGive nurses the power to make care decisions to improve patient outcomes\n\nMagnet hospitals have fewer surgical deaths", "article_metadata": {"description": "Magnet hospitals and hospitals with better nurse staffing levels have better surgical outcomes at equal or lower costs than other providers,\u00a0according to\u00a0research published in\u00a0JAMA Surgery.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Magnet hospitals and hospitals with better nurse staffing levels have better surgical outcomes at equal or lower costs than other providers,\u00a0according to\u00a0research published in\u00a0JAMA Surgery.", "title": "Magnet status, higher nurse-to-patient staffing levels improve outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/magnet-status-higher-nurse-patient-staffing-levels-improve-outcomes/2016-01-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,care value,Chronic Conditions,magnet hospitals,Nurse Staffing,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,staffing levels,surgical outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2629\"", "article_summary": "Magnet hospitals and hospitals with better nurse staffing levels have better surgical outcomes at equal or lower costs than other providers, according to research published in JAMA Surgery.\nNurse staffing levels, too, have a significant effect on hospital outcomes, particularly for in-hospital cardiac arrest.\nSilber and his team found better care value at hospitals with better nursing environments and above-average levels of nurse staffing, particularly for higher-risk patients.\nResearchers also found improved nurse staffing is not necessarily financially burdensome and moreover, often pays for itself.\nResearch has also found that patients are more satisfied with care at Magnet hospitals, and that providers with the designation lead in nursing outcomes, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
