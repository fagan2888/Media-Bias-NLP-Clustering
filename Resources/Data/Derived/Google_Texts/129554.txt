A 58-year-old man has been arrested as a suspect in an Internet sex crime involving an investigator who posed as a 14-year-old boy.

Investigators with the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office Internet Crimes Against Children unit, posing as a teen, began communicating by computer with a man who sent nude photos of himself, and who requested photos back, according to a sheriff’s office media release.

The suspect “described explicit sexual conduct and detailed how he wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with the 14-year-old,” the sheriff’s office said.

Investigators traced the exchanges to a local address and served a search warrant there Friday.

“Several items of evidence were collected,” according to the release.

The sheriff’s office identified the suspect as Jeffrey Allan Lane.

Lane talked with investigators, the sheriff’s office said, and admitted making the Internet pleas for sex.

He faces felony charges of Internet luring of a child and Internet sexual exploitation of a child.

Lane was held at the Arapahoe County Jail. He posted a $50,000 bond and was released.
