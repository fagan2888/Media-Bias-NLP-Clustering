Gov. David Dewhurst, the second highest-ranking elected official in the state, called for President Obama\u2019s impeachment this week.\n\nThe Republican politician told a Tea Party forum Monday, \u201cBarack Obama ought to be impeached, Not only for trampling on our liberties, but what he did in Benghazi is just a crime,\u201d the Texas Observer quoted his speech.\n\nSpeaking to The Observer after the event, Dewhurst elaborated on his statement.\n\n\u201cI think this president, Barack Obama, has disregarded federal law. He\u2019s tried to do things which are not authorized under federal law, such as with immigration, such as not following our federal drug laws,\u201d Dewhurst told the Observer. \u201cHe\u2019s created winners and losers out of Obamacare where he has no authority, such as allowing for the unions and big businesses to postpone their mandates for a year.\u201d\n\nDewhurst further took Obama to task for the administration\u2019s handling of the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya \u2014 which left four Americans dead, including the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.\n\nDewhurst\u2019s spokesman, Travis Considine, told the Texas Tribune that the lieutenant governor, himself a former CIA officer, \u201cfeels very strongly about the tragedy in Benghazi and has said that Congress should consider impeaching the President over the tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDavid Dewhurst also believes that President Obama should be held accountable for Washington\u2019s failure to secure the border and the gross overreach of the federal government under Obamacare,\u201d Considine added.\n\nDewhurst lost a Senate primary run to Texas Sen. Tex Cruz in 2012 and is seeking re-election in 2014.\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "Texas Lt. Gov.
