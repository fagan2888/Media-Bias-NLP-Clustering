To find enlightenment. To take a spiritual journey.\n\nWhat does this language mean? Are these pursuits, these aspirations, really possible? And if they are, what do the results look like?\n\nI can\u2019t pretend to have the answers. What I do know is that I went to India this year on a journalism fellowship to write about religion and spirituality. I landed in a place called Rishikesh, a holy spot for Hindus and magnet for Westerners seeking inner peace.\n\nFor two weeks, I set judgment aside and dove in to see what this place was all about. What I found touched me more than I anticipated and left me feeling somewhat transformed. I chronicled all of this in \"Indian Awakenings\" last month.\n\nSince then, I've had a different sort of awakening.\n\nThe flood of responses, including hundreds of long and thoughtful e-mails from readers around the world, made it clear: People are hungry for stories of spiritual discoveries \u2013 and for mainstream platforms willing to explore them.\n\nNo surprise there, said Lisa Miller, a clinical psychologist at Columbia University, Teachers College, and director of the Spirituality Mind Body Institute.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a huge cultural shift,\u201d said Miller, who'd barely heard about spirituality in academia when she started out 20 years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re evolving \u2013 as a collective \u2013 and finding something deeper, more true and more permanent.\u201d\n\nThe story from India \u201cstimulated not only my intellect but also awakened my soul,\u201d wrote one of the readers.\n\n\u201cIt inspired me to live my life with a more open heart,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cAn energy forced me to read your article,\u201d wrote a third. \u201cWhile reading, I cried, reflected on my life, felt the wounds of my daughters, exclaimed pain from my sister\u2019s suicide, gave thanks to my parents and even sent advice to a guy I just met. I\u2019m not sure where this will all lead.\u201d\n\nMiller attributes this opening up, at least in part, to a loss of security, a response to challenges. Financial downturns and, for some, implosions. Natural disasters. School shootings. Domestic terrorism. Pick your pain.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve never suffered aren\u2019t very deep,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this country, there\u2019s been a shattering of the golden calf. Idolatry of the material side of the American dream is fading, and we need to come up with a new American dream.\u201d\n\nThe letters, however, came from countries far and wide. People weighed in from all different faith backgrounds \u2013 Hindu, Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, Mormon, Buddhist, Jewish, atheist and agnostic.\n\nMost shared enthusiasm about peering outside their normal perspective and learning about others' views. But the ones who were least willing to bend or be open seemed to fit into two distinct categories, firmly set on opposite ends of the spiritual spectrum: those who believe the Bible is the literal word of God, and those who don't believe in God at all.\n\nIf sitting in front of idols and not sticking to the Bible wasn\u2019t going to be the end of me, the literalists seemed to say, the devout atheists thought my gullibility and being a sucker would.\n\nThose diametrically opposed criticisms made sense to Dr. Andrew Newberg, a neuroscientist who helped pioneer a field called \u201cneurotheology,\u201d or the neurological study of religious and spiritual experiences.\n\nA person\u2019s reactions come down to how the brain is wired, said Newberg, the co-author of books including \u201cHow God Changes Your Brain.\u201d Those who can look outside their own views will do so. Those who are firmly wired may not be capable of challenging the information they hold dear.\n\n\u201cOur brains are belief-making machines, so we gravitate to different beliefs,\u201d whether we find them in science, religion or art, he said. \u201cEach of our brains is doing its best job to figure out the world.\u201d\n\nHow we are raised, our genetics, even infections we had as children help shape how our brains work and how necessary it is for us to lock into a specific sort of mindset, Newberg said.\n\nWhen we engage in rituals, we strengthen our connections to a belief. And this doesn\u2019t just apply to religion. It plays out, too, in our politics and morals - even where we get our news.\n\n\u201cThe connections that make sense to us or comfort us, we keep feeding them,\u201d he said.\n\nWe are, as a result, drawn to the people and ideas that support our wiring, Newberg said. For those who may seem less flexible on either end of the spectrum, it can generate prejudice.\n\nBut for those who believe in a loving, non-punishing God, he says, the benefits of spiritual practice and prayer are real. This sort of mindset, even just 12 minutes of meditation a day, can slow the aging process, scale back anxiety, reduce depression and increase compassion, security and feelings of love. He says the brain scans he's studied prove it.\n\nI didn\u2019t find my guru in India, nor did I develop a consistent yoga or meditation practice. But I returned feeling like something had shifted inside of me.\n\nThis recent Father\u2019s Day, unlike previous ones since my dad died, didn\u2019t wreck me. I\u2019ve slept better. I\u2019m in the healthiest relationship I\u2019ve ever known. I don\u2019t feel like I've failed because I didn't have children, nor do I have those days at work when I think, \u201cI suck.\u201d\n\nAnd I like to think that my being open to possibilities, my looking at the world and people with wonder instead of judgment, helped bring me there. Whether I technically found myself or got enlightened, I can\u2019t say. All I know is I\u2019m in a better place.\n\nGauging from readers\u2019 reactions, no matter where they come from, it appears many of them want to get there, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jessica Ravitz, CNN (CNN) -- To discover one\u2019s self.
