It took firefighters 45 minutes to find the source of the fire and extinguish the flames.\n\nRELATED: Fire at Kohl\u2019s sends shoppers into the cold\n\nInvestigators focused on recycled batteries or an electrical problem as the cause, police said.\n\nMonmouth County fire marshal Henry Stryker III said the fire was ruled accidental and that recycled batteries couldn\u2019t be ruled out as a factor.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1EQeDJ3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Company officials said the store will reopen at 9 a.m. Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Company officials said the store will reopen at 9 a.m. Wednesday.", "title": "Kohl\u2019s in Holmdel reopens after fire", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/2015/02/25/kohls-holmdel-reopens-fire/23987565/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Company officials said the store will reopen at 9 a.m. Wednesday.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/02/25/B9316385314Z.1_20150225092617_000_GL0A2CFD4.1-0.jpg", "title": "Kohl\u2019s in Holmdel reopens after fire", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/?_rdr"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: KEN SERRANO/ASBURY PARK PRESS STAFF)Buy PhotoThe Kohl\u2019s department store that caught fire last week is expected to reopen Wednesday morning, company officials said.\nBuy Photo Firefighters converge on Kohl\u2019s in Holmdel to put out a smoky fire.\nRELATED: Fire at Kohl\u2019s sends shoppers into the coldInvestigators focused on recycled batteries or an electrical problem as the cause, police said.\nThe smoky fire, which sent dozens of shoppers and employees into the cold Friday night, caused the department store to shut down for several days.\nThe store is expected to reopen 9 a.m. Wednesday, said company spokeswoman Maggie Lund."}
