Ricardo Lara introduced the bill to pave the way for illegal immigrants to purchase health plans from Covered California, Kaiser Health reports. The legislation was approved by the California Senate last year and on Tuesday made it through the state Assembly\u2019s Committee on Health. The Assembly\u2019s Committee on Appropriations will take up the bill next.\n\nIllegal immigrants are excluded from the Affordable Care Act as well as Medicaid, and they cannot buy a health plan from any state exchanges or the federal marketplace, a provision that was necessary for Congress to pass the law.\n\nLara\u2019s proposal would reverse this aspect of Obamacare and potentially set a precedent for other states to follow suit, although the California bill would not allow undocumented immigrants to receive federal dollars to purchase health insurance, unlike other Obamacare participants.\n\nMany people believe this move to not grant money makes the legislation mainly symbolic because most illegal immigrants would not practically be able to pay for health premiums on their own, according to Kaiser Health.\n\nLara\u2019s bill is expected to pass through the legislature, but it would still need to be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. Even if it becomes law, however, Covered California would still not necessarily be able to sell health care coverage to illegals because the bill does not actually do that. Instead, the legislation would essentially be a formal request to the federal government to exempt California from the provision that forbids sales to illegal immigrants, putting the ultimate decision in the feds\u2019 hands.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allows states to seek an \u201cinnovation waiver\u201d to let them modify parts of Obamacare to expand coverage, but only with approval from the federal government.\n\nIf the California bill is signed by the governor and approved by the feds, then California would have the first state exchange in the United States from which illegal immigrants could purchase health insurance.\n\nA different California law set to take effect this month allows illegal immigrant children to sign up for and receive the full benefits of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cLast year we really made history in ensuring that over 170,000 children across the state have access to health care,\u201d Lara said, referring to the newly implemented law. \u201cAgain we\u2019re taking another bite at the apple, and we\u2019re not going to rest until we get health care for all.\u201d\n\nCovered California staff personnel presented an analysis of the proposed legislation to the organization\u2019s board last month and estimated that enrollment would increase by 50,000 if illegals could buy through the exchange.\n\nCovered California\u2019s executive director, Peter V. Lee, has not taken a position on Lara\u2018s bill, but he said exchange officials are ready to help the legislature, adding, \u201cThe ball is in their court.\u201d\n\nProponents of the bill argue that broader access to health care is the right thing to do and fosters a sense of inclusion. They say opening the exchange will simplify the enrollment process and make it easier to get coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a modest step forward, but important for the goal of healthcare for all,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nSome advocates are concerned that not giving illegal immigrants subsidies will prevent many of them from buying coverage even if the bill becomes law, especially because Coverage California plans are expensive.\n\nAnother issue is the cost of the legislation. Some analysts believe this issue is not a big deal, however.\n\n\u201cThe [Lara] bill, at least in its current state, doesn\u2019t have a large price tag, so it seems possible [Brown would] approve it,\u201d said Shannon McConville, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cBut you can never know for sure.\u201d\n\nOthers disagree, including Sen. Joel Anderson, who voted against the bill last year.\n\n\u201cThe state has failed on its commitment to health care providers and their patients, and my budget priority is to take care of them first before expanding the pool,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nOther opponents are principally against the bill and do not think the state or federal governments should provide benefits to those who broke the country\u2019s laws and are here illegally.\n\nIra Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the Lara bill would be \u201ctantamount to excepting their unlawful presence in the country.\u201d\n\nHe argued \u201cthis is just the first step in eventually getting subsidized coverage\u201d as California would set a precedent that other states would soon follow.\n\nSupporters of expanding health care coverage acknowledge that permitting illegals to make purchases on the state exchange will not necessarily make coverage more affordable for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California legislators are circulating a bill to allow illegal immigrants to buy health insurance from Covered California, the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "State lawmakers in California are circulating legislation that would open the door for illegal immigrants to buy health insurance from Covered California, the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.
