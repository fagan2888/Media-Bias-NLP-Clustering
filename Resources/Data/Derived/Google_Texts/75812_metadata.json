An important milestone was reached this year with the approval for accreditation from the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing. \u201cThe Friendship Center (TFC) was forging new territory by partnering with a university nursing program: both to gain future volunteers for TFC and to provide opportunities for the nursing students to work with senior adults. The relationship has been a huge success, and TFC is grateful for the enriching contributions of the nursing students\u201c, said Susan Hawkins, Volunteer Coordinator for The Friendship Center.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourwoodlandsnews.com", "description": "Nursing students enrolled at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) have been spending quality time with Montgomery County seniors.", "title": "SHSU students spend time at county Friendship Centers", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/woodlands/news/shsu-students-spend-time-at-county-friendship-centers/article_14625a86-6481-5492-b556-5a4535689280.html", "image": {"width": 567, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/e9/de931640-c182-5892-bb89-e18435a36115/529c151447c3e.preview-600.jpg?resize=567%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news", "description": "Nursing students enrolled at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) have been spending quality time with Montgomery County seniors."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6b3\"", "article_summary": "Nursing students enrolled at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) have been spending quality time with Montgomery County seniors.\nThe four-year nursing program at SHSU began in November of 2008.\nThe relationship has been a huge success, and TFC is grateful for the enriching contributions of the nursing students\u201c, said Susan Hawkins, Volunteer Coordinator for The Friendship Center.\n\u201cThe Friendship Center (TFC) was forging new territory by partnering with a university nursing program: both to gain future volunteers for TFC and to provide opportunities for the nursing students to work with senior adults.\nAn important milestone was reached this year with the approval for accreditation from the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing."}
