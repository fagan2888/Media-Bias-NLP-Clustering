Nevada’s largest daily newspaper is telling Sen. Harry Reid to “quit the race-baiting already” after he embarrassingly referred to Clarence Thomas as a white man.

“Harry Reid is the da Vinci of distraction,” the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote Friday. “The moment any scandal, policy failure or political defeat crashes down on him — and there have been plenty the past few years — the Senate majority leader unleashes outrageous rhetoric that’s better suited for a sandbox than what once passed for the world’s greatest deliberative body.

“Worse, the Nevada Democrat has become especially fond of slinging race cards just to crank up the outrage,” the editorial read.

The comments come after Mr. Reid last week blasted the Supreme Court for its decision to overturn part of the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate.

The senator railed against the “five white men” who ruled that some businesses do not have to provide some forms of birth control if doing so violates the employer’s religious beliefs.

Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, a black conservative, was one of the five who ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby.

“Sen. Reid’s slip was no accident,” the Review-Journal continued. “He believes racial and ethnic minorities are ideologically monolithic constituencies who are incapable of independent or — gasp! — right-of-center thinking. In the majority leader’s mind, Mr. Thomas is not an African-American because the justice doesn’t blindly subscribe to liberal orthodoxy.

“Never mind that Sen. Reid himself, like the entire Senate Democratic leadership, is as white as an Irishman in a snowstorm,” the paper quipped.

“We thought the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president was supposed to herald an age of post-racial politics,” it concluded. “So much for hope and change. Quit the race-baiting already, Sen. Reid. You’re clearly colorblind — in all the wrong ways.”
