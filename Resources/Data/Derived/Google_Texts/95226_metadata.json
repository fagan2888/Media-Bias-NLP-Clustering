Several of the activists were among the 787,767 participants of an unofficial referendum calling for candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s leader be nominated by the public instead of Chinese officials.\n\nBeijing-allied authorities have characterized the referendum as unlawful. In response, the pro-democracy group threatened a sit-in of the city\u2019s financial district if the existing government fails to provide basic voting rights.\n\nUnder China\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule of law, Hong Kong was grafted into China in 1997, yet allowed autonomy. But a \u201cwhite paper\u201d from Beijing has recently clarified that this autonomy is not \u201cfull\u201d autonomy:\n\nToday\u2019s march was peaceful, but frustrations over Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive have been simmering for years. In 2012, Beijing-backed Leung Chun-ying won 689 votes from 1,193 society representatives to become Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive. These representatives are largely business executives and existing politicians with connections to mainland China.\n\nFor the tens of thousands of Hong Kong activists, this authorized autonomy falls far short of real democracy. While participants (ranging from 98,000, according to police, and 510,000, according to organizers) hope they will be able to choose their own leadership by the 20th anniversary of China\u2019s takeover in 2017, mainland China representatives assert that only leaders who \u201clove the country and love Hong Kong\u201d should be on the ballot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the peak of a stifling hot Tuesday, a historic number of Hong Kong activists marched over three miles in support of elections free from Chinese oversight.", "pubdate": 20140701, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "At the peak of a stifling hot Tuesday, a historic number of Hong Kong activists marched over three miles in support of elections free from Chinese oversight.", "title": "Pro-democracy activists swarm Hong Kong on anniversary of Chinese takeover", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14571033223_cc13f88528_o.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/pro-democracy-activists-swarm-hong-kong-anniversary-chinese-takeover/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "At the peak of a stifling hot Tuesday, a historic number of Hong Kong activists marched over three miles in support of elections free from Chinese oversight.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14571033223_cc13f88528_o.jpg", "title": "Pro-democracy activists swarm Hong Kong on anniversary of Chinese takeover", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "protests"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Chinese government, democracy, Hong Kong, protests"}, "article_summary": "At the peak of a stifling hot Tuesday, a historic number of Hong Kong activists marched more than three miles in support of elections free from Chinese oversight.\nFor the tens of thousands of Hong Kong activists, this authorized autonomy falls far short of real democracy.\nUnder China\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule of law, Hong Kong was grafted into China in 1997, yet allowed autonomy.\nIn 2012, Beijing-backed Leung Chun-ying won 689 votes from 1,193 society representatives to become Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive.\nSeveral of the activists were among the 787,767 participants of an unofficial referendum calling for candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s leader be nominated by the public instead of Chinese officials."}
