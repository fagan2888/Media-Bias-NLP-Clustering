That\u2019s not a problem for consumers eligible for Obamacare\u2019s taxpayer-funded subsidies. Their cost is calculated based on their income.\n\nIt\u2019s you \u2014 the taxpayers \u2014 who get gouged when premiums are hiked, because you foot the bill for the subsidies. That makes the Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell, expected some day this month, even more consequential. It will determine the fate of these subsidies. Without them, Obamacare buyers in 37 states will have to pay the actual \u2014 and unaffordable \u2014 sticker price of Obamacare. And taxpayers will be off the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.\n\nDemocrats are predicting disaster if the court rules against President Obama. Republicans will \u201crue the day\u201d they let millions of people lose their subsidies, says House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. That\u2019s crazy talk. No one will lose their coverage immediately, the poor will be unaffected, and the biggest losers will be insurance companies. Employers, job seekers and taxpayers stand to win. In addition, most Republicans in Congress are inclined to compromise with the president to provide some type of financial help for insurance buyers. Here\u2019s how it would shake out:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act says subsidies will be provided only in states that set up their own exchanges. But only a handful of states (including New York) did. In 37 states that didn\u2019t, people use the federal Healthcare.gov website instead. The Obama administration handed out subsidies to these people anyway, playing fast and loose with the law and your money.\n\nIf the justices rule that the Obama administration can\u2019t do that, some 7.7 million people will eventually lose their subsidies.\n\nEventually, but not soon. During oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito suggested that if the court makes such a \u201cdisruptive\u201d ruling, it could delay it taking effect. And Justice Antonin Scalia told the Obama lawyers, \u201cIf the consequences are as disastrous as you say, so many million people without \u2014 insurance and whatnot,\u201d Congress will come up with a remedy.\n\nInsurance companies are lobbying furiously for a congressional fix. The dirty secret is that insurers stand to lose the most from King v. Burwell. The Affordable Care Act compels the public to buy their product, and forces taxpayers to subsidize it. What a sweetheart deal. The giant players \u2014 United Healthcare, Cigna, Aetna, Anthem and Humana \u2014 have seen their stock prices double, triple, even quadruple since the law was passed in 2010. The coming ruling threatens to put an end to their gravy train.\n\nMeanwhile outside Washington D.C., a ruling against the subsidies will benefit employers and job seekers. Any of the 37 states that wants to can set up an exchange and immediately qualify for the subsidies. But most are controlled by the Republican Party and won\u2019t do it. Without subsidies, the employer mandate is toothless, because employers are only fined for not offering coverage if their workers go to an exchange and get a subsidy. Nullifying the impending employer mandate, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, 2016, would likely ignite a hiring boom.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that looming mandate has caused 21 percent of small business to reduce workers\u2019 hours, 41 percent to delay hiring, and 27 percent of franchises (such as fast food restaurants) to replace full-timers with part-timers.\n\nPeople facing a penalty for being uninsured will also be winners. Without subsidies, most will be exempted from the penalty, saving them $2,000 on average next year.\n\nDespite Democrats\u2019 dire warnings, the poor won\u2019t be hurt. An amazing 89 percent of people who were uninsured before Obamacare and gained coverage under the law are on Medicaid, which will not be affected.\n\nIgnore the alarmist rhetoric. A loss for the Obama administration in King v. Burwell will be a win for most Americans.\n\n\u2022 Betsy McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Analysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week health insurers announced they will hike premiums on Obamacare plans by double digits in 2016.
