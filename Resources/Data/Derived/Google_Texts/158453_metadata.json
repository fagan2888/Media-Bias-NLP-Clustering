Rochener Gilot, who worked as a Haitian officer in the 1990s before moving to the U.S., closely watched the rookies work on building trust with local residents. \u201cThe population\u2019s comfort level with police is not going to change overnight, but we\u2019re removing the myth that police are not friendly or approachable. People here are starting to see that they can talk to the cops,\u201d he said.\n\nHaitians will soon rely more on their police to maintain security as the United Nations downsizes the peacekeeping force it has kept in Haiti since 2004, when a violent rebellion swept the country. While the U.N. will maintain a police contingent of 2,601, it will cut its multinational troop size from 5,021 to 2,370 in June.\n\nMany people wonder if the Haitian officers will be ready.\n\n\u201cThere is little question that the (national police force) has been strengthened and professionalized over recent years, but it began at such a weak and dysfunctional level that it is still not at the professional level everyone wants,\u201d said Mark Schneider of International Crisis Group, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Haitian National Police was founded in 1995 after then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army due to its long history of abuse. An uprising in 2004 ousted Aristide and insurgents targeted police officers, killing and mutilating scores. Many abandoned their posts. When U.N. peacekeepers arrived, they found a force left demoralized and outgunned.\n\nIn more recent years, the foreign peacekeepers have done much of the heavy lifting as they helped police battle gangs in urban slums.\n\nAs the force is built up, some Haitians still accuse officers of being incompetent and heavy-handed agents for the elite.\n\n\u201cIn Haitian culture, if you have a gun and a uniform, you\u2019re one of the rough boys. If the U.N. leaves and all we have is Haitian police, I think there will be no human rights here,\u201d 25-year-old Etienne Bergerald said in the cinderblock slum of Delmas 32 as he transformed a rusty car with spray paint.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Haiti police face crucial test with UN drawdown", "title": "Haiti police face crucial test with UN drawdown", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Haiti police face crucial test with UN drawdown", "title": "Haiti police face crucial test with UN drawdown", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/17/haiti_police_face_crucial_test_with_un_drawdown/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/haiti-improving-police.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Haiti police face crucial test with UN drawdown", "title": "Haiti police face crucial test with UN drawdown", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/haiti-improving-police.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "DAVID McFADDEN", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Haitian National Police was founded in 1995 after then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army due to its long history of abuse.\nMany people wonder if the Haitian officers will be ready.\nDisdained by many as abusive or inept, officers of Haiti\u2019s force now say their new approach is beginning to pay off.\nAs the force is built up, some Haitians still accuse officers of being incompetent and heavy-handed agents for the elite.\n\u201cIn Haitian culture, if you have a gun and a uniform, you\u2019re one of the rough boys."}
