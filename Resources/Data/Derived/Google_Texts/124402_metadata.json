We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us. Our success won\u2019t depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values, or giving into fear. Instead, we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless, and by drawing upon every aspect of American power.\u201d\n\nThis immediately raises several questions, such as: Whatever happened to \u201cdegrading and ultimately destroying\u201d ISIS?\n\nSuddenly it\u2019s just \u201cdestroy,\u201d even though Obama, and virtually everyone in his Administration, spent the last several years awkwardly shoehorning the phrase degrade and ultimately destroy into every public statement. Every time any foreign leader took a stand against the Islamic State, Obama or one of his munchkins raced out to congratulate them for \u201cjoining our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy the Islamic State.\u201d Apparently the San Bernardino attack saw ISIS finally degrading Obama\u2019s credibility enough to make him stop talking about twenty-year strategies to annoy them into oblivion.\n\nAnother question: how are we supposed to marshal all the strong, smart, resilient, and relentless power of America against a deadly enemy without \u201ctalking tough\u201d about them? When he isn\u2019t trying to ignore them, Obama treats the Islamic State like a schoolyard bully he intends to file a complaint about with the principal, at his earliest opportunity, once he\u2019s finished writing up his homework assignment about how Christmas is an act of cultural appropriation against pagan societies.\n\nObama took another stand against fear at the end of his speech: \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that freedom is more powerful than fear; that we have always met challenges \u2013 whether war or depression, natural disasters or terrorist attacks \u2013 by coming together around our common ideals as one nation, as one people. So long as we stay true to that tradition, I have no doubt America will prevail.\u201d\n\nObama lectures about irrational fear because he devoutly believes all criticism of himself is irrational. He\u2019ll ride the bomb of his presidency all the way to the ground, waving his cowboy hat and whooping it up, and anyone who doesn\u2019t come along for the ride is either a chicken, a racist, or a mindless slave to Republican special interests.\n\nHectoring people about how concern over ISIS is blind fearmongering is also a way to keep Americans from noticing what an utter disaster Obama has made of the world. True, there have been bipartisan attempts since 9/11 to claim that unless politicians get what they want, \u201cthe terrorists will have won,\u201d but here Obama is going for the most childishly simple definition of a terrorist as one who desires terror, and the best way to beat them is refusing to give it to them.\n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous, and stupid, way to look at terrorism. Fear is not the objective. Submission is the objective. Above all else, terrorists want civilized people to submit to their demands, and grant their viewpoint legitimacy. They don\u2019t win because civilized people are afraid. They win when the governments of civilized nations are exhausted, and start talking about giving them what they want, to make them stop.\n\nObama looked exhausted indeed on Sunday night, and his Party has demonstrated a growing willingness to make deals with Islamists and give them what they want, accepting at least some of their demands as legitimate grievances. That\u2019s the thinking behind the nauseating genre of left-wing \u201cvictims had it coming\u201d speeches and op-eds, including their Really Deep Thoughts about how free speech doesn\u2019t include the right to offend Muslims, while offending every other religion is the highest form of artistic independence.\n\nWhat terrorists really want is for civilized people to admit they have legitimate grievances. Also high on their holiday wish list: lots of helpless soft targets they can kill easily. Liberals are working hard to give Islamist terrorists both of those gifts. Frankly, the terrorists had them at \u201cgrievances.\u201d There isn\u2019t much they would rather talk about.\n\nThe irony of our Fearmonger-in-Chief lecturing us about irrational phobias is astounding. There hasn\u2019t been a major American politician in recent memory who spent more time trying to scare the hell out of citizens than Barack Obama. He\u2019s constantly telling us to be afraid of our fellow citizens. We\u2019re supposed to be frightened of an insufficiently regulated private sector and its predatory capitalists. We\u2019re supposed to be scared of our racist, sexist, homophobic neighbors. Obama constantly describes opposition to his agenda as malevolence.\n\nBefore the current terrorism storyline gripped our national attention, Obama was dishing out idiotic global-warming scare stories that had even climate-change believers shuffling their feet uncomfortably and muttering about him going overboard. Every time he refers to climate change, this President speaks in apocalyptic terms: the end is nigh unless we do what he wants, right now, without asking pesky questions. He\u2019s big on portraying skeptics as a sinister conspiracy out to rape the planet, a pack of predatory fatcats who don\u2019t mind melting the polar ice caps to make a quick buck, in the process submerging the coastal cities they\u2026 um\u2026 inexplicably live in.\n\nObama worked hard to stoke fears of misogynism with phony statistics about a \u201cpay gap\u201d imposed on women by mysterious, nameless sexist men\u2026 statistics he kept peddling long after they had been debunked.\n\nHe beamed warmly upon the racial paranoia unleashed by the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown narratives. Have you heard any Democrats lecture the Black Lives Matter crew on their tendency to abandon American values and give into fear, their reliance on \u201ctough talk,\u201d their refusal to understand that freedom is more powerful than fear? No, it\u2019s all they can do to choke out a declaration that all lives matter, without getting run off the stage by a mob of activists. The Democrat Party is so invested in fearmongering that they consider the statement \u201call lives matter\u201d to be controversial.\n\nSay a word against the gruesome excesses of Planned Parenthood, and Obama\u2019s crew will instantly accuse you of being a knuckle-dragging primate who wants to destroy a Woman\u2019s Right to Choose out of sheer patriarchal sadism. Military veterans, Christians, and Tea Party members have all been described as incipient terrorists by this Administration. Democrats have worked for years to inflate the Koch Brothers into supervillains.\n\nObama has personally blamed oil company conspiracies for high gas prices under his reign, dismissed opposition to ObamaCare as a sadistic urge by Republicans to watch poor people die in the streets, absurdly claimed that the entire U.S. government would instantly collapse if the debt ceiling wasn\u2019t raised \u2013 he even threatened to cut off Social Security checks! \u2013 and suggested the weak employment numbers characteristic of his Administration were a conspiracy by profiteering employers to cut costs by cutting jobs. Oh, and if they do give you a job, they\u2019re monsters who will stick you with sweat-shop wages for no good reason, unless the government forces them to pay higher wages.\n\nObama\u2019s still fear-mongering right now, on the very issue at hand. His obsession with the Great Hypothetical Anti-Muslim Backlash stokes fears of toothless gun-toting rednecks itching for an excuse to start burning down mosques. His gun-control agenda, which has absolutely nothing to do with the San Bernardino attackers, is premised on fear of law-abiding Americans who might be driven into bullet-spewing rages. He\u2019s pushing his dizzy \u201cno fly list, no gun\u201d idea by explicitly stoking fears that everyone on that list is too dangerous to risk having a firearm\u2026 even though over 70 employees of the Department of Homeland Security are on it.\n\nThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u2026 and whatever Barack Obama tells us to fear. His entire Administration has been one big neurotic breakdown, driven by the fear Americans will tear the country to pieces unless they\u2019re taxed and regulated into a stupor. Statism is based on the fear of what free people will do with their freedom. No wonder they can\u2019t work up any apprehension over international terrorism \u2013 they spend every day looking out the window and seeing contemptible monsters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama White House has scarcely been able to get through a public statement since the San Bernardino jihad attack without tut-tutting Americans for being unreasonably frightened of Islamist terrorism.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Obama White House has scarcely been able to get through a public statement since the San Bernardino jihad attack without tut-tutting Americans for being unreasonably frightened of Islamist terrorism.", "title": "The Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself, Plus What Obama Tells Us to Fear - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Obama-Oval-Saul-LoebAP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/07/thing-fear-fear-plus-obama-tells-us-fear/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama White House has scarcely been able to get through a public statement since the San Bernardino jihad attack without tut-tutting Americans for being unreasonably frightened of Islamist terrorism.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Obama-Oval-Saul-LoebAP.jpg", "title": "The Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself, Plus What Obama Tells Us to Fear - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, fear, gun control, ISIS, jihad, San Bernardino Attack, terrorism,Big Government,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-12-07T11:27:34-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe228f\"", "article_summary": "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u2026 and whatever Barack Obama tells us to fear.\nOur success won\u2019t depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values, or giving into fear.\n\u201cThe threat from terrorism is real,\u201d Obama admitted, \u201cbut we will overcome it.\nStatism is based on the fear of what free people will do with their freedom.\nSuddenly it\u2019s just \u201cdestroy,\u201d even though Obama, and virtually everyone in his Administration, spent the last several years awkwardly shoehorning the phrase degrade and ultimately destroy into every public statement."}
