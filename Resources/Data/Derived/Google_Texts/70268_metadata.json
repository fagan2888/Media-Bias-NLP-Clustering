James, a native of Akron, Ohio, won two NBA championships with the Miami Heat, the team he joined after spending the first seven years of his career with the Cavs.\n\nEarnest praised James\u2019s \u201ctremendous skill and athleticism on the court,\u201d and said the president is also a fan of his off the court. \u201c[T]he president enjoys watching him play,\u201d Earnest continued. \u201cThe president also has had an opportunity to meet him personally a few times, and the president does consider him to be a fine young man who carries himself with the kind of professionalism that is really pretty impressive to see.\u201d\n\nObama, a major NBA fan, has met James multiple times, including during the Heat\u2019s two visits to the White House after winning back-to-back NBA championships. When the NBA star was last a free agent in 2010, Obama made an appeal for him to join the president\u2019s beloved Chicago Bulls. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to tamper,\u201d longtime Obama adviser David Axelrod said at the time, \u201cbut as a Chicago fan, the president thinks LeBron would look great in a Bulls uniform.\u201d\n\nJames has also pitched in politically for the president. The day before the 2012 presidential election, James tweeted his support for Obama\u2019s reelection, writing: \u201cThe President got more work to do, make sure you get out and vote tomorrow.\u201d Earlier this year, James starred in an administration advertisement to encourage Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Friday, Earnest offered some of his own thoughts, praising James\u2019s decision to return home to Ohio. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s made this decision I think is a testament to the kinds of values that he has incorporated into his life and that he says he\u2019s interested in instilling in his children,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s a pretty powerful statement about the value of a place that you consider home.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Press Secretary Josh Earnest says Obama enjoys watching LeBron James play.", "title": "Earnest: Obama LeBron's 'big fan'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/lebron-return-cleveland-obama-big-fan-108816.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110919_obama_lebron_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,LeBron James", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Press Secretary Josh Earnest says Obama enjoys watching LeBron James play.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefca\"", "article_summary": "Earnest: Obama LeBron's 'big fan'President Barack Obama is a \u201cbig fan\u201d of LeBron James and considers him to be \u201ca fine young man,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday.\nEarnest praised James\u2019s \u201ctremendous skill and athleticism on the court,\u201d and said the president is also a fan of his off the court.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t speak to him personally about it,\u201d Earnest said when asked at Friday\u2019s press briefing what Obama thought about the NBA superstar\u2019s decision to rejoin the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\u201cI know that the president is a big fan of Lebron\u2019s.\u201dStory Continued BelowJames on Friday announced he will return to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers, a decision he announced in a Sports Illustrated article published Friday.\nOn Friday, Earnest offered some of his own thoughts, praising James\u2019s decision to return home to Ohio."}
