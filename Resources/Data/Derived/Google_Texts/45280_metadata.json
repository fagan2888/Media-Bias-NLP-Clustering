But that\u2019s not holding her back \u2013 it\u2019s spurring her on.\n\nThe former CEO of Hewlett Packard, in fact, seems extra-motivated by Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s apparent march to the Democratic nomination \u2013 which, if she succeeds, would make her the first woman to win a major-party nomination in the United States.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary Clinton were to face a [Republican] female nominee, there are a whole set of things that she won\u2019t be able to talk about,\u201d Ms. Fiorina told reporters Thursday at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to talk about being the first woman president. She won\u2019t be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged. She won\u2019t be able to play the gender card.\u201d\n\nRecommended: 14 Republicans running in 2016\n\nInstead, says Fiorina, Mrs. Clinton will have to run on \u201cher track record, her accomplishments, her candor and trustworthiness, and her policies.\u201d\n\nFiorina dismisses the idea of \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d All issues are women\u2019s issues, she says \u2013 though \u201csometimes women see those issues differently.\"\n\nOn health care, \u201cmen tend to talk about overreach of government, and certainly those are issues I and other women care deeply about,\u201d Fiorina says. \u201cOn the other hand, women tend to focus more on access and choice. Will I still be able to go to my children\u2019s pediatrician? Will everyone have access to quality health care?\u201d\n\nAnd what about the social safety net? Single women tend to vote Democratic, in part because they are more reliant on government services than married women. Low-income single moms, in particular, often see the safety net as a lifeline.\n\nFrom Fiorina\u2019s perspective, the question is how those services are structured. She\u2019s met single women who want a life of \u201cdignity and purpose and meaning,\u201d but government creates the wrong incentives, she says.\n\n\u201cIf you are a single mom and you are on food stamps and you depend on those food stamps, we make it so hard for you to decide, \u2018You know what, I want to get a job where I can work 40 hours or 45 hours or 50 hours a week to try and pull myself and my family up,\u2019\u201d Fiorina says.\n\nSometimes, though, the numbers don\u2019t add up \u2013 especially when the cost of child care is factored in.\n\nFiorina agrees, then goes on: \u201cI must say, that I think there are many, many, many examples of liberals finding facts to support the government\u2019s overreach.\u201d\n\nObamacare is one example, she says, where the government caused the consolidation of an industry that ended up \u201cnot good for anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think the same is true of child care,\u201d Fiorina says. \u201cI mean everybody is getting ginned up to say the government needs to do all these things. I believe that the private sector demonstrably does many things better \u2013 not all things \u2013 but many things better.\u201d\n\nThough she has flown high in business \u2013 in 1999, becoming the first female CEO of a Fortune 20 company, HP, a position from which she was forced out in 2005 \u2013 Fiorina also makes clear that she has had life experiences that many people, many women, can relate to. She has overcome a diagnosis of breast cancer. She lost a stepdaughter to addiction.\n\nShe speaks of her early adult life as a secretary in a nine-person real-estate firm, typing and filing and answering phones. Two men in the office saw her potential and offered her the opportunity to learn about business.\n\n\u201cMy life took a different turn,\u201d says Fiorina, a graduate of Stanford University. \u201cMost people have far more potential than they realize.\u201d\n\nFiorina is taking that same approach to this next phase in her life. Women are underrepresented in political leadership, as in business, because they haven\u2019t realized their potential.\n\nThe data, she says, are clear. \u201cIf you get women involved in any problem \u2013 economic growth, poverty, disease, conflict resolution \u2026 the problem gets better.\u201d\n\nFiorina is not letting the fact that she\u2019s never held political office get in the way. She did win the Republican nomination for US Senate in California in 2010, but lost to incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer (D) in the general election. Senator Boxer is vacating her office at the end of this term, but Fiorina seems to have her eye on a different prize.\n\nFiorina holds out her corporate experience and advisory roles at the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, and State Department as an alternate path to the top of American government. She says voters see her as someone who \u201cunderstands economies and how the world works and technology and executive decisionmaking and what makes a bureaucracy go.\u201d\n\nAnd she thinks voters have had enough of politics as usual: \u201cMost Americans think that the professional political class isn\u2019t a particularly good invention.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "92f5a4f973c2606cc7bfa7d705b9d9c2", "sailthru.author": "Linda Feldmann", "description": "The former Hewlett Packard CEO said that a female Republican nominee would be a game-changer in the 2016 election, forcing Clinton to run exclusively on her record.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/04/0416-Carly-Fiorina.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "The former Hewlett Packard CEO said that a female Republican nominee would be a game-changer in the 2016 election, forcing Clinton to run exclusively on her record.", "title": "Carly Fiorina wants to take away Hillary Clinton's 'gender card'", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/monitor_breakfast/2015/0416/Carly-Fiorina-wants-to-take-away-Hillary-Clinton-s-gender-card", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/04/0416-Carly-Fiorina.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/04/0416-Carly-Fiorina.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "The former Hewlett Packard CEO said that a female Republican nominee would be a game-changer in the 2016 election, forcing Clinton to run exclusively on her record.", "card": "summary", "title": "Carly Fiorina wants to take away Hillary Clinton's 'gender card'"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-16", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-16T15:55:26-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/monitor_breakfast/2015/0416/Carly-Fiorina-wants-to-take-away-Hillary-Clinton-s-gender-card", "sailthru.tags": "section-the-monitor-breakfast,section-politics,section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "The Monitor Breakfast", "published_time": "2015-04-16T15:55-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Michael Bonfigli/The Christian Science Monitor"}, "article_summary": "Single women tend to vote Democratic, in part because they are more reliant on government services than married women.\nShe\u2019s met single women who want a life of \u201cdignity and purpose and meaning,\u201d but government creates the wrong incentives, she says.\n\u201cShe won\u2019t be able to talk about being the first woman president.\nShe won\u2019t be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged.\nOn health care, \u201cmen tend to talk about overreach of government, and certainly those are issues I and other women care deeply about,\u201d Fiorina says."}
