Peyton Manning had an NFL season passing yardage record to break, yet the Denver players couldn\u2019t stop raving about Marshall. Not the defensive players, mind you. It was the side of the ball Adam Gase coaches and Manning operates.\n\n\u201cOur offensive players loved him,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said of Marshall. \u201cHe was running around on the practice squad last year, and I finally said to the guys, \u2018Hey, we can\u2019t block this dude.\u2019 He\u2019s on scout team wrecking our offense.\n\n\u201cIn Oakland, I\u2019ve got offensive players \u2014 I won\u2019t mention names \u2014 chirping at me to get him into the game. That\u2019s what happens. They go against these guys every day. So some of these young guys make an impression. And players know players.\u201d\n\nIt was no ordinary journey that brought Marshall to what will be his first NFL start as the Broncos\u2019 weakside linebacker Sunday night against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFrom a \u201ctubby kid\u201d who blocked for a skinny running back named Quinton Carter with the Pop Warner Wolverines while growing up in Las Vegas, to a tweener college prospect who decommitted from Colorado State because he had a prescient feeling about coach Sonny Lubick\u2019s job security, to a young NFL player who was cut twice by the woebegone Jacksonville Jaguars, to a Broncos practice-squad player through the first 16 weeks of the 17-week 2013 season, Marshall has finally made it.\n\nHe is starting Denver\u2019s season opener because Danny Trevathan suffered a fractured leg three weeks ago in practice. But Marshall was in position as the next man up because of his week-in and week-out performance on the Broncos\u2019 practice squad last year.\n\nLet that be a lesson, Shaquil Barrett.\n\n\u201cAt first it was sort of surreal how things went down,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThere was a time during the Philadelphia Eagles game. I was on the sidelines in my jump suit and Coach Fox comes up to me and says, \u2018Keep working. You\u2019re going to get your opportunity.\u2019\n\n\u201cI thought that was big, because I\u2019m a practice-squad player and he has a game to coach. That he took the time to give me some encouragement \u2014 that stood out to me. That kept my hope alive.\u201d\n\nThe Denver players on the field went up 52-13 on the Eagles. They didn\u2019t need Fox anymore. He turned and found somebody else to coach.\n\nCSU loses out\n\nLas Vegas has placed 5-1 odds on Denver winning the Super Bowl this season, and could have made its native son a far greater underdog of ever playing for the team.\n\nAfter Marshall\u2019s parents separated, Dad didn\u2019t handled it well. For a time, Barbara Marshall had to take Brandon and his older brother Marcus to a Las Vegas shelter to hide from her abusive ex-husband.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him since we were knee high and watched him overcome all kinds of adversity from family and personal to sports his entire life,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThat he made it to where he is today doesn\u2019t surprise me. The kind of guy he is, he\u2019s going hard on every play. If the guy on the other side isn\u2019t going hard on a play, he\u2019ll be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn high school, Marshall played tight end, running back and linebacker. He received only two college offers, and hometown UNLV wasn\u2019t one. A coach there said Marshall wasn\u2019t a tight end or a running back or a linebacker.\n\nLubick, however, saw an athlete. And for a while, he had Marshall coming to Fort Collins.\n\n\u201cSonny\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason I committed there. But I felt like he wasn\u2019t going to be there long, and I decommitted. My feeling was right.\u201d\n\nMarshall enrolled at Nevada and, after his redshirt freshman year, Lubick was fired at CSU. Marshall wound up being a four-year starter for the Wolf Pack, and he played well enough to become a fifth-round draft pick of the Jaguars.\n\nBut two coaching changes in two years put Marshall on the NFL waiver wire twice during that time.\n\nThe Broncos rescued him about this time last year by signing him to their practice squad. Marshall took it from there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come a long, long way, but Brandon always had a little swag about him,\u201d said Broncos tight end Virgil Green, who was one year ahead of Marshall at Nevada. \u201cHe never really looked wide-eyed. Even his freshman year, we had a pretty good linebacker corps at Nevada and he always found a way to make plays and get things done.\u201d\n\nIn that game at Oakland to end the 2013 regular season? Late in the fourth quarter of the Broncos\u2019 blowout win, Marshall went in and chased down Rashad Jennings for his first NFL tackle.\n\nMore tackles are expected Sunday against the Colts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an opportunity to establish myself in the league,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cPeople can see me starting. If I can establish myself as a starting linebacker, then I should get a lot of years out of the NFL.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall ready to make his first NFL start", "title": "Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall ready to make his first NFL start", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/01/broncos-linebacker-brandon-marshall-ready-to-make-his-first-nfl-start/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__Brandon-Marshallp1-1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__Brandon-Marshallp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01T21:07:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:28:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2185\"", "article_summary": "Peyton Manning had an NFL season passing yardage record to break, yet the Denver players couldn\u2019t stop raving about Marshall.\nBut Marshall was in position as the next man up because of his week-in and week-out performance on the Broncos\u2019 practice squad last year.\n\u201cOur offensive players loved him,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said of Marshall.\nThere was one half-serious regular-season game remaining for the Broncos to play in 2013 when the conversation turned to, of all people, linebacker Brandon Marshall.\nAnd players know players.\u201dIt was no ordinary journey that brought Marshall to what will be his first NFL start as the Broncos\u2019 weakside linebacker Sunday night against the Indianapolis Colts."}
