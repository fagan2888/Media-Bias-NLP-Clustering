A rejection by California \u2014 given the state\u2019s huge market \u2014 could jeopardize the acquisition altogether.\n\nEyes are now on Jones, who plans to run for state attorney general in 2018. Last week he said the Centene-Health Net deal could enhance competition in California. Centene currently has almost no market share in California but does have financial stability from its out-of-state business, so it would bring an infusion of \u201cnew capital and new resources\u201d to take over Health Net and take on market share leaders.\n\nMore than three-quarters of the private insurance market in California now belongs to Kaiser Permanente (42 percent), Anthem Blue Cross (20 percent) and Blue Shield of California (15 percent). Centene\u2019s acquisition of Health Net, the fourth-largest insurer in the state (6 percent), could help it compete with the Big Three, Jones said. In the case of Anthem, though, that logic would work against it, because merger approval would mean one of the Big Three would just get more powerful, according to Shana Charles, health policy professor at California State University Fullerton.\n\n\u201cFor the regulators, the big question is whether or not a merger would make the market more competitive,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause Anthem is so big in California, that\u2019s going to be a big concern.\u201d\n\nJones has fashioned himself as a consumer advocate challenging the power of big insurers. \u201cHe has consistently played that role,\u201d Charles said. \u201cSo really, this is a perfect opportunity for him.\u201d\n\nSeveral factors weigh against the Anthem/Cigna and Aetna/Humana deals, consumer advocates said.\n\n\u201cFor the Anthem/Cigna deal, there is overlap in market share, and that wasn\u2019t the case with Centene,\u201d said Tam Ma, attorney for the Sacramento-based advocacy nonprofit Health Access California. Since Cigna and Anthem compete for subscribers, Ma said the Anthem deal would reduce health insurance competition in 31 counties in California.\n\nAnd, Ma said, Anthem has a history of dramatically hiking premium rates, even after state regulators have deemed them unreasonable. Add in a high number of consumer complaints, a question about whether they contract with enough doctors, low quality ratings and Anthem\u2019s major data breach last year, and you get a volatile mixture that defies merger approval, she said. \u201cThe big concern is, if they get bigger, are these problems going to get bigger?\u201d\n\nIn a prepared statement, Anthem spokesman Darrel Ng said Anthem and Cigna have limited overlap and combined will be in a better position to improve consumer choice and quality as well as preserve affordability.\n\n\u201cExpanding access to affordable health coverage is the foundation of our combination with Cigna and will remain Anthem\u2019s top priority,\u201d Ng said.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to work with the Department of Justice and appropriate state regulators, and are confident that our proposed merger is being reviewed based on these facts.\u201d\n\nAn outright rejection could sink the deal. That could send shockwaves through the stock market and raise questions about California\u2019s attitude toward business. Health care systems around the country are combining, claiming financial necessity. Insurers say they need to combine, too, to maintain negotiating clout.\n\nInstead of blocking the deal, regulators could approve it with conditions.\n\nOne of Jones\u2019 predecessors, John Garamendi, did both. In 2004, he rejected Anthem\u2019s proposed merger with competitor Wellpoint. Anthem sued him. Garamendi later approved the deal, but got the company to pay $265 million toward various health projects in California, double those in the original agreement.\n\nApproval in California isn\u2019t Anthem\u2019s only worry. Federal antitrust officials have yet to weigh in. It\u2019s unclear who will render judgment on the deal first, them or Jones.\n\nThe hearing Tuesday is in San Francisco. The insurance department said it will soon hold hearings on another huge health industry deal, Aetna\u2019s proposed $37 million acquisition of Humana. The Department of Managed Health Care has already held its hearings on both mergers, but has not issued a timeframe for any decision.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anthem\u2019s proposed $54 billion acquisition of Cigna will soon undergo public review by the California Department of Insurance.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Proposed Anthem-Cigna Merger Under Scrutiny in California\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/28\\/proposed-anthem-cigna-merger-under-scrutiny-in-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-28 12:22:41\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-04-05 14:15:28\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":165532,\"author_id\":\"11105\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Fine\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Fine\",\"tags\":[\"Anthem\",\"Cigna\",\"Merger\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Insurance\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/GettyImages-96525183-e1437746938599.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Anthem\u2019s proposed $54 billion acquisition of Cigna will soon undergo public review by the California Department of Insurance.", "title": "Proposed Anthem-Cigna Merger Under Scrutiny in California", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/28/proposed-anthem-cigna-merger-under-scrutiny-in-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/GettyImages-96525183-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "anthem,cigna,merger,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a39\"", "article_summary": "Last week, state regulators signed off on Centene\u2019s $7 billion purchase of fellow health insurer Health Net.\nSince Cigna and Anthem compete for subscribers, Ma said the Anthem deal would reduce health insurance competition in 31 counties in California.\nAnd, Ma said, Anthem has a history of dramatically hiking premium rates, even after state regulators have deemed them unreasonable.\n\u201cFor the regulators, the big question is whether or not a merger would make the market more competitive,\u201d she said.\nThe insurance department said it will soon hold hearings on another huge health industry deal, Aetna\u2019s proposed $37 million acquisition of Humana."}
