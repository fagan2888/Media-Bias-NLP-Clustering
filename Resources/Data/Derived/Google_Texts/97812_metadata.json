Republicans are trying to take private employer based health insurance away from one million Americans. House Republicans tried this same move in February 2014, and the impact on healthcare was spelled out by the CBO.\n\nThe CBO concluded,\n\nRepublicans have mastered the art of making legislation that would harm average Americans sound beneficial. McConnell and Boehner aren\u2019t going to come straight out and say that their aim is to make sure that fewer people have health insurance, but that is their intention.\n\nCongressional Republicans know that they can\u2019t repeal the ACA, so they are going to try to chip away at the edges of the law in order takeaway health insurance from as many people as possible.\n\nDuring his press conference yesterday, President Obama made it clear that he will veto any legislation that took health insurance away from the American people.\n\nIt took Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. John Boehner one day to show the American people what this Republican Congress will have in store for them.\n\nPresident Obama better get his veto pen warmed up, because, by the looks of things, it is going to be a very busy two years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have announced that one of the first things that the new Republican controlled Congress will do it take away health insurance from 1 million Americans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have announced that one of the first things that the new Republican controlled Congress will do it take away health insurance from 1 million Americans.", "title": "McConnell and Boehner Announce Plan to Take Health Insurance Away From 1 Million Americans", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/11/06/mcconnell-boehner-announce-plan-health-insurance-1-million-americans.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mcconnell-boehner-worried.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-06T14:34:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,ACA,John Boehner,mitch mcconnell,Obamacare,republican controlled congress to take away obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-11-06T14:34:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T14:34:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, John Boehner, mitch mcconnell, Obamacare, republican controlled congress to take away obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd59\"", "article_summary": "Republicans are trying to take private employer based health insurance away from one million Americans.\nMitch McConnell and John Boehner have announced that one of the first things that the new Republican controlled Congress will do it take away health insurance from 1 million Americans.\nDuring his press conference yesterday, President Obama made it clear that he will veto any legislation that took health insurance away from the American people.\nMcConnell and Boehner aren\u2019t going to come straight out and say that their aim is to make sure that fewer people have health insurance, but that is their intention.\nIt took Sen.
