I think she finds that a little bit too constricting for her.\u201d\n\n\n\nCoyne adds that he\u2019s still open to working with Kesha. \u201cI think my relationship with Kesha is the same as it\u2019s always been \u2014 when you wanna do something, let\u2019s fucking get together and we\u2019ll do it and we\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d he says.\n\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne no doubt has some interesting stories to tell about hanging out with his new buddy Miley Cyrus, but \u201cthe craziest ones I\u2019m not allowed to really speak about,\u201d he tells Billboard at this year\u2019s Bonnaroo.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: The Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne Dishes Working With Miley Cyrus & Kesha (Video)", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121417/bonnaroo-2014-the-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne-dishes-on-miley-cyrus-kesha-ke$ha", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/bonnaroo-2014-wayne-coyne-flaming-lips-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne no doubt has some interesting stories to tell about hanging out with his new buddy Miley Cyrus, but \u201cthe craziest ones I\u2019m not allowed to really speak about,\u201d he tells Billboard at this year\u2019s Bonnaroo.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: The Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne Dishes Working With Miley Cyrus & Kesha (Video)", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121417/bonnaroo-2014-the-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne-dishes-on-miley-cyrus-kesha-ke$ha", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/bonnaroo-2014-wayne-coyne-flaming-lips-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne no doubt has some interesting stories to tell about hanging out with his new buddy Miley Cyrus, but \u201cthe craziest ones I\u2019m not allowed to really speak about,\u201d he tells Billboard at this year\u2019s Bonnaroo.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: The Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne Dishes Working With Miley Cyrus & Kesha (Video) | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd57d9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think she\u2019s in like a production deal, I guess, with Dr. Luke.\nFlaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne no doubt has some interesting stories to tell about hanging out with his new buddy Miley Cyrus, but \u201cthe craziest ones I\u2019m not allowed to really speak about,\u201d he tells Billboard at this year\u2019s Bonnaroo.\nBut Coyne says his relationship with Kesha is \u201ca little more complicated.\u201d Coyne and Kesha had been working on a full-length album together following the pop star\u2019s contribution to the veteran psych-rock band's \"The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends\" collection.\nI think she finds that a little bit too constricting for her.\u201dCoyne adds that he\u2019s still open to working with Kesha.\nBonnaroo 2014 Full Coverage: Photos, Video & MoreCoyne and Cyrus recently came together to perform a cover of the Beatles' \"Lucy In The Sky of Diamonds\" with Miley Cyrus at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards."}
