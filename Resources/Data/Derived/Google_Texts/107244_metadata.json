But, he added, that is not likely to be his approach.\n\nBeyond the Senate Budget Committee, the House\u2019s plans will immediately test the skills of the prospective Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in balancing conservatives against moderate Republicans like Susan Collins of Maine and Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic states.\n\nFor his part, President Obama has other plans. The deficit has fallen from $1.4 trillion in 2009 \u2014 or nearly 10 percent of the economy then \u2014 to $483 billion, or 2.8 percent of the economy, in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Measured against the economy, the deficit is now below the average over the last 40 years, and as long as the debt continues to fall relative to the economy, Mr. Obama appears to be more concerned about other economic matters.\n\nThe White House is sticking to its principle that any deficit reduction has to include tax increases to soften budget cuts, and that no belt-tightening should be undertaken that would jeopardize the economic growth just now picking up momentum.\n\nThe president\u2019s real economic policy emphasis will be a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code to free up revenues for long-term spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. Mr. Van Hollen said Democrats would not bend in their opposition to spending cuts that they say would be largely used to cut taxes for the rich.\n\nAnd, Mr. Van Hollen said, those arguments will have resonance once Americans realize the fight has moved from symbolic to real.\n\nThe Ryan budget faced a vote in the Senate in 2013, and five Republicans voted against it: Ms. Collins; Dean Heller, a moderate-leaning Nevadan; Mike Lee of Utah; Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Ted Cruz of Texas, who saw the plan as too timid. It failed on an advisory vote, 40 to 59.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the other hand, four Republican newcomers to the Senate \u2014 Representatives Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Steve Daines of Montana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2014 are already on the record supporting the Ryan approach, with a fifth, Representative Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, in a runoff for the last outstanding Senate seat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a strong commitment to get a budget done for no other reason than they\u2019ve made such a big deal about the other side failing,\u201d said Hazen Marshall, a former Senate Budget Committee staff director who has been consulting with the incoming committee leadership. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be easy. At the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to get a majority.\u201d\n\nThe budget, one of Congress\u2019s first orders of business, sets top-line spending limits, with advisory policy details. But it has one powerful mechanism, a parliamentary procedure called reconciliation that shields legislation from a Senate filibuster.\n\nIn 2012, the House budget ordered six committees to produce policy changes that would save $261 billion over 10 years to avert automatic spending cuts at the Pentagon. The results would have pushed 1.8 million people off food stamps and cost 280,000 children their school lunch subsidies and 300,000 children their health insurance coverage.\n\nElimination of the social services block grant to state and local governments would hit child abuse prevention programs, Meals on Wheels and child care.\n\nA quarter of the cuts in the bill would come from programs for the poor. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized insurance premiums under the health care law made up more than a third of the package\u2019s savings.\n\nHad the Senate gone along with the budget plan that ordered those cuts, the resulting bills could not have been filibustered by opponents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Johnson said the parliamentary tactic will be used next year. The question is how. Republicans could again use it to push through budget cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, or they could use it to advance changes to the tax code that cut revenue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very heightened focus on, \u2018The dog caught the bus. Now what are we going to do?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nMr. Van Hollen said Republicans would have little choice but to push ahead with past budget plans. To do otherwise would indicate that earlier efforts were politics, not policy priorities.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t say now that they have the power to implement those budgets, they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nChris Chocola, the president of Club for Growth, a political action committee that bankrolled many of the Republican campaigns, pointed to the tax cuts of Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas and the confrontations that Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan had with his state\u2019s public employee unions as models for the Republican Congress. Mr. Brownback is now dealing with budget deficits, but Mr. Chocola noted that the governor was re-elected.\n\nThat is all well and good, said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, but even with the tool of reconciliation, congressional Republicans will face President Obama\u2019s veto pen.\n\n\u201cIf we need reconciliation instructions to pass it in the Senate, the chances the president would sign it into law are not very good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141112053006, "twitter": {"description": "Congressional Republicans have plans to transform Medicare and Medicaid and to cut taxes for high earners, measures once out of reach with Democrats controlling the Senate.", "title": "In Control, Republican Lawmakers See Budget as Way to Push Agenda", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/us/politics/in-control-republicans-see-budget-as-way-to-push-agenda.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003229255"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/us/politics/in-control-republicans-see-budget-as-way-to-push-agenda.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003229255", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/us/politics/in-control-republicans-see-budget-as-way-to-push-agenda.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 12, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "United States,Federal Budget (US),Medicaid,Medicare,United States Politics and Government,Income Tax,Midterm Elections (2014),House of Representatives,Senate,Congress", "news_keywords": "Medicaid,Medicare,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jonathan Weisman", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By JONATHAN WEISMAN", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Congressional Republicans have plans to transform Medicare and Medicaid and to cut taxes for high earners, measures once out of reach with Democrats controlling the Senate.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Congressional Republicans have plans to transform Medicare and Medicaid and to cut taxes for high earners, measures once out of reach with Democrats controlling the Senate.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 12, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/jonathan_weisman/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-11-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Senate", "published": "2014-11-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "United States", "slug": "13budget", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141113152551, "hdl_p": "In Control, Republican Lawmakers See Budget as Way to Push Agenda", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/us/politics/in-control-republicans-see-budget-as-way-to-push-agenda.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Congressional Republicans have plans to transform Medicare and Medicaid and to cut taxes for high earners, measures once out of reach with Democrats controlling the Senate.", "title": "In Control, Republican Lawmakers See Budget as Way to Push Agenda"}, "pdate": 20141112, "des": "Midterm Elections (2014)", "articleid": 100000003229255, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "In Control, Republican Lawmakers See Budget as Way to Push Agenda", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd238d\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Van Hollen said Republicans would have little choice but to push ahead with past budget plans.\nMr. Brownback is now dealing with budget deficits, but Mr. Chocola noted that the governor was re-elected.\nIn 2012, the House budget ordered six committees to produce policy changes that would save $261 billion over 10 years to avert automatic spending cuts at the Pentagon.\nMr. Van Hollen said Democrats would not bend in their opposition to spending cuts that they say would be largely used to cut taxes for the rich.\nChris Chocola, the president of Club for Growth, a political action committee that bankrolled many of the Republican campaigns, pointed to the tax cuts of Gov."}
