Tom Latham\u2019s seat did not name or criticize one another and instead played up their strengths: he, his toughness and she, her womanhood.\n\nYoung, a former chief of staff to retiring Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, promised stronger oversight of the federal government, if he\u2019s elected. \u201cI will be a taxpayer watchdog for Iowa,\u201d he pledged to the crowd on Wednesday, calling for a flat tax. \u201cWe have almost an $18 trillion dollar budget debt. Isn\u2019t that astounding? I can hardly quantify that. We have to change the way we budget in Washington. They have to balance their budgets.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemocrat Appel, meanwhile, played up the historic nature of her candidacy: She would be the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a woman\u2019s voice in Congress that represents the State of Iowa?\u201d she asked, to the loudest cheers of her speech. \u201cYou have to sit down and listen to folks to get things done and that\u2019s what we\u2019re missing in Congress right now. Nobody\u2019s talking to each other. The gridlock is there and it\u2019s not going to stop until we send different people up there to get things done.\u201d\n\nThe message resonated with the mostly female crowd, many who were sporting Staci Appel t-shirts. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the women of the Senate, getting together and having dinner every two weeks, they get stuff done,\u201d says Rita Davis, a Des Moines Democrat. \u201cWomen get stuff done. I mean, not all women, but Staci is definitely one of those who does.\u201d\n\nAppel fits to a T the Democrats\u2019 midterm strategy of appealing to unmarried women in midterm election that otherwise has them on their heels due to President Obama\u2019s unpopularity. Unmarried women are reliably Democrat, though they tend not to turn out in off presidential years.\n\nYoung pointedly criticized Obamacare and what he called the President\u2019s foot-dragging in approving the Keystone Pipeline, which Republicans say will create thousands of jobs if the Administration overcomes environmental concerns and allows it to go through.\n\nDemocrats view the seat, which encompasses most of Des Moines, as one of their few pick up opportunities. The district is a race swing seat and is rated a \u201ctoss up\u201d by Cook Political Report, which tracks congressional races.\n\nAppel, the former assistant majority leader in the State Senate, has a good personal narrative. She has six children and pushed through legislation to mandate equal pay for women, ban smoking in public buildings and to expand pre-school. Two of her own children benefited from that last bill, and Appel isn\u2019t shy about talking about the effect of policy on her family, personalizing the race in a way that is often appealing to women.\n\nIowa Republicans have done their best to tie her to an unpopular president and an even more unpopular\u2014in Iowa\u2014House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cStaci Appel will be the chief lieutenant of Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat leading congressional liberals,\u201d says Jeff Patch, communications director for the Iowa Republican Party. \u201cAppel\u2019s extreme ideas do not fit this district,\u201d Patch says.\n\nAppel\u2019s campaign has tried to paint Young as a Washington insider, something that might be tough given that his biggest political association is with Grassley, a man who established his reputation as a tough investigator of the federal government and remains popular in Iowa despite his long tenure in Washington.\n\nAppel has so far raised $1.2 million and had $726,000 cash on hand at the end of June, according to Federal Election Commission filings. That\u2019s compared to Young whose raised $828,000 but given a six way primary, he ended June with only $88,000 cash on hand. Young had a six way GOP primary in which he placed fifth, but won the nomination at the state convention\u2014welcome to Iowa\u2019s arcane politics\u2014to the criticism of some that his insider status with Grassley\u2019s formidable machine unfairly greased the party\u2019s wheels.\n\nYoung has also stumbled on organization.
