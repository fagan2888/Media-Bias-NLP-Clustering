Instead, what net neutrality preserves is the anti-right of an ISP to tell No You Can\u2019t.\n\nSen. Cruz also riffs on the idea that net neutrality is a scrap between large companies, and their lobbying armies. That\u2019s actually somewhat true, but to only paint the issue in those terms is to miss the larger point, which deals with smaller companies. Net neutrality matters because it creates the market conditions that allow new companies to come into existence that may challenge the very sniping giants that Sen. Cruz wants to dismiss as, roughly, commensurate.\n\nThe segment is not all negative, in fact. Senator Cruz points out that he is a cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act in the Senate.\n\nHere\u2019s the clip:\n\nFeatured Image: Gage Skidmore/Flickr UNDER A CC BY-SA 2.0 LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/alex-wilhelm/\" title=\"Posts by Alex Wilhelm\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Alex Wilhelm</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex\" rel=\"external\">@alex</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "p": {"domain_verify": "6189ff68ce30e30f12b40b3b40873027"}, "twitter": {"description": "The good Senator Ted Cruz from Texas tackled net neutrality again today, with a bit more tact than earlier this week when he called it \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately\u2026", "title": "Senator Ted Cruz Dishes Once Again On That \u2018Net\u2026", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/14/ted-cruz-round-two-with-dramatic-pauses/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/cruz.png?w=764&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "The good Senator Ted Cruz from Texas tackled net neutrality again today, with a bit more tact than earlier this week when he called it \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear at that point what the connection between the Affordable Care Act and the preservation of the open Internet was, precisely, but the comment did cause a stir.\nToday, at a Texas incubator in Austin, Sen.", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "sailthru.tags": "net neutrality, Ted Cruz", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://techcrunch.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d9ea925a71f82f06a1e6224298f7fe80?s=16", "category": "TC", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Alex Wilhelm", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-14 17:31:30", "sailthru.title": "Senator Ted Cruz Dishes Once Again On That \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019 Thing", "content": "The good Senator Ted Cruz from Texas tackled net neutrality again today, with a bit more tact than earlier this week when he called it \"Obamacare for the Internet.\" It wasn't immediately clear at that point what the connection between the Affordable Care Act and the preservation of the open Internet was, precisely, but the comment did cause a stir.
