A productive Congress and Hillary running\n\nKarl Rove is predicting that 2015 will be the \u201cmost productive period\u201d in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see the most productive period of sustained bipartisan legislation that we\u2019ve seen in a long while,\u201d Rove said Thursday on Fox News.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe conservative, who annually offers his political predictions for the year, said the \u201cmost interesting\u201d developments in the Capitol will come out of the newly Republican-controlled legislative branch.\n\n\u201cI think the Republicans are going to send the president a steady stream of bills throughout the year that have bipartisan support,\u201d Rove said.\n\nBut while Republicans may steadily pump out bills in the 114th Congress, he questions what will happen once they reach the president\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether or not the president is going to sign those bills,\u201d Rove said. \u201cIf he vetoes a lot of them, after a while, it\u2019s going to work against the Democrats.\u201d\n\nWhen focusing his sights on the White House, Rove predicts that, much like the bills coming out of Congress, a stream of Republican presidential contenders may surface this year, but many may not come to fruition.\n\n\u201cWe are going to find out a lot of Republican presidential candidates either don\u2019t get into the race or get into the race and don\u2019t go very far because of the challenge of raising money,\u201d Rove said, pointing out the $88 million price tag on former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s race.\n\nOn the Democratic side: \u201cHillary Clinton is going to run, Elizabeth Warren will not. After flirting with it, I don\u2019t think Joe Biden is going to run, although we certainly will hear a lot from him in the way of continuing gaffes.\u201d\n\nRove looked back on his 2014 predictions in a Wall Street Journal article published Wednesday. Thirteen were correct, but he was wrong on six, including his prediction that Republicans would lose governorships and that Kathleen Sebelius would stay in her post as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Republican operative expects a period of &quot;sustained bipartisan legislation.&quot;", "title": "Rove's 2015 predictions?
