â€” Cary police were searching Tuesday afternoon for a man they say robbed a Wells Fargo branch on Harrison Avenue.

Authorities say a man wearing a black jacket and sunglasses went into the bank, at 1701 N. Harrison Ave., at about 11:45 a.m. and demanded money.

The man told bank employees he had a weapon, but he never showed it, police said.

The man left the area on foot with an unknown amount of money.

No other information about the robbery has been released.
