In all, the federal government estimated the penalties would total $373 million.\n\n\n\nHHS assessed 63 hospitals in New Jersey. A complete list can be found at the HHS Hospital Compare website, www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare.\n\n\n\nCapital Health Medical Center in Hopewell was the only New Jersey facility to hit the lowest possible score of 10.\n\n\n\nSpokeswoman Jayne O\u2019Connor said that despite CMS\u2019 accounting for hospitals that take on the sickest patients, such measurements of quality are going to fall hardest on places like Capital Health.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the hospitals receiving penalties are those, like Capital Health, that provide tertiary level care to the sickest of patients \u2014 those who require the most intensive care,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Connor said Capital Health has been aware of the threat of the 1 percent penalty, which will cost it about $500,000. The financial hit will be \u201cdifficult,\u201d she said, adding that Capital Health already has undertaken safety initiatives that have demonstrated significant improvement.\n\n\n\nRobert Wood Johnson University Hospital officials did not say how much it would be penalized, but that it would not cut services.\n\n\n\nThe network has taken steps to improve, and results show in a reduction of more than 40 percent in central line infections at the New Brunswick campus and enhanced safety measures for catheters and intravenous lines at Somerset, said spokesman Peter Haigney.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do support efforts like this to increase transparency,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nNext-to-last on the list of penalized facilities was University Hospital in Newark, with a score of 9.675. A representative declined to comment.\n\n\n\nOverlook Medical Center in Summit scored 8.7 and was penalized, but other measures showed it performing at a high level, noted spokeswoman Janina Hecht. She cited its award as a U.S. News and World Report top regional performer in four specialties.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe remain steadfast in our commitment to providing the highest level of safety and quality to every patient at our medical center,\u201d said Hecht.\n\n\n\nAtlantic Health System, which operates Overlook, also saw its Chilton Medical Center in Pompton Plains penalized. Two other Atlantic Health facilities, Morristown Medical Center and Newton Medical Center, were not.\n\n\n\nOther hospitals contacted by NJ Advance Media did not respond to questions about the penalties or declined to comment.\n\n\n\nTo calculate the penalties, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services looked at a facility\u2019s rate of infections involving catheters inserted into veins or bladders and eight quality measurements including post-operative hip fractures, pulmonary embolisms and serious blood clots in the legs. It then combined the weighted scores and penalized those in the lowest quarter.\n\n\n\nState and national hospital representatives said CMS\u2019 methodology was flawed.\n\n\n\n\u201cA hospital can make big strides in reducing hospital acquired conditions, as our hospitals in New Jersey have, and still be penalized under this methodology,\u201d said Kerry McKean Kelly, vice president of communications and member services for the New Jersey Hospital Association.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the American Hospital Association wrote CMS, making the same argument.\n\n\n\nFor example, the association contends hospitals should be scored on their total population at risk for infection, as opposed to the volume of central lines or catheters, because many hospital infection reduction efforts \u201ccorrectly focus on reducing the use of unnecessary central lines and urinary catheters,\u201d wrote Linda E. Fishman senior vice president.\n\n\n\nBy not considering the reduction in the use of catheters, a hospital\u2019s infection rates could appear to remain steady because the number of days patients are on central lines and catheters falls too, she said.\n\n\n\nEven with the penalties on 722 hospitals, the federal government says the industry is doing a better job at keeping patients safer while they\u2019re admitted.\n\n\n\nIn a research brief released earlier this month, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \u2013 a separate division of the department that issued the penalties \u2013 said hospital care is getting safer.\n\n\n\nAccording to the agency, the estimated rate of \u201charms\u201d experienced by in-patients fell by 17 percent between 2010 and 2013. That saved about 50,000 lives and nearly $12 billion in health care costs, the agency said.\n\n\n\nThis is not the only effort under Obamacare to curb health care spending by penalizing errors. HHS cut payments to more than 2,100 hospitals nationwide this year that had too many patients readmitted within a month after their discharge from a hospital.\n\n\n\nThat program, in its third year, cost hospitals a total of $428 million, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Darragh may be reached at tdarragh@njadvancemedia.com.
