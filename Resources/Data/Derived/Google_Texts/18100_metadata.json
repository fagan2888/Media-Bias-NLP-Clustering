I am the mother of two boys,\u201d said Domahidy, 37, who is the director of clinics for Centennial-based Project C.U.R.E.\n\nOn Tuesday, Domahidy was back at the nonprofit\u2019s warehouse in Centennial, helping load a container of medical supplies for Sierra Leone, where health workers have been battling the virus for six months.\n\nIn Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the virus has been most widespread, the disease killed 2,288 people as of Saturday, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe shipping container bound for Sierra Leone holds disposable gowns, masks, boots, duct tape and other materials to protect health workers treating the victims.\n\nMedical facilities in the countries where the virus is raging are crude and underequipped, said Domahidy, who helps to set up mobile clinics and does other work for the aid organization.\n\nWhile in a rural area of Congo, where Ebola has not been reported, she saw a disposable gown that Project C.U.R.E. had delivered a year ago drying after being washed. \u201cThese clinics are underserved and have nothing. They were washing and reusing disposable gowns and gloves,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause of the danger of transmission, the gowns, gloves and other protective gear are supposed to be disposed of after being worn. \u201cThey want to do good work and save lives, but they don\u2019t have the equipment and supplies,\u201d she said.\n\nOne hundred volunteers from Valor Christian High School in Highlands Ranch helped to sort materials bound for Sierra Leone.\n\n\u201cI think it is really cool that I\u2019m touching something that is going to save somebody\u2019s life,\u201d said Mia McLaughlin, a 15-year-old sophomore.\n\nThe container, which will travel by freighter, is expected to take 30 to 45 days to arrive in Sierra Leone and be unloaded, said Jan Mazotti, spokeswoman for Project C.U.R.E., which works in 132 countries.\n\nThe container will leave Centennial on Wednesday.\n\nDomahidy will go to Tanzania the next time she leaves the country in two weeks for a different project.\n\nProject C.U.R.E. works with partners who unload and distribute the supplies in countries where there are deadly outbreaks. It doesn\u2019t send personnel into those countries.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Centennial charity sends medical aid supplies to fight Ebola", "title": "Centennial charity sends medical aid supplies to fight Ebola", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/09/centennial-charity-sends-medical-aid-supplies-to-fight-ebola/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140909__ebola-supplies-charityp1.jpg", "height": 487}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140909__ebola-supplies-charityp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-09T14:19:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:57:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5d5\"", "article_summary": "One hundred volunteers from Valor Christian High School in Highlands Ranch helped to sort materials bound for Sierra Leone.\nThey were washing and reusing disposable gowns and gloves,\u201d she said.\nThe shipping container bound for Sierra Leone holds disposable gowns, masks, boots, duct tape and other materials to protect health workers treating the victims.\nOn Tuesday, Domahidy was back at the nonprofit\u2019s warehouse in Centennial, helping load a container of medical supplies for Sierra Leone, where health workers have been battling the virus for six months.\nCorinne Domahidy was in the Democratic Republic of Congo when the deadly Ebola virus was reported in the country last month."}
