A federal appeals court has upheld a trial ruling that requires taxpayers to pay for a murderer’s sex change. From the FNN story:

A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a judge’s ruling granting a taxpayer-funded sex change operation for a transgender inmate serving a life sentence for a murder conviction, saying receiving medically necessary treatment is a constitutional right that must be protected “even if that treatment strikes some as odd or unorthodox.”

This probably means that Bradley Manning will eventually win his claim that becoming Chelsea Manning is a civil right.

People who predicted that Obamacare and health insurance would soon be paying for sex change surgeries were once laughed at. But if sex change surgery is medically necessary–rather than elective–under the law, I don’t see how Obamacare won’t cover it.

Meanwhile, in California, a new law essentially states that every gay person in the state is entitled to group health insurance coverage for fertility treatments if they want a baby. They may be biologically fertile, but are considered infertile because they don’t want heterosexual intercourse.

Straights, in contrast, have to demonstrate actual infertility to be entitled to mandatory group health insurance coverage for infertility.

Our medical priorities are shifting from being concerned foremost with saving or extending life, to facilitating fulfilling lives as determined by the patient’s internal narrative.

In the UK, for example, a 42-year-old woman is entitled to free IVF on the NHS despite inability to conceive at that age often having to do with natural body rhythms. At the same time, some terminal cancer patients are denied chemotherapy that can extend life for months, meaning they die earlier than they otherwise would.

That kind of thing is coming here, too. Heck, it’s here already!
