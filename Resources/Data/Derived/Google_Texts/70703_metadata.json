We must use any means possible to repeal, defund and ultimately stop Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMace continued, \u201cPublic support for this law is falling through the floor, and working people and small businesses alike are searching for relief from Obamacare. With numerous exemptions and waivers granted by this administration it is clear, even the most ardent proponents of Obamacare understand it is deeply flawed.\n\nI believe defunding Obamacare, and ultimately repealing this bill is not only the best option, but the only option legislators have to address this policy before it imposes even more damage on our healthcare system and the greater economy.\u201d\n\nMace added, \u201cWe need market-based reforms that would empower individuals and allow broader choices across state lines for health insurance options.
