But I was gratified by the show of intolerance because it perfectly illustrated my argument that the Left is entering a new phase of ideological agitation \u2014 no longer trying to win the debate but stopping debate altogether, banishing from public discourse any and all opposition.\n\nThe proper word for that attitude is totalitarian.
