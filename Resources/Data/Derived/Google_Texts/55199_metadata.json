The theme for NLAAD 2014 is To End AIDS, Commit to Act \u2013 Para Acabar con el SIDA, Comprometete a Actuar. Tony Ochoa, Program Manager for NLAAD at LCOA has said: \u201cWhen delivering HIV/AIDS awareness or general messages, it is critical to assess how the communities we are trying to reach are communicating. To increase HIV/AIDS awareness among Latinos, social media platforms are no longer just an option but necessary.\u201d\n\nThe NLAAD website has many online resources to view and share. You can find an event near you or learn where to get an HIV test. The site features PSAs, videos, event photos, and podcasts that are also shared on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. In addition, you can visit the AIDS.gov NLAAD page for resources to support your online communications about the impact of HIV within Latino communities.\n\nHow Latinos are Using the Internet\n\nIn 2013, the Pew Hispanic Center reported that the \u201cdigital divide\u201d between Latinos and other ethnic groups is closing. Pew surveys indicated that 76% of Latino Internet users use a cell phone, tablet, or other mobile handheld device to connect, at least occasionally. The number rises to 87% for Latinos ages 18-29. Of Latino Internet users aged 18-19, 84% say they use social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter\u201360% in English. The data show that reaching Latinos on the Internet and using social media with culturally appropriate HIV messages may be a good outreach strategy.\n\nAct Against AIDS Campaigns to Reach Latinos\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently launched We Can Stop HIV One Conversation at a Time/Podemos Detener el VIH Una Conversaci\u00f3n a la Vez, a national communication campaign that encourages Hispanics/Latinos to talk openly about HIV/AIDS with their families, friends, partners, and communities. Check out its resources, including a video, telenovela, PSA, and more.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s REASONS/RAZONES campaign reminds Latino gay and bisexual men that there are many reasons to take an HIV test and that everyone can play a role in stopping the spread of HIV. Its videos feature Latino gay and bisexual men sharing their reasons for getting an HIV test. Widgets, social media posts, a social media kit, and other online resources are also available.\n\nRecursos en Espa\u00f1ol\n\nAIDS.gov maintains the page Recursos en Espa\u00f1ol that compiles HIV/AIDS-related Spanish language materials from the Federal Government.\n\nYou Can Use Social Media to Communicate about NLAAD\n\nHere are some ideas for using social media to spread the word about the impact of HIV on Latino communities:\n\nTwitter: When you use social media to observe the day, please use the hashtag #NLAAD so that you can be a part of the larger conversation.
