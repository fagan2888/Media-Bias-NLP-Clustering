Their five year retransmission consent deal expires today.\n\nYesterday, Cox said it wanted the public to tell the FCC the merger between Nexstar Broadcasting and Media General is a bad idea. Nexstar quickly fired back by calling Cox irrational.\n\nTactically, Cox\u2019s mis-guided plea to consumers to oppose the announced transaction with Media General serves to further highlight the irrational thinking of Cox\u2019s management as Nexstar\u2019s merger with Media General is in full compliance with the FCC\u2019s rules regarding ownership of television stations, including the national cap, which was statutorily set by Congress.\n\nNexstar then called Cox ignorant after it tried shaming by sidecar when it said Nexstar\u2019s Mission Broadcasting agreed to terms two weeks ago.\n\nFurthermore, Cox\u2019s assertion that \u201cNexstar won\u2019t even accept the very same rate that stations they manage agreed to just two weeks ago\u201d speaks to the ignorance of Cox as it relates to FCC regulations. Specifically, the FCC adopted rules in 2014 that prohibit Nexstar from knowing the rates agreed to with Cox by the stations Nexstar provides operating services to.\n\nNexstar also said it wanted to \u201cset the record straight\u201d and called Cox\u2019 allegations that its merger wasn\u2019t in the public interest a \u201cgross misrepresentation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://adweek.it/20bfDq0", "image": "http://www.adweek.com/tvspy/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/cox-nexstar.jpg", "description": "Cox says Nexstar's merger is not in the public interest.
