Luke Malek, R-Coeur d'Alene, in response to Luke's shot across the IFF bow:\n\nHere\u2019s one more thing regarding Rep. Luke Malek\u2019s diatribe about the Idaho Freedom Foundation as printed in the Spokesman-Review newspaper: I like Luke Malek. I do. I truly do. However, I don\u2019t believe anything he says. In 2013, when Malek was a freshman legislator, I spent a lot of time educating Malek and his colleagues about the issues surrounding the state insurance exchange. Malek told me he felt the Legislature needed to act that year on the matter. \u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d I told him. Obamacare did not (and still does not) require every state to set up an insurance exchange in any one year; a state can make a decision to set up an exchange or even dismantle its insurance exchange at any point. Malek acknowledged this. He told me he agreed, that the state need not proceed in 2013 with setting up a state insurance exchange. More below.\n\nDFO: So, Wayne Hoffman is hammering state Rep. Luke Malek, R-Coeur d'Alene, for having the audacity to challenge the clandestine Idaho Freedom Foundation. But he didn't have much to say when policy analyst Parrish Miller tweeted he wasn't sure whether parents have a responsibility to keep their children alive? Really?\n\nDFO: I trust Luke. In fact, I consider him to be the best Kootenai County legislator. Hands down. Thoughts?\n\nSeveral days later, February 13, the House Health and Welfare Committee scheduled a meeting. On the agenda were two proposals, including RS22027, \u201chealth insurance exchange.\u201d The sponsor of the legislation was listed as \u201cRep. Luke Malek.\u201d\n\nI sent a text message to Malek: \u201cWhat is your RS on the agenda for tomorrow\u2019s H&W meeting?\u201d\n\nHis answer: \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d\n\nThe rest is history. Malek was proposing the state create an insurance exchange, a proposal which lead to the state\u2019s implementation of Obamacare. Malek did ask to meet with me after his proposal was introduced. But the deed was done.\n\nSince the mid 1990s, I\u2019ve watched legislators and lobbyists come and go. There\u2019s one common thread in the legislative universe. Your word should count for something. I have no ill will toward Malek. I still like the guy. I just don\u2019t trust him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Rep.
