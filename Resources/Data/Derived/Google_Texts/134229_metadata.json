HMRC said Troup had never had any dealings with Mossack Fonseca or advised any of its clients named so far. It added that any HMRC officers with a potential conflict of interest would exclude themselves from a relevant investigation.\n\nBookmakers William Hill said they had cut their odds on Cameron resigning as prime minister this year to 2/1, compared with 16/1 when he won the last general election last May.\n\nCameron said on Thursday his father's investment trust was not set up to avoid tax but to invest in dollar-denominated shares. He said he had paid all taxes due on his own investment, which was worth about 30,000 pounds when he sold it in 2010.\n\nBut Cameron stands accused of hypocrisy after portraying his government as being in the forefront of global efforts to crack down on offshore tax havens. A comment he made in 2012 about a famous comedian's legal tax avoidance scheme being \"morally wrong\" has been widely quoted by media.\n\nThe documents disclosed by Downing Street on Sunday, from RNS Chartered Accountants, show Cameron paid tax of 75,898 pounds on income of 200,307 pounds in the 2014-2015 financial year, the most recent one included. ($1 = 0.7080 pounds)\n\n(Additional reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary in Edinburgh; Editing by Ros Russell and Peter Cooney)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron took the unusual step on Sunda", "title": "UK's Cameron releases tax records to calm Panama Papers storm", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/UK-PM-releases-tax-records-after-Panama-Papers-storm", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-britain_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/UK-PM-releases-tax-records-after-Panama-Papers-storm", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-britain_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron took the unusual step on Sunda", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Cameron announced a new taskforce on tax evasion would be led by the tax authority, HMRC, and the National Crime Agency.\nAfter saying on Saturday that could have handled the fallout from the Panama disclosures better, Cameron released a summary of his tax records for the past six years.\nCameron will make a statement about tax policy to parliament on Monday to try to regain the upper hand.\nCameron said on Thursday his father's investment trust was not set up to avoid tax but to invest in dollar-denominated shares.\nThe Guardian newspaper reported later that HMRC boss Edward Troup's former employer, London-based law firm Simmons and Simmons, had counted Cameron's father's fund among its clients."}
