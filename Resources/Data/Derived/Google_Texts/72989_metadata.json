That\u2019s a jump from 1,900 households with 6,504 people in 2005. The total cost of the program in 2014 was $55.2 million.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not an agency in Pueblo that touches more lives than we do,\u201d said Tim Hart, director of Pueblo County Social Services. \u201cAt least a third of the people in Pueblo County come through our door.\u201d\n\nA moving door lately.\n\nThe agency relocated during its busiest year ever to the Wells Fargo building after its former offices near the Pueblo County Courthouse were closed because of structural problems. The reason for the boom in food stamps, as well as other services, can be traced to changes in guidelines that were put in place with Obamacare.\n\nOne of the changes was to increase access to Medicaid, which began to expand in 2012. In 2013, the guidelines for income eligibility for food stamps increased from 10 percent of poverty level ($92/month for an adult) to 138 percent ($1,265/month).\n\nBenefits can be as high as $200 per month for one adult, but usually aren\u2019t at the upper limit after deductions for other sources of income are deducted.\n\nNot everyone on food stamps received them for all 12 months of the year.\n\nAt the same time, portals for health insurance programs increased awareness for the SNAP program as well as other forms of assistance.\n\nSo growth in the food stamp program, which had nearly doubled in terms of households served from 2005-11, exploded from 2012-14.\n\nSome in the community have attributed growth in the need for services to an influx of families drawn here by publicity for marijuana. Hart doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\n\n\u201cI have been asked about that, but our system doesn\u2019t track it. There\u2019s no way to say they moved here for marijuana,\u201d Hart said.\n\nMore likely, the lower cost of living and wage structure in Pueblo has created a situation where more people are eligible for benefits. Family size also matters. The income cutoff for a family of eight is $4,344 a month.\n\nWhat\u2019s likely to happen in the future?\n\n\u201cWe feel like everyone who is eligible is on, but then there could be more when there is a big layoff at the mill or at Vestas,\u201d said Tammy Torres, administrator for adult services.\n\nSocial Services tries to sort out the short-term needs from long-term assistance.\n\n\u201cWhen those things (layoffs) happen, we\u2019re seeing more young working parents, so it might mean more children in the household,\u201d said Karen Garcia, family services center administrator. \u201cOur goal is to help them, but try to get them off the program.\u201d\n\nHart said the answer is something his department has no control over.\n\n\u201cWe need better-paying jobs in the community,\u201d he said.\n\ncwoodka@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/3421907-120/pueblo-services-pages-pageset", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=suaP_VM_LG43oVJi_WAz7M$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvaN6gtJJmjMftob7OcPi3yWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "Food stamp use at all-time high in Pueblo"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s not an agency in Pueblo that touches more lives than we do,\u201d said Tim Hart, director of Pueblo County Social Services.\nLast year, 10,807 households with 32,749 people in Pueblo County received benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in 2014.\nOne in every five Pueblo County residents received federal food assistance last year, representing a fivefold increase in the past 10 years.\nNot everyone on food stamps received them for all 12 months of the year.\n\u201cAt least a third of the people in Pueblo County come through our door.\u201dA moving door lately."}
