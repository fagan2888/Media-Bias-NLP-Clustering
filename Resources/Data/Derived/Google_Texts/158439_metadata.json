Velez is an airsoft rifle enthusiast, according to his Facebook page, so the couple posed with fake weapons for a picture.

Administrators suspended the students for 10 days.\n\n\"They are juniors in high school, they know it's provocative and they should know better,\" said Superintendent Richard Gross in an interview with WHDH. \"Things like that scare students.\"\n\nThe teens maintain that they weren't trying to scare anyone. The photo was taken in one of their own homes. No airsoft guns were brought onto school property.\n\n\"It was just a photo,\" said Velez. \"It's not in the yearbook. There's nothing against photos on a personal profile.\"\n\nThe couple is still awaiting formal disciplinary charges, which could actually be much worse than a mere 10-day suspension.\n\nRational response to a credible threat, or absurd crackdown on a perfectly legitimate, innocent hobby?
