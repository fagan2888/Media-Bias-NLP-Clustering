Estelle Thomson describes herself as "a poor Native kid from the village." She was particularly touched by his visit. "For Native youth, whose graduation rates from college and even high school are abysmal, teen pregnancy and suicide rates are disproportionately high, this single statement can fuel the success of so many kids. If they can just remember that feeling. ... Some of those kids will realize they have no limits because the president of the United States said he believed in them. Some of them are our next generation of leaders who will remember the kindness of a man who came across the country to see them. Some of them will see that brown people (like them) can be very successful if they work hard."
