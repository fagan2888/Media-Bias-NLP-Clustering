The billionaire Leonsis and his company, Monumental Sports and Entertainment, will chip in a paltry $5 million up front for rent and, according to Leonsis, will make a $10 million investment in charities and in the community throughout the length of the lease.\n\nAfter her speech, Bowser was asked if she thought the team owner was contributing enough in the deal, and again she side-stepped the question.\n\n\u201cWe negotiated a great deal,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Bowser, the new practice facility will spur $4 million in new tax dollars annually, for a total of $90 million.\n\nMax Brown, the prominent Bowser lobbyist who now heads Events DC, agreed with Bowser, calling the new practice facility \u201cunbelievably transformative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis facility is going to create jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous victory for all of us.\u201d\n\nIn order for Bowser to hit the $90 million number for new tax dollars, the facility would need to host at least 90 other events each year.\n\nBowser said the site could play host to arts, cultural, entertainment events.\n\nFollow Josh on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
