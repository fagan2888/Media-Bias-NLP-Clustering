I like to use this booth because there\u2019s a small space heater inside that cuts through the chill of the Iraqi winter. There\u2019s even a hot plate to boil water for tea, but it only works when you run an extension cord from the generator, and that prevents you from closing the door all the way. I\u2019m interrogating an Iraqi general today, so I make the tea.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to schedule this booth because everyone wants to use it, and we\u2019re only supposed to use it when we have someone important to talk to. It\u2019s always a good thing if you\u2019re interrogating a former Iraqi army officer, especially a major or a colonel. And if you get a former general, like today, then the booth is yours for sure.\n\nThe comfortable interrogation booth is designed for an approach called change of scenery. The prisoner is supposed to think he\u2019s somewhere else; he\u2019s supposed to be tricked into thinking he\u2019s just holding a normal conversation in an office building or his living room; he\u2019s supposed to forget he\u2019s being interrogated at Abu Ghraib prison. But it\u2019s still just a plywood interrogation booth that smells like fresh- cut lumber, and it\u2019s still surrounded by the mud and the filth and the incoming mortar rounds that mark Abu Ghraib.\n\nIt\u2019s early morning\u2014the afternoon sun is still a few hours away\u2014so when two U.S. Army soldiers deliver the general to the booth he is shivering from the cold. I haven\u2019t had time to read the screening report, so I don\u2019t know much about him, but I\u2019m sure his story is similar to so many of the others I\u2019ve already heard. He\u2019s Shia, which means he probably commanded some poorly trained army unit that probably had more men than rifles. And he probably couldn\u2019t pay his men because he embezzled the unit\u2019s payroll in order to fund the bribes that got him promoted to general in the first place. He probably deserted during the invasion, never wanted to fight U.S. troops, and just wanted to go home and live in an Iraq free of Saddam Hussein. This is what all the former generals tell us. None of us believe it.\n\nThe report says something about the general\u2019s sons being involved in anti-Coalition activities, which doesn\u2019t make much sense because he\u2019s Shia, and it\u2019s January 2004 and the Shia haven\u2019t turned their guns on us yet. But it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s true inside Abu Ghraib, and it\u2019s hard to make sense of anything going on in Iraq.\n\nI\u2019m working with one of the two good translators today. She grew up in one of Baghdad\u2019s Christian communities and moved to Michigan during high school, so unlike most translators, she\u2019s fluent in both languages. And she\u2019s fast. She doesn\u2019t wait for you to finish your sentences the way the other translators do, or ask you to repeat yourself, or waste time debating the exact meaning of a word. She talks as you talk, making the conversation seamless.\n\nI\u2019m supposed to collect information about the location of the general\u2019s sons, but like so many things in Iraq, it\u2019s an impossible task. He\u2019s been detained since October 2003. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, he\u2019s done wrong. He\u2019s had no contact with his family, no information about the outside world, and no cooperation from the men who have imprisoned him. My task is to gain his trust and convince him to betray his sons.\n\nBy the time I\u2019ve read the initial screening report and gathered basic background information, I\u2019ve given up. I shouldn\u2019t be here. I should have quit by now. A single month at Abu Ghraib is enough to know that all of this is wrong, but I stay, in hopes of salvaging the experience and finding some way to excuse what I\u2019ve done. With each day, the hole gets deeper.\n\nI have the booth scheduled for another hour and I don\u2019t have the energy this morning to start on someone new. So I take the time to ask the general about his life and learn what I can about Iraq. I do this with most prisoners, whether they have intelligence value or not. When I write the report, I\u2019m supposed to call this the approach phase. I\u2019m supposed to be building rapport. Some interrogators talk about how good they are at this, how they develop relationships with prisoners and come to some sort of understanding, opening lines of communication that will eventually produce good intelligence.\n\nIt\u2019s all bullshit. This is Abu Ghraib prison. The Iraqis hate all of us.\n\nAs I talk to the general about the village where he grew up, his service in the Iran-Iraq War, and how much he loves his sons, I ignore the memories from the previous night, when I interrogated a young man in one of the uncomfortable interrogation booths. I made him stand with his arms in the air until he dropped them in exhaustion. He lied to me, said he didn\u2019t know anything about the men he was captured with or the bomb that had been buried in the road. So I hurt him. Now I\u2019m in a decent room serving decent tea and acting like a decent man. The comfortable interrogation booth is all I need to convince myself that the general and I are enjoying this conversation. I\u2019ve fallen for my own stupid trick. When I pour the tea and turn up the heater, I complete the illusion.\n\nAs we drink our tea, the translator starts a conversation with the general about what it was like growing up as a Christian in Iraq and how her Muslim neighbors always took good care of her. I was an Arabic linguist in the Army, and while my language skills have faded,\n\nI understand enough to allow the translator to steer the conversation for a bit. The general says he was never very religious, but as he gets older he attends Friday prayers more often. The translator seems to like him. I do, too. I pretend the general feels the same way about me.\n\nI talk about growing up in Pennsylvania and attending a Presbyterian church as a boy and how hearing the call to prayer from the mosques of Baghdad reminds me that I should be praying to my god more often. \u201cNo, no,\u201d the general says in English. \u201cNot a different god. Same god. Same god.\u201d He points at both the translator and me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A single month at Abu Ghraib is enough to know that all of this is wrong, but I stay.
