Kansas City Chiefs fans packed local sports bars in Wichita on Saturday for the big playoff win over the Houston Texans.

Emerson Biggins in west Wichita filled every seat with around a hundred people there for the game.

"We got here an hour before it started and we actually got the last open table," said Chiefs fan Connie Gress.

Fans say they expected a win, but none of them predicted the Chiefs would dominate the entire game. The Chiefs started the night with revenge, hoping snap a 22 year streak without a playoff win.

"Feeling really good right now, offense is holding up, defense is doing what they need to do," said Josh Bennett while the game was still in progress.

Most fans at Emerson Biggins admit, they never thought they'd be watching their team in the playoffs after Kansas City started the season on a 1- 5 skid.

"When I saw Jamaal Charles go down, I went, I'm done," said Chiefs fans Craig Bennington.

"Actually I went to Vegas at the beginning of the year and put down a bet for the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl, I almost threw the ticket away," said Paul Winter of Wichita.

But as the Chiefs have done for the past 11 games, the red and gold pulled away and fans went wild.

"I just explode," said Winter. "I live and breathe Chiefs."

The team that once faced all odds didn't allow a single Texans point.

"This is definitely a Godsend, we needed this win," said Winter.

As fans look ahead, they say their team needs to take it one game at a time.

"I would like to see them go two more games," said Chiefs fan Tanner Prophet.

Their ultimate hope is to see this miraculous streak extend to Super Bowl 50.

"I don't think the chiefs are scared of anybody," said Winter.
