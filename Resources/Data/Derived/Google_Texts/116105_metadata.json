If any bill made it out of that arduous process, it would get vetoed by the current president. But at least Republican leaders could know how much they\u2019d be able to chew off in 2017 under potentially unified Republican control of government.\n\nBut say reconciliation, with all of its rules about what types of legislating can and can\u2019t be done, proves to be too much of a hassle. It\u2019s too hard to twist repeal into a net deficit-reducer, and the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s being a pain in the ass, not allowing Republican leaders to remove all the terrible, job-killing, Europeanizing regulations that have no budgetary impact. Imagine if Republicans came into power in 2017 with control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, and then turned to their base and said, \u201cSorry, we can\u2019t repeal Obamacare after all, because some nitpicky Senate procedural rules are getting in the way.\u201d How do you think that might play on talk radio? How might that play at CPAC? Would the Senate Conservatives Fund, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth just nod empathetically and say, \u201cthat\u2019s a bummer, but we understand and won\u2019t attack you\u201d?\n\nHa! Every Republican would get primaried and lose. When you hear conservative entertainment personalities like Sarah Palin or Mark Levin or whoever blab on about how they may form a third, real conservative party if Republican congressional leaders don\u2019t start showing backbone, it\u2019s usually always bluster. But maybe they would actually do it for an election or two if Senate Republicans hid behind the filibuster and left Obamacare intact.\n\nSo then the question becomes: Would you support using the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to kill the filibuster in order to move an Obamacare repeal to the president\u2019s desk?\n\nWe raised this possibility last week, and it\u2019s beginning to filter into candidate interviews. It sounds like Jeb Bush, for example, is finally learning how to contend in a Republican presidential primary. When pressed about nuking the filibuster in an interview with Hugh Hewitt last Friday, Bush said that he \u201cwould certainly consider\u201d it if the right elements of a replacement plan were in place. Scott Walker had an even more definitive answer for Hewitt:\n\n\u201cI heard you say Obamacare will be repealed and replaced,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cThere are a lot of Republican senators who love the filibuster. Rick Santorum told me you don\u2019t need to break the filibuster to repeal Obamacare. But if it\u2019s necessary to do so, will you urge your Republican colleagues to invoke the Harry Reid rule that he used last year that he used to break the filibuster to repeal Obamacare root and branch?\u201d Walker responded: \u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The court challenges are over.
