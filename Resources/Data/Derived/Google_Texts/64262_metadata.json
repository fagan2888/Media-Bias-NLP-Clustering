Ramon Fonseca, a co-founder of Mossack Fonseca, said the documents were obtained illegally by hacking but confirmed that many of them were real. He denied his firm has engaged in any wrongdoing.\n\nThis is a look at offshore accounts and how they are used:\n\nWHAT ARE OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS?\n\nOffshore bank accounts and other financial dealings in another country can be used to evade regulatory oversight or tax obligations.
