Mike Huckabee, meeting with reporters in Washington D.C. this morning, revealed he will give an \u201cindication\u201d of his presidential plans for 2016 in an appearance on Fox News tonight.\n\nTalking like a potential presidential contender, but trying not to act like one (Huckabee refused to sit at the head of a table during his meeting with reporters), the former governor and Fox News host declared that \u201ca lot of things have gone very well\u201d in preparing for a decision about his future.\n\n\u201cI think things will be different than last time,\u201d said Huckabee, who last ran for president in 2008. \u201cSome good and some not. The good is that I think there will be lot more financial support. I am much more of a known quantity than eight years ago when I entered the race as a total unknown. The downside is there is going to be a big field.\u201d\n\nIn jest, he added:\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of qualified, capable people, but none of them will be as qualified as me.\u201d\n\nHuckabee, who won Iowa\u2019s Republican caucuses in 2008, vowed a more well-rounded campaign this time around.\n\nThe pastor-pundit-politician, known for his pull with Evangelicals, realizes he wouldn\u2019t be alone in that pursuit if he were to run again, facing off with a deep Republican field that includes likeminded contenders such as Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know I agree with narrative that in 2008 my primarily strength was only Evangelicals,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cHonestly, if the Evangelicals had truly united and unified, I would have not only won Iowa, but also South Carolina, Texas and a lot other states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I had was a coalition of not only Evangelicals and pro-life Catholics, but the core base of my support was working class people, people who felt disenfranchised from establishment. Those were the people who showed up at rallies waving the signs. Yes, I would love to have monolithic support (of Evangelicals) but I don\u2019t have any presumption that that is a vote I am owed or I deserve. I have to work for it and earn it like anybody else.\u201d\n\nAs a former governor who understands how to reach across the aisle to get stuff done, but also will \u201cstay true to core principles,\u201d Huckabee argues he can fill a lane that isn\u2019t occupied.\n\n\u201cMick Jagger\u2019s \u2018You can\u2019t always get what you want\u2019 should be played regularly in Washington to remind people it\u2019s not, \u2018I win all the time, you lose all the time,\u2019\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t work like that\u2014not in marriage, not in business, not in politics. Clearly one of the reasons I\u2019m considering, contemplating and moving toward a decision is to bring the art of governing, the understanding of how to govern, while never losing your core values. You don\u2019t want to govern for the short game. You want to govern for the long game. Govern what\u2019s best for the country, not your party.\u201d\n\nBut Huckabee\u2019s pitch, like most, is also heavy on jabs and contrasts towards Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI leave tips at Chipotle in the little jar,\u201d Huckabee said, teasing Clinton about her recent appearance at the fast-food chain. \u201cI like to not wear sunglasses and at least say hello so they don\u2019t think I\u2019m robbing the place. Her rollout did not go stellar.\u201d\n\nThe pitch also features brags about his executive experience, but others have that too.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker can say they\u2019ve run a state\u2014but Huckabee is different, he says, because he\u2019s already competed with the \u201cClinton political machine.\u201d\n\nHuckabee was lieutenant governor of Arkansas\u2014where the Clintons political fortune began\u2014from 1993-96 before becoming the state\u2019s governor from 1996-2007.\n\n\u201cOne thing I find intriguing is that a lot of people don\u2019t make the connection that coming through the ranks of Arkansas politics was terrific preparation for governing,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\n\u201cBecause every race I ever ran was essentially against the Clinton political machine. They dominated Arkansas politics. People ask what the bluest state in America was in the 1990s. It was actually Arkansas. When I got elected lieutenant governor \u2026 people were so excited to see a Republican go to the state capital that the door was nailed shut from the inside. That gave me the challenge of how to govern in a hostile atmosphere.\u201d\n\nIf Huckabee were to run, he\u2019d also find the \u201chealthy diet\u201d lane busy.\n\nHuckabee, who says he hasn\u2019t eaten sugar since January (though his new book is called \u201cGod, Guns, Grits, and Gravy\u201d), would have to battle with Bush\u2019s famed Paleo diet.\n\nAnd in standard conservative credo, Huckabee promises a \u201crobust, shockingly strong\u201d foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe bully picks on the kid who he doesn\u2019t think would kick his butt,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has to be the guy nobody wants to pick on because the one thing he [the bully] knows is not only you could kick his butt, but you would. I\u2019m going to put my heel on this side of your face, and there is nothing you\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nHuckabee understands there are others like him.\n\nHe just thinks he\u2019s better than them.\n\n\u201cAll of us will say a lot of the same things,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know of anyone who could say they have more of a true bonafide record of consistency, not just with what I said, but with what I\u2019ve done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Arkansas Gov.
