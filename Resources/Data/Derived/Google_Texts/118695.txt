St. Paul, MN

A published report says the University of Minnesota has paid out nearly $450,000 in sexual harassment settlements over the past five years.



The St. Paul Pioneer Press requested records of all sexual harassment cases involving the university over the past five years after athletics director Norwood Teague resigned last month for sexually harassing two co-workers.



The newspaper reports that the largest of the five settlements over the five years was for $250,000, which the university paid to a student-athlete last December to resolve her complaint related to semi-nude modeling she did for a gymnastics coach.



The volunteer assistant coach, Jim Stephenson, left the team amid the allegations. His wife, head gymnastics coach Meg Stephenson, resigned after she was accused of retaliating against the gymnast and an employee.
