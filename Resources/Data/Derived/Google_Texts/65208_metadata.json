She and I ended up living together all four years.\n\nIn fact, the Myers-Briggs tool, which classifies each individual as one of 16 personality types, is considered such a powerful tool that most college career centers and Fortune 500 companies use it to help people determine their appropriate course in the work world.\n\nSoon, doctors, too, may conduct personality tests with patients to help tailor their care. A recent study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that personality might play a key role in preventive health care among young-adult patients \u2014 the sort of patients now likelier to be covered by Obamacare and actually come in for check-ups.\n\nInstead of 16 personality types, researchers from Duke University examined the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits, which provide the foundation for most personality assessments. They include conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness to experience.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not surprising that conscientious 26-year-olds had better health outcomes at age 38. But the effect size is impressive: 45 percent of the least conscientious individuals developed multiple health problems by age 38, compared to 18 percent of the most conscientious group.\n\nConscientious people generally may be healthier due to diligent behaviors outside of the physician\u2019s office, such as exercising and eating nutritiously, rather than because of their health care, the study notes.\n\nWhat might be surprising is that neurotic young adults did not have declining physical health later in life (though they perceived their health as worse than non-neurotic adults.) This contradicts many theories linking traits of neuroticism, such as anxiety, to worse health.\n\nThe APA press release, published this week, includes commentary from the lead author, Salomon Israel, PhD, of Duke University and Duke University Medical Center:\n\n\u201cPersonality traits can be measured cheaply, easily and reliably, and these traits are stable over many years and have far-ranging effects on health,\u201d said Israel. \u201cOur findings suggest that in addition to considering \u2018what\u2019 a patient has among risks for chronic age-related diseases, physicians can benefit from knowing \u2018who\u2019 the patient is in terms of personality in order to design effective preventive health care.\u201d\n\nWhile the doctor may benefit from knowing the patient\u2019s personality type, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether the patient would. Would knowing that you\u2019re neurotic enhance your health care experience, or would it just make you more stressed and anxious?\n\nWith more evidence, I suppose one day we may have another form to complete while sitting in stiff waiting-room chairs. After questions about smoking and our family history of diabetes, we may also have to contemplate whether or not we agree with the statement, \u201cI am the life of the party.\u201d\n\nReaders, would you like your doctor to know your personality scores?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study suggests that personality tests could help doctors determine how best to deliver preventive health.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A study suggests that personality tests could help doctors determine how best to deliver preventive health.", "title": "Might Personality Tests Of Patients Improve Preventive Health Care?", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/03/personality-health-care", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-13-at-11.21.16-AM-620x348.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/03/personality-health-care", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-13-at-11.21.16-AM-620x348.jpeg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Might Personality Tests Of Patients Improve Preventive Health Care?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-13", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 13 Mar 2014 11:45:15 -0400"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebda\"", "article_summary": "Might Personality Tests Of Patients Improve Preventive Health Care?\nInstead of 16 personality types, researchers from Duke University examined the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits, which provide the foundation for most personality assessments.\nWould knowing that you\u2019re neurotic enhance your health care experience, or would it just make you more stressed and anxious?\nSoon, doctors, too, may conduct personality tests with patients to help tailor their care.\nA recent study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that personality might play a key role in preventive health care among young-adult patients \u2014 the sort of patients now likelier to be covered by Obamacare and actually come in for check-ups."}
