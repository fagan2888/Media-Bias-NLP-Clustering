Small letters that read \u201cComing 2016\u201d hang over the the word \u201cTRUMP.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations from contributing anything of value to federal campaigns, but attorneys who specialize in election law say the Trump sign is not likely to fall under the rules because it went up in 2014, before Trump became an official presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIn this instance because the billboard went up long before Mr. Trump became a candidate, it appears the corporation did so in the normal course of doing business, not to influence the campaign,\u201d said Paul Ryan, senior counsel with The Campaign Legal Center.\n\nBut Ryan said a future sign could present an issue.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, he and his business entities need to be very careful that they don\u2019t spend any corporate funds to help his campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nKenneth Gross, a D.C.-based attorney with the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said he doesn\u2019t see an issue with the signs.\n\n\u201cThere are FEC rules that would kick in for electronic media within certain timeframes of an election, but not for putting signs on a business trumpeting his brand, if you will,\u201d he said. \u201cPun intended, I guess.\u201d\n\nAllen has not personally filed any complaints with the General Services Administration (GSA), which is leasing the property to Trump. However, he said he would encourage constituents to do so if they wished.\n\nIn a statement, GSA spokeswoman Kamara Jones said Trump\u2019s billboard has been in front of the historic Old Post Office (OPO) in downtown Washington since September 2014.\n\n\u201cGSA allows signage to be placed in front of major construction sites to inform the public about the work that is happening on the site and who is doing the work,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe signage is not political advertising; it merely informs the public about the renovation of the OPO into a luxury hotel.\u201d\n\nDaniel Weiner, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said there are rules for pre-existing business communications that weigh in favor of the argument that Trump\u2019s signs are not campaign-related, but he said the billboard certainly raises the question.\n\nRegardless of what the sign is intended to mean, Weiner said, \u201cif it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a duck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at advertisements and try determine their intended meaning, we look at what does the thing look like and go on that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s immaterial if he says 'That\u2019s not what I intended.' \u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, Ivanka Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization, said it obtained all the necessary approvals for the signs on Pennsylvania Avenue a long time ago.\n\n\u201cConstruction at Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C is well underway and ahead of schedule, she said. \u201cWhen the redevelopment is completed, this will be the finest luxury hotel in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Election Commission said it does not comment on specific cases or candidates, saying, \u201canyone can file a complaint if they feel the law is being violated.\u201d\n\nAs for Allen, he said he would have raised the issue if the signs were for President Obama.\n\n\u201cThat large of a sign on Pennsylvania Avenue that looks substantially like a campaign sign to me is the corporation expending resources that look an awful lot like Trump the campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless of whether his campaign signs were intentionally designed to look like his business signs or not, branding expert and author Karen Post said Trump is doing a good job building his brand by staying in the news.\n\n\u201cHe is a smart guy and knowing he\u2019s been in this branding space fore several decades with other venues, I would be surprised is hadn\u2019t thought through some of these things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really too early to tell whether he\u2019s truly shooting himself in the foot or creating a lot more discussion and conversation, which can be a strategy for what you\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s running a campaign or building a business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Trump \"Coming 2016\" sign is blocks from the White House.", "description": "The Trump \"Coming 2016\" sign is blocks from the White House.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Trump \"Coming 2016\" sign is blocks from the White House.", "title": "Trump billboard draws scrutiny", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/other/248580-trump-billboard-draws-scrutiny", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/trumpsign_072015gn_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-20T19:27:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-20T19:27-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/other/248580-trump-billboard-draws-scrutiny", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-20T19:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Donald Trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20T19:10:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T19:27:18-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/other/248580-trump-billboard-draws-scrutiny", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Trump \"Coming 2016\" sign is blocks from the White House.", "card": "summary", "title": "Trump billboard draws scrutiny"}, "dcterms.title": "Trump billboard draws scrutiny"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe103f\"", "article_summary": "The dark blue billboard with white lettering stands in front of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\u201cConstruction at Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C is well underway and ahead of schedule, she said.\n\u201cThat large of a sign on Pennsylvania Avenue that looks substantially like a campaign sign to me is the corporation expending resources that look an awful lot like Trump the campaign,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPun intended, I guess.\u201dAllen has not personally filed any complaints with the General Services Administration (GSA), which is leasing the property to Trump.\n\u201dIn a statement to The Hill, Ivanka Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization, said it obtained all the necessary approvals for the signs on Pennsylvania Avenue a long time ago."}
