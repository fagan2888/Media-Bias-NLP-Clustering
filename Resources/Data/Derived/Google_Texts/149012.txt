Thousands of people gather to hear Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders during a campaign rally at the Prince William County Fairground in Virginia.

While GOP White House hopefuls traded barbs in California, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took to Twitter.

The Vermont senator live-tweeted the debate Wednesday night, ripping the Republicans for their policy and rhetoric:



As a result of Citizens United, billionaires are now controlling our politics. Will any R support the overturn? Let's see. #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Rubio knows California has a drought. Will he have the courage to connect that to climate change or reject the science? #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

30mil Americans have no health insurance. Even more underinsured. And Trump wants to get rid of Obamacare. Really? #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Now we're really getting to the Republican talking points. More money for war and confrontation. #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Gee. How come these guys are not talking about the great "success" of Bush's foreign policy and the war in Iraq? #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Does anybody on the stage believe that our gay brothers and sisters have the same rights as the rest of us? Anybody? #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Kasich. You don't know ANYBODY who doesn't think we should defund Planned Parenthood? Really? You apparently don't know the American people. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Rich get richer. Median fmly income $5k less than in 1999. One of the highest rates of childhood poverty. Any discussion? #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

The American people overwhelmingly want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Too bad, the Republicans don't. #DebateWithBernie — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015

Sanders wasn’t the only Democratic presidential candidate to chime in. Hillary Clinton also tweeted criticisms of the Republicans.

Fingers crossed we're getting close to the part when they talk about things they're for?instead of against. #GOPdebate — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 17, 2015

For a bunch of people who don't believe in acting on climate change, the Republican candidates seem committed to recycling ideas. #GOPdebate — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 17, 2015

Former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, a Democratic presidential candidate, meanwhile, suggested the Republican rhetoric was racist and economically unsound.
