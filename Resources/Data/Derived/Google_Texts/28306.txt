UPDATED: Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.

New Haven and Harlem line service had been restored earlier Wednesday, while Hudson Line service was restored as tracks were reopened.

The MTA said that structural engineers from Metro-North had verified the integrity of the Park Avenue elevated structure, which runs near the site where two buildings collapsed in an apparent natural-gas explosion Wednesday morning. All four of the tracks on the structure were cleared of debris, inspected for track and third-rail integrity and approved for use by railroad and the city fire department, the MTA said.

Trains will operate at slower speeds through the area of the collapse in an effort to protect employees and “reduce vibrations as rescue and recovery work continues,” the MTA said in a release. Commuters should expect delays and crowding during rush hour.
