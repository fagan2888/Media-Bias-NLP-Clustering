The patents for several popular brand-name drugs \u2014 Celebrex, Copaxone, Nexium, Actonel and Exforge \u2014 are scheduled to expire soon. You can already get generics for Cymbalta, Maxalt, Maxalt MPT, Micardis, Micardis HCT, Twynsta and Xeloda, whose patents recently expired.\n\nPay for generics yourself. Some stores charge as little as $4 for a 30-day supply of some drugs or $10 for a 90-day supply, while some insurance companies charge a $10 co-payment for a 30-day supply.\n\nFind \u201ctherapeutic alternatives.\u201d Some brand-name drugs don\u2019t have a generic equivalent but may have a therapeutic alternative \u2014 a medicine in the same class of drugs that varies a little chemically. For example, Diovan is a blood-pressure medication with no direct generic substitute. In one popular prescription-drug plan, the monthly cost for a 30-day supply of 80-mg tablets is $149.66. But you could spend just $1 per month for a comparable dose of losartan potassium, $2 per month for irbesartan or $20 for a monthly supply of Benicar. Check with your doctor about any drug that isn't a direct generic substitution.\n\nOrder your drugs through the mail. Mail-order pharmacies may provide a three-month supply of drugs for the same price as a one- or two-month supply at a local pharmacy. Some insurance plans require you to use mail order for maintenance drugs.\n\nSplit your pills. Ask your doctor if you can save money by cutting your pills. Your physician will have to write a new prescription for twice the strength and half the quantity, noting your intent to split the tablets.\n\nGet help from special drug programs. Go to the National Council on Aging\u2019s Benefits Checkup site (benefitscheckup.org) and anonymously input basic information about your income, assets, medical conditions and drugs. You\u2019ll see whether you qualify for any special programs, such as drug manufacturers\u2019 patient-assistance programs for low-income patients.\n\nKimberly Lankford,\n\nKiplinger's Personal Finance", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are several ways you can save on your medications.", "og": {"description": "There are several ways you can save on your medications.", "title": "Retirement: Save on prescription-drug costs", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-retirement-save-on-prescription-drug-costs.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-generics_bonanza_20312445.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/GENERICS_BONANZA_20312445.JPG", "height": 447}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-12T01:25:26Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-12T01:25:26Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Retirement: Save on prescription-drug costs\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-retirement-save-on-prescription-drug-costs.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-generics_bonanza_20312445.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/GENERICS_BONANZA_20312445.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1852984\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-12T01:25:26Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-generics_bonanza_20312445.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/GENERICS_BONANZA_20312445.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-08-12T01:25:26Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4585\"", "article_summary": "In one popular prescription-drug plan, the monthly cost for a 30-day supply of 80-mg tablets is $149.66.\nYou\u2019ll see whether you qualify for any special programs, such as drug manufacturers\u2019 patient-assistance programs for low-income patients.\nGet help from special drug programs.\nSome stores charge as little as $4 for a 30-day supply of some drugs or $10 for a 90-day supply, while some insurance companies charge a $10 co-payment for a 30-day supply.\nKeep an eye out for new generic drugs."}
