LOS ANGELES â€” Chris Paul banked in a shot over Tim Duncan with a second left to lift the Los Angeles Clippers to a 111-109 victory over the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in Game 7 on Saturday night for a wild finish to an entertaining first-round series.

After Duncan made two free throws to tie it with 8.8 seconds left, Paul drove the right side and put up a one-handed shot over the 39-year Spurs star that went in as he was falling away.

Matt Barnes knocked away the inbound pass to seal the victory.

The Clippers, who faltered at home in Games 2 and 5, move on to face the Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals starting Monday night in Houston.

Paul returned from an early hamstring injury to finish with 27 points.

Duncan also had 27 points.
