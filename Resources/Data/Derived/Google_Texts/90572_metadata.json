For example, five-star providers had average post-discharge mortality rates of 9.8 percent, compared to 11.2 percent for one-star hospitals.\n\nFive-star hospitals also had lower readmission rates, averaging rates under 20 percent, while one-, two-, three- and four-star providers all readmitted at least 20 percent. Researchers noted the analysis only included Medicare patients, potentially limiting the data's applicability, and that the difference in care quality between two-, three- and four-star hospitals was negligible.\n\n\"If you use the star rating you're more likely to end up at a high-quality hospital,\" co-author Ashish K. Jha, M.D., of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health told Reuters. \"But I wouldn't use only the star rating to choose a hospital.\"\n\nExperts have long questioned the broader reliability of patient satisfaction scores, arguing that while they are an important aspect of care, providing incentives can lead hospitals to prioritize comfort over outcomes.
