Arizona, as one of the anti-Obamacare states, declined to establish a state exchange, so Arizonans have to use the federal health insurance exchange, healthcare.gov.\n\nAbout half the states have a similar restriction in place.\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, they had to lobby for the inclusion of an exception for cases of rape in incest, which is included in this bill.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate on a 16-12 vote.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Arizona president Bryan Howard said at a previous committee hearing that this is the 28th abortion-related bill proposed in Arizona since 2009, and the number of abortions has actually gone up over that time.\n\n\"For those truly interested in reducing abortion, the only thing that is going to make a difference is to discuss how education and family planning can reduce unintended pregnancy,\" Howard said while testifying on this bill.\n\nGot a tip?
