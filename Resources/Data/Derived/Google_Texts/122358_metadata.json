For an earlier morning read on exponentially more races \u2014 and for a more comprehensive aggregation of the day's most important campaign news \u2014 sign up for Campaign Pro today. (http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTHE KICKOFF \u2014 Chamber goes up in two Alabama races ahead of March 1 primaries: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is airing ads on behalf of Reps. Bradley Byrne and Martha Roby. Both 30-second spots, which will begin airing today, focus on praising the incumbents as solid conservatives as they face primary challengers on March 1. Watch Byrne\u2019s spot here: https://youtu.be/mi_tngGrcO0. And Roby\u2019s spot here: https://youtu.be/h_8gdJ-6i1w\n\n\u2014 The U.S. Chamber endorsed GOP Rep. David Joyce in OH-14 yesterday, ahead of his March 15 primary, and today the Chamber will endorse GOP Rep. John Shimkus, who faces a Club for Growth-endorsed challenger in IL-15. Shimkus has hit the airwaves in that primary with a negative spot slamming state Sen. Kyle McCarter as part of the \"Springfield machine\" who is backed by \"Washington insiders.\" See the spot, which only briefly touts Shimkus, here: bit.ly/1To4Frv\n\nHOOSIER SHOWDOWN \u2014 What to expect at Rep. Todd Young's hearing to stay on the Indiana Senate ballot, via Campaign Pro's Scott Bland: http://politico.pro/1STQaNI\n\n\u2014 FIRST IN SCORE: YOUNG CONTINUES PUSHBACK \u2014 If Young stays on the ballot, his campaign will not let this controversy go quietly into the night. The campaign released their second web ad this week on the topic. \u201cSome Hoosiers like Chicago-style pizza,\u201d a narrator intones over footage of pizza dough being rolled and toppings being added. \u201cBut nobody likes Chicago-style politics,\u201d he says as a shot of the Chicago skyline and President Barack Obama appears. The spot accuses GOP Rep. Marlin Stutzman of using \u201cdirty tricks\u201d against Young and features a side-by-side shot of the president and Stutzman. Watch it here: https://youtu.be/ko9UvP7Z_TQ\n\nSUPREME DOLLARS \u2014 Parties raise money off SCOTUS fight: The fight over whether President Barack Obama will get to appoint another Supreme Court Justice before the end of his term hit the inboxes of small donors everywhere on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell penned a missive for the NRSC, while the DSCC asked donors t \u201cshow the GOP that Democrats won\u2019t take their obstruction lying down.\u201d Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto said her race was now a \u201cbattle for the future of the Supreme Court\u201d in a fundraising letter. Florida Democrat Patrick Murphy declared: \u201cNothing less than the future of the Supreme Court is on the line.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Even House candidates join in: Most of the focus on how the Supreme Court vacancy would impact down-ballot races has focused on the Senate since, after all, only senators have a say. But Democratic House nominees clearly see it as a winning issue, as well. Former Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Glenn Ivey is airing a radio ad in Maryland\u2019s 4th District, where he was one of three Democrats competing to replace Rep. Donna Edwards. \u201cNow they\u2019re telling President Obama that he can\u2019t even nominate a justice to the Supreme Court,\u201d Ivey says in the ad. \u201cThey want a right wing Supreme Court to help them overturn Obamacare and eliminate affirmative action.\u201d Listen to the spot here: https://youtu.be/f6NzNZbxOls\n\n\u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Josh Gerstein writes on how Scalia\u2019s death could alter election law: \u201cA new justice nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate would almost certainly shift the court in the direction of stricter voting rights enforcement and a greater willingness to take account of race when considering redistricting and election law matters. But the more likely scenario in the near-term \u2014 deadlock over Scalia's replacement \u2014 could have a similar effect by leaving the court less likely to come up with five votes to set precedent on such issues and to issue emergency stays in challenges to last-minute voter ID and election-law changes coming up from lower courts.\" http://politi.co/20F5CMD\n\nDays until the South Carolina Republican primary and Nevada Democratic caucuses: 3.

Sinclair, busy - Making Political Ads Work! **\n\nMAPMAKER, MAPMAKER \u2014 North Carolina Republicans draw new 10-3 congressional map: The newly compact districts could shift several members around even while preserving the GOP's partisan advantage in the delegation, the Raleigh News and Observer reports. GOP Rep. George Holding's 13th District and Democratic Rep. Alma Adams' 12th District would move far from their respective bases. GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers' 2nd District moves from west of Raleigh to east of it. Nearly every district would see a major population shift, if not necessarily a partisan one. bit.ly/1To56C1\n\n\u2014 Next steps: The legislature will meet in special session this week to approve the maps. The court that ordered new maps be drawn also has to approve the lines as well. (Democrats castigated the new map as gerrymandered Wednesday.)\n\n2018 NRSC CHAIR BATTLE ALREADY TAKING SHAPE \u2014 Morning Consult\u2019s Reid Wilson reports two freshmen senators \u2014 Thom Tillis and Cory Gardner \u2014 are the early frontrunners. Both \u201chave both put out feelers about running the NRSC next year, according to half a dozen aides and lobbyists close to the Senate Republican Conference. While other senators are said to be in the mix \u2014 notably Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) \u2014 Gardner and Tillis, the sources said, have been by far the most active in cultivating fellow Republicans. \u2026 Tillis, the one-time speaker of the North Carolina state House, has run a campaign arm before, when he helped Republicans recapture the chamber in 2010. Gardner mounted what some consider the best campaign a Republican has run in recent years.\u201d http://bit.ly/1VoIDUG\n\nTHE GLOSSY TREATMENT \u2014 Jason Zengerle profiles GOP consultant Rex Elsass in GQ, dubbing him \u201cThe Most Powerful Man in the GOP (And You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Him),\u201d while the piece\u2019s URL refers to him as \u201cthe secret wizard of the far right.\u201d http://bit.ly/1PH37Xf\n\nPOLL: VOTERS IN SENATE STATES BACK CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM \u2014 The U.S. Justice Action Network released a poll Wednesday showing majority support for a wide range of criminal justice reforms in six states with competitive Senate elections in 2016: Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. Voters thought too many non-violent criminals were in prison, that the federal government spent too much money on prisons and that the main goal of prison should be rehabilitation. The group noted it briefed both the DSCC and NRSC on the results of the poll, which was conducted by The Tarrance Group. http://bit.ly/1VoMi4U\n\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cBush struggles to mask mounting frustration,\u201d by Eli Stokols in Summersville, S.C.: \u201cFighting for his political life in the final days of this primary battle, Bush took the stage intent on showing toughness and drawing a sharp contrast between himself and Marco Rubio. Just moments earlier, he\u2019d gotten devastating news: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose endorsement he\u2019d sought, was backing Rubio, who poses the biggest threat to his own chances of political survival. \u2026 During the question and answer period following an unusually hot-tempered 30-minute rendition of his stump speech, Bush received unsolicited advice from three audience members in succession, each encouraging him to be tougher. It did not improve his mood.\u201d http://politi.co/1LusoQu\n\n\u2014 \u201cCarson\u2019s 'anything but last' aspirations,\u201d by Kyle Cheney in Gaffney, S.C.: \u201cThese are bleak times for Carson. Faced with the prospect of a poor finish in socially conservative, deeply Christian South Carolina, the socially conservative, deeply Christian candidate is working to set the lowest bar possible for declaring victory. To score a good result, his campaign says, Carson doesn\u2019t need to win. He doesn\u2019t even need to place second in the six-candidate field. Or third. Or fourth. \u2018If Dr. Carson does not place last in South Carolina, it\u2019s only upwards and forwards for him,\u2019 said Armstrong Williams, a close Carson confidant and adviser.\u201d http://politi.co/1PH6Ow6\n\n\u2014 OUTLIER OR MAJOR SHIFT? You decide \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass on the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday: \u201cTed Cruz has eclipsed Donald Trump in a national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of Republican primary voters out Wednesday, marking a significant reversal from recent weeks of surveys. Cruz is the first choice of 28 percent of Republican primary voters surveyed between Sunday and Tuesday, in the first national poll conducted entirely following the most recent debate in South Carolina. Trump fell seven points from the last NBC/WSJ poll, from 33 percent in mid-January to 26 percent in the latest results. Though he trails Cruz by 2 points, well within the margin of error, Wednesday's poll is the first time Trump has not come out on top since October.\u201d A multitude of other statewide and national polls still have Trump on top, however. http://politi.co/1XyoTiT\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"No, I've never been to a rave. It's a Republican primary, Anderson!\" \u2014 EDM fan Marco Rubio during CNN's South Carolina town hall on Wednesday night.\n\n** A message from Sinclair Broadcast Group: News, opinions, and entertainment surround us 24/7, yet a fundamental truth remains, whether for competitive races or impactful ballot measures, the TV commercial reigns as the medium for reaching potential voters.
