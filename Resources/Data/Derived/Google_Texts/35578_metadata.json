It\u2019s also sparked questions of how far is too far when it comes to showing images of abortion.\n\nThe signs of demonstrators, led by pro-life group Created Equal, were destroyed by an unidentified man outside Beechcroft High School in Columbus earlier this month.\n\n\u201cGet them off or I\u2019ll take them,\u201d says the man, who identifies himself as a homeowner across the street from the school. A video released by the group shows him kicking, bending and breaking the corrugated plastic signs, then throwing them into the street, despite oncoming traffic.\n\nIn the video, the man can also be seen shouting at demonstrators, and taking the group\u2019s signs out of the hands of Jami Beer, Created Equal\u2019s director of campus outreach. He can be heard objecting to the graphic nature of the signs, which depict what Beer called \u201cthe aftermath of abortion\u201d\u2014the remnants of aborted children.\n\nBeer said that she doesn\u2019t like looking at the graphic images either, but they need to be shown so people can see what abortion really looks like.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to make abortion look pretty,\u201d said Beer. \u201cThe nature of abortion is disturbing. High school students are old enough to have abortions. They have a right to know what it looks like.\u201d\n\nWhile many pro-life organizations are united in their desire to peacefully protest, the use of graphic images is a point of debate within the movement.\n\nJanet Morana, executive director of Priests for Life and the co-founder of the Silent No More Awareness campaign, told The Daily Signal that she supports \u201cshowing the victims of abortion\u201d during pro-life demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThese images have value,\u201d said Morana. \u201cAs Father Frank Pavone says, \u2018America will not reject abortion until America sees abortion.\u2019\u201d\n\nMorana said that she has participated in demonstrations similar to Created Equal\u2019s outside of high schools. She\u2019s witnessed firsthand students\u2019 reaction to the images.\n\n\u201cYoung people respond to it,\u201d said Morana. \u201cWhen they are shown the truth, they no longer support abortion.\u201d\n\nMorana stressed that free-speech rights allow all causes to peacefully protest. \u201cYou can disagree, you cannot censor,\u201d she said.\n\nMallory Quigley, communications director at Susan B. Anthony List, told The Daily Signal she could only think of one instance in which her organization used a graphic image. The group sent an email using a crime-scene photo from the murder trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, and that they did include a disclaimer in the subject line.\n\n\u201cIn that particular instance it was valuable,\u201d said Quigley. \u201cSometimes people need to see it to believe it.\u201d\n\nAbby Johnson, a former abortion clinic employee and founder of And Then There Were None, a ministry that helps abortion workers leave the industry, generally discourages the use of graphic images. In her experience, they do more harm than good.\n\nIn remarks printed on Patheos.com, Johnson writes:\n\nI watched them be ineffective for many years \u2026 from inside the abortion clinic. A perspective that most do not have. I watched for several years as women would literally run away from those holding graphic signs. They would come into my office and ask us why those people were holding them. We used that as an opportunity to point out how crazy the prolifers were and that they would do anything to prevent women from making the choices they felt they needed to. It was an AMAZING way for us to build camaraderie inside our clinic.\n\nCreated Equal, the group at the center of the Columbus incident, stands by its use of the graphic images\u2014and even got an apology from the man who destroyed its signs.\n\n\u201cIn a culture killing its children, unfortunately sometimes abortion advocates act violently against those who defend the children. Nevertheless, we refuse to be intimidated into silence,\u201d Mark Harrington, the executive director of Created Equal, said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Beer, the woman who was confronted in Columbus, said the mission of Created Equal is to \u201craise a generation of 21st century preborn defenders,\u201d which includes ministering to high school and college students.\n\nBeer said Created Equal frequently exercises its First Amendment rights to protest abortion on public property.\n\nNot showing the graphic images, she said, \u201csilences the voices\u201d of the 2,900 children the Guttmacher Institute estimates are aborted every day in the United States.\n\nBeer said that during the incident, she did feel that she and her group were in danger, and called the man\u2019s behavior \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nColumbus\u2019 10TV declined to identify the man in the video, but reports that he describes himself as neither pro-life nor pro-choice but rather offended by the graphic images used. The news station reports he is willing to financially compensate Created Equal for the damage. Beer said that the signs destroyed were worth about $120.\n\nBeer said that charges had been filed against the man, but were \u201con hold\u201d because of his apology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent pro-life protest in Ohio drew a heated response from a neighbor upset by the group\u2019s graphic depiction of aborted fetuses on their signs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A recent pro-life protest in Ohio drew a heated response from a neighbor upset by the group\u2019s graphic depiction of aborted fetuses on their signs.", "title": "Pro-Life Group\u2019s Graphic Signs Spark Debate Over Images of Abortion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10857116_776364892441154_3432638384191165105_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-13T22:37:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1AjACua"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A recent pro-life protest in Ohio drew a heated response from a neighbor upset by the group\u2019s graphic depiction of aborted fetuses on their signs.", "title": "Pro-Life Group\u2019s Graphic Signs Spark Debate Over Images of Abortion", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10857116_776364892441154_3432638384191165105_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-02-17T03:01:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-13T22:37:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Abortion, prolife, prochoice, abortion debate, Created Equal, abortion images, aborted children"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda909\"", "article_summary": "I watched for several years as women would literally run away from those holding graphic signs.\nThe signs of demonstrators, led by pro-life group Created Equal, were destroyed by an unidentified man outside Beechcroft High School in Columbus earlier this month.\nNot showing the graphic images, she said, \u201csilences the voices\u201d of the 2,900 children the Guttmacher Institute estimates are aborted every day in the United States.\nNevertheless, we refuse to be intimidated into silence,\u201d Mark Harrington, the executive director of Created Equal, said in a statement.\nBeer said that she doesn\u2019t like looking at the graphic images either, but they need to be shown so people can see what abortion really looks like."}
