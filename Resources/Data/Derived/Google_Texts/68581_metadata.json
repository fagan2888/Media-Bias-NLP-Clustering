For example, a young software-development company I know put all its funding into product development. The entrepreneurs were from an engineering and software background and they invested in what they knew\u2014hiring software developers to enhance the product. Some years later, they told me that they wished they had taken the time to identify what they did not know very well\u2014software marketing\u2014and had allocated the funds across several areas of the business including market research. Instead, they relied on their investor\u2019s marketing expertise\u2014but their investors\u2019 marketing experience was not in software marketing.\n\nThe result of their failure to think strategically about how to allocate the investment, they said, was an over-engineered product that they were never successful in selling.\n\nLessons learned:\n\nThink strategically about how to allocate investment of money into the business. Do not put it all into one bucket.\n\nFigure out what you don\u2019t know\u2014and allocate funds to fill in those gaps.\n\nRecognize that offers from your investors to provide business products and services are valuable only if there is an alignment with your company\u2019s needs.\n\nLearn from your mistakes and persevere. (See postscript)\n\nP.S. The entrepreneurs learned from their mistakes and with self-generated funding (their consulting revenue) built a highly successful consulting company.\n\nSharon Hadary (@hadaryco) is the founding and former executive director of the Center for Women\u2019s Business Research, an adjunct professor in the doctorate of management program at the University of Maryland University College and has co-written a new book, \u201cHow Women Lead: The 8 Essential Strategies Successful Women Know.\u201d\n\nRead the latest Small Business Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The greatest mistake entrepreneurs make when getting either angel or venture-capital funding is not spending enough time thinking through what they are going to do with the money once they get it.", "title": "Don\u2019t Spend All Your Angel Investor\u2019s Money in One Place", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/12/02/dont-spend-all-your-angel-investors-money-in-one-place/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Don\u2019t Spend All Your Angel Investor\u2019s Money in One Place", "description": "The greatest mistake entrepreneurs make when getting either angel or venture-capital funding is not spending enough time thinking through what they are going to do with the money once they get it.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "The greatest mistake entrepreneurs make when getting either angel or venture-capital funding is not spending enough time thinking through what they are going to do with the money once they get it.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-12-02T11:53:27-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/12/02/dont-spend-all-your-angel-investors-money-in-one-place/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-1782", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The greatest mistake entrepreneurs make when getting either angel or venture-capital funding is not spending enough time thinking through what they are going to do with the money once they get it.", "title": "Don\u2019t Spend All Your Angel Investor\u2019s Money in One Place", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/12/02/dont-spend-all-your-angel-investors-money-in-one-place/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-1782", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-02T11:53:39-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7aa\"", "article_summary": "Instead, they relied on their investor\u2019s marketing expertise\u2014but their investors\u2019 marketing experience was not in software marketing.\nWhat is the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make when dealing with angel investors?\nThe entrepreneurs learned from their mistakes and with self-generated funding (their consulting revenue) built a highly successful consulting company.\nRecognize that offers from your investors to provide business products and services are valuable only if there is an alignment with your company\u2019s needs.\nFor example, a young software-development company I know put all its funding into product development."}
