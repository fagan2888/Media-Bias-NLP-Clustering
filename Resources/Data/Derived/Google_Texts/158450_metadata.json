Nebraska is among 20 states that have so far opted out.\n\nBut Nebraska lawmakers \u2014 including some Republicans \u2014 haven\u2019t given up, and plan to push the issue for the second legislative session in a row.\n\nBecause the feds say they\u2019ll pick up most of the cost of the program, taxpayers in states that don\u2019t participate will bear a significant share of the overall costs through federal tax payments, but won\u2019t enjoy any of the benefits, the Commonwealth Fund study said. The feds pay all the costs of expansion for the first three years, and then support begins dropping to 90 percent by 2020.\n\nGov. Dave Heineman has strongly resisted, saying an expansion is too expensive and he doubts the feds will live up to promises to fund most of the costs. He said it would cost Nebraska hundreds of millions of dollars to expand Medicaid, reducing funding for education and likely requiring a tax increase. He points to broken promises to fund 40 percent of special education decades ago, which is now funded at less than half that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust them and I also don\u2019t want to take away resources from education funding in this state, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have to do or raise taxes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Heineman said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThe bottom line is this Medicaid expansion is too expensive; it\u2019s unaffordable long term.\u201d\n\nEducation and jobs should be the state\u2019s priorities, he said.\n\nBut the Commonwealth report said no state that rejects the expansion will save money, and research has shown the cost to expand Medicaid will average less than 1 percent of state budgets. The Commonwealth Fund supports independent health care research, and its aim is to promote \u201ca high performance\u201d health care system.\n\nThe report said Medicaid expansion would cost most states less than a sixth the amount of money they pay to attract businesses annually. The Medicaid expansion program will become a large source of revenue to states \u2014 averaging 2.35 times as much federal highway money states will get in 2022, the report said. The report estimates Nebraska would spend about $55 million on the expansion by 2022, compared to $1.7 billion in incentives for businesses.\n\nRobert Graboyes, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said while it\u2019s true states that decline to join the program will be turning down money, there\u2019s no guarantee the feds will be able to afford to keep their promise to take on most of the costs.\n\n\u201cNo one really knows if they will,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf I were a betting man, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll fulfill that. If you expand you\u2019re going to be paying a big chunk of the bill.\u201d\n\nExpanding Medicaid would open up the program to adults under the age of 65 who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (nearly $16,000 for individuals or about $32,500 for a family of four). Graboyes said those people would be dropping private plans or no plans to enter an expensive, broken program. He said people are better off being uninsured than being on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cGovernments are notorious in underestimating what are going to be the costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be a very expensive thing to undertake.\u201d\n\nDuring the last legislative session, a bill expanding Medicaid was filibustered and not voted on because supporters couldn\u2019t round up enough votes to end debate. Omaha Sen. Jeremy Nordquist has vowed to bring the bill to a vote in the next session, which begins in January. Heineman has challenged Nordquist to bring the bill up for a cloture vote on the first day of the session to see who has the votes.\n\nNordquist has said expanding Medicaid would have helped keep Nebraska\u2019s insurance rates down as Obamacare is implemented. He cites a study by the independent, nonprofit RAND Corp. that said premiums for people who buy their own insurance would increase 8 to 10 percent in states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid.\n\nAn interim hearing on expanding Medicaid will be held at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Capitol.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
