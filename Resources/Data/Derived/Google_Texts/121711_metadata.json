He said:\n\nBe willing this next election to vote. Vote for candidates that stand for biblical truth and biblical principles and that are willing to live them. If we don\u2019t, this country\u2019s not going to stand much longer. It\u2019s going to fail.\n\nGetting ready for the @Franklin_Graham #DecisionAmerica prayer rally tour to kick off in Des Moines pic.twitter.com/OzGOEMNb7r \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) January 5, 2016\n\nGraham preached to and prayed with the Iowans who gathered in the capital city of the Hawkeye State, which is home to the nation\u2019s first presidential caucuses next month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the enemy is at the gate. They\u2019ve come through the gates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have left the gates wide open and have allowed our moral walls to fall down.\u201d\n\nIn the last election, Graham said, an estimated 20-30 million evangelical Christians did not vote.\n\n\u201cWe talk about national elections, but I want to remind you what some of the most important elections are mayors, city council, county commissioners, judges, school boards,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nCould you imagine that in the next two, three election cycles that the majority of the mayors and city councils of America were born-again Christians, the impact that that would have on this nation and our cities?\n\nHe suggested that his listeners form prayer groups and start praying for the local community they live in.\n\nSpotted: Boyd Clark at @Franklin_Graham\u2018s #DecisionAmerica stop in Iowa pic.twitter.com/zbqWkfxQCi \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) January 5, 2016\n\n\u201cOur educators and our politicians and our churches seem many times to be more concerned about political correctness than God\u2019s truth and his righteousness,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham heads up both the Christian nonprofit Samaritan\u2019s Purse, which lends hands and resources to disaster-stricken places around the world, and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.\n\n\u201cNo political party is going to be able to turn this around,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no hope in the Democratic Party. I have zero hope in the Republican Party. I have no hope in [the] tea party or any other party. My only hope is in Almighty God and his son, Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing we can do is pray. God hears prayer and God answers prayer.\u201d\n\nIowa was Graham\u2019s first stop on the Decision America Tour.
