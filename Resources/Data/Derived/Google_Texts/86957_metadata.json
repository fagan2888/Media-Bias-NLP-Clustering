[10 Ways to Keep Your Mind Sharp]\n\n\"Early evaluation and identification of people with dementia may help them receive care earlier\" and help reduce societal costs, said Dr. Vikas Kotagal, lead author on the paper and assistant professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor.\n\nPeople with dementia may have any of a host of brain conditions that cause long-term difficulties in thinking and reasoning that are severe enough to affect daily life. The most common form is Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMost forms of dementia have no cure, and treatment is limited. Nevertheless, screening for dementia at its earliest stages might help doctors slow the progression or better equip family members and the patient to deal with the disease, Kotagal said.\n\nSome forms of dementia stem from poor nutrition and can be reversed. One common, reversible cause of dementia is vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n\"There are [several] factors that commonly contribute to overall cognitive disability in patients with dementia that can get better with medical management, namely depression and sleep disorders,\" Kotagal told LiveScience. \"Many dementias are caused by cardiovascular risk factors. Identifying these risk factors and modifying them in at-risk individuals can lead to a change in the natural [progression] of these conditions.\"\n\nFor non-reversible forms of dementia, some studies have shown that exercise, social interactions, and engaging the mind in puzzles and games may help slow the progression, although to a very limited degree. Medications, too, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, may have a small but positive effect in helping patients maintaining longer bouts of clear thinking.\n\nThe new study also found that people who were married were more than twice as likely to have had dementia screening as people who were not married.\n\n\"It's possible that spouses feel more comfortable than children [do] raising concerns,\" about dementia, Kotagal said. Another possibility could be that unmarried elderly people may be more reluctant to share their concerns with their doctor if they are worried about the impact it could have on their independence, he added.\n\nDeciding when to see a doctor can be tricky, the researchers wrote, given that tests are not standardized and most seniors experience at least some cognitive decline that's not dementia.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a non-governmental panel of health experts, does not recommend universal screening for dementia because the benefits of pharmacological treatment might not outweigh the risks.\n\n\"Performing this testing in clinically symptomatic older individuals, however, is a different story,\" Kotagal added. For people with symptoms, a screening may be a great help.\n\nPeople with a family member who needs more help with tasks that they have always been able to handle \u2014 specifically because of thinking and memory problems \u2014 should consider scheduling a visit to discuss this with the person's doctor, he said.\n\nThe symptoms of dementia usually first appear after age 60, and the risk increases with age. By age 85, between 25 and 50 percent of people exhibit signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Medicare now reimburses people for Annual Wellness Visits that can include an assessment of cognitive function.\n\nFollow Christopher Wanjek @wanjek for daily tweets on health and science with a humorous edge.
