As part of his grand healthcare reform scheme, President Obama in 2009 pushed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, a law that made \u201cbiosimilars\u201d \u2014 drugs that are highly similar to existing FDA-approved products \u2014 fair game in the pharmaceutical market. While logistics hampered its start, the biosimilars industry is about to get real big, real quick.\n\nThis March, the FDA approved its first biosimilar \u2014 a cancer drug known as Zarxio, which was determined to be biosimilar to Amgen Inc.\u2019s Neupogen (generically known as filgrastim). And just today, to speed up the entry of biosimilars into the drug market, the FDA announced a new system for naming the copycat drugs.\n\nEurope\u2019s been giving the United States biosimilars-related FOMO for some time now. It established its industry in 2006, and it\u2019s now estimated to be worth somewhere between $2.25 and $4.8 billion U.S. dollars. By one estimate, the American biosimilars industry could be worth $11 billion by 2020.\n\nDrug companies eyeing the market will have to learn some ground rules: In terms of safety and efficacy, they don\u2019t differ in any meaningful way from the original, or reference, product. (They\u2019ll still need to be prescribed by a physician, unlike \u201cinterchangeables,\u201d which pharmacists can freely substitute.) They\u2019ve got to be produced by a different company \u2014 Zarxio is produced by Sandoz, Inc. \u2014 than the reference product. And they can only be manufactured once the reference product\u2019s patent has expired.\n\nBut don\u2019t get biosimilars confused with generics, those cheap, renamed exact copies of brand-name drugs. Companies that manufacture biosimilars strive to create compounds that mimic the chemical structure \u2014 and, therefore, the function \u2014 of the reference drugs, but biosimilar copies are built from a new molecule. Creating a biosimilar structure skips that stage when you don\u2019t know whether the final product even works. The riskiest, most expensive part has already been done.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time for Big Pharma, especially when analysts report that about 12 drug patents are going to expire in the next five years \u2014 opening a $67 billion market up to biosimilars.\n\nLast year, the World Health Assembly, calling the price of medicines \u201dcatastrophic,\u201d called for international governments to improve access to biosimilars, which, at least in the States, are about to revolutionize public access to life-saving drugs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug d\u00f6ppelgangers are about to revolutionize access to pharmaceuticals.", "og": {"site_name": "Inverse", "description": "Drug d\u00f6ppelgangers are about to revolutionize access to pharmaceuticals.", "title": "They're Not Generics.
