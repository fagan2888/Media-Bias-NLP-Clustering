KNOXVILLE ? A 68-year-old man died after he was struck early Saturday evening while trying to walk across Clinton Highway, officials said.

The man, whose name wasn't immediately available, was taken to the University of Tennessee Medical Center, where he later died from his injuries, according to a Knox County Sheriff's Office news release.

Authorities said at about 6:53 p.m., the man was crossing from the Clark Motel to a gas station when a woman driving a 2006 Nissan Quest struck him.

A witness told deputies she was crossing with the man, but went back because the traffic was too close.

No charges will be filed against the driver because she was unable to avoid the crash, according to the KCSO.
