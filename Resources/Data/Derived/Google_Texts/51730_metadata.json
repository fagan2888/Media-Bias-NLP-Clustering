We\u2019ll be running these daily through Dec. 31. Look for more New Year\u2019s predictions here.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The new year will bring challenges for national political leaders grappling with health and medical issues.\n\nA new head of the pharmaceutical lobby will have to deal with heavy pressure to bring down drug prices. The next commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration will have to balance competing pressures to speed approvals of new drugs without compromising safety.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll all be watching the campaign debate on medical science \u2014 which is being driven right now by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, but could also turn to Republican priorities once the shape of the GOP race is more clear.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nHere are three key players in national politics to watch in 2016:\n\nStephen Ubl, new president and chief executive, PhRMA\n\nNo lobbyist in Washington is likely to draw as much scrutiny in 2016 as Stephen Ubl, who took over as president and CEO of the pharmaceutical lobby in November.\n\nUbl\u2019s group, PhRMA, short for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is used to having its way in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nBut the political tide has turned against the industry in the last two years. Satisfaction with drug makers is way down from where it was two decades ago. The industry\u2019s main talking points \u2014 including the argument that high prices are justified by hefty research spending \u2014 are not resonating with the public.\n\nAnd both politicians and broad swaths of the public want action to make drugs more affordable. Clinton is making it a centerpiece of her presidential campaign, and the Republican candidates have also started to give the issue some attention.\n\nUbl cut his teeth leading a medical device lobby that \u2014 just shortly after his departure \u2014 finally secured a victory it had long sought: the temporary suspension of a device tax in the Affordable Care Act. Ubl can take a lot of credit for that.\n\nBut he\u2019ll have his work cut out for him in the year ahead.\n\nAnn O\u2019Leary, adviser to Hillary Clinton\n\nClinton is talking a lot about rising prescription drug prices, and when she has to flesh out the details of her plan to bring costs down, she\u2019s going to turn to Ann O\u2019Leary, one of her senior campaign policy advisers.\n\nO\u2019Leary leads the work on Clinton\u2019s health care policies, including her recently announced plan to boost funding for Alzheimer\u2019s research in hopes of finding an effective treatment by 2025. She shares the domestic policy portfolio with Jake Sullivan, another senior policy adviser.\n\nOther presidential candidates also have health care policy advisers, of course, but O\u2019Leary is the one most likely to end up working for a presidential nominee, given the unpredictability of the Republican race right now and Clinton\u2019s strong lead among Democrats.\n\nSo O\u2019Leary is the most likely to have to figure out how campaign rhetoric would actually work in practice \u2014 and to find strategic ways to keep the issue in front of voters.\n\nO\u2019Leary, who lives in Oakland, is a longtime Clinton policy hand: She was Clinton\u2019s legislative director in the Senate and worked on the \u201cToo Small to Fail\u201d program, an early childhood development initiative cosponsored by the Clinton Foundation and the advocacy group Next Generation.\n\nNow, she\u2019ll play a big role in determining whether Clinton can sell her drug prices plan, and her other life science policies, to voters nationwide.\n\nRobert Califf, FDA nominee\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration is likely to get confirmed by the Senate sometime next year.\n\nOnce he\u2019s in, though, he\u2019ll be under constant pressure from key Democrats \u2014 including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 to prove that he\u2019s not too close to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nCaliff was the founding director of the clinical research center at Duke University, and some Democrats are wary of him because the pharmaceutical industry funded some of the studies he oversaw at Duke. They want to make sure he won\u2019t be tempted to allow the FDA to rush new drugs through the approval process without due diligence.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing in November, Califf promised he would never lower safety standards. But he will face pressure from lawmakers in both parties who want to push the FDA to move faster. The House has passed legislation to speed approval times, and Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) are working on their own version, which will be released in 2016.\n\nCaliff\u2019s other big challenge: Alexander wants him to do more to cut the backlog of generic drugs waiting for approval \u2014 a backlog Califf has blamed in part on incomplete applications filed by the drug companies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new year will bring challenges for national leaders grappling with health and medical issues, from FDA nominee Robert Califf to PhRMA head Stephen Ubl.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "The new year will bring challenges for national leaders grappling with health and medical issues, from FDA nominee Robert Califf to PhRMA head Stephen Ubl.", "title": "3 national political leaders who'll be in the hot seat in 2016", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/stat-felt-politics-35mm-wide-1-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-09T16:23:06-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/28/2016-national-politics/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "The new year will bring challenges for national leaders grappling with health and medical issues, from FDA nominee Robert Califf to PhRMA head Stephen Ubl.", "creator": "@DavidNather", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/stat-felt-politics-35mm-wide-1-1024x576.jpg", "title": "3 national political leaders who'll be in the hot seat in 2016", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Three to watch", "published_time": "2015-12-28T11:00:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T16:23:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "drug prices, fda, three to watch"}, "article_summary": "Ubl\u2019s group, PhRMA, short for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is used to having its way in the nation\u2019s capital.\nA new head of the pharmaceutical lobby will have to deal with heavy pressure to bring down drug prices.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The new year will bring challenges for national political leaders grappling with health and medical issues.\nNow, she\u2019ll play a big role in determining whether Clinton can sell her drug prices plan, and her other life science policies, to voters nationwide.\nAs the year winds down, STAT reporters are taking a look at the stories they\u2019re most eager to track in 2016."}
