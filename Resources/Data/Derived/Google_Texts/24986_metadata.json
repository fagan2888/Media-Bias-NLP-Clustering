The guys of AsapSCIENCE recently looked to evolution for the answer.\n\n\u201cAll humans have the same number of hair follicles as our primate ancestors, except our hair now is much more thin and unable to be seen by the human eye,\u201d the YouTube hosts explained on their second channel AsapTHOUGHT. \u201cThroughout evolution it became an advantage to have thinner hair, and it\u2019s thought to be this way because our ancestors were traveling far distances to find food and, in the heat, thick hair was a disadvantage.\u201d\n\nWhile men and women, too, have the same number of hair follicles, men have more of what\u2019s called terminal hair: visible, thick hair that's usually associated with the hair on a person's head or pubic hair. Men have this hair \"on their chest, back, and other places.\" Women can also have hair in these places, but they have more vellus hair, which is hair that\u2019s even thinner and harder to notice. Apparently, these differences have to do with sexual selection.\n\nMale peacocks, for example, flash their tail feathers to display their fitness in order to attract potential mates. One theory even suggests hairy men are better able to detect parasites on their body, so females perceive more hair as a marker for greater, parasite-free health. It makes sense then biology professor Pavol Prokop has said hairless men are preferred more in areas closer to the equator, where there's an increased number of parasites.So it may be men became hairier so it would be easier to attract potential partners.\n\nWatch the video in full below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "evolution, hairy, men, why, more, hair, attracts, opposite, sex, indicates, greater, health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The guys of AsapSCIENCE get to the bottom of why some men are so hairy.", "title": "Why Hairy Men Attract More Women", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/evolution-hairy-men-why-more-hair-attracts-opposite-sex-indicates-greater-health-348030", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/16/hairy-chests.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The guys of AsapSCIENCE get to the bottom of why some men are so hairy.", "title": "Why Hairy Men Attract More Women", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/evolution-hairy-men-why-more-hair-attracts-opposite-sex-indicates-greater-health-348030", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/16/hairy-chests.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/16/hairy-chests.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-08-16T13:12:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-16T13:26:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The guys of AsapSCIENCE get to the bottom of why some men are so hairy."}, "article_summary": "Women can also have hair in these places, but they have more vellus hair, which is hair that\u2019s even thinner and harder to notice.\ntorbakhopper, CC BY-ND 2.0Everyone has hair, but why do men tend to have so much more of it?\nOne theory even suggests hairy men are better able to detect parasites on their body, so females perceive more hair as a marker for greater, parasite-free health.\nThe guys of AsapSCIENCE get to the bottom of why some men are so hairy.\nMen have this hair \"on their chest, back, and other places.\""}
