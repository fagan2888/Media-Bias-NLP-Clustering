A slew of economists believe we're in for years, if not decades, of slow growth and puny average annual returns from stocks. JPMorgan projects growth of less than 2 percent per year over the next five years; Robert Gordon, an influential economist at Northwestern University, says this lull will go on for two decades. Notables, including Robert Shiller and Bill Gross, believe stocks will rise less than 5 percent a year for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut there promises to be little headwind from Washington, and surprisingly strong employment data this month and a healthy revision of GDP in the third quarter suggest investors may be underestimating the recovery. Economic drag from tax hikes, spending cuts and policy uncertainty shaved nearly 2 percentage points off growth this year, said Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Next year such \"fiscal drag\" will cut just a half point off GDP. Growth should accelerate to more than 3 percent by year-end, Hanson said.\n\nThere will be tussles, for sure. Republicans want to keep the focus on problems with the rollout of Obamacare. But they are no longer trying to repeal the law, and neither side has the stomach for a government shutdown. With a budget deal likely by Christmas and hopes for a deal on the debt ceiling early next year, those issues could be put aside for nearly two years. That would eliminate a big uncertainty and clear the way for the market to focus on improving fundamentals. BlackRock's year-ahead strategy calls for overweighting stocks. Merrill Lynch forecasts a 10 percent to 12 percent S&P 500 gain next year.\n\n(Read more: Now where do stocks go?
