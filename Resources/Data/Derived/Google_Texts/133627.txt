UPDATE: Taco Bell has fired an employee that left an insensitive remark on an order of an officer and his fiancé. The company apologizes for the worker’s behavior and says they’re moving forward to correct the situation.

Jeff Graves, senior director of operations for Taco Bell, said the worker was let go from the job. The worker wrote “PIG” on to-go orders for the couple Saturday night in Newton.

“We do not share the same belief or view as the employee whatsoever,” Graves said. “Our company, Taco Bell, has always been pro-law enforcement, military. We’ve always supported the police in our community. Many of our restaurants give police discounts when they come in and eat.”

Graves said he reached out to the officer and the officer’s fiancé once he learned of the situation.

“We’ve of course apologized to him, all the Newton Police officers and, in fact, everyone in the community,” Graves said. “In fact, I’ve even met with the lieutenant with the Newton Police Department this morning, and we’re even going to plan a community event working with the Newton Police officers within the next week just to show our support for the officers and the community.”

NEWTON, Kan. -- An officer and his fiancé say they found an unexpected surprise at a fast food restaurant. Now some are upset online.

The couple went to order food at Taco Bell Saturday night in Newton. When they received their order, they found the word "PIG" written on top of some of their food.

The message, they believe, was in reference to the officer's work in law enforcement.

The couple called and spoke to a manager on duty.

"I was told I could bring the 5 tacos back and she would have them remade," the couple shared with us. "I advised her that we were both working and that wasn't an option. She then said she would leave a note to refund our money and get the food remade."

KAKE News has reached out to Taco Bell. Once we hear back from them, we will share the company's side of the story.
