Paul LePage had threatened to withhold state funds from a Fairfield nonprofit organization over its decision to hire House Speaker Mark Eves as its next president.\n\nLePage essentially admitted to it in a June 25 news release.\n\n\u201cTo provide half-a-million dollars in taxpayer funding to a charter school that would be headed by Maine\u2019s most vehement anti-charter-school politician is not only the height of hypocrisy, it is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d the statement from LePage read.\n\nHe made an even more unequivocal statement four days later, responding to a question from WMTW reporter Paul Merrill.\n\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could, I would. Absolutely. Why wouldn\u2019t I? Tell me why I wouldn\u2019t take the taxpayer money to prevent somebody to go into a school and destroy it. Because his heart\u2019s not into doing the right thing for Maine people.\u201d\n\nBut more than four months later, the 12 lawmakers digging into the situation that prompted allegations that LePage abused his authority and calls for his impeachment have uncovered, well, a muddle. Those searching for a smoking gun to indict LePage haven\u2019t found one.\n\nThere is, by and large, agreement on the key facts. There\u2019s no question that LePage\u2019s intervention with Eves\u2019 appointment at Good Will-Hinckley caused the nonprofit organization\u2019s board, concerned by the prospect of losing $530,000 in state funding, to rescind its offer to the Democratic House speaker. And there\u2019s no question that representatives of Good Will-Hinckley and the Harold Alfond Foundation, a major Hinckley donor, came away from interactions with the governor and his representatives with the impression that Good Will-Hinckley risked a major state funding loss because of the person it hired as its leader.\n\nBut Government Oversight Committee members have yet to uncover a specific instance in which anyone from the LePage administration explicitly told Good Will-Hinckley its state funding was in jeopardy unless it reneged on its agreement to hire Eves \u2014 as LePage said he had done.\n\nThere was the handwritten note from LePage to Hinckley board chairman John Moore. But Moore has said the note, which he threw away, did not explicitly mention state funding. It said something along the lines of, \u201cI would have trouble supporting Hinckley if you hire such a hack,\u201d Moore recalled to investigators from the Legislature\u2019s Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability.\n\nAnd there was the conversation between LePage adviser Aaron Chadbourne and Good Will-Hinckley lobbyist Sara Vanderwood after LePage learned of Eves\u2019 hire. Vanderwood told lawmakers Thursday that Chadbourne indicated the Eves hire would result in Good Will-Hinckley \u201closing LePage\u2019s support.\u201d Again, there was no specific mention of funding, but Vanderwood came away with the impression that Good Will-Hinckley\u2019s state funding \u2014 which she had been hired to protect \u2014 was in jeopardy. Chadbourne told lawmakers he didn\u2019t intend to communicate a threat of lost funding.\n\nThen there was LePage\u2019s phone call to Greg Powell, chairman of the Harold Alfond Foundation, whose financial support of Good Will-Hinckley helped turn the organization around after it nearly closed in 2009. The foundation\u2019s support was contingent upon the state meeting its funding obligations, Powell said Thursday.\n\nDuring the phone conversation, LePage told Powell he couldn\u2019t support the organization if it hired Eves. To Powell, the word \u201csupport\u201d meant state funding. But LePage never explicitly mentioned state funding, and Powell never asked the governor for clarification.\n\n\u201cSupport\u201d from the LePage administration may have meant moral support for Good Will-Hinckley and the governor\u2019s continued championing of the organization. It\u2019s hard to believe that\u2019s all it could mean, though, especially in the context of state policy, given the range of people to whom LePage and members of his administration proactively communicated the governor\u2019s pending loss of support and given LePage\u2019s public statements in June.\n\nLePage has yet to directly speak about the matter under oath. Perhaps, as part of Eves\u2019 civil lawsuit against him, LePage will shed clarity on his actions and the intent behind them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editorial: The lawmakers digging into the situation that prompted allegations that LePage abused his authority and calls for his impeachment have uncovered, well, a muddle.
