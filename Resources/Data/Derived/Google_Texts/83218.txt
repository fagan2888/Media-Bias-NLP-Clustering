John Johnson sat down with Mac Barnes for WTOK’s On the Record program.

Barnes is the head football coach at Lamar School. Barnes highlighted the importance of teaching children leadership at an early age. He also went into detail about what society might or might not be doing right when it comes to future generations.

"We understand what we're doing good in education and what we're doing good in parenting,” Barnes explains. “We realize this, we're not doing a real good job in those areas that are harder to measure; the social, emotionally and things like this."

On the Record can be seen on WTOK every Sunday evening at 5:30 p.m.
