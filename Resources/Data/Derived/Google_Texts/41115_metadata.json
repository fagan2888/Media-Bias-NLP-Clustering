One year later, we still don\u2019t know how either effort will end. But their fortunes may have diverged.\n\nWhat had started with a walkout by a couple hundred fast food workers in a single city has spread to pull thousands off the job in a hundred municipalities this month. Those strikes reflect the theory behind several of 2013\u2019s high-profile U.S. union-backed non-union organizing campaigns: that courageous and well-crafted strikes that don\u2019t shut down a workplace, mobilize a majority, or continue indefinitely could effectively engage co-workers and an array of customers, shareholders, politicians and reporters. In fast food perhaps more than anywhere, that theory could boast incremental but real success this year. Stephen Colbert skewered McDonalds, individual stores succumbed to comparatively hefty raises, and workers in places from Wausau to Windsor Locks followed the lead of unseen co-workers in Chicago and St. Louis. It remains to be seen whether the campaign can squeeze fast food giants in a way that\u2019s strong or sustained enough to force major corporate concessions \u2014 and, if it does, how well the strikers and the Service Employees International Union align when it comes to defining an acceptable deal.\n\nLike the fast food effort, the Wal-Mart uprising this year captured a slice of public consciousness, and can credibly claim credit for corporate moves to mollify workers. But by all appearances, the retailer\u2019s most dramatic reaction to the ongoing strike wave was a purge of over twenty participants \u2014 and it took a toll. While a campaign architect pledged to me in May that \u201cwe\u2019re certainly going to prove it\u2019s growing this year,\u201d how Black Friday 2013 stacks up against last year\u2019s depends on how you count.\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving 2012, organizers say over 400 Wal-Mart employees went on strike. One year later, after promising \u201cwidespread, massive strikes and protests,\u201d the campaign focused the day itself on civil disobedience by activists (a mix of Wal-Mart employees and supporters). Organizers have since released tallies of that day\u2019s arrestees (116), protests (1,448) and #WalmartStrikers tweets (over 83,000), but no figure for the number of Wal-Mart employees who participated. While the president of the United Food & Commercial Workers union this fall emphasized that the effort could embarrass Wal-Mart even without pulling 500,000 workers out on strike, whether it can effectuate a true transformation in the world\u2019s largest private employer depends on whether a still-courageous minority can compel more co-workers to defy their well-founded fears.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2013 was a year of unexpected vulnerability and vitality \u2014 and the year fast food and Wal-Mart campaigns diverged", "title": "From fast food strikes to Wal-Mart: 2013 and the year in labor", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "2013 was a year of unexpected vulnerability and vitality \u2014 and the year fast food and Wal-Mart campaigns diverged", "title": "From fast food strikes to Wal-Mart: 2013 and the year in labor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/26/from_fast_food_strikes_to_wal_mart_2013_and_the_year_in_labor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/year_in_labor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2013 was a year of unexpected vulnerability and vitality \u2014 and the year fast food and Wal-Mart campaigns diverged", "title": "From fast food strikes to Wal-Mart: 2013 and the year in labor", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/year_in_labor.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2013, AFL-CIO, Editor's Picks, fast food strikes, Labor, McDonalds, SEIU, Unions, Wal-Mart, Walmart", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc82e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2013, AFL-CIO, Editor's Picks, fast food strikes, Labor, McDonalds, SEIU, Unions, Wal-Mart, Walmart, Elections News, Media News, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis time 13 months ago, low-wage non-union workers had just mounted first-of-their kind strikes against the behemoths of the post-crash economy: fast food and Wal-Mart.\nIn fast food perhaps more than anywhere, that theory could boast incremental but real success this year.\nLike the fast food effort, the Wal-Mart uprising this year captured a slice of public consciousness, and can credibly claim credit for corporate moves to mollify workers.\nWhat had started with a walkout by a couple hundred fast food workers in a single city has spread to pull thousands off the job in a hundred municipalities this month.\nOrganizers have since released tallies of that day\u2019s arrestees (116), protests (1,448) and #WalmartStrikers tweets (over 83,000), but no figure for the number of Wal-Mart employees who participated."}
