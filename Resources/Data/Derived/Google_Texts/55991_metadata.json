This is not because the GOP has found a coherent message or a compelling messenger but because Obama\u2019s base has lost that lovin\u2019 feelin\u2019.\n\nA poll released on Monday by Pew Research says that while 90 percent of liberal Democrats still profess approval of how President Obama is doing his job \u2014 more than double his approval in the population overall \u2014 the percentage who say they \u201cstrongly approve\u201d has plunged to 54 percent, down almost 20 percent from just six months ago.\n\nCompared to George W. Bush at the same point in his presidency, Obama has more total support from his base (90 percent of liberal Democrats versus Bush\u2019s 82 percent support among conservative Republicans) but far less \u201cstrong support\u201d (54 percent to Bush\u2019s 65 percent). A strong supporter is a likely voter; any other supporter could just as easily stay home on Election Day.\n\nIn the 2006 midterm elections, the Bush analog to the upcoming 2014 midterms, with more strong support for President Bush than Obama has now among their respective bases, Democrats picked up 31 seats in the House of Representatives, ending a Republican majority and installing Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) as Speaker of the House.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats picked up six seats by defeating Republican incumbents.\n\nIn the 2006 elections, as Wikipedia notes, \u201cno Congressional or gubernatorial seat held by a Democrat was won by a Republican.\u201d\n\nSix years later, it was no accident that most of Barack Obama\u2019s traffic-snarling trips to key swing states during the 2012 election cycle were visits to universities in Colorado (he visited CU three times in 2012), North Carolina, Iowa, Ohio and elsewhere, offering platitudes about college affordability. Obama was dependent on young, idealistic, and na\u00efve young adults to win re-election.\n\nA poll just prior to the election showed that college students preferred Obama to Mitt Romney by 30 percentage points, with an even larger gap in swing states where Obama focused most of his campaigning. And these young adults turned out in much larger numbers than the pundits had expected, with an estimated 50 percent turnout among voters ages 18 to 29, making up 19 percent of the electorate.\n\nOne study of the 2012 election concludes that \u201cwithout young people, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and Pennsylvania would have flipped from blue to red,\u201d giving the election to Romney. You don\u2019t need to go that far. If a moderate fraction of young voters were disinclined to participate in an election, or, even more impactfully, switched from Democrat to Republican, it could completely change American elections, many of which are decided by small single-digit percentage changes in voter preferences.\n\nAmong young adults those preferences are changing dramatically: A recent Harvard survey of 18- to 29-year olds shows plunging approval of Obama, down to 41 percent (from 52 percent last year), and now tracking with older Americans\u2019 views. Along with a substantial decline in Democratic Party self-identification by 18-24 year olds, 52 percent of that group says they would recall President Obama if they could. And with more recent data, Fox News reported on Wednesday that Obama approval among registered voters under the age of 35 is down to 37 percent, lower than any other age group.\n\nFor conservatives, the good news here is substantial. By demonstrating not just incompetence but overt lies the Obama administration is undermining the faith of an increasingly libertarian millennial cohort in the Nanny State and its Democratic pied pipers.\n\nAdditionally, the Obama propagandists are \u2014 remarkably for people so effective with Facebook and Twitter during the last two presidential elections \u2014 showing a strangely off-putting social media aesthetic.\n\nTheir latest and perhaps greatest fail is \u201cpajama boy,\u201d an effete plaid-wearing cocoa-sipping geek, as their face of the generic young adult who should sign up for Obamacare.\n\nAppropriately snarky reactions from the Twitterverse include Dana Loesch\u2019s \u201cAll-natural birth control right here, ladies\u201d as well as dozens of hilarious mash-ups and photo manipulations.\n\nWhat typical guy would take guidance from a character whose most common descriptive seems to be \u201cdouche\u201d? For that matter, what young woman would?\n\nAs Reason magazine\u2019s Nick Gillespie points out, \u201cIf you think the latest bid to reboot the public image of Obamacare is absolutely godawful, disturbing, pathetic, you name it (I know I do!), I\u2019ve got news for you: You\u2019re probably not the audience for it.\u201d\n\nBut the problem for Democrats everywhere is that if the \u201chipster douchitude on a cracker\u201d is the left\u2019s \u201cin-group,\u201d that is a very thin reed on which to attach a political campaign. Getting the majority of graduate students in the Department of Comparative Lesbian Eskimo Literature isn\u2019t going to win Senate elections, especially in competitive upcoming races in states like Louisiana, Arkansas, South Dakota, and West Virginia. (Boulder is another story.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just young people who are abandoning the false promise of \u201chope and change.\u201d\n\nA Gallup poll released earlier this month shows massive declines among all of Obama\u2019s core base groups, led by a stunning 23 percent drop in Obama\u2019s approval among Hispanics since last December. Among those earning less than $24,000 a year, the plunge was 18 percent. Nonwhite support of Obama fell 17 percent (though it still remains high at 65 percent). Support among moderates fell 16 percent and among 18-29 year-olds tumbled 15 percent, both resting under 50 percent with groups Democrats must have to win.\n\nAnd so the Obama presidency circles the drain.\n\nUnion members are furious about the impact of Obamacare on their \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans. In August, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has over 40,000 members in the United States, dissolved their ties with the AFL-CIO based in large part on the AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka\u2019s active role in helping Obamacare become law.\n\nSeveral other large labor unions are now suffering buyer\u2019s remorse over the ironically named Affordable Care Act. Union dissatisfaction with the Obama administration has become intense enough that even the Washington Post\u2019s Ezra Klein was compelled to report on it.\n\nAmong reporters, however, it\u2019s more of a Silver Blaze situation: notable for the lapdogs not barking. Some are reluctantly recognizing that what little credibility they and their profession have left requires telling today\u2019s political stories with near-honesty rather than serving as Obama\u2019s human shields.\n\nOf course there are holdouts: The slavishly pro-Obama NBC News begins a story about the president\u2019s 38 percent job approval in Iowa by saying, \u201cNot that he\u2019s running for anything again.\u201d I\u2019m sure that makes the reporter feel better.\n\nThat\u2019s par for the \u201cjournalistic\u201d course among the usual old-line news outlets whose J-school-graduate employees are inconsolable as the legacy of their \u201chistoric\u201d president swirls in the bowl like Tuesday\u2019s pot roast, substantially less appealing after being fully digested.\n\nAnd while the Hollywood celebrity elite try to stand their ground, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan believes that \u201cNew York\u2019s Democrats, to the degree they ever loved the president, don\u2019t love him anymore, and have moved on. They are not thinking about what progress he might make in Washington next year, they\u2019re talking about what Hillary might do the year after that.\u201d\n\nYet all this talk about President Obama obscures a larger point, though one not lost on likely-to-be-ex-Senator Mark Pryor (D-AR) and other vulnerable Democrats \u2014 or on the declining Mrs. Clinton herself: The flush isn\u2019t just sucking away Obama\u2019s last measure of relevancy, but the relevancy of his party and his philosophy, and the morale and commitment of their supporters.\n\nThe last remaining glimmer of Obama\u2019s political capital and personal appeal, and thus his ability to help vulnerable Democrats in the 2014 elections and beyond, is flowing into the septic tank of Progressive history.\n\nAs of now, President Obama is to Democratic contenders what an accidentally flushed necklace would be to a woman trying to impress a date \u2014 if she pulled it out of the muck and put it around her neck without first washing it off.\n\nSome things you just have to let go.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc79d\"", "article_summary": "Along with a substantial decline in Democratic Party self-identification by 18-24 year olds, 52 percent of that group says they would recall President Obama if they could.\nAnd with more recent data, Fox News reported on Wednesday that Obama approval among registered voters under the age of 35 is down to 37 percent, lower than any other age group.\nA strong supporter is a likely voter; any other supporter could just as easily stay home on Election Day.\nNonwhite support of Obama fell 17 percent (though it still remains high at 65 percent).\nObama was dependent on young, idealistic, and na\u00efve young adults to win re-election."}
