Which team will win the World Cup on Sunday: the one that’s perceived as “powerful,” “focused” and “committed”? Or, its rival, described mostly as “confident” and full of “flair,” but “unconvincing”?

If perception prevails, bet on Germany.

Linguists at Cambridge University Press have mined a multibillion-word database of written and spoken English language sources to identify the words that media websites used most frequently in connection with each of the 32 national teams in the tournament. The words, mostly nouns and adjectives, range from “woeful” for South Korea (which lost two games and drew one) to “powerful” for Germany, which upset home-country favorite Brazil (“emotional”) in a semifinal this week and faces Argentina (“confident”) on Sunday.

Confidence counts, of course. (Think “The Little Engine That Could,” or “The Tortoise and the Hare.”) Moreover, perception — limited, in this case, to a survey of English language online newspapers, news and sports websites and blogs from a week before the tournament to this week’s semifinals, before and after final scores — doesn’t necessarily trump reality.
