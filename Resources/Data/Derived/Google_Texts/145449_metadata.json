So let's all take a minute to watch one of the latest viral videos:\n\nMovie tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme's \"epic split\" between two moving Volvo trucks.\n\nNaturally, it's got folks asking questions.\n\na) Whether it's real?\n\nb) How did they do that?\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, what you see is really what you get. Volvo says Van Damme does have one foot on each truck as the two vehicles slowly back up and get farther apart.\n\nBut Van Damme, known to fans as the \"muscles from Brussels,\" wasn't in any real danger. The Journal writes that:\n\n\"Van Damme's feet [weren't] secured to the mirrors, video director Andreas Nilsson said, \"but we had him rigged [with a wire] so that if he would fall off he wouldn't die, obviously.\"\n\nAs Mashable adds, \"the ad is designed to show off the trucks' Volvo Dynamic Steering.\"\n\nThe trucks go backwards, Volvo public relations manager Anders Vilhelmsson tells the Journal, because \"we all know that going in reverse is a bit more difficult than going forward. ... We felt that would be the ultimate test.\"\n\nThe stunt, Vihelmsson says, was done in one take.\n\nThis blogger has to say that his legs \u2014 which are a few years older than the 53-year-old Van Damme's \u2014 ache just watching.\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR.
