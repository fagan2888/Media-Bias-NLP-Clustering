Church, appeared in court on Friday. The 21-year-old pleaded not guilty to charges that he had lied to authorities and concealed information about the attack. Meek was arrested Thursday night.\n\nBack in June, Meek told NBC that Roof had made a series of racist comments, but had not given him specifics about his alleged plans or targets:\n\nHe just said he wanted to do something crazy. I didn't know what his crazy plan was. I didn't know that he wanted to hurt black people, because he didn't say that.\n\nMeek was eventually indicted after investigators continued to look into the case. What they determined: \u201cMeek\u2019s statements and representations denying such specifics were false, fictitious and fraudulent when made.\u201d\n\nAccording to the AP, if convicted, Meek could face up to five years for lying and three years for concealing information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal authorities say that Joey Meek concealed information about the suspect\u2019s possible plan to attack the South Carolina church.", "author": "Adam Chandler", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Federal authorities say that Joey Meek concealed information about the suspect\u2019s possible plan to attack the South Carolina church.", "title": "Could Dylann Roof's Friend Have Prevented the Charleston Shooting?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/09/RTX1HMJO/facebook.jpg?1442606200", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/09/charleston-shooting-dylann-roof/406213/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0099\"", "article_summary": "I didn't know that he wanted to hurt black people, because he didn't say that.\nThe 21-year-old pleaded not guilty to charges that he had lied to authorities and concealed information about the attack.\nI didn't know what his crazy plan was.\nJoey Meek, the South Carolina man who hosted the suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof in the days before the massacre at Mother Emanuel A.M.E.
