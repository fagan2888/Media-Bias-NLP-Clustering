× Internet Abbreviations: What They Really Mean

People often ask me what it’s like to be working at one of the biggest talk radio stations in the country at the age of twenty three. I really like it! Therefore I feel like it’s my responsibility to serve as a translator between you and the millennial in your life.

I want to make your life easier by translating the abbreviations that have confused you on the phone that you probably paid for.

LOL: “Laugh out Loud” or “Laughing out Loud” Used when you are laughing, or not laughing and just want the other person to think that you find them amusing.

BRB: “Be right back.” Used mostly when you are tired of texting the person so you pretend to have a reason that pulls you away from the phone.

OMW: “On my way” Used mostly when you aren’t actually on your way. It’s what you say when you forget about something you’re supposed to be at and you’re just now leaving.

FYEO: “For your eyes only” It means you should probably take their phone from them. Or at least have a serious conversation with them.

IMHO: “In my humble opinion” Usually the thought associated with this abbreviation is neither humble or well-informed.

WTH: “What the heck (or Hell)” Which is the abbreviation version of your face when you don’t understand something that the millennial in your life is doing.

KTASWDELISM: “Kale tastes awful so why does Eanet love it so much?” Used by me… texting my Dad… about Dave Eanet and his love for Kale.

US2TWID: “Using Siri to text (or Tweet) while I drive” This is usually used as an explanation for why typos exist in previous texts or tweets.

DUFLP: “Do you feel lucky punk?” Used exclusively by Clint Eastwood.

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ: Your kid is learning the alphabet.

Hope that helps. Feel free to share yours below.
