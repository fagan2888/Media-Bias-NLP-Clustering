The experiences put them at increased risk for depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders as well as difficulties with school, work and relationships.\n\nMitchell and colleagues analyzed data from a national telephone survey of 4,114 children aged 2 to 17 years. Roughly half were at least 10 years old and answered their own questions during the phone interviews with researchers. Caregivers answered questions on behalf of kids under 10.\n\nSlightly more than half of the participants were boys. About 57 percent of the kids in the study were white, while 15 percent were black and 19 percent were Latino.\n\nMany lived with two adults, whether their biological or adoptive parents or stepparents, while about 36 percent of the kids lived with single parents or another caregiver.\n\nFamilies in the study came from all income levels, with about 62 percent of children living in middle-class households.\n\nBoys, minorities, and kids from low-income families or households not headed by two biological or adoptive parents were most likely to be exposed to weapon violence, the study found.\n\nMuch of the violence involved objects such as sticks, rocks, bottles, but about 3 percent of children reported exposure to guns and knives.\n\nGun and knife violence didn\u2019t vary by gender, although older children were more likely to experience it. The odds of being a witness or victim in an attack with these lethal weapons were higher for kids not living with their biological or adoptive parents as well as for kids who carried these weapons themselves or had friends who did.\n\n\u201cThis study represents typical American kids at a range of incomes and shows that their exposure to violence is very widespread and common,\u201d said Dr. Denise Dowd, a specialist in pediatric emergency medicine at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nChildren who are repeatedly exposed to weapons, whether it\u2019s domestic violence or gangs or bullying or fighting at school, are at risk for particularly troubling outcomes, said Dowd, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. These kids can experience what\u2019s known as toxic stress, when traumatic events produce changes in the brain that can lead to other health problems.\n\nStress sets off alarms in the brain that trigger the nervous system to release hormones to sharpen the senses, tense the muscles, speed up the pulse and deepen breathing. Commonly called a flight or flight response, this biological reaction helps people defend themselves in threatening situations.\n\nRoutine exposure to stress can lead to immune system problems, heart disease, nervous system complications and mental health disorders, previous research has found.\n\n\u201cWhen you are exposed to this toxic stress, the fight or flight instinct is all you have, whether you\u2019re being attacked by a bear in the woods or your father comes home drunk and screaming at you,\u201d said Dowd. \u201cThese kids can shut down or they can become hypersensitive and ready to fight at the slightest provocation.\u201d\n\nOften, exposure to weapons happens in the home, making it crucial that parents keep guns locked, unloaded and out of reach, she said.\n\nParents should also be on the lookout for signs that kids may be experiencing violence at school or in the community. Even when children don\u2019t talk about it, they might indicate a potential problem by refusing to go to school, complaining of headaches or stomachaches that don\u2019t appear to have a medical cause.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing any parent can do is create a home environment that\u2019s nurturing and supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, be attuned to sudden changes in how children act because before they have words for what is going on their bodies will respond.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Rapaport)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "more, one, four, us, kids, exposed, weapon, violence", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "More than one in four U.S. children are exposed to weapon violence before their eighteenth birthday, either as victims or witnesses, a large study suggests.", "title": "More Than One In Four U.S. Kids Exposed To Weapon Violence", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/more-one-four-us-kids-exposed-weapon-violence-336974", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/08/weapon-violence.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than one in four U.S. children are exposed to weapon violence before their eighteenth birthday, either as victims or witnesses, a large study suggests.", "title": "More Than One In Four U.S. Kids Exposed To Weapon Violence", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/more-one-four-us-kids-exposed-weapon-violence-336974", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/08/weapon-violence.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/08/weapon-violence.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-06-08T09:38:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T09:38:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "More than one in four U.S. children are exposed to weapon violence before their eighteenth birthday, either as victims or witnesses, a large study suggests."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9116\"", "article_summary": "A large study suggests that one in four U.S. children are exposed to weapon violence before their eighteenth birthday.\nBoys, minorities, and kids from low-income families or households not headed by two biological or adoptive parents were most likely to be exposed to weapon violence, the study found.\nPhoto courtesy of Shutterstock(Reuters Health) - - More than one in four U.S. children are exposed to weapon violence before their eighteenth birthday, either as victims or witnesses, a large study suggests.\nParents should also be on the lookout for signs that kids may be experiencing violence at school or in the community.\nAbout one in 33 kids are directly assaulted during incidents involving guns or knives, researchers report in the journal Pediatrics."}
