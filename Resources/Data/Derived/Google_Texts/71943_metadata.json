In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich pulls into a statistical tie with 43 percent to Hillary\u2019s 44 percent of the vote. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was in a statistical tie with Clinton in his home state, 43 percent to 44 percent. Sen. Marco Rubio lags behind by 10 points, 39 to 49 percent.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Malley drills Obama from the left - In a NYT op-ed, Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, D-Md., writes against President Obama\u2019s decision to allow drilling along the Atlantic coast: \u201cTo allow drilling off the Atlantic Coast is to willfully forget Deepwater\u2019s awful lesson even as the economic, environmental and public health consequences continue to reverberate in communities along the gulf.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The Des Moines Register reports that O\u2019Malley has booked at least two upcoming visits to Iowa in addition to travel to New Hampshire and South Carolina.]\n\n\n\nWHY ARE REPUBLICANS CATCHING DEMS\u2019 VACCINE WOES?\n\nKatherine Miller in BuzzFeed: \u201cBut who are these people pandering to? What part, exactly, of the Republican coalition so opposes mandatory requirements that, in the context of a measles outbreak, vaccination is a compromise issue? Because here\u2019s the truth: This is largely a liberal fringe issue. The people not vaccinating their kids against the diseases once declared defeated don\u2019t live in South Carolina or Indiana or a particularly conservative part of Ohio or Florida. That isn\u2019t where people are contracting the whooping cough\u2026 No, the strongholds are in places like Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Marin County, California. The affluent, the educated, the enlightened, the ones who believe in purity and science \u2014 people in liberal enclaves are the ones rejecting one of the 20th century\u2019s major scientific achievements.\n\n\n\n[Marin [Calif.] Independent Journal: \u201cAt Greenwood School in Mill Valley, 61 percent of the kindergartners are partially or completely unvaccinated, according to state figures. At San Geronimo Valley Elementary in San Geronimo, 58 percent of the kindergarten children are partially or completely unvaccinated.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, as of 2011, 19 states had \u201cphilosophical\u201d exemptions \u2014 the way you might oppose designated hitter, except in this instance, you oppose a medical professional immunizing your child from rubella, and cool, that works. Many of those states, with a fair amount of exceptions like Texas and Louisiana, conjure the image of people hiking in fleeces. California, Vermont, Washington state, Maine, New Mexico, Colorado. These are states where one can oppose vaccination for personal reasons.\n\n\n\nJEB JUMPS IN FOR CPAC\n\nNRO:\u201c[F]ormer Florida governor [Jeb Bush] will speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual event hosted by the American Conservative Union and attended largely by the party\u2019s young activists\u2026.The exact date of Bush\u2019s remarks has yet to be determined, but the conference will take place from February 25\u201328 in National Harbor, Maryland. \u2026. Several other potential 2016 candidates will join Bush at the conference, including neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, former Texas governor Rick Perry, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeltway bucks, too - Politico : \u201cJeb Bush [R-Fla.] is starting to shake the D.C. money tree. The former Florida governor is headed to the Beltway Feb. 17 for two fundraising events for his leadership political action committee, called Right to Rise. Bush is slated to attend a late morning and luncheon reception at BGR Group\u2019s Washington offices. The invitation lists three levels of contributions: $10,000 for co-hosts, $5,000 for hosts and $1,000 for attendees. Another fundraiser that evening will be at Laura and Jamie Wareham\u2019s McLean, Virginia home.\u201d\n\n\n\nBushworld 3.0 - The Hill : \u201cFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has hired two experienced Republican communications operatives to advise his political action committee and potential 2016 presidential campaign. Danny Diaz and Jon Downs will become advisers to Bush\u2019s Right to Rise PAC, an organization that could serve as the precursor to his official bid. They will likely join a campaign organization should he choose to run\u2026Diaz was a top communications adviser to Sen. John McCain\u2019s [R-Ariz.] campaign for the presidency in 2008, and he worked on the 2004 reelection effort of former President George W. Bush. Downs is an ad creator who has worked for Sen. Dan Sullivan [R-Alaska] and Sen. Ted Cruz [R-Texas] and is known for aggressive spots.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Choosing up - The Houston Chronicle reports that Bush\u2019s new hires mean the end of the relationship between the presidential campaign of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Terry Nelson, the former political director for George W. Bush who is a partner of Diaz and Downs at the firm FP1 Strategies.]\n\n\n\n\u201cI think many candidates are at the point now where we\u2019re starting to assess political support financial support, build a team. I am doing all those things as well. Certainly my name recognition isn't what the other candidates is because I haven't been in politics my whole life.\u201d \u2013 Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nWALKER TELLS IOWANS HE\u2019S ONE OF ROMNEY\u2019S \u2018FRESH FACES\u2019\n\nDes Moines Register: \u201cIn what sounded like a full-throttle campaign speech, Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker went on the attack against his presumptive rivals in the presidential race, telling Iowans on a conference call Monday night that the country needs a proven leader who can take on everyone from Washington liberals to terrorists\u2026During a question-and-answer session, a Des Moines man mentioned that when Mitt Romney officially bowed out of any 2016 speculation on Friday, the 2012 nominee said it's time for fresh leadership in the Republican party. \u2018What do you think he meant by that and is that you?\u2019 the caller asked Walker. Walker answered that he phoned Romney, \u2018a good and decent man,\u2019 on Friday. \u2018I thanked him specifically for pointing that out,\u2019 Walker said. \u2018I think, you know, there's others \u2013 my friend [Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.] is about the same age and so in terms of fresh faces I guess he and I would be in a similar vein,\u2019 Walker said.\u201d\n\n\n\nHello, Wisconsin - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: \u201cGov. Scott Walker [R-Wis.] hired another group of political operatives in preparation for his anticipated presidential campaign\u2026Kirsten Kukowski, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, will serve as \u2018Our American Revival\u2019 communications director\u2026The Tarrance Group, which has been a key player in Walker in governor\u2019s races, will be heavily represented. Ed Goeas, president and CEO of Tarrance, will serve as senior adviser... The data officer will be Mark Stephenson, who worked on the campaign for Iowa's new Republican U.S. senator, Joni Ernst.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHRISTIE HAS HILLARY\u2019S HIGH-FLYING HABITS\n\nNYT: \u201cAs Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey waited to depart on a trade mission to Israel in 2012, his entourage was delayed by a late arrival: Mr. Christie\u2019s father, who had accidentally headed to the wrong airport. A commercial flight might have left without him, but in this case, there was no rush. The private plane, on which Mr. Christie had his own bedroom, had been lent by Sheldon G. Adelson, the billionaire casino owner and supporter of Israel\u2026 He has also quietly let others pay the bills. That tendency, the governor himself says he wants to \u2018squeeze all the juice out of the orange,\u2019 has put him in ethically questionable situations, taking benefits from those who stand to benefit from him.\u201d\n\n\n\nSound Off: 2016 Power Index - \u201cStill think [Mitt Romney] would be best president but recognize that the media, conservative pundits and talk show hosts will not hear of this and would beat on him constantly were he to stay in. Given that, my next pick is Scott Walker. He appears to have a strong back bone, discipline and belief in fiscal conservatism. Only time will tell.\u201d --Nancy Jewett\n\n\n\n\u201cI like [Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis.] no nonsense approach- he does not seem to have any baggage and is not constrained to call them as he sees them!!! Refreshing in today's political world!!!!\u201d \u2013 Thomas Flanagan\n\n\n\n\u201cThough we haven't heard from him yet on the national stage, I continue to like John Kasich. Every chance I get I tell folks about his common-sense sound and how he's been doing well in Ohio (a not-so-red state). RUN, JOHN, RUN!!\u201d \u2013Tom Saunders\n\n\n\n\u201cFor a man who has the courage of honest, American, truthful, do what is right and Godly convictions, who will do what is RIGHT instead of what is political and expedient - Ben Carson.\u201d \u2013 Jim Magwood\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\n\u201cBut February made me shiver. With every paper I\u2019d deliver, bad news on the doorstep. I couldn\u2019t take one more step,\u201d say the lines from Don McLean\u2019s first epic Baby Boomer coming of age saga. And it was, in fact, this day in 1959 that \u201cthe music died\u201d when Buddy Holly, J.P. \u201cThe Big Bopper\u201d Richardson, and Ritchie Valens all perished in a plane crash en route to Fargo, N.D.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has unveiled a bill to repeal ObamaCare. National Review: \u201c[Cruz\u2019s] \u2018Obamacare Repeal Act\u2019 that would repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2018as if such Act had not been enacted.\u2019 The text of Cruz\u2019s bill to repeal the 2,700-page law, which spawned another 10,000 pages of regulations, barely runs onto the third page. It comes as Republicans have debated whether to use a procedural tactic that circumvents filibusters known as reconciliation to repeal the legislation\u2026The bill is co-sponsored by 44 Senate Republicans, including [McConnell]\u2026 and several leading members of the Obamacare working group that is mulling the GOP\u2019s possible response to a major anti-Obamacare lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\n\n[In WashEx, Byron York examines how ObamaCare will cause headaches for Democrats in the 2016 presidential race.]\n\n\n\nSENATE DEMS PREPARE TO OBSTRUCT IMMIGRATION PLAN\n\nWith just 25 days until the agency runs out of money, the first major funding fight comes to a head today as the Senate takes up DHS funding bill. Roll Call: \u201cDemocrats are planning to block proceeding to a House-passed Homeland Security appropriations bill that would also negate President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. It\u2019s a turnabout from a few months ago, when Democrats were in charge and railed against Republicans whenever they would vote to block debate on a bill\u2026. \u2018It seems our Republican colleagues are willing to shut down the government despite the fact that we have such security needs here in this country,\u2019 [Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.] said. \u2018They dislike DREAMers more than they dislike ISIS, and it\u2019s just unbelievable.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nTick, tick, tick - David Drucker lays out the legislative timeline, stressing how delivery and passage of a sound budget is where the rubber meets the road for Republicans: \u201c[T]o take Obama on and make the case that smaller governments and freer markets are better, Congressional Republicans have to pass their own budget resolution showing their own funding priorities. That means at least 218 Republicans in the House, and 51 in the Senate, are going to have to agree on a plan.\u201d]\n\n\n\nBattered Reid seeks to reclaim clout - Las Vegas Review-Journal: \u201cA still battered-looking Sen. Harry Reid [D-Nevada] made a return to the Senate floor on Monday, and immediately jumped into a fray over immigration and homeland security\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest on the DHS funding battle.]\n\n\n\nTARGETING SCANDAL FRONT AND CENTER FOR IRS BOSS\n\nHill sources tell Fox News that a hearing at the Senate Finance Committee today with IRS Commissioner Jon Koskinen could bring a major revelation about the agency\u2019s missing emails relating to the scandal surrounding the agency\u2019s targeting of President Obama\u2019s political enemies. Koskinen\u2019s appearance follows a week in which Congress has raised concerns over the embattled agency\u2019s handling of ObamaCare subsidies, and whether taxpayer information may have been shared with political operatives in the White House.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the IRS budget clash from Capitol Hill.]\n\n\n\n[Obama wants big funding boost for IRS - The Hill : \u201cThe president\u2019s new budget calls for giving the IRS $12.9 billion in fiscal 2016, roughly an 18 percent increase over the $10.9 billion that Congress approved for the agency in the current fiscal year.\u201d]\n\n\n\nWHITE HOUSE, RED FACE\n\nIn passing along president Obama\u2019s mistaken claim that George Washington had lived and made \u201cbooze\u201d at the White House, Fox News First mistakenly claimed Thomas Jefferson was the first president to inhabit the executive mansion. But as astute readers Paul Ruby, Ron Gay, Joan Nugent, John W. Gibson and Alan Mizelle pointed out, President John Adams spent the final five months of his term in the still-unfinished home. Like President Obama, we should have done our homework!\n\n\n\nCARB PANIC\n\nIt must not have been his \u201ccheat day.\u201d WCAU reports that a man in the Philadelphia suburb of Upper Darby faced police questioning after sounding his apartment building\u2019s fire alarm because of a clogged commode. But it was the circumstances of the plumbing problem that caused the most questions. The man, who was not identified by authorities, had apparently tried to flush multiple potatoes. After his toilet clogged, he reportedly called the building\u2019s maintenance department several times. When help did not come soon enough, police say he pulled the building\u2019s fire alarm. The fire department then evacuated the three-story building to investigate.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t mind if the President sends a budget which he knows is not going to achieve anything. But when he prefaces his remarks as we just saw by saying we have to put politics aside, posing again as the one person in the country who rises above partisanship and party, speaks for the national interest, it\u2019s really grating.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
