ARLINGTON, Va. — Cathy Polley, VP health and wellness at the Food Marketing Institute and executive director for the FMI Foundation, passed earlier this week from cancer.

"I live my life to the fullest. We only get so much time in this earth, so wasting it is not an option. I try to surround myself with those who want to join me in making a difference every single day," Polley told the organization Disruptive Women in Healthcare, which had named Polley a "Woman to Watch" in 2014.

Polley started her career in 1982 as a pharmacist for eight of her 19 years with Kmart and worked her way toward director, government and trade relations for the mass market retailer. She joined the National Association of Chain Drug Stores in 2001 as VP state government affairs and continued as a staunch advocate for pharmacy with the American Pharmacists Association as SVP, chief policy officer in 2007.

Later that year, she joined the Food Marketing Institute and has both promoted in-store health and wellness solutions through the food class of trade and spearheaded FMI's support of research and education since.

"Leading the association’s health and wellness area gives me the opportunity to work with food retailers across the nation on efforts that combine pharmacy, nutrition and marketing and deliver in-store solutions for their shoppers looking to achieve healthier lifestyles," Polley told Disruptive Women in Healthcare . "I am fortunate to work on creative initiatives that help food retailers deliver against their health and wellness strategies."

Polley was a former member of the Michigan Board of Pharmacy and earned her pharmacy degree from the University of Michigan.
