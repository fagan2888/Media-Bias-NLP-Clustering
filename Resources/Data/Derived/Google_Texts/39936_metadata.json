Absolutely Not.", "article_keywords": ["going", "regarding", "iraq", "todays", "absolutely", "acted", "romney", "wars", "mccain", "bush", "won", "differently", "president", "world", "reality", "events", "say", "obama"], "article_url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/h-a-goodman/would-mccain-or-romney-ha_b_5616572.html", "article_text": "...Its assertion calls into question the wars' costs -- 6,800 U.S. troops, untold enemy and civilian dead, and a $2 trillion, and rising, bill for U.S. taxpayers. \"We committed ourselves to counterinsurgency without having a real discussion between the military and civilian leadership, and the American population --'Hey, are you good with this? Do you want to stay here for 30 or 40 years like the Korean peninsula, or are you going to run out of energy?' It's obvious: we ran out of energy.\" There was a belief in some quarters of the U.S. government that Washington and its allies were going to remake that troubled part of the world. \"Don't be so arrogant and think you're going to reshape the Middle East,\" Bolger says. \"We've basically installed authoritarian dictators.\" \"They should have been limited incursions and [then] pull out -- basically like Desert Storm,\" he adds, referring to the 1991 Gulf War that forced Saddam Hussein's forces out of neighboring Kuwait after an air campaign and 100-hour ground war. \"Some say the Iraq surge of 2007 proved counterinsurgency tactics worked. Others point out that today's Iraq is a sectarian mess, undermining that belief. As for the Afghan surge of 2010-11, well, who knows? We cannot even say, or will not even say, who won these campaigns. It sure does not seem to be us,\" Bolger wrote in the February issue in Signals, the journal of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.\n\nIt doesn't make for good GOP propaganda, but the reality is closer to Lt. Gen. Bolger's firsthand assessments than Ted Cruz's view that Obama is \"weak\" on foreign policy. When Iraq is a \"sectarian mess\" and \"we cannot even say\" who won both wars yet, the notion that President Obama could dissuade Assad or Putin through American might is ludicrous. President Romney would have had the same limitations as Obama and would have had to face the same VA crisis, ISIS catastrophe, and Syrian disaster since he would have inherited both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nThe U.S. is paying a terrible toll for our hubris in thinking we could reshape the globe (thanks neocons) and the rhetoric condemning Obama for not caring simply ignores reality. As for U.S. precedent pertaining to Russian aggression, George Bush did nothing to prevent Putin from invading Georgia in 2008. A New York Times article during Putin's first taste at reconquering lost nations highlights the fecklessness of conservatives when they had the White House:\n\nIt was the question of the day. As Russian forces massed Sunday on two fronts, Georgians were heading south with whatever they could carry. When they met Western journalists, they all said the same thing: Where is the United States? When is NATO coming? Since the conflict began, Western leaders have worked frantically to broker a cease-fire. But for Georgians -- so boisterously pro-American that Tbilisi, the capital, has aGeorge W. Bush Street -- diplomacy fell far short of what they expected. ...Georgians around Gori spoke of America plaintively, uncertainly. They were beginning to feel betrayed. \"Tell your government,\" said a man named Truber, fresh from the side of the Tbilisi hospital bed where his son was being treated for combat injuries. \"If you had said something stronger, we would not be in this.\" He had not slept for three days, and he was angry -- at himself, at Georgia, but mainly at the United States. \"If you want to help, you have to help the end,\" he said. ...One, who gave his name as Major Georgi, spoke with anger. \"Write exactly what I say,\" he said. \"Over the past few years, I lived in a democratic society. I was happy. And now America and the European Union are spitting on us.\"\n\nWhen Bush was in office, the Georgian outlook was \"If you had said something stronger, we would not be in this\" and they expressed anger towards U.S. fecklessness. We did nothing to stop Russia from invading South Ossetia and even Karl Rove's assertion that Bush was more forceful has been debunked as \"mostly false.\"\n\nBoth GOP presidential candidates, had they won, would have been shackled by the wars and economic distress that Obama inherited and would never have invaded Syria or Ukraine. The VA crisis was a long time in the making and Paul Ryan's budget goals gutted veterans of funding. Bush was also accused of wanting to provide amnesty to illegal immigrants and 13 attacks on U.S. embassies took place during Bush's presidency. McCain, Romney, and George Bush can't be described as Tea Party conservatives, so it's not beyond reason that both McCain and Romney would have a similar outlook on policy issues. Republicans can try to paint President Obama as a weak and incompetent leader, but the reality is that he's presided over a nation constrained by wars, the specter of Wall Street's 2008 collapse, and world leaders who realize all too well that we're tired of policing them.\n\nFollow H.
