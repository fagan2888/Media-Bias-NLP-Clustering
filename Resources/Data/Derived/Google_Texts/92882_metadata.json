Ex-presidents are given pensions of nearly $200,000 annually as well as funding for office space and custodial staff.\n\nThe new normal is that our ex-presidents rely on huge paydays from private interest groups to fund their lifestyles. But that flies in the face of the original intent of the presidential pension, which was to preserve the dignity of former presidents and prevent corruption.\n\nThe origins of the presidential pension\n\nThe first proposal for a presidential pension system came from steel industry magnate Andrew Carnegie, who was the world\u2019s richest man when he retired in 1901. In 1912, Carnegie offered to privately fund a $25,000 annual pension for future ex-presidents, arguing that our chief executives should be able to \u201cspend their latter days free from pecuniary cares in devoting the intimate knowledge they have gained of public affairs to the good of the country.\u201d\n\nThen-President Teddy Roosevelt, the trust-buster, criticized the proposal \u2014 not because it wasn\u2019t enough money, but because it was too much. \u201cMy interest isn\u2019t in pensions for ex-presidents but in pensions for the small man who doesn\u2019t have a chance to save, and who, when he becomes superannuated, faces the direst poverty,\u201d he said.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s successor, William Howard Taft, refused Carnegie\u2019s offer, and the idea of a presidential pension whatsoever went nowhere for decades.\n\nWhen Harry Truman was getting ready to leave the White House in 1953, he was approached by numerous employers. The Los Angeles Times reported that if he was \u201cunemployed after he leaves the White House it won\u2019t be for lack of job offers \u2026 but [he] has accepted none of them.\u201d\n\nOne of those job offers was from a Florida real estate developer, asking him to become a \u201cchairman, officer, or stockholder, at a figure of not less than $100,000\u201d \u2014 the sort of position that is commonplace today for ex-politicians.\n\n\u201cI could never lend myself to any transaction, however respectable, that would commercialize on the prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency,\u201d Truman would later write of his refusal to influence-peddle to get by.\n\nAlthough he had access to a small pension from his military service, Truman had little financial support after leaving office. He moved back into his family home in Independence, Missouri. He eventually agreed to write a memoir for Life magazine, but it was a lengthy project that provided far from luxurious stipends.\n\nIn 1958, Dwight Eisenhower and Congress finally acted, partly in response to Truman\u2019s plight, establishing the pension system for ex-presidents we have today.\n\nThe presidential path to riches\n\nBut modern presidents expect to live in luxury after they leave office, and to people with that sense of entitlement, $200,000 a year is chump change. By comparison, the median private pension benefit of individuals age 65 and older was $9,227 a year in 2014 \u2014 for those people lucky enough to have a pension in the first place.\n\nThe first ex-president to aggressively supplement his pension was Gerald Ford. He joined the boards of corporations such as 20th Century Fox, hit the paid speech circuit, and was made an honorary director by Citigroup.\n\nRonald Reagan, known for slashing the taxes of America\u2019s richest and crushing trade unions opposed by large businesses, quickly cashed out. Almost immediately after leaving office, he joined the speaker circuit, doing \u201ctwo or three\u201d speeches a month before Fortune 500 companies. It was estimated that Reagan earned $50,000 a speech.\n\nAt a time when Japan was a major trade rival with the United States, Reagan flew to Japan for a series of paid speeches. He accepted $2 million for a pair of 20-minute speeches to the Fujisankei Communications Group. An additional $5 million was arranged for expenses related to the visit.\n\nProminent business consultant Chin Ning Chu, looking back in her 1991 book on Asian business culture, wrote that the Japan speeches \u201cdemonstrated to the world that Japan has arrived \u2026 [it] put a price tag on the president of the United States.\u201d She noted that \u201cBy paying Reagan a sum so disproportionately large for his services, they sent a clear message to American political leaders: If during a politician\u2019s career he cooperates with the Japanese, then the Japanese will take care of him after retirement. There is no law against paying a former member of government for a few speeches after he has retired from public service.\u201d\n\nThen-President George H.W. Bush was asked about the practice of ex-presidents getting private sector paydays. \u201cI have no problem with that, provided it\u2019s not overdone. Everybody\u2019s got to make a living,\u201d he replied.\n\nHis son George W. Bush made at least $15 million from over 100 paid speeches between 2011 and 2015. The exact number is a mystery because former presidents are not required to disclose their income.\n\nWe know how much Bill Clinton made only because he shared a bank account with his wife when she was a senator and then secretary of state, making his income a required disclosure. The two have earned at least $139 million from speeches, including $35 million from the financial sector.\n\nAnd despite the fact that his wife is running for president, Bill Clinton has not stopped. \u201cI gotta pay our bills,\u201d he explained. One of those paid speeches last summer was before America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the primary lobbying group that plowed money into trying to defang and defeat the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI never made any money until I left the White House,\u201d Bill Clinton told a student group in 2009. \u201cI had the lowest net worth, adjusted for inflation, of any president elected in the last 100 years, including President Obama. I was one poor rascal when I took office. But after I got out, I made a lot of money.\u201d\n\nReforming the system\n\nCongress appropriated $3.5 million for presidential pensions and other benefits in 2015.\n\nMembers of Congress in both parties are sponsoring legislation that would reduce ex-presidents\u2019 pension payouts if they earn more than a predefined threshold in private sector earnings annually.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers should not have to pay for a former president\u2019s allowance if the former president is making a comfortable living earning more than $400,000 a year after leaving office,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., about the bill. The bill passed the House in January.\n\nOne recent ex-president who didn\u2019t cash out, of course, is Jimmy Carter. Perhaps not coincidentally, in a Quinnipiac University poll released in November, a plurality of Americans said Carter has had the best post-presidency.\n\nCarter \u201cseldom accepts speaking fees and when he does he typically donates the proceeds to his charitable foundation,\u201d noted the Associated Press; Carter has instead built a comfortable life by writing dozens of books.\n\nTop photo: Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W.
