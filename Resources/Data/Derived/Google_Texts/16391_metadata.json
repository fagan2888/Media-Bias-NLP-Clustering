As the baby boomer generation ages and more Americans enroll for medical care under the Affordable Care Act, the demand for doctors has grown ever more urgent.\n\nOne medical school is hoping to alleviate the shortage by gearing its curriculum and admissions standards toward getting its graduates to enter the primary care field.\n\nAt the Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University, Conn., the medical degree program matches each student with a local primary care physician as their mentor. One day per week for three years of their schooling, the students work at the physician\u2019s office to get hands-on experience.\n\nThe school also established a fellowship for one student in each class to have their full tuition paid for if they sign an agreement declaring that they intend to pursue the primary care discipline.\n\nShortage\n\nAccording to estimates by the Association of American Medical Colleges, there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary care doctors by the year 2020.\n\nAn area of medicine long considered less prestigious than its specialty counterparts like cardiology or neurology, primary care is often overlooked by medical students in favor of other better-paying fields that garner more respect within the medical community.\n\nA pediatrician and family practitioner make an average of $188,000 and $199,000 a year, respectively, compared to a neurosurgeon who makes three times that, at an average of $591,000, according to the latest data by medical consulting firm, Merritt Hawkins.\n\nNew Medical School\n\nNewly established in 2010, the school attracted 60 students to join its first class in August last year. This year, another 90 will enroll.\n\nThe school hopes to distinguish itself from more well-known and established medical schools in the country through its emphasis on primary care. \u201cAs a private school, we draw applicants from around the country and expect many of them to go back to where they grew up to practice medicine. So we see ourselves as having a national impact on primary care, because they\u2019ll be going back to where they grew up in every state of the union that needs primary care physicians,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Koeppen, the founding dean of the school. Many underserved communities across the country will benefit from more primary care doctors.\n\nFaculty at the Netter School is hired to primarily teach its medical students, unlike the faculty who mostly conduct research at research universities. \u201cFor the 28 years that I was at UConn [University of Connecticut], there was not a single faculty member hired to teach medical schools,\u201d said Koeppen, who previously served as dean for academic affairs at UConn\u2019s School of Medicine before becoming dean at Quinnipiac.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely the opposite here. Every full-time faculty member we have hired was hired for their expertise in teaching medical school,\u201d he said.\n\nIn its admissions process too, the school gives preference to accepting applicants who are more likely to go into primary care.\n\n\u201cWe know that if you come from a disadvantaged background\u2014and you can define disadvantage multiple ways\u2014you\u2019re more likely to go into primary care. And so those things are getting factored in to see who gets offered,\u201d said Koeppen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The country is in desperate need of more doctors\u2014especially primary care physicians.
