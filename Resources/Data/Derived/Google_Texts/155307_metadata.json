He just published \u201cCA Still Tied to Gold Rush-Era Water Rights System\u201d to highlight how \u201csenior water rights holders enjoy few limits on their water and nearly zero cost or accountability,\u201d yet are \u201coff-limits to many state regulations.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csenior-rights\u201d Nichols is complaining about are California\u2019s \u201criparian water rights\u201d that are included in \u201csource of title\u201d to property that \u201cabutted\u201d the \u201cwatercourse\u201d of the state\u2019s natural rivers and streams. These water rights pre-date the Legislature\u2019s action in 1914 establishing regulation of \u201cAppropriative Rights\u201d for \u201cunallocated water.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s first water-right permits were established in Spanish land grants as property rights to ensure food production to support their Colonial network of pueblos, ranchos and 21 missions. The United States took control of California in 1846 as a territory during the Mexican-American. The US government promised to protect property rights.\n\nThen all-hell-broke-loose with the 1848 discovery of gold. The 1849 Gold Rush era was a lawless time when miners and farmers claimed water rights by posting notices to trees along waterways. Gun battles over water claims were common, since water was key to dredging for gold and profitably growing the food to feed the miners.\n\nThe United States granted California statehood in 1850 and directed re-issuance of land titles, including riparian rights, to all legitimate holders under the 1851 Act of Congress\n\nLittle changed regarding water rights until the 1913 opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct demonstrated that infrastructure could dramatically change where and how much water flowed to different communities in California.\n\nTo prepare to manage the expected explosion of \u201cunappropriated\u201d water, the California Legislature passed The Water Commission Act of 1914 to establish a comprehensive permit system of \u201cAppropriative Rights\u201d regarding all new water \u201cdiversion and storage.\u201d\n\nCalifornia specifically guaranteed all pre-1914 water rights as senior if used for municipal and industrial uses, irrigation, hydroelectric generation and livestock watering.\n\nThe Act created an agency that later evolved into State Water Resources Control Board to regulate permits and licenses for California\u2019s \u201cpost-1914\u201d surface water. New permits required petitioning the state\u2019s new water agencies to demonstrate availability of \u201cunappropriated water\u201d and the ability to beneficially use new water resources.\n\nOver the next 65 years, huge amounts of \u201cunappropriated water\u201d was created by building dams and reservoirs. Shasta Lake was created by damming three rivers in 1945. Oroville, the tallest dam in the United States at 770-feet high, was finished in 1968. The state also built 10 large reservoirs from 1927 to 1979 to support a population that had grown at the time to 22.3 million.\n\nBut despite a 70 percent population growth to 38 million today, California has not built a dam or major reservoir in 36 years. Without the Legislature building any new \u201cdiversion and storage\u201d infrastructure in over three decades, it should not be surprising that there is a \u201ccrisis\u201d due to a lack of creating any new \u201cunappropriated\u201d water.\n\nNichols states, \u201cCritics say this system has created an arbitrary set of winners and losers among farms, cities and the environment, compromising the state\u2019s ability to deliver water in a fair and effective manner during painful dry spells.\u201d\n\nSan Diego, the second largest city in California and eighth-largest in America, was able to grow to 1.3 million people because \u201cunappropriated\u201d water was created through \u201cdiversion and storage\u201d infrastructure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Left wants to Hijack Cal Drought \u201cCrisis\u201d to Cancel Water Rights", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Left wants to Hijack Cal Drought \u201cCrisis\u201d to Cancel Water Rights", "title": "Left wants to Hijack Cal Drought \u201cCrisis\u201d to Cancel Water Rights", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/california-drought-sign-AP.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/04/27/left-wants-to-hijack-cal-drought-crisis-to-cancel-water-rights/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Left wants to Hijack Cal Drought \u201cCrisis\u201d to Cancel Water Rights", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/california-drought-sign-AP.jpg", "title": "Left wants to Hijack Cal Drought \u201cCrisis\u201d to Cancel Water Rights", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Appropriative Rights, Drought, riparian rights, The Water Commission Act of 1914, unappropriated water\u201d,Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "unappropriated water\u201d", "published_time": "2015-04-27T06:06:53-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe liberal California Legislature, having worsened the drought crisis by refusing to build water infrastructure, now is demanding the \u201copportunity\u201d to expropriate historic water rights.\nNew permits required petitioning the state\u2019s new water agencies to demonstrate availability of \u201cunappropriated water\u201d and the ability to beneficially use new water resources.\nThe 1849 Gold Rush era was a lawless time when miners and farmers claimed water rights by posting notices to trees along waterways.\nOver the next 65 years, huge amounts of \u201cunappropriated water\u201d was created by building dams and reservoirs.\nOroville, the tallest dam in the United States at 770-feet high, was finished in 1968."}
