David Ige appointed her to replace the late Mele Carroll as the 13th House District representative.\n\n\n\nThe Maui News / CHRIS SUGIDONO photo Apoliona Kurihara-Klein\n\nAfter hearing two hours of testimony Friday, the panel delayed voting until Tuesday afternoon. The committee is considering a bill to authorize HHSC's Maui regional system to enter into an agreement with a private entity to transition one or more of its facilities, including Maui Memorial, Kula Hospital and Lanai Community Hospital, into a new private Hawaii nonprofit corporation.\n\nThe House panel includes Maui Reps. Lynn DeCoite (East Maui, Molokai and Lanai) and Kyle Yamashita, although Yamashita was absent from Friday's hearing. An official with DeCoite's office said she was researching the bill and reserved comment until she was more familiar with it.\n\nLo told the committee that Maui Memorial is the fourth largest hospital in the state and has the second most trauma cases. He added that the hospital has 11,000 discharges a year and is at full capacity.\n\nThe Maui region increased its operating revenue by $72.6 million from 2008 to 2013 while operating expenses grew $55.1 million in the same period, Lo said. However, in 2014, hospital revenues dropped with reduced patient reimbursements from the federal Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) while expenses escalated because of federally mandated requirements and increasing collective-bargaining employee costs, he said.\n\nDr. Nicole Apoliona, medical director of Kula Hospital and Clinic, said that the small Upcountry hospital also is facing difficulties as a \"quasi-state agency\" because it is hampered by state rules regarding contracting, procurement, recruitment and management.\n\n\"I have many stories about how these rules and regulations have affected our ability to operate, including the 1.5 years it took me to recruit a quality, appropriate family physician to an attractive full-time outpatient position at Kula Clinic,\" Apoliona told the committee. \"As a state agency, we cannot be nimble enough to survive and thrive in this rapidly changing field.\"\n\nSeveral people and groups testified in opposition to the bill. They worried about the precedent it would set for state health care, as well as the welfare of its employees.\n\nMichele Kurihara-Klein, legislative officer for Hawaii Government Employees Association, said that the language of the bill is \"unprecedented and excessively favorable\" for a single beneficiary who is a private operator. She called for \"intensive and thoughtful scrutiny\" by legislators, including an independent financial and management audit.\n\n\"This partnership is not really a partnership. This is actually an acquisition,\" Kurihara-Klein said. \"This deal means that the state will foot the bill while the private operator assumes no risk at all and ostensibly shares no profits with the state. This is a win-win for the private operator at the expense of the state and its finances and the employees that it governs.\"\n\nDavid Okabe, chief financial officer and treasurer of Hawaii Pacific Health, which has come forward as a potential partner with Maui Memorial, said his company is not looking to profit on state subsidies and aims to work with the HGEA once there is an agreement in place.\n\nHPH works with four unions at three different hospitals, he said.\n\n\"The idea that we would be profiting off government subsidies, quite honestly, we're not expecting it,\" Okabe said. \"But we can include some part of the agreement that we would share that back with the state.\"\n\nLo said that, in the agreement, HPH would be held accountable by an independently funded Maui regional board with performance and fiscal standards.\n\nCommittee members questioned whether HPH would have to partner with all of the Maui regional system, which it doesn't. They also wondered if the state would assume all liabilities in the partnership.\n\nApoliona said it \"only makes sense\" for the partnership to include all three hospitals and clinics because of the \"way health care reimbursement and quality measurements have changed to include the whole continuum of care from acute care to transitional long-term care to even outpatient.\n\n\"To really deliver quality health care to your community, you really need to ensure the quality is consistent and sustainable through that entire continuum,\" she said.\n\nNoting this is the third year the Maui region has supported legislation to allow a private-public partnership, she asked legislators not to \"let this opportunity slip through your fingers as it may not come again.\"\n\nBefore Friday's hearing, Lo stressed the importance of the Legislature acting on the measure.\n\n\"There's so much at stake here,\" Lo said. \"It's your friends. It's your family. It's my family. This is not about politics or anything. This is about doing this because we need to provide this service for the community.\n\n\"Right now, we're in limbo and got to watch what's going on and plan for any eventuality,\" he said. \"We don't know what the funding is going to be in the future, and odds are we're not going to get the amount of money we need from the state.\"\n\n* Chris Sugidono can be reached at csugidono@mauinews.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Lahaina, Hilo, Kane'ohe (Kaneohe), Kailua, Pearl City, Waipahu, Kahului, Kailua-Kona, Kihei (Kihei), and Lihue, Hawaii, Oahu, Molokai, Hawaii", "description": "HONOLULU \u2014 Alarm bells were rung again at the state Capitol on Friday, warning of the dire financial condition of Maui Memorial Medical Center and..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd249a\"", "article_summary": "They worried about the precedent it would set for state health care, as well as the welfare of its employees.\nThe panel deferred action on a bill that would make way for a public-private partnership for Maui Memorial Medical Center.\n\"It would take $523 million to $800 million for the next 10 years to maintain status quo,\" said Wesley Lo, HHSC's Maui region chief executive officer.\nThe Maui region increased its operating revenue by $72.6 million from 2008 to 2013 while operating expenses grew $55.1 million in the same period, Lo said.\n\"To really deliver quality health care to your community, you really need to ensure the quality is consistent and sustainable through that entire continuum,\" she said."}
