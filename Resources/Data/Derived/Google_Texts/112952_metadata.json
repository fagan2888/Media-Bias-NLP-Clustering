I believe he\u2019s going to give us a good chance.\u201d\n\nGonzales, 22, who has been pitching for Double-A Springfield, will replace Jaime Garcia in the Cardinals lineup. Garcia and fellow pitcher Michael Wacha were put on St. Louis\u2019 disabled list Sunday with shoulder injuries.\n\nGonzales was scheduled to pitch Wednesday for the Texas League in the Double-A all-star game. He has a 2.33 this season for Springfield, with 46 strikeouts and 10 walks.\n\nHe is the only Colorado high school pitcher to be the winning pitcher in four state championship games (2007-10).\n\n\u201cA lot of guys come in here (to Colorado) not knowing what to expect,\u201d Matheny said of pitching at altitude. \u201cBut this is something he grew up with.\u201d\n\nGonzales, a left-hander, joins a Cardinals rotation that has the National League\u2019s best ERA this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pounding the strike zone. He\u2019s getting quick outs,\u201d Matheny said. \u201cHe\u2019s able to work both sides of the plate and has above-average off-speed stuff.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals drafted Gonzales out of Gonzaga University a little more than a year ago, with the 19th pick in the first round.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have too many expectations (this year),\u201d Gonzales told The Denver Post earlier this month. \u201cI just wanted to compete. That\u2019s the biggest thing for me, and the rest kind of takes care of itself.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1702\"", "article_summary": "He is the only Colorado high school pitcher to be the winning pitcher in four state championship games (2007-10).\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of pitcher I used to love to catch,\u201d said Matheny, a former big-league catcher.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have too many expectations (this year),\u201d Gonzales told The Denver Post earlier this month.\n\u201cA lot of guys come in here (to Colorado) not knowing what to expect,\u201d Matheny said of pitching at altitude.\nGarcia and fellow pitcher Michael Wacha were put on St. Louis\u2019 disabled list Sunday with shoulder injuries."}
