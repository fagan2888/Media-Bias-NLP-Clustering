David Vitter has proposed an amendment to an unrelated energy bill that would end the subsidies for lawmakers and their staffers. Members of Congress and Hill staffers were forced to participate in the Obamacare exchanges in the first place by an amendment to the Affordable Care Act by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nMany of the people affected by the amendment make too much money to receive subsidies already available under Obamacare, so their costs would have risen compared to their previous coverage. The White House Office of Personnel Management ruled members of Congress and their staff would receive their own subsidies after Congress began to panic about a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of staffer resources as a result.\n\nThe \u201cbrain drain\u201d argument is a lot of baloney \u2013 with unemployment still at record levels and huge numbers of recent college grads \u2013 let alone the mature professionals most Americans would like to see running government offices \u2013 finding replacements should be no problem.\n\nNaturally, Vitter has had to fight just to get a vote on his proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have offered several vindictive counter-amendments, including one banning the subsidies to any member found to have visited a prostitute \u2014 a jab at Vitter\u2019s 2007 D.C. madam controversy \u2014 or to anyone who votes for Vitter\u2019s amendment, even if it fails.\n\nThis is typical of how the \u201cthugocracy\u201d running Washington works; they no longer even bother to try to make the argument for their position, they just threaten and intimidate to get what they want.\n\nPublic Notice has an antidote for this \u2013 casting as much sunshine as possible on the activities of Capitol Hill\u2019s insiders and their culture of legalized corruption. says it is launching its advertising campaign because it just wants Congress subjected to the same laws as the rest of us. \u201cAmericans will pay the price for this ill-conceived law and deserve to know whether their representatives will as well,\u201d Hamel said.\n\n\u201cInconvenient\u201d will begin to run soon as a \u201cpre-roll\u201d ad (those annoying ads that run before what you really want to see plays) on YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and other sites. A clip should be up soon on the Public Notice website.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Public Notice: Congress Exempting Itself from Obamacare"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf302\"", "article_summary": "A clip should be up soon on the Public Notice website.\nPublic Notice has an antidote for this \u2013 casting as much sunshine as possible on the activities of Capitol Hill\u2019s insiders and their culture of legalized corruption.\nThe White House Office of Personnel Management ruled members of Congress and their staff would receive their own subsidies after Congress began to panic about a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of staffer resources as a result.\nsays it is launching its advertising campaign because it just wants Congress subjected to the same laws as the rest of us.\nMembers of Congress and Hill staffers were forced to participate in the Obamacare exchanges in the first place by an amendment to the Affordable Care Act by Iowa Republican Sen.
