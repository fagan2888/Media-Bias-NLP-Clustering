So I posed a series of questions\u2013with a few verbal restrictions\u2013to Matthew Thomas (\u201cWe Are Not Ourselves,\u201d a novel already out), Emily St. John Mandel (\u201cStation Eleven,\u201d a novel available Sept. 9), Dylan Landis (\u201cRainey Royal,\u201d a novel available Sept. 9), John Warner, \u201cTough Day for the Army,\u201d stories available Sept. 15), and Lindsay Hunter (\u201cUgly Girls,\u201d a novel available Nov. 4).\n\nWithout summarizing the plot in any way, what would you say your novel is about?\n\nTHOMAS: The persistence of hope in the face of certain defeat; the refusal to despair; a brief moment of triumph; years spent chasing an idyll; in short, an alternate history of the New York Mets.\n\nLANDIS: A girl in trouble named Rainey Royal. Also jazz, sex, cigarettes, New York, 1970s, girls and men, friendships and cruelty, art, and Saint Catherine of Bologna.\n\nMANDEL: It\u2019s about a traveling Shakespearean theatre company in a post-apocalyptic North America. It\u2019s also about friendship, memory, love, celebrity, our obsession with objects, oppressive dinner parties, comic books, and knife-throwing.\n\nHUNTER: The \u201cfriendship\u201d between two teenaged girls. Acting out of desperation. Nostalgia for something that never existed. The Internet as predator. The assumptions we make and accept as fact.\n\nWARNER: Mankind is a pestilence, bent on destroying ourselves and others, but occasionally we break free from our monstrousness and achieve something like grace. Also has a talking monkey.\n\nWithout explaining why and without naming other authors or books, can you discuss the various influences on your novels?\n\nHUNTER: My mother\u2019s yearbooks. 48 Hours Mystery. Keith Morrison. Fairy tales. The kind of heat you feel in August when you just get back into your car at 2:00 in the afternoon. The silence of waiting. Ugliness.\n\nWARNER: \u201cSlap Shot,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d fraternity hazing, Mitt Romney\u2019s smile, small town newspapers, the Double Jeopardy noise, crappy zoos.\n\nMANDEL: Post-apocalyptic novels, a 2010 book tour on the Michigan lake shore, the 1918 flu, the New York Public Theater, an unsettling moment one night in Toronto when I was nineteen and just for a second all the lights on Yonge Street blinked out, the 2003 blackout in New York City, orchestral music.\n\nLANDIS: Mean girls, biology, the language of jazz, specific pieces of art, collage, yearning, the language of seduction.\n\nTHOMAS: The scent of bitter almonds. The watery part of the world. Such wonderful shirts. Bernard is thinking of his biographer. Old father, old artificer. See the child. These fragments I have shored against my ruins. I can\u2019t go on, I\u2019ll go on. The apparition of these faces in the crowd. Only connect. Isn\u2019t it pretty to think so?\n\nWithout using complete sentences, can you describe what was going on in your lives as you wrote this book?\n\nLANDIS: Loss, death, and caregiving for my parents.\n\nTHOMAS: Sleepless nights, two a.m. feedings, growing pains, wailing, burping, babbling, unreasonability\u2014and then my twin children were born.\n\nMANDEL: Day job, book tour, disappointment, happiness, exhaustion. Constant work.\n\nHUNTER: Pregnant. Summer. Winter. Basement. Loss. Change. Home.\n\nWARNER: Stories span 1997 to 2014: MFA, giving up writing, career (marketing research), first book, marriage, moving, second career (teaching), moving, begin editing McSweeney\u2019s Internet Tendency, moving, second book, father died, grandmother died, father-in-law died, third book, fourth book, failed humor imprint (TOW Books), moving, novel published, novel failed in marketplace, moving, purchase of weed whacker.\n\nWhat are some words you despise that have been used to describe your book by readers and/or reviewers?\n\nMANDEL: \u201cWomen\u2019s fiction.\u201d There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with writing books that are aimed specifically at women. But since I don\u2019t actually write those books, it\u2019s impossible to interpret that label as anything other than \u201cthis book was written by a girl.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Matthew Thomas, Emily St. John Mandel, Dylan Landis, John Warner, and Lindsay Hunter talk about the writing process", "title": "Internet predators, vicious Amazon reviews, and how Mitt Romney\u2019s smile inspired a novel", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Matthew Thomas, Emily St. John Mandel, Dylan Landis, John Warner, and Lindsay Hunter talk about the writing process", "title": "Internet predators, vicious Amazon reviews, and how Mitt Romney\u2019s smile inspired a novel", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/internet_predators_vicious_amazon_reviews_and_how_mitt_romneys_smile_inspired_a_novel/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/author_roundtable.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Matthew Thomas, Emily St. John Mandel, Dylan Landis, John Warner, and Lindsay Hunter talk about the writing process", "title": "Internet predators, vicious Amazon reviews, and how Mitt Romney\u2019s smile inspired a novel", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/author_roundtable.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Teddy Wayne", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, authors, Books, Fiction, novelists", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9810\"", "article_summary": "Topics: authors, Books, Fiction, novelists, Entertainment NewsAs always, autumn has yielded a bumper crop of new fiction.\nSo I posed a series of questions\u2013with a few verbal restrictions\u2013to Matthew Thomas (\u201cWe Are Not Ourselves,\u201d a novel already out), Emily St. John Mandel (\u201cStation Eleven,\u201d a novel available Sept. 9), Dylan Landis (\u201cRainey Royal,\u201d a novel available Sept. 9), John Warner, \u201cTough Day for the Army,\u201d stories available Sept. 15), and Lindsay Hunter (\u201cUgly Girls,\u201d a novel available Nov. 4).\nWARNER: Stories span 1997 to 2014: MFA, giving up writing, career (marketing research), first book, marriage, moving, second career (teaching), moving, begin editing McSweeney\u2019s Internet Tendency, moving, second book, father died, grandmother died, father-in-law died, third book, fourth book, failed humor imprint (TOW Books), moving, novel published, novel failed in marketplace, moving, purchase of weed whacker.\nAlso jazz, sex, cigarettes, New York, 1970s, girls and men, friendships and cruelty, art, and Saint Catherine of Bologna.\nWARNER: \u201cSlap Shot,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d fraternity hazing, Mitt Romney\u2019s smile, small town newspapers, the Double Jeopardy noise, crappy zoos."}
