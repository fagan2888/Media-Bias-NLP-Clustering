THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT. ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.\n\nGet your attention, all those upper-case, bold-face letters? They certainly got mine, when they came in the mail recently. It was a virginity-losing moment: My first debt-collection letter in more than a half century of financial clean living.\n\nAnd of course, it was a medical bill that did it \u2014 just as it\u2019s medical care that causes more American personal bankruptcies than any other bills.\n\nMy health bills for preventive care had all seemed reasonable until now \u2014 or at least, they were bountifully paid by insurance. Mammograms, children\u2019s check-ups, all were fully covered. But I\u2019d shifted recently to an insurance plan with a $500 personal deductible, and I\u2019d made a naive mistake: When my doctor kindly offered to clean my waxy ears during my annual check-up last April, I said, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\n\nWell, really, how was I to suspect that three or four minutes of whooshing ear-rinse could add up to $446 out of my pocket? (Correction: $446 upon first billing, but knocked down to $338.03 after several long and tortured phone calls, and a medical re-coding. It still struck me as insane, but I paid it to get the collection agency off my back.)\n\nDoctor, if we\u2019re going to cross the line from preventive to billable, I\u2019d like you to let me know.\n\nIt\u2019s an ever-more-common American rite of passage: That shocking moment when you unfold the bill, look at the total that is unpaid by your health insurance, and expostulate, \u201cAre you (expletive) kidding me?!?\u201d\n\nReaders, do you have an eye-popping bill and back-story you\u2019d like to share? We\u2019re hoping to make this a series \u2014 \u201cMedical Bills That Make You Go \u2018What??!'\u201d You can send in your story \u2014 and, if you\u2019d like, scans of your bills that will protect your privacy \u2014 by clicking on the \u201cGet In Touch\u201d button at the bottom of this page. Goodness knows, you have few other outlets for your frustration.\n\nIn my own case, I\u2019m asking you to brave the numbing tedium of any billing tale because there\u2019s a clear object lesson here: Yes, preventive care, including check-ups, must be fully covered by insurance plans under Obamacare. But that doesn\u2019t mean that everything that\u2019s done during a check-up has to be covered.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub. The line between \u201cpreventive\u201d and \u201cdiagnostic\u201d or \u201cprocedural\u201d can creep up on you, as WBUR\u2019s Martha Bebinger has reported: When Is Preventive Care Free And When Do You Pay? Her report included this valuable lesson: As one Massachusetts woman was horrified to discover, it\u2019s possible to go in for a free \u2014 because it\u2019s preventive \u2014 colonoscopy, but then, while you\u2019re still on the table, if the doctor finds polyps and removes them, that transforms it into a non-preventive \u2014 and thus potentially billable to you \u2014 \u201csurgical procedure.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d read that story but clearly I didn\u2019t take its lesson enough to heart. I also take full blame for my longtime practice of getting routine primary care at an expensive top Boston hospital: You can see in the upper right corner of the image above that the initial charge to my insurer for my check-up \u2014 which involved no lab tests and nothing higher-tech than a blood pressure cuff \u2014 was nearly $1,192.\n\nStill, in hopes that my own financial pain might help others, I asked Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the biggest health insurer in the state and the one that happens to cover me, for useful pointers. I spoke with Debra Wilson, a senior manager in the Member Service Division. Our conversation, lightly edited:\n\nDW: I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re highlighting this for people. Folks go in and have preventative visits, and things will invariably come up. The patient is there and having their physical, but they\u2019re also addressing problems. These problems could be longstanding. So it\u2019s important that when something does come up and present itself, that the patient ask questions.\n\nIt\u2019s very important that all of us are educated in our health care decisions, and part of that is that we not be afraid to ask, \u2018What does that entail and what might the cost be?\u2019\n\nAsk questions beforehand so you\u2019re fully aware of what\u2019s going to be involved, not only with the procedure but the cost. It can generate a liability to the patient, and no one likes an unplanned bill. We\u2019ve also asked our network management team, the folks in the field working with physicians\u2019 offices, if they could also educate the patient at the time \u2014 usually after the fact, but let them know, if they were in for a visit and also had a procedure or additional service, that they could receive a balance bill.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to discourage these conversations with physicians because it\u2019s probably something they do need to have addressed, and it\u2019s being done all in one trip, so it\u2019s efficient. We just want everyone to be aware of what could happen in terms of cost liability, that that could change depending on services rendered.\n\nThe tricky part for the patient is that it can be hard to know whether something is considered preventative or diagnostic or a procedure. For example, at that same checkup of mine, my doctor found that my blood pressure was a bit elevated, so we discussed ways to lower it. Conceivably, that could be billed as not preventive but diagnostic, or an education procedure?\n\nThat\u2019s discretionary, based on that particular provider\u2019s office and their billing practices. Certainly, that could be within the preventative visit, but again, I think it\u2019s important not to be afraid to ask those questions.\n\nWould it be reasonable to go into a preventive appointment and say, \u2018Doctor, if we\u2019re going to cross the line from preventive to billable, I\u2019d like you to let me know\u2019? Would that be weird?\n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with that.\n\nWhat\u2019s been your experience of the most common health care procedures or discussions that have led to what we could call \u2018surprise bills?\u2019\n\nPersonally, the ones I\u2019ve been involved with have centered around diabetes. The member goes in for a [preventative] visit and then they\u2019re also billed for an evaluation and management code for the same day with the diagnosis of diabetes, and that is a billable procedure. And there have been instances where we\u2019ve reached out to physicians\u2019 offices on behalf of members to confirm the procedure was distinct and separate, and in most cases, they are. It\u2019s just about educating our members that these situations do come up, and seeing the value that it is handled all in the one visit.\n\nSo in a way it\u2019s about managing expectations of what will be free and what won\u2019t. But that sounds like a good example of how it can be hard for a patient to anticipate \u2014 you go in for a checkup, you have diabetes, your doctor asks about how your management is going, and then that turns into a charge you\u2019re liable for\u2026Is there any helpful rule of thumb about how to know what kinds of things might turn into unexpected bills?\n\nI really think it\u2019s about having that conversation with the physician at the time, and asking those questions during that visit.\n\nThe trouble is, things can come up while you\u2019re right in the thick of things. WBUR\u2019s Martha Bebinger has written about how free colonoscopies suddenly become billable if the doctor finds and removes polyps\u2026\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so glad you brought that up. Historically, yes, and then it would process more as a surgical benefit, as opposed to processing against their routine colonoscopy. However \u2014 good news! We are now able to process claims \u2014 gastroenterologists are able to bill in such a way that even if there are polyps uncovered, that the procedure will still process against their routine benefits. Isn\u2019t that great?\n\nFor sure \u2014 so if a patient is facing a bill for polyps during a colonoscopy, they should ask for help? Is it just Blue Cross or all insurers?\n\nIt\u2019s been just fairly recently we\u2019ve been able to do that \u2014 and yes, if the claim is not coded that way initially, we are able to reach out to physicians\u2019 office and help members. I can\u2019t speak for other insurers.\n\nI confess, I\u2019m tempted to put off my next check-up for a while. I\u2019m sparing you the gory details of all the phone calls and the SNAFUs that led up to my debt-collection letter, but it really does hurt to spend $338 for an ear cleaning that, according to an excellent ear-wax roundup in the Wall Street Journal, I might have handled virtually for free:\n\n\u2026Doctors recommend softening impacted earwax with a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, commercial ear drops or hydrogen peroxide. Then allow the loosened wax to work its way out naturally. If it still needs help, try gentle irrigation with a bulb syringe or tilt your head in the shower, say doctors. After a few minutes, straighten up and let the water run out again. \u201cWater works just as well as a $10 bottle of ear drops,\u201d says Dr. Rosenfeld.\n\nOr a $446 irrigation, I suspect.\n\nA bit of further reading on health costs: Negotiating Medical Bills (Healthcare Savvy)\n\nBeware the Upcode \u2014 and Don\u2019t Take It Lying Down (Healthcare Savvy)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical bills that make you go 'What?!\" How did a check-up that was supposed to be free turn into a $446 bill for ear-wax rinsing and a letter from a collection agency?", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Medical bills that make you go 'What?!\" How did a check-up that was supposed to be free turn into a $446 bill for ear-wax rinsing and a letter from a collection agency?", "title": "Lesson Of The $446 Ear Rinse: Medical Bills That Make You Say \u2018What?!\u2019", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/03/medical-bills-say-what", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/03/medicalbills-620x394.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/03/medical-bills-say-what", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/03/medicalbills-620x394.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Lesson Of The $446 Ear Rinse: Medical Bills That Make You Say 'What?!'"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-14", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Fri, 14 Mar 2014 12:36:54 -0400"}, "article_summary": "And of course, it was a medical bill that did it \u2014 just as it\u2019s medical care that causes more American personal bankruptcies than any other bills.\nLesson Of The $446 Ear Rinse: Medical Bills That Make You Say \u2018What?\nMy health bills for preventive care had all seemed reasonable until now \u2014 or at least, they were bountifully paid by insurance.\n(Correction: $446 upon first billing, but knocked down to $338.03 after several long and tortured phone calls, and a medical re-coding.\nA bit of further reading on health costs: Negotiating Medical Bills (Healthcare Savvy)Beware the Upcode \u2014 and Don\u2019t Take It Lying Down (Healthcare Savvy)"}
