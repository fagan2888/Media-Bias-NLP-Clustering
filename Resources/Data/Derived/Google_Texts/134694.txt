EDMOND, Okla. (AP) - The body of a construction worker who was trapped in a collapsed trench in Edmond has been recovered.

Deputy Fire Chief Chris Denton says the body of 37-year-old Roberto Garcia Ochoa of Oklahoma City was found about midnight Friday and was recovered from the trench about 2:15 a.m. Saturday.

Investigators say Ochoa was working on a sewer pipe in east Edmond when the estimated 20-feet deep trench collapsed about 4:20 p.m. Friday. Ochoa was trapped under several feet of dirt.

The body was sent to the state medical examinerâ€™s office to determine the cause of death.
