(If you missed Part One, it's here.)\n\nMedicine in the 21st Century\n\nAt the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine, administrators began thinking about a curriculum redesign back in 2012, said Catherine Lucey, MD, vice dean for education at UCSF.\n\n\"We did so based on a belief that the primary responsibility of schools of medicine is to produce graduates who are capable of improving the health of communities and reducing the burden of suffering from disease,\" she said in a phone interview, noting that this view of medical education was first articulated in 1950 but was reiterated in a Lancet commission paper in 2010.\n\n\"What became clear to us at UCSF was that we really needed to fundamentally rethink the important skills, competencies, and attitudes our physicians have, and update our curriculum to make sure people are prepared to practice in this century as opposed to the last century,\" Lucey said in a phone interview.\n\nThat means taking into account the shift from caring mostly for patients with acute illnesses to caring mostly for patients with chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer, \"which require more than a brief checkup with a physician every 3 months,\" and it also involves working with public health peers to design environments where people are less likely to get these diseases of modern society through different strategies of prevention, she said.\n\nIt also means that \"We need physicians to work in teams, physicians who are willing to measure the outcomes of their care ... [and physicians who will] work across boundaries to advance science,\" Lucey explained.\n\nTo achieve these goals, UCSF has been piloting a new curriculum that will launch fully in 2016. \"From the very beginning of medical school, students will do two things that are relatively unique,\" said Lucey. \"One is that they're [going to be] embedded in clinical settings\" such as primary care offices or intensive care units, \"for a day a week for an entire year ... Their responsibilities will be to understand, measure, and improve the patient experience ... and learn what it is like as a patient to navigate these systems.\" The students will learn to use system improvement tools and then apply them to whatever setting they're working in.\n\n\"The second thing we'll do is that students will, from the very beginning of medical school, learn to think like a scientist,\" she continued. \"Every physician needs to view medicine as a developing science; you need to learn what today's facts tell us, but you also need to learn where our knowledge is still incomplete.\" The medical school students will spend part of each week working with biomedical scientists and graduate students to tackle \"a problem that sits at the edges of the known and the unknown,\" Lucey said.\n\nIn addition to these two new learning strategies, \"students will work to really understand how patients are experiencing healthcare and learn to respond ... to unconscious bias and microagressions,\" she added.\n\nThe Science of Healthcare Delivery\n\nLast week, students at the Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minn., started their first block of medical training -- the school's new curriculum in the science of healthcare delivery. The curriculum will be interwoven throughout the students' 4 years at the medical school, and will include online modules created through a joint collaboration with Arizona State University, a Mayo spokesperson said.\n\nThe new curriculum will encompass several different domains, such as:\n\nHigh-value care : Students will look at the cost of care delivery as well as its quality and safety.\n\n: Students will look at the cost of care delivery as well as its quality and safety. Team-based care : Students will explore how to deliver effective care as a member of a team, \"which is a new perspective for many medical students,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our students really become immersed in the care team, and as part of their early training they shadow members of a care team -- everyone from the appointment desk to the person who rooms the patient to the nurses, care coordinators, and social workers -- so they see it's a comprehensive team that takes care of the patient.\"\n\n: Students will explore how to deliver effective care as a member of a team, \"which is a new perspective for many medical students,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our students really become immersed in the care team, and as part of their early training they shadow members of a care team -- everyone from the appointment desk to the person who rooms the patient to the nurses, care coordinators, and social workers -- so they see it's a comprehensive team that takes care of the patient.\" Leadership : \"We look at their role as physician leaders but also as servant leaders as part of the community,\" said the spokesperson. The students also learn what it takes to lead a team, including change management and motivation.\n\n: \"We look at their role as physician leaders but also as servant leaders as part of the community,\" said the spokesperson. The students also learn what it takes to lead a team, including change management and motivation. Person-centered care : Students learn to treat patients holistically rather than considering only disease management or which prescriptions to write. That includes looking at non-medical factors that will impact the patient, such as their inability to afford a prescription.\n\n: Students learn to treat patients holistically rather than considering only disease management or which prescriptions to write. That includes looking at non-medical factors that will impact the patient, such as their inability to afford a prescription. Health policy, economics, and technology: In this domain, students look at ramifications of changes in the healthcare landscape that impact the delivery of care, and how those factors can be influenced to improve care delivery. \"Our goal is to not only help our students heal the sick and provide excellent patient care, but also have the tools to heal the ailing healthcare system,\" according to Michele Halyard, MD, the medical school's interim dean.\n\nThere is also a focus in the new curriculum on student wellness and resiliency, with an emphasis on avoiding burnout both in medical school and as a practicing physician. As part of that focus, the students had a 1 1/2-hour yoga session during their orientation.\n\nNavigating the System\n\nTo help students keep up with the changing healthcare system, Penn State College of Medicine, in Hershey, Pa., has created a System Navigator curriculum. The main reason for creating the curriculum \"is an understanding that medical education has not kept up effectively with the way the healthcare system has been changing,\" said Therese Wolpaw, MD, vice dean for educational affairs at the medical school.\n\n\"We're still in the model of the science of clinical care and the physician as the personal expert, [but] the system has really moved toward the patient as the center of care and a whole team of people working together\" to create the best possible patient care, she said in a phone interview. \"So how can we understand the journey that the patient takes through the system -- the challenges they have and the things that work for them?\"\n\nThe System Navigator curriculum has two parts -- a classroom-based part and an experimental part, Wolpaw explained. In the classroom section, which is 20 months long, students learn about health policy, health economics, the role of community agencies, the importance of electronic health information, the importance of teamwork, leadership, evidence-based care, and healthcare financing, including about the Affordable Care Act and how it affects patients.\n\n\"But we also felt that learning in the classroom doesn't help [the students] see things from the patient's eyes,\" she said. \"So every student is trained and serves as a patient navigator -- I like to think of it as a guide, whose job is to make the journey through the system smooth, and resolve any barriers to making care more complicated than it needs to be.\"\n\nFor example, students might help patients with insurance issues, financial issues, transportation, or patient education. \"We're helping students learn about all aspects of the healthcare system today, including the role of the patients, the family, and the community,\" said Wolpaw, who added that the patient navigator program -- which students participate in during their first year of medical school -- has been very successful.\n\n\"It's really important for medical schools like ours to think about how students can begin to be value-added to the system where they're learning, so they're not just taking from the system ... They don't need to wait 4 years to give back,\" she said. \"It's a win-win when we find the way that they can learn and give back simultaneously.\"\n\nPart three of our series will look at two schools that are revising the way they teach fundamentals like basic science.\n\nOther installments in this series:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joyce  Frieden", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/MedicalEducation/52990", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "Part two of a three-part <em>MedPage Today</em> series", "card": "Summary", "title": "The Changing Face of Medical Ed: It's All About the System"}, "dc.date.issued": "2015-08-07 16:30:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,publichealthpolicy,healthpolicy,generalprimarycare,medicaleducation,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-07 16:30:00", "sailthru.title": "The Changing Face of Medical Ed: It's All About the System", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "Part two of a three-part <em>MedPage Today</em> series", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-08-08 16:08:00", "date": "2015-08-07 16:30:00", "sailthru.description": "Part two of a three-part <em>MedPage Today</em> series", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/MedicalEducation/52990", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "Part two of a three-part MedPage Today series", "title": "The Changing Face of Medical Ed: It's All About the System"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2015-08-07 16:30:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "Other,primarycare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "article_summary": "\"From the very beginning of medical school, students will do two things that are relatively unique,\" said Lucey.\nNavigating the SystemTo help students keep up with the changing healthcare system, Penn State College of Medicine, in Hershey, Pa., has created a System Navigator curriculum.\nPerson-centered care : Students learn to treat patients holistically rather than considering only disease management or which prescriptions to write.\n\"The second thing we'll do is that students will, from the very beginning of medical school, learn to think like a scientist,\" she continued.\nTwo years ago, the American Medical Association said medical education needed a shakeup, citing \"gaps between how medical students are trained and how healthcare is delivered,\" and put up $11 million to fund experiments in closing those gaps."}
