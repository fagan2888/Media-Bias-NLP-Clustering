New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie unveiled a proposed state budget Tuesday that would reduce spending on charity medical treatment by 30 percent, from $502 million to $352 million, NJ Spotlight and The Wall Street Journal report. State officials said more than 700,000 New Jersey residents have obtained health insurance since the Affordable Care Act took effect, reducing hospitals' claims for uncompensated care.

This year's reduction doubled the $74 million cut last year from the charity-care program by Mr. Christie, who called during his recently ended presidential campaign for Obamacare to be repealed. Suzanne Ianni, president of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, said that despite the swelling insurance rolls, the cuts could imperil safety-net hospitals serving the poorest communities.
