Anthony List Candidate Fund announced its endorsement of Mitch McConnell for U.S. Senate in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cThe contrast between Mitch McConnell and Alison Grimes on life couldn\u2019t be more stark,\u201d said SBA List Candidate Fund President Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cAlison Grimes is so extreme on abortion that she even supports painful late-term abortions after five months \u2013 more than halfway of pregnancy. It\u2019s no wonder Alison Grimes has been endorsed by extreme abortion groups who only back candidates who support abortion on-demand, for any reason, paid for by the taxpayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell has a 100 percent pro-life voting record and has pledged to bring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to the floor for a vote when he becomes Majority Leader. This compassionate legislation is supported by the majority of Americans \u2013 women in higher numbers than men,\u201d continued Dannenfelser. \u201cMitch McConnell will always stand up for Kentucky values and we are proud to endorse him in his re-election bid.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is endorsed by National Right to Life and Kentucky Right to Life.\n\n\u201cNo U.S. senator has done more for unborn children than Sen. Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell is a stalwart defender of innocent human life and a tireless advocate for pro-life principles,\u201d said Margie Montgomery, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life. \u201cPro-life voters need to come together to re-elect pro-life Sen. Mitch McConnell and defeat pro-abortion Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nAs reported by National Right to Life, \u201cMcConnell has been a key supporter of every major pro-life initiative to come before the U.S. Senate during his tenure, including current legislation to protect unborn children at 20 weeks, a point by which the unborn child is capable of experiencing great pain when being killed by dismemberment or other late abortion techniques.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s general election opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes is endorsed by EMILY\u2019s List, a pro-abortion PAC that backs female Democrats who support abortion-on-demand. EMILY\u2019s List labeled McConnell an \u201canti-choice obstructionist\u201d for fighting back against the pro-abortion Obama agenda.\n\nThe 2012 elections were barely over before Planned Parenthood turned its attention to attacking McConnell. They recognize the asset he is to the pro-life movement in the Senate.\n\nIn February 2013, Planned Parenthood began running ads blasting McConnell for his support for Hobby Lobby in their legal challenge to the Obama Mandate.\n\nHowever, despite McConnell\u2019s proven record, some have falsely alleged that McConnell is somehow weak on pro-life issues. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s GOP primary challenger Matt Bevin has misrepresented McConnell\u2019s record, even claiming on his website that McConnell voted in favor of federal funding for abortion. Yet, time and time again, McConnell voted against abortion funding.\n\n(McConnell\u2019s voting record on pro-life issues is available here.)\n\nMcConnell voted for the pro-life Mexico City Policy. He voted to cut off funding to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which participates in the carrying out of China\u2019s One-Child Policy that relies on forced abortions. He also voted to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, America\u2019s largest abortion provider. McConnell has stood resolutely from the beginning against funding of abortion in Obamacare and its mandates that violate rights of conscience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Life Group Endorses Mitch McConnell, Alison Grimes Too Extreme on Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Today the national pro-life political action committee the Susan B.
