As the story explains, starting next year, the dreaded ObamaCare employer mandate kicks in for businesses with between 50 and 99 employees. That means they will all have to offer their full-time workers \u2014 which means anyone clocking in more than 30 hours a week \u2014 government-approved health benefits, or face a steep fine.\n\nPresident Obama delayed this mandate twice, citing the cost and disruptions it would cause.\n\nThe delays have come to an end, and as of Jan. 1, these companies will not only have to provide \u201caffordable\u201d insurance for these workers, they must also file complex new tax forms with the IRS detailing the cost of the insurance, the names and Social Security numbers of employees and their dependents, and how long they were covered by insurance.\n\nThe compliance costs alone can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, prompting one HR contractor to tell AP that \u201cit\u2019s probably going to be a big nightmare for a lot of businesses.\u201d\n\nThe AP story goes on to detail other troubles businesses will face in meeting ObamaCare\u2019s mandate, noting that \u201ceven companies that already offer insurance may be in for a surprise if their current plans don\u2019t meet the law\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind the fact that these medium-sized companies are typically the ones that create the most jobs in a growing economy, and the fact that the ObamaCare employer mandate has already shown to have an adverse effect on jobs and worker hours.\n\nPresident Obama often talks about avoiding \u201cself-inflicted\u201d wounds to the economy, by which he means bad public policy. But his own ObamaCare law could prove to be a big one next year.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The headline in the AP story says it all: \"Crunch time at small businesses as health care demands loom.\" \"Loom\" is the right word.
