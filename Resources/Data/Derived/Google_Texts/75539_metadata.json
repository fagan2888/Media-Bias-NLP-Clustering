Probably so \u2014 if you don\u2019t work in the energy industry.\n\nTexas has diversified its economy significantly in the last 20 years, but oil is still king. So when oil prices plunge, it has a big effect on the state\u2019s economy. How big? Next year may answer that question.\n\nThe Texas economic engine is likely to move at a slower speed next year, even as the U.S. economy picks up steam.\n\nTexans \u2014 and all Americans \u2014 face an unprecedented time of economic transition as interest rates are poised to rise in 2015. Consumers may see more change in their pockets, but some businesses could suffer as they face low energy prices and tax changes next year.\n\n\u201cGiven the drop in oil prices, I would be surprised if Texas performed as well as it has this year,\u201d Wells Fargo economist Michael Wolf said.\n\nThis year, Texas outpaced U.S. economic growth and led the nation in job growth, setting a state record with 421,900 jobs added for the 12 months through October.\n\nIn 2015, economists expect Texas\u2019 economic and job growth to slow slightly because of lower oil prices, labor shortages in certain industries and weaker exports.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas expects the Texas economy to grow 3.5 percent in 2015, down from an estimated 4.5 percent this year. It expects the state\u2019s employment growth to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2015 vs. 3.5 percent this year. More Texas companies expect to hire more people in 2015, according to various surveys.\n\nDespite signs that many American families are struggling to make ends meet more than five years after the recession ended, the U.S. economy improved significantly in 2014. For example, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in November, compared with 7 percent a year ago and 9.9 percent five years ago.\n\nNext year promises to be better for the U.S. economy, though it faces some headwinds such as more political friction amid weaker global economies.\n\n\u201cI have my own company, and I\u2019ve had a good year,\u201d said Nancy Davis of Dallas, who runs a marketing and advertising firm. \u201cI feel optimistic about next year.\u201d\n\nOil prices\n\nOil prices, which have plunged nearly 47 percent since June, are a big risk for the Texas economy next year.\n\nTexas\u2019 oil production, which has more than doubled in the last three years, drives much of the state\u2019s economic growth \u2014 about 12 percent. And while energy accounts for less than 3 percent of Texas employment, energy employment jumped 11 percent for the 12 months through October, more than any other industry.\n\nLower oil prices can be a double-edged sword for the economy.\n\nA price drop generally benefits the U.S. economy: Consumers save money on gas and home heating bills, consumer spending rises, and some businesses benefit from lower transportation and shipping costs. But capital investments could suffer, causing a trickle-down effect on other businesses.\n\nIn Texas, it\u2019s unlikely that low oil prices will cause a crisis as they did in the late 1980s, because the state\u2019s economy has diversified so much since then. Still, some fear that a prolonged downturn will hurt energy companies and could spread to other businesses such as real estate, restaurants and retail that have benefited from the increased energy hiring.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it pushes Texas into recession, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a repeat of the \u201980s,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Wolf said. \u201cBut I am somewhat concerned about just how large the ripple effect could be in Texas.\u201d\n\nNo one agrees on a break-even price for when oil production is no longer profitable. One economist noted that it\u2019s \u201cmore art than science.\u201d\n\nMine Y\u00fccel, director of research for the Dallas Fed, thinks drilling activity will taper off if oil prices drop below $60 per barrel for a long time.\n\nThere are signs the industry is already reacting. The Texas Railroad Commission issued fewer oil drilling permits in October. Some Texas companies told the Dallas Fed this fall that they\u2019re revising budgets and expect lower capital expenditures due to lower oil prices.\n\nBut consumers are benefiting from lower energy prices. Gas prices have fallen nearly 27 percent to an average of $2.30 a gallon in Dallas in the last year, according to GasBuddy.com.\n\nLisle Stilwell of Dallas saved about $6 the last time she filled her car\u2019s gas tank. She hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen moved to spend\u201d the savings yet, she said.\n\nBut Aichi Amemiya, a U.S. economist at Nomura, said recent data shows that consumers are spending their savings from lower gas prices on other goods and services.\n\nConsumers could also see higher prices in 2015. The Fed wants an inflation rate closer to 2 percent rather than the 1.7 percent rate so far this year. Prices of certain items, such as beef and butter, have skyrocketed this year.\n\nInterest rates\n\nInterest rates, which have hovered near zero since 2008, are another risk to the economy. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start raising rates in mid-2015.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Wolf thinks the Fed will raise rates by 0.25 percent each quarter starting in June. That means people will see higher rates on auto, home and business loans, but the pace of increases will be \u201cso slow it won\u2019t have much impact,\u201d he said.\n\nMortgage rates, for example, will remain low. Wolf doesn\u2019t expect the 30-year mortgage rate to rise above 5 percent until mid-2016. It\u2019s around 4 percent now.\n\nStill, JPMorgan Chase chief economist Anthony Chan expects consumers and businesses to react as rates rise next year. \u201cI have very little doubt people will be jumping and be beside themselves to buy houses to beat the rush,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, higher rates will help consumers still struggling to rebuild wealth lost in the 2007-09 recession. Bank savings rates will go up.\n\nIt\u2019s tricky. If the Fed moves too aggressively to raise rates, the nation could slip back into recession. Treading timidly could cause inflation to surge.\n\nIn summer 2013, the stock market went crazy after the Fed indicated it would wind down its stimulus program. Some fear the same could happen this time around.\n\n\u201cThere are risks the Fed\u2019s tightening could lead to financial turmoil, because it\u2019s impossible to predict how financial markets react to higher rates,\u201d said Amemiya, who thinks the Fed will start hiking rates in third quarter 2015.\n\nTax changes\n\nBusinesses will face more tax uncertainty in 2015.\n\nCongress is working on tax reform to simplify the tax code and make the nation more competitive internationally.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips thinks reforms would include changes to corporate investment incentives and a way to bring back some of the more than $2 trillion in U.S. corporate profits parked overseas at lower tax rates. He predicts a 30 percent chance of reforms becoming law in 2015.\n\nSome health care taxes are set to change next year. For example, businesses with 50 or more employees will face health care regulations that were delayed a year. The Affordable Care Act requires such employers to offer full-time workers a health care plan or pay a penalty.\n\nBut the whole health care law could unravel if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down federal tax subsidies for residents of states without their own health exchange.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big question,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cCompanies are confused about what they need to do long term. For consumers, what do you do? What people want is certainty.\u201d\n\nFollow Sheryl Jean on Twitter at @SJeanDallas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consumers probably would benefit, but businesses may suffer as interest rates are poised to rise and energy prices to collapse.", "og": {"description": "Consumers probably would benefit, but businesses may suffer as interest rates are poised to rise and energy prices to collapse.", "title": "Risks for the 2015 economy?
