He\u2019s the youngest of three. His father died of a heart attack when Emmanuel was 2. His brothers, Stephane and Jean-Micheal, quickly became his role models.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like my two fathers. They raised me,\u201d Emmanuel said.\n\nTheir mother, Therese Kabeya, struggled to provide for her sons in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the birthplace of Emmanuel and his brothers. Two wars terrorized the country during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Jean-Micheal and Ste- phane recall hearing gunfire and screams throughout the night.\n\nKabeya headed to Arlington, Texas, in 2001 with dreams of providing a better life for her sons. A year later, her boys joined her.\n\nTheir primary outlet was basketball. Once Emmanuel was old enough, they played king of the court. But most games ended with the smaller Emmanuel on the ground suffering from the MMA-style physicality bestowed upon him by his brothers.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the competitive Emmanuel, now a Nuggets first-round draft pick, to catch up with his brothers. Jean-Micheal knew Emmanuel was special when he saw him playing in tournaments as a third- grader and he looked like a ninth-grader.\n\n\u201cWe all went through it together,\u201d Jean-Micheal said, \u201cand we\u2019re just happy one of us made it and we\u2019re happy it was him.\u201d\n\nStephane was the first out of the house. He received scholarship offers from a few Division I basketball programs, including the University of Denver. But a back injury forced him to play at a junior college before finishing his career at Texas Wesleyan.\n\nJean-Micheal was a star in high school, earning all-district honors his junior year, but he suffered a knee injury twice in a two-year span. He played at Western Texas College before he got a call from SMU coach Larry Brown with an offer to play for the Mustangs in Dallas.\n\nJean-Micheal knew it was a recruiting ploy to get Emmanuel to come to SMU too, but he didn\u2019t care. For him, it was an opportunity to get the most important thing his mother wanted for her sons: a top-tier education.\n\nEmmanuel did sign with SMU but never played for the Mustangs, instead signing a $1.2 million contract to play in China.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to come,\u201d Jean-Micheal said, \u201cbut he left me. But I always knew how much my mom was struggling. I was the first one to tell him, \u2018Go ahead and go.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBrown, a former Nuggets coach, was hit hard by the decision. He called Emmanuel the best young point guard he had ever seen. But he still offered Jean-Micheal, who played only 24 minutes in two seasons, the opportunity to remain on the team.\n\nHis senior year was difficult for Jean-Micheal. Stephane and Kabeya moved to China with Emmanuel while Jean-Micheal stayed behind. But he talked to Emmanuel every day via FaceTime. Despite the 13-hour time difference, they watched each other\u2019s games.\n\nJean-Micheal may have a future as a scout. He said Emmanuel\u2019s best skill is his playmaking ability, and he doesn\u2019t agree with the John Wall comparison.\n\n\u201cRussell Westbrook as far as athleticism, Derrick Rose passing skills. He reminds me of Baron Davis,\u201d Jean-Micheal said. \u201cBut mostly he plays like Emmanuel.\u201d\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets point guard Emmanuel Mudiay has bloodline entrenched with basketball", "title": "Nuggets point guard Emmanuel Mudiay has bloodline entrenched with basketball", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/28/nuggets-point-guard-emmanuel-mudiay-has-bloodline-entrenched-with-basketball/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150628__BN20150629_Z00_BNSP29BKNBROTHERp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150628__BN20150629_Z00_BNSP29BKNBROTHERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-28T20:30:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T19:19:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1627\"", "article_summary": "Jean-Micheal knew Emmanuel was special when he saw him playing in tournaments as a third- grader and he looked like a ninth-grader.\nJean-Micheal knew it was a recruiting ploy to get Emmanuel to come to SMU too, but he didn\u2019t care.\nHis brothers, Stephane and Jean-Micheal, quickly became his role models.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the competitive Emmanuel, now a Nuggets first-round draft pick, to catch up with his brothers.\nTheir mother, Therese Kabeya, struggled to provide for her sons in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the birthplace of Emmanuel and his brothers."}
