The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a provision that provides for subsidies for those who qualify for individual insurance coverage under the act.\n\nWhat keeps Deschaine up at night are the elements of the employer mandate that go into effect next month.\n\nUnder the law, more companies are going to be considered applicable large employers. Through this year, companies with 100 or more employees were, as applicable large employers, required to offer health insurance plans. In 2016, the threshold drops to 50 employees, and in addition to meeting health care provision requirements, those companies also have to report details of 2015 insurance coverage to the IRS.\n\nComplicating matters in Maine is the number of companies that rely on seasonal or part-time employees or workers \u2014 all of which are defined differently under the law and which, if calculated incorrectly, could result in substantial penalties for employers. In addition, the Affordable Care Act deems anyone who works 30 hours a week to be a full-time employee, but in nearly all other cases, a full-time employee works 40 hours a week.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on is mass confusion,\u201d Deschaine said.\n\nThe panel fielded submitted questions that ranged from whether any software exists to track employee status to the intricacies of reporting new information to the IRS to understanding how common ownership rules of multiple entities apply to the requirement to provide insurance.\n\nEven as companies, lawyers, accountants and insurers are working to meet the new requirements, another possible change to the law could come in about 11 months with the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cHow this plays out depends on who is the nominee and what is their plan,\u201d Lungren said. \u201cSomehow, if the GOP gets a full sweep of the president, Senate and House, that could open up the Affordable Care Act to repeal and replacement.\u201d\n\nTo date, he said, Republican lawmakers have been further along on repeal than replacement. But one of the positive outcomes of the Supreme Court decision was that it prompted congressional Republicans to start figuring out what an alternate plan would be, Lungren said.\n\nJessica Lowell \u2014 621-5632\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @JLowellKJ", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Maine State Chamber hosted the forum to offer information and education ahead of changes to the federal health law affecting businesses.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The Maine State Chamber hosted the forum to offer information and education ahead of changes to the federal health law affecting businesses.", "title": "Augusta forum tackles Affordable Care Act changes in 2016 - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/456282_202377-20151201-Chamber-Hea.jpg", "height": 704}, "updated_time": "2015-12-01T16:25:43-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/12/01/augusta-forum-tackles-affordable-care-act-changes-in-2016/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/456282_202377-20151201-Chamber-Hea.jpg", "description": "The Maine State Chamber hosted the forum to offer information and education ahead of changes to the federal health law affecting businesses.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Augusta forum tackles Affordable Care Act changes in 2016 - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-12-01T16:07:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T16:25:43-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "AUGUSTA \u2014 Speakers at a forum for businesses Tuesday on the Affordable Care Act said navigating changes to the federal health care law in 2016 will require strict attention to detail and quite likely the advice of a team of consultants.\nJeff Lungren, health care lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, speaks Tuesday to members of the Maine Chamber of Commerce about health insurance at the Senator Inn in Augusta.\nThrough this year, companies with 100 or more employees were, as applicable large employers, required to offer health insurance plans.\nIn 2016, the threshold drops to 50 employees, and in addition to meeting health care provision requirements, those companies also have to report details of 2015 insurance coverage to the IRS.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a provision that provides for subsidies for those who qualify for individual insurance coverage under the act."}
