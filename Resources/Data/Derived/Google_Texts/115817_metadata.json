The playground will include an extensive climbing wall, swing bridges and a treehouse, which will connect to each other.\n\n0320 NWS Mehaffey Site Plan-sub.jpg Mehaffey Park Site Plan submitted 3/18/15 (Not Provided)\n\nAnd its completion doesn't come a moment too soon, especially on the west side of town, according to Mayor Cecil Gutierrez.\n\nGutierrez said he moved to the northwest side of Loveland with his family when his son was in elementary school, and the city was having discussions then about the park. Now, he has a granddaughter who is turning 21.\n\n\"I'm excited to see it finally come to be,\" Gutierrez said.\n\nLoveland, he said, is known for its great parks system, and Mehaffey Park will be no different.\n\nThe exact opening date of the park will depend on water delivery from the Louden Ditch Co., Meisel-Burns said, which won't be before May 1.\n\nThis is important for placing sod, which takes about six to eight weeks to establish, as well as for seeding, she said.\n\nParks Manager Larry Callihan said the pond at the park has been topped off, but there probably won't be more water to fill it before mid-April to May 1.\n\nThe opening will also depend on scheduling of other city events such as the June employee picnic and July 4th as well as the weather. If it cooperates, the project can stay on schedule, he said.\n\nThe park was initially planned to be constructed in phases, which turned out to be a challenge, Meisel-Burns said. It ended up costing more, especially as construction prices went up after the September 2013 flood, and it created delays for the same reason. An additional $500,000 was added to the projected cost because of the flood and delays.\n\nThat cost includes engineering, design, construction, environmental work and land acquisition \u2014 the first 60 acres was acquired in 1997 from the Mehaffey family, with the remaining 9.5 acres acquired in 2013. The 2013 acquisition was for the connection to 29th Street.\n\nA small piece of land at 29th Street that the city purchased won't have anything on it \u2014 at least in the short term. By the time all the features were laid out, Meisel-Burns said, they didn't need it.\n\nA disc golf course is planned in the long term as well for the park, but it could be one or two years before that's added.\n\n\"The disc golf course will be added at a later date,\" Callihan said. \"One of the reasons is we need to do some planting of trees and landscaping there,\" adding that they also need to mature to make the course more interesting.\n\nThe course will be located at the northeast side of the park, he said.\n\nThe park will have two entrances -- the north entrance will be at 3350 W. 29th Street and the south entrance will be at 3285 W. 22nd Street.
