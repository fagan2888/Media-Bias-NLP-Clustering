Ed Hernandez, OD, (D-24) explained that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s creation of a \u201chuge need\u201d for primary care providers \u201cprompted me to introduce a series of scope of practice bills to address the issue,\u201d including SB 493 for pharmacists.\n\n\u201cPolitical battles over scope of practice are contentious for any profession. I knew that going in,\u201d recalled California state Sen. Ed Hernandez, OD, (D-24) who last year introduced a series of scope of practice bills, including SB 493 for pharmacists.\n\nBut as Dr. Ed, an optometrist and local business owner choosing to practice in a Latino community with many Medicaid patients, Hernandez also knew that communities of color; and other communities in California don\u2019t have access to primary care. \u201cFewer and fewer physicians are going to these communities or taking patients with Medicaid,\u201d he said. So Hernandez looked at the abilities of pharmacists, optometrists, and nurse practitioners and the need to expand their scopes of practice to utilize them more efficiently within the health care system.\n\nHernandez represents roughly just under a million people from the City of Los Angeles to the Eastern San Gabriel Valley in communities that are predominantly Latino, working class, and second- or third-generation immigrants. He also serves as the Chair of the Senate Committee on Health. \u201cI\u2019ve always said this: pharmacists are completely overtrained and underutilized,\u201d he told Pharmacy Today. On March 13, 2013, Hernandez announced his introduction of three separate bills to allow pharmacists, optometrists, and nurse practitioners to practice to the full extent of their education and training. (Two other authors carried bills for physician assistants; Hernandez coauthored.)\n\nUltimately, only the pharmacist bill moved forward. On May 29, the California Senate approved SB 493, and it went to the California Assembly. On July 19, the California Medical Association (CMA) became \u201cneutral\u201d on an amended version of SB 493, and soon all organized opposition was dropped. On September 11, the California Assembly voted unanimously to pass SB 493, and the next day, the state Senate completed final approval. On October 1, Gov. Jerry Brown of California signed SB 493 into law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to have got it to the governor\u2019s desk,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s kind of a blueprint for where the rest of the country\u2019s going to follow.\u201d The new law gives new authorities to all licensed pharmacists, including the ability to furnish certain hormonal contraceptives, nicotine replacement products, and prescription medications for travel and to independently initiate and administer certain vaccines; and declares that pharmacists are health care providers who have the authority to provide health care services. It also establishes an Advanced Practice Pharmacist (APP) recognition for pharmacists meeting certain criteria and gives additional new authorities related to direct patient care to APPs.\n\n\u201cBut just one person alone wasn\u2019t going to get a piece of major legislation like that over the finish line,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt was going to require the advocacy group that represents that profession as well.\u201d\n\nCrafting SB 493\n\nThe California Pharmacists Association (CPhA) and the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists (CSHP) worked with Hernandez on the legislation. \u201cWell over a year ago, [I] kind of laid out the role of where I felt pharmacy should go. And they were obviously very supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understood the dynamics of what it took.\u201d\n\nIn August 2012, CSHP and CPhA were forming provider status committees whose respective chairs\u2014CSHP\u2019s Ryan Gates, PharmD, CDE, CGP, and CPhA\u2019s Sarah McBane, PharmD, CDE, BCPS, FCCP\u2014then convinced their committees and associations to join together \u201cto really get at the strength and unity of the voice [for] the profession,\u201d Gates told Today.\n\nMcBane and Gates became Co-Chairs of the Joint Provider Status Task Force, which first met in December 2012. At a full-day meeting in Burbank, CA, the joint task force\u2014comprising pharmacists from community settings to Kaiser Permanente to schools of pharmacy to safety net hospitals\u2014hashed out the profession\u2019s objectives for the legislation. At first, the diversity around the table made it \u201cvery difficult to get to a granular level,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we really sat down as a group, as a profession, and talked about: How can we expand access to care in the community setting?\u201d In fact, by about 1:00 pm, \u201ceverything really started clicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing we were careful of is we didn\u2019t propose anything too radical. We carefully crafted our bill as far as scope of practice provisions are concerned to identify things that are worth fighting for,\u201d said Jon R. Roth, CAE, CPhA CEO. Some other changes \u201cmight not have been worth it because it would have been a huge battle over something that really didn\u2019t gain much for pharmacists. So we tried to prioritize.\u201d\n\nOne priority was a flat-out declaration that pharmacists are health care providers. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of people considered to be the provider status part of it,\u201d Roth said. While the provider status designation by itself does not make pharmacists eligible to bill California\u2019s Medicaid program, it was a first step in that direction. Ensuring that pharmacists have \u201cthe scope of practice, or the legal authority, to perform the types of functions that health care payers want pharmacists to do\u201d was another step on the path to payment.\n\nProposing the necessary scope of practice changes, the joint task force knew, would lead to \u201cpushback potentially from the organized medical groups,\u201d said Brian Warren, CPhA Center for Advocacy Vice President. Health insurance companies, managed care organizations, and patient advocacy groups actually supported those changes. On the payment side, however, \u201cyou have the ability to kind of scare some of those health insurance companies and HMOs,\u201d he continued. \u201cDealing with organized medicine in opposition, as well as the managed care organizations and the health insurance companies, would have been too many people to be fighting all at once. That was part of the strategy for bifurcating.\u201d\n\nThe joint task force also had to get buy-in from the associations\u2019 members on the controversial creation of two different classifications of pharmacists in which the APP recognition gives experienced pharmacists a few select additional authorities.\n\nTop to bottom: Hernandez, an optometrist, at his private practice; Ryan Gates, PharmD, CDE, CGP, and Dawn Benton, MBA, of the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists (CSHP); pharmacists, student pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians participate in the California Pharmacy Legislative Day on April 16, 2013; Hernandez talks with another state senator on the Senate floor.\n\nCalifornia Pharmacists Association and CSHP members in front of the state capitol building at the pharmacy legislative day.\n\nPassing SB 493\n\nHernandez was well prepared to frame the bill for the California State Legislature \u201cbecause of the battles that I had with the optometrists as they moved their scope of practice over many decades,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, there is going to be a huge need for primary care providers not only in my district, but in the state of California.\u201d The worsening provider shortage for patients, Warren said, \u201ccreated a \u2018why this is needed now\u2019 type of thing that resonated with the legislature and also resonated with the medical community.\u201d\n\nCPhA and CSHP joined the California Association for Nurse Practitioners and the California Optometric Association to form the Californians for Accessible Healthcare coalition. Explained Dawn Benton, MBA, CSHP Executive Vice President and CEO, \u201cWe all agreed to be arm in arm in regards to support for each other.\u201d At the same time, the state senator\u2019s decision to sponsor the three scope of practice bills separately, according to Benton, was important for the pharmacists \u201cpolitically and strategically,\u201d given the risk of losing them all versus the chance to get one or two through.\n\nHernandez told Today that CSHP and CPhA \u201cplayed a critical role in lobbying the bill.\u201d Both associations hired lobbyists. \u201cThey always say there\u2019s two things you don\u2019t want to see being made, which are legislation and sausage. Nothing is closer to the truth,\u201d Gates said.\n\nPieces of legislation never finish as they were first introduced, and SB 493 was no exception. \u201cThere was concern by the opposition,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe tried to address them as much as we could.\u201d Several amendments and long negotiations later, Warren said, CMA withdrew its opposition. \u201cWe know plenty of physicians. Many of our members work with physicians who are supportive of this. That was another thing that really helped us.\u201d CMA never dropped its opposition to the optometrist and nurse practitioner bills.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a perfect marriage collaborating with Dr. Hernandez to pass SB 493,\u201d Benton said. \u201cPharmacy needed a champion to lead our cause, and he was the ideal candidate. He is so highly respected not only as an optometrist and legislator, but as a person with strong moral character, which blended perfectly with the fact that pharmacists are highly trusted professionals. We aligned on the compelling nature of legislation focusing on the need to expand patient access. Collaborating on the process was the key to its success.\u201d\n\nHernandez believes that SB 493 is now one of the most progressive laws in the country. Because California is one of the largest states, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see a lot more [states] move in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe culture of pharmacy needs to change from that of getting reimbursed for dispensing a product to being recognized as a provider and getting reimbursed for providing a service.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "title": "The saga of SB 493: Hernandez and California's new provider status law", "url": "https://www.pharmacist.com/saga-sb-493-hernandez-and-californias-new-provider-status-law", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2014-03-05T16:23:52-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-28T10:49:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-05T16:23:52-05:00"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcce1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt felt like a perfect marriage collaborating with Dr. Hernandez to pass SB 493,\u201d Benton said.\nCollaborating on the process was the key to its success.\u201dHernandez believes that SB 493 is now one of the most progressive laws in the country.\nPieces of legislation never finish as they were first introduced, and SB 493 was no exception.\nOn May 29, the California Senate approved SB 493, and it went to the California Assembly.\nJerry Brown of California signed SB 493 into law."}
