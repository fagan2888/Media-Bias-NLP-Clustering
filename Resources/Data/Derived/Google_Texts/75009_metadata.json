Under Hochman\u2019s watch, Providence has focused on the distinct areas of population health, personalization and entrepreneurship \u2014 eschewing fee-for-service reimbursement, investing in personalized diagnostics and genomics, hiring strategists from the likes of Amazon.com and starting its own $150M venture capital fund.\n\nIn greater Seattle, \u201cwe\u2019re the home of innovative companies,\u201d like Amazon, Costco and Expedia, said Hochman. When leaders from those kinds of companies look at hospital systems, \u201cthey look at us like we\u2019re absolutely insane in the way we deal with our patients and customers.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nServing Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington, Seattle-based Providence Health & Services is one of the largest providers on the West Coast, with 34 hospitals and a health plan. Hochman, a trained rheumatologist, was CEO of Seattle\u2019s Swedish Healthcare Services and led its affiliation deal with Providence before becoming Providence CEO in 2013.\n\nBring retail, tech talent to healthcare\n\nProvidence\u2019s last 10 major management hires, Hochman said, have come from Amazon, including Aaron Martin, the new vice president of strategy and innovation leading the $150M venture fund who worked on Amazon\u2019s Kindle and its self-publishing platforms. Another is the new vice president of digital innovation, Mark Long, a former NASA engineer who worked at Amazon\u2019s internal logistics services start-up.\n\nThe health system is going to invest $150 million over the next five years in early- and mid-stage companies in the areas of online primary care access, patient engagement, wellness, chronic disease management, clinician experience and data analysis.\n\nProvidence is also investing in advanced diagnostics and personalized medicine, hiring one of world\u2019s wealthiest and more innovative physicians, Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, to oversee what\u2019s billed as the country\u2019s first clinical genomic network for whole genomic sequencing.\n\nPersonalized medicine for rich and poor\n\nAs a Los Angeles surgeon in the 1980s, Soon-Shiong pioneered insulin cell transplants for Type 1 diabetics and then became a billionaire after inventing the cancer drug Abraxane. His new company, Nant Health, is pitching a suite of health IT and genomic sequencing processes that will be used across the Providence system.\n\n\u201cWe think technology works for everyone\u201d and \u201ccan bring it to everyone out there,\u201d from patients in Anchorage to Los Angeles, said Hochman.\n\nOn the population health front, Providence is making forays into accountable care and sponsoring its own health plan. It recently inked deals to serve employees of Boeing and Intel through ACO-style, self-funded health plans.\n\nBoeing's requests reminded Hochman of the features American healthcare consumers are increasingly seeking: retail clinics and online services, same-day or next-day appointments for primary care, online scheduling and review of test results, and telemedicine consults.\n\n\u201cCan my people get an appointment in the same day and get the information back in the same day?\u201d he said Boeing requested. \u201cIt really had a lot to do with the way services would be delivered.\u201d\n\nProvidence is also applying that strategy to its health plan, which covers Oregon state employees. Under Providence\u2019s plan, Hochman said, patients have seen costs keep pace with inflation thanks to avoiding acute and emergency care, a mix of patient-centered services and aggressive case management of chronic conditions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a real believer that provider-based insurance is essential,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving patients and staff what they need and want\n\nNovant Health, a hospital and clinic network serving Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia, has been asking its patients what they want from healthcare provider to find ways to reform.\n\nA key theme is cost transparency, said the health system\u2019s Chief Consumer Officer Jesse Cureton, a newcomer to healthcare who spent 30 years in financial services and helped build Bank of America. Another theme is 24/7 access to urgent care and nurses, extended hours, and online health records.\n\nFor primary care, Novant has opened three walk-in clinics in a partnership with Target retail stores, staffed by Target-employed nurse practitioners overseen by Novant Health physicians.\n\nNovant has also worked on improving its hospitals by connecting facilities digitally and trying to free up clinicians. In 2010, after learning that hospital nurses spent only 40 percent of their time directly serving or engaging patients, the system set a goal to have nurses spend 70 percent of their time in patient care activities.\n\nNovant has largely met that goal, while also improving retention, with an 8 percent decline in nurse turnover in 2013 compared to 2012, and key aspects of hospital care that are increasingly linked to reimbursement. Sallye Liner, RN, Novant\u2019s chief clinical officer, said many hospitals over the past few years have seen \u201cfewer patient falls, reductions in serious safety events, and a reduction in medication overrides, a precursor to medication errors.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitals-rush-reinvent-their-business", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Providence-healthcare-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Providence Health in the northwest and Novant Health in the southeast are pushing population health, high technology and other options that are creating value and improving care.", "title": "Hospitals in rush to reinvent their business"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Providence-healthcare-feature.gif"}, "description": "Providence Health in the northwest and Novant Health in the southeast are pushing population health, high technology and other options that are creating value and improving care.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hospitals in rush to reinvent their business"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If hospitals are not going to be the future of American healthcare, as Scripps Health cardiologist Eric Topol has said, then executives like Providence Health &amp; Services CEO Rod Hochman are on the right track.&#13; \u201cYou have to disrupt your own business to be successful,\u201d Hochman said at a forum hosted by the American Hospital Association on Tuesday.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5c2\"", "article_summary": "Serving Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington, Seattle-based Providence Health & Services is one of the largest providers on the West Coast, with 34 hospitals and a health plan.\nThe chief executive is trying to help the system reinvent patient care.\nPhoto of Providence Health from Wikipedia.\nOn the population health front, Providence is making forays into accountable care and sponsoring its own health plan.\nIf hospitals are not going to be the future of American healthcare, as Scripps Health cardiologist Eric Topol has said, then executives like Providence Health & Services CEO Rod Hochman are on the right track."}
