Artist James Woodfill said he was curious as to if he could create it mechanically.

On top of the roof there are several white boxes called solar cells, with batteries inside that power the lights.

On the rooftop of the Mimosa Tree Capital Partners building at 3rd and Detroit the installation is all around, but you can only see it at night.

There's a new piece of public art in downtown Tulsa. It's the first Urban Core Art Project installation and it's hidden in plain sight.

On the rooftop of the Mimosa Tree Capital Partners building at 3rd and Detroit the installation is all around, but you can only see it at night.

It's called Tulsa Patterns (Firefly Reference) and artist James Woodfill said he was curious as to if he could create it mechanically.

"I find that happens with most of my art it starts with a curiosity about some sort of occurrence," he said.

On top of the roof there are several white boxes called solar cells, with batteries inside that power the lights. The lights are small LED bulbs with a Mini Cooper auto turn signal lens.

The lights are small LED bulbs with a Mini cooper auto turn signal lens.

"That covers the light and keeps it out of the weather. Mini Cooper knows how to make lights visible from a long way away," said Woodfill.

You can see them from the street and from inside buildings around downtown.

The installation with be here for a year and it's the first for the Urban Core Art Project group.

They are excited about the beginning and more to come.
