Google will pay a stunning $3.2 billion in cash for the buzzy maker of \u201csmart\u201d thermostats and smoke alarms \u2014 \u201cone of the hottest names in energy-management technology and product design\u201d \u2014 according to GigaOm. That\u2019s an awful lot of Skynet jokes.\n\nBut when Nest founder Tony Fadell (a former Apple engineer who was one of the leaders of the original iPod team) says in his own announcement of the deal that \u201cfrom the beginning, our vision was to create a conscious home\u201d you can kind of understand the nervousness. Google already knows a lot about our everyday actions \u2014 now the company will have access to sensors with intimate knowledge of our physical activity inside our own homes. Substitute the word \u201cGoogle\u201d for \u201cNest\u201d in a Wired feature by Steven Levy from last October: \u201cNest is all about exploiting the growing infrastructure of sensors and connectivity around us. \u201d\n\nThe algorithms created by Nest\u2019s machine-learning experts\u2014and the troves of data generated by those algorithms\u2014are just as important as the sleek materials carefully selected by its industrial designers. By tracking its users and subtly influencing their behavior, the Nest Learning Thermostat transcended its pedestrian product category.\n\nSo now Google will, in theory, have access to all that potentially behavior-influencing data. No wonder Twitter exploded in jitters:\n\nI don't *want* my smoke detector telling Google when I'm in the shower. http://t.co/6yzRLenAGh \u2014 Tom Tomorrow (@tomtomorrow) January 13, 2014\n\nGoogle buys Nest thermostat venture, seems serious about becoming Skynet. http://t.co/gEQ1mcVBLu \u2014 Ward Harkavy (@WHarkavy) January 13, 2014\n\nGoogle: self-regulating houses, self-driving cars, and those killer military robot dogs.
