The system will allow individuals and families to apply and enroll in OHP, as well as manage their information online.\n\nONE will not replace HealthCare.gov for Oregonians. HealthCare.gov is still the place to go to apply and enroll in private health insurance plans through the federal exchange and to find out if people qualify for tax credits and other financial help for private insurance plans.\n\nThe kynect system was chosen because of similarity in Kentucky\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s state Medicaid rules, policies and system interfaces. OHA has been working hand-in-hand with Deloitte Consulting to begin the design and development work needed to adapt the technology for use in Oregon.\n\nAs for a timeline, there are two components. The system will begin becoming available to OHA eligibility workers and other staff by the end of 2015.\n\nFor the public, the timeline is a bit different. The system is expected to become available to Oregonians who are applying for OHP for the first time in early 2016. However, for Oregonians who are current OHP members, they will be asked to renew their coverage using our current renewal process (which is a manual process through an online PDF or paper application). Once they renew in 2016, they will get more information about setting up an online account in the new system.\n\nMcDaid added that \u201cMAGI Medicaid\u201d is a new term the council should become familiar with. \u201cMAGI stands for Modified Adjusted Gross Income.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of MAGI as the new population covered under Obamacare,\u201d said Health Share CEO Janet Meyer. \u201cThis is part of the expansion.\u201d\n\nMixed-eligibility households, in which some members may be eligible for Oregon Health Plan or Healthy Kids, will be referred to the right place.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me feel good,\u201d said McDaid, \u201c we\u2019re doing this and in user testing, things are going well.\u201d\n\nRide2Care helps drivers submit timely bills, appeals\n\nAt the October meeting, councilors expressed deep concerns about the bumpy transition of non-emergency medical transportation service to Access2Care, known as RideToCare.\n\nClients were unhappy with the service and drivers were frustrated with late payments.\n\nCrystal Rouse of Access2Care/RideToCare said 70 providers attended a meeting to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cWe went over their concerns with sample groups and that was absolutely amazing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe had a manual form, but there were language issues and system issues, and we sat down with them and got great feedback.\u201d\n\nAny payment denial from the third quarter was opened to appeal for seven days. Additional training was provided on how to appeal.\n\nOf more than 2,000 denied trip payments, there were more than 1,600 appeals and a payout of more than $45,000.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it clear, it\u2019s not in our best interest to deny payments,\u201d said Rouse, who estimated that 3 to 5 percent of rides are audited. When payments for legitimate services are denied, \u201cWe all lose.\u201d\n\nKendra Hogue can be reached at Kendra.hogue@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve got great news,\u201d said Jon McDaid, regional outreach coordinator for Oregon Health Authority Health Systems.\nThe rollout of ONE -- the new statewide health insurance computer system -- and attempts to improve the Ride to Care program dominated Health Share\u2019s Community Advisory Council last week.\n\u201cThis is part of the expansion.\u201dMixed-eligibility households, in which some members may be eligible for Oregon Health Plan or Healthy Kids, will be referred to the right place.\n\u201cThe system interfaces with all different kinds of portals including the Oregon Employment Department and the federal Healthcare.gov site.\u201dThe Oregon Health Authority is working to adopt the the Kentucky eligibility and enrollment system (kynect) for future enrollment in the Oregon Health Plan.\n\u201cMAGI stands for Modified Adjusted Gross Income.\u201d\u201cThink of MAGI as the new population covered under Obamacare,\u201d said Health Share CEO Janet Meyer."}
