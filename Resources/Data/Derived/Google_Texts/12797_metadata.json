He told the crowd that recent primary victories in Wisconsin and Utah are giving him momentum ahead of the state\u2019s April 19 primary.\n\nCruz also said endorsements from former GOP candidates and party leaders show the party is uniting behind him as the only candidate capable of winning a matchup with Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nMORE CAMPAIGN 2016 COVERAGE\n\nHe won big applause by promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act and eliminate the IRS.\n\nHe also said the race is as much about the Supreme Court as the presidency, with the winner likely to pick a justice that could set the court\u2019s direction for decades.\n\nLater Thursday, Cruz took a stop at the bakery at the Chabad Neshama Center in Brooklyn, and learned to make matzah from scratch with the help of a dozen children.\n\n\u201cWe took the stalks of wheat, we ground it up, we had flour, and we actually rolled out the dough with rolling pins,\u201d said Rabbi Moshe Winner.\n\nWinner, who is rabbi of the Chabad Center in Brighton Beach, said the event was not about politics. He said all the candidates were welcome.\n\n\u201cThis was not an endorsement at all,\u201d Winner told WCBS 880\u2019s Peter Haskell.\n\nBut Cruz had some strong supporters at the event, 1010 WINS\u2019 Carol D\u2019Auria reported.\n\n\u201cHe supports Israel. He\u2019s going to do for our economy, and I think there\u2019s no other choice out there,\u201d one man said at the event.\n\nWinner said the event was a great experience for the kids.\n\nAt the Brooklyn campaign stop, Cruz was asked what would happen if the general election turned to Trump up against Clinton, as CBS2\u2019s Brian Conybeare reported.\n\n\u201cThe first thing we would do is weep,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cbut there is something more fundamental, we must prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nCruz also participated in a roundtable with African-American business leaders in Brooklyn on Thursday.\n\nAs Cruz toured New York, a remark he made in the past became the subject of a new campaign ad from rival John Kasich, governor of Ohio.\n\nDuring a Republican presidential debate in January, Cruz said Republican frontrunner Donald Trump embodied \u201cNew York values,\u201d and went on to say, \u201cthe values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Ted Cruz Makes Matzah In Brooklyn\n\nBut Cruz defended the comment on Thursday and took a swipe at Trump.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has been funding these failed liberal policies and those failed liberal politicians for 40 years,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAt a campaign rally on Long Island later that evening, Trump also took a swipe at Cruz for the same \u201cNew York values\u201d remark.\n\n\u201cDo you remember during the debate when he started lecturing me on \u2018New York values\u2019 like we\u2019re no good?\u201d Trump asked the crowd.\n\nBut Cruz also defended his definition of New York liberalism against Trump\u2019s latest remarks.\n\n\u201cThe people of New York know exactly what those values are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to know what liberal, Democratic values are, follow Donald Trump\u2019s checkbook.\u201d\n\nAnd as Cruz has campaigned in New York, not everyone has been excited to hear him.\n\nCampaigning in the Bronx Wednesday, Cruz was met by a group of shouting protesters when he showed up for a meet-and-greet at a restaurant.\n\n\u201cGet out of the Bronx,\u201d they shouted.\n\nAccording to a new Monmouth Poll released Wednesday, Trump has support of 52 percent of likely GOP voters in New York followed by Kasich with 25 percent. Cruz comes in third at 17 percent.\n\nKasich also visited Brooklyn on Thursday for a town hall meeting, and dined at a deli in the Bronx.\n\nTrump laid low on Thursday following his rally.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
