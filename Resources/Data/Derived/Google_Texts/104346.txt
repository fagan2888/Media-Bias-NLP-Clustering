EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) â€” Actor Alec Baldwin and director Richard Linklater have braved the chilly waters off New York's Long Island at separate polar bear plunges on New Year's Day.

Newsday (http://nwsdy.li/1Tvs34w ) reports that Baldwin dived into the Atlantic Ocean on Friday to benefit an East Hampton rehabilitation facility. Linklater took part in a nearby plunge benefiting the East Hampton Food Pantry.

Baldwin is a Long Island native and a regular at glitzy charity events on the island's East End.

The Texas-based Linklater was vacationing in the area and decided to join the plunge. He said it was "really cool, so many people coming out for a good reason."

Baldwin has starred in numerous films as well as the NBC show "30 Rock."

Linklater's films include "Dazed and Confused," ''School of Rock" and "Boyhood."

This story has been corrected to show that Baldwin and Linklater participated in separate polar plunges, not the same one.
