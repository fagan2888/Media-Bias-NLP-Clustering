HealthCare.gov is down a lot and gets easily overloaded on those rare times it is up and sputtering, so naturally the Obama administration is airing ads to encourage people to visit a broken, buggy site.

When it’s taxpayer money you’re spending, you have nothing to lose.

Consumer Reports has advised people to avoid using HealthCare.gov for at least another couple of weeks because of all the unresolved problems, but HHS is spending taxpayer money urging people to keep trying, if the site’s broken or not.
