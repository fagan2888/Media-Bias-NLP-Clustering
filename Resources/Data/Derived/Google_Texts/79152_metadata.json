About 20 minutes into the documentary Under the Gun, Couric asks members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, \"If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\"\n\nThe response? Dead silence, for about nine awkward seconds:\n\nThat's not how it really went down, though, according to activists who contacted the Free Beacon. In audio provided to the website, Couric's question is actually quickly met with answers, and the back and forth lasts about four minutes:\n\nThe gun rights activists have called the segment \"unbelievable and extremely unprofessional.\" \"[Couric] intentionally removed their answers and spliced in nine seconds of some prior video of our members sitting quietly and not responding. Viewers are left with the misunderstanding that the members had no answer to her question,\" Virginia Citizens Defense League president Philip Van Cleave said.\n\nWhen asked about the edits, Nora Ryan, the chief of staff for EPIX, which is airing the documentary, said that the channel \"stands behind Katie Couric, director Stephanie Soechtig, and their creative and editorial judgement.\" Jeva Lange", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/speedreads/546541/senators-take-aim-obamacare-85-proposed-healthcare-amendments", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_6_4/public/458901783.jpg?itok=MB4bjCc4", "type": "article", "description": "Senate Republicans are\u00a0determined to destroy ObamaCare.
