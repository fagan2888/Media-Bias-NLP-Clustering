EUGENICS: How and Why We Are Being Exterminated.

(ThyBlackMan.com) If you believe every conspiracy is just a theory with no verifiable facts, stop reading this article now. If you are afraid of the truth and you believe ignorance is bliss, stop reading this article now. But if you want to know the truth, the why and the what you can do about it, please keep reading this article. I am going to give you information that can be verified independent of me, independent of YouTube and independent of theory. Before you shake your head in disbelief, go check for yourself. I hope you are a skeptic, but a skeptic with the nerve to go find out, not just to scoff in disbelief.

Last night I again watched an old movie called Logan’s Run, a sci-fi thriller of sorts made far ahead of its time. Logan’s Run was based on population control. The people lived in a utopian society where they were micro-chipped (lo-jacked and required to turn themselves in to be exterminated in their mid 30s). The brainwashing was so affective that they had no idea they were being deceived and they were being killed instead of “renewed”. It was government run religion without the spirituality and everything was regulated by a supercomputer.

This movie might sound like humorous sci-fi if it were not for several factors that are true today and science fiction of just 20 or 30 years ago is easily becoming science fact today. Did you know, for instance, that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has a provision that allows for microchip implantation and tracking of those who have the plan? Google what I just said and download a pdf copy of the plan. You will see for yourself. Do I have your attention? Good, keep reading.

Eugenics is population control. It is what the Georgia Guide stones reference. It is what Hitler believed in, a master race and extermination of those people who are not a part of it. It is what he was told to do. It is what Margaret Sanger promoted by placing Planned Parenthood primarily in Africa-American areas and making abortion readily available. This has gone unnoticed because of the marketing disguises used to make us believe her centers made sense and they were there to “help”. If they shared the real or main reason, many women would not have gone – and sadly many women would have gone anyway. But there have been over 40 million abortions since the landmark court decision Roe vs. Wade and if you look at the percentages of African-Americans who will never exist, the numbers clearly paint a picture. This article is not a debate on pro-life or pro-choice but numbers do not lie and neither are numbers coincidental.

After Steve Jobbs died, a meeting was held with the Rockefellers, Oprah and Bill Gates. In fact, Bill Gates has spoken in favor of population control and the Rockefellers have a population control plan. More media, the medical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the telecommunications industry, those who regulate your food and world financiers are in on this plan than you might think. If you work in one of these industries and you are shaking your head or laughing, it is likely that you are not high enough in your field to know what I am saying is true. If you do know what I am saying is true, you are not shaking your head. I am going to give you more proof but don’t ask me how I know some of it because some questions are best not answered, But don’t assume that I have no facts because you would be in error.

Eugenics is about reducing the population of the planet through natural and artificial means. The long white trails you see in the sky, for example, are not commercial passenger planes. They are planes spraying Chemtrails of poison gas containing Barium which is dangerous and toxic to the respiratory system. Last year after reading an article, I went outside and made a ball with snow. I tried to melt the snow with a lighter but it would not melt. It burned black on the bottom like a ball of chemicals. That’s a fact and I did it myself along with several other people. There is or was something chemical and unnatural in the snow that fell in the snowstorm last year in Atlanta. But the evidence does not stop there.

Eugenics involves population control and reduction by counting on deaths from natural causes, accidents, wars, natural diseases, man-made diseases (AIDS), mutated disease strains (H5N1 flu, Ebola which mutated dozens of times), natural disasters (earthquakes, famines, tornadoes), man-made disasters (Hurricane Katrina, earthquakes, tsunamis, famines and crime. The numbers are crunched and projections are made. Then whatever needs to be adjusted is adjusted to reduce the numbers. Before you say I am just making this all up, do your homework. Research H.A.A.R.P., the patented government weather control device based on the work of Nikola Tesla. The United States government patent website is www.uspto.gov and while you are there I have something else for you to check. You will also find the patented cure for AIDS that has set there quietly for over 10 years. Do a patent search then a patent number search. Search patent number 5676977 and see what you find. Not s treatment, but a CURE. Are you still doubting me or thinking I am just making up conspiracy theories? Then keep reading. I am sure you skeptics will say the holocaust did not occur and that tour government did not give those men syphilis in the Tuskegee experiment too. But most of us know it happened. And 911 is a whole other issue that I cannot get into today.

It is a risk to even tell you as much as I have. Therefore for you skeptics or those who want to keep their heads in the sand, do not bother to comment and do not expect me to respond to your comments. But the facts are the facts. Have you ever wondered why the medical symbol is two snakes wrapped around a staff? No it’s not because of Moses but more likely because of Hermes and the caduceus he carried. It is the mark of the serpent, the same one back in the Garden of Eden. The same serpent known as the Kundalini in the practice of Yoga. The same serpent which sits on top of the headdress of King Tut. It is the same dragon that Chinese culture is infatuated with, the same serpent reptile that Christ spoke of when he called a group “generation of Vipers” in the Bible. Check for yourself.

Have you ever wondered why doctors seem to be able to treat almost anything but cure almost nothing? The medical INDUSTRY makes more money by treating people than curing them. Have you ever wondered why we can clone animals (and probably humans as well), put a rover on Mars and determine the sex of a newborn but we are still using chemotherapy to kill cancer cells – even though it kills good cells and often weakens people until they die? Have you ever wondered why so many pharmaceutical medicines have side effects that can be worse than the condition the medicine is supposed to fight in the first place? None of this is coincidence. These are all facts, like them or not.

Did you notice how one day we were in a flu pandemic and all of a sudden, no more talk about it as if it seemed to disappear? But before you say it was because of the vaccines, you need to know a great many people who never took the shot also never got the flu, myself included. Likewise many children died after receiving the flu shot but this was kept quiet and out of the media. And others took the shot but got the flu anyway. Look how the Ebola crisis was handled. It could have easily spread across this country – or was that a trial run like H1N1 before it came back as H5N1?

Our country goes into war after war after war selectively and the returning body bags are kept quiet or out of the media. Why do you think that is? Enemies are manufactured like cheap fake Nikes and off to another battle our children go. Agent Orange sprayed in Vietnam has been linked to the deaths and illnesses of many soldiers and PTSD is taking even more of them out. The American Legion in a recent commercial reported that 22 veterans a day commit suicide. Wow, are you freakin kidding me? Yet the marketing of patriotism is forcing people to believe the battles, wars and deaths are all necessary to protect our freedoms from dictators who can’t reach us with their missiles anyway. When the United States wanted Bin Laden gone, he was gone. When the United States wanted to capture the “great threat” Saddam Hussein, our military found him hiding in a hole. But he was a big threat right? Wrong. Yet our country went to war to get a man who was not a threat and to get weapons we never found while thousands of people died on both sides. Do you wonder why? It was not simply about weapons or oil because we have plenty of both.

In World War II the United States broke a treaty and used incinerary devices to cause Japanese civilians to heat up to a thousand degrees in less than a minute. That’s not an indictment, that’s a fact and 200,000 people in Japan lost their lives. I am not saying some wars are not necessary. I am simply saying what Denzel Washington said in Crimson Tide. “The true enemy cannot be defeated because in a war the true enemy is war itself”. My point is simply that these wars, fights, battles and skirmishes have a covert purpose of population control. When the “ethnic cleansing” went on in Africa in the Sudan and genocide of hundreds of thousands of people occurred, the world stood by and let it happen. Why? Because it served a sick purpose – population control. There are still thousands of people in Haiti displaced, facing famines and living in tents from the manufactured earthquake years ago but that is never mentioned. Yet we go right on building more bombs and weapons to kill more people faster. Fact, Russia just completed the most powerful missile on the planet again. It replaced there earlier missile called satan and this new one can deliver 14 nuclear warheads. That’s crazy and that’s every major city in the United States – Chicago, Miami, Washington, New York, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles etc. If we do not have that many soldiers inhabiting our major cities, what could be the purpose of such a weapon of mass destruction? You guess it, population control through war.

SO WHAT CAN THE AVERAGE PERSON DO ABOUT THESE THINGS? Knowing the truth is a start. Then do your own research and don’t be afraid to do it. Sharing the truth is next. Share this article with everybody you know. Then you pray. Then you begin to prepare. That’s why I tell people to stay off the scope as much as you can. But many people are not listening and go right on jumping on Facebook, even though Facebook is a data gathering hub that reports to DAARPA which reports to the Department of Defense. Stop helping people track you and build your profile. Stop telling everybody what you are doing all the time, where you go are who you know. You have the right to bear arms (legally) so don’t trade in your weapon. Our people are trading in weapons and “white” people are buying every weapon they can. Read the labels on the food you buy because it is likely the accumulation of pesticides, insecticides, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and genetically modified or cloned foods is causing all types of diseases and medical problems. Stop eating so much fast food and know what’s in it. Is there any milk in McDonald’s shakes? Only about half of their nugget is chicken, did you know that? Know what you are eating and make the time to cook.

You should also know that the cheapest foods are often purchased by the most people in certain economic groups. If those groups are full of people considered a detriment to the planet by the powers that be, you can expect the most chemicals to be in the cheapest foods. And all of the same name grocery stores are not created equal. Research natural cures and remedies. Hold your doctor accountable and discuss alternative breakthrough cures and treatments. Don’t just follow like a dumb sheep or treat a doctor like he/she walks on water. Double and triple check his or her advice. There is a lot you can do and you will be able to make a much longer list once you do your research. We have only scratched the surface. Check out everything for yourself and believe no one blindly. That is your biggest defense. Meanwhile, I wish you wisdom, long life, good health and the desire to know the truth so you can act on it.
