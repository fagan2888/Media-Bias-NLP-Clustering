Ever since Donald Sterling was caught telling his girlfriend that she can\u2019t bring blacks to his Los Angeles Clippers games, accusations of racism have dramatically escalated in public life.\n\nWashington politicians are using the atmosphere to stir up racial divisions in an election year.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid united all of his Democrat caucus last week to sign a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. They want the league to force Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the football team\u2019s name because they consider it \u201ca racial slur.\u201d\n\nWhile 100 percent of Democratic senators are suddenly outraged by the football team name, Redskins\u2019 President Bruce Allen pointed out to Reid that 90 percent of Native Americans are not offended by the team\u2019s name.\n\nIn a letter sent Friday, Allen clarified the facts and also invited Reid to come to a game to see firsthand that the team is a \u201cpositive, unifying force\u201d in the community.\n\nAnother member of the Democratic caucus, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, said this week that opposition to ObamaCare comes from racism.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee said at a hearing Wednesday that he had emails from people who oppose the health care law \u201cbecause they don't like the president -- maybe he's of the wrong color, something of that sort.\"\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat added, \u201cI've seen a lot of that, and I know a lot of that to be true. It\u2019s something you\u2019re not meant to talk about it public.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Johnson was the only Republican in the hearing at the time.\n\nThe Wisconsin freshman told Rockefeller that it was regrettable that he would \u201cplay the race card.\u201d An animated Johnson added, \u201cI found it very offensive that you would basically imply that I'm a racist because I opposed this law.\"\n\nMichelle Obama used a high school graduation speech in Topeka, Kansas, on May 16 to tell students to talk about \u201cthe issue of race -- because, even today, we still struggle to do that.\u201d\n\nShe told the teenagers to monitor their parents and grandparents for \u201coff-colored\u201d jokes or references to \u201cthose people.\u201d\n\nThe first lady challenged the high-schoolers to ask for more diversity in their college fraternities, and when they have families of their own, to \u201cinsist on integrating your children\u2019s schools.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the left throwing around accusations of racism like free T-shirts at a baseball game.\n\nPat Sajak, the host of \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d tweeted on May 19 that \u201cI now believe global warming alarmists are unpatriotic racists knowingly misleading for their own ends.\u201d\n\nA rare conservative in Hollywood, Sajak explained in a tweet two days later that he meant only to \u201cparody the name-calling directed at climate skeptics.\u201d\n\nThe Sterling case could be used to improve race relations if people would stop pretending that it\u2019s possible to have zero biases.\n\nAnother NBA owner, Mark Cuban, said Sterling is \u201cobviously racist\u201d and \u201cbigoted.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas Maverick\u2019s owner, however, \u200battempted to make the debate productive.\n\nHe explained in a lengthy interview with Inc. that everyone has some biases, but it\u2019s better to help people grow beyond their limited thinking instead of simply ostracizing them.\n\nCuban then gave a remarkable honest assessment of his own prejudices.\n\n\u201cIf I see a black kid in a hoodie and it\u2019s late at night, I\u2019m walking to the other side of the street,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd if on that side of the street, there\u2019s a guy that has tattoos all over his face--white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere--I\u2019m walking back to the other side of the street.\u201d\n\nThe politically-correct media and liberal advocates flat-out ignored the \u200bfull \u200bcontext of Cuban's remarks and pounced.\n\nThe entrepreneur \u200bwas forced to tweet an apology to Trayvon Martin\u2019s family (the hoodie-wearing teenager was shot and killed when attacking George Zimmerman, who was found by a Florida jury to be acting in self-defense) but stood by the rest of his statement.\n\nCuban was right that we all have prejudices. Everyone makes snap decisions based on appearance.\n\nWhat sets\u200b apart Sterling is \u200bthat he acted on his biases, which makes him a racist. The NBA was right to ban him for life.\n\nHowever, racism is not biased thinking, and it\u2019s not minor political issues. None of these things are racist: opposing ObamaCare, supporting global-warming theories, all-white or all-black college fraternities and football team names.\n\nRacism is a serious violation of human rights. So it is crying wolf to throw around the hot-button term for disputes that largely hurt no one. Public figures in politics and Hollywood and sports need to stop race baiting.\n\nEmily Miller is the chief investigative reporter at Fox 5 D.C.
