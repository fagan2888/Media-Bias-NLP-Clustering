The parcel, site of the former WPAL radio station, is mostly marsh, with about 1.3 acres of highland, she said. It also includes a building and a dock on the river.\n\nIn December, the city purchased about an acre on the Ashley River at the end of Bender Street in the Maryville-Ashleyville neighborhood for $350,000. The site, all of which is highland, sits not far from Higgins Pier.\n\nAll of the land will be used for parks, she said. \u201cThe city now is evaluating what the specific, appropriate uses will be.\u201d\n\nCity Councilman Bill Moody, a longtime supporter of the city purchasing the Wappoo Road property, said the site includes a building, but not the radio tower.\n\nNow that the land has been purchased, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll put together a group of neighborhood people and parks people to decide how to proceed.\u201d\n\nThe land isn\u2019t yet open to the public, and there is a barrier blocking the pier. Moody said he doesn\u2019t know how long it will take for the city to open up the property, \u201cbut it will be sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nThe city wants the land to be used, he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want bands playing out there at 10 p.m. We don\u2019t want the neighbors disturbed.\u201d\n\nCouncilman James Lewis, who represents the Maryville-Ashleyville neighborhood, said the city\u2019s purchase of the Ashley River site will benefit neighborhood residents and anybody else who wants to take in a striking view of the river.\n\nThe property has been overgrown for years, but Lewis said the city eventually will clean it so people can use it.\n\nHe said the city made a wise purchase because if it hadn\u2019t acted, \u201cone of these days a developer might have bought it.\u201d\n\nReach Diane Knich at 843-937-5491 or on Twitter @dianeknich.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "City purchases waterfront land for West Ashley parks, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Ashley River,Higgins Pier,Stono River,WPAL", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The city of Charleston has purchased two pieces of waterfront property in West Ashley that eventually will become city parks.", "title": "City purchases waterfront land for West Ashley parks", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160220/160229941/city-purchases-waterfront-land-for-west-ashley-parks", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160220/PC16/160229941/AR/0/AR-160229941.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160220/PC16/160229941/AR/0/AR-160229941.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The city of Charleston has purchased two pieces of waterfront property in West Ashley that eventually will become city parks.", "title": "City purchases waterfront land for West Ashley parks", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160220/PC16/160229941/AR/0/AR-160229941.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160229941}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "City purchases waterfront land for West Ashley parks , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Ashley River,Higgins Pier,Stono River,WPAL", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T20:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T17:03:00Z", "author": "Diane Knich"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The city of Charleston has purchased two pieces of waterfront property in West Ashley that eventually will become city parks."}, "article_summary": "The city of Charleston has purchased two pieces of waterfront property in West Ashley that eventually will become city parks.\nColleen Carducci, the city\u2019s real estate management director, said the city purchased a 30-acre parcel at 1717 Wappoo Road for $980,000 last month.\nIn December, the city purchased about an acre on the Ashley River at the end of Bender Street in the Maryville-Ashleyville neighborhood for $350,000.\nThe property has been overgrown for years, but Lewis said the city eventually will clean it so people can use it.\nAll of the land will be used for parks, she said."}
