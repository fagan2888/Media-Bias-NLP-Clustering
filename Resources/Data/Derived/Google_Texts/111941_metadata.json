(Content taught on Saturday won\u2019t be repeated on Sunday due to time constraints.) Register: www.lowcountrynaturalbuilding.com/news/upcoming-workshops/\n\nToday, four years after that gutsy decision, Magill gets so many requests both here and beyond that she\u2019s having to turn down jobs through her business Root Down Designs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge demand and I\u2019m always pleasantly surprised about the interest in it both in South Carolina and the Southeast,\u201d says Magill. \u201cI see it as a trend that\u2019s growing and growing rapidly.\u201d\n\nNatural building methods includes an array of methods, from rammed earth, adobe, straw bale and cob, all of which use \u201cearthen materials,\u201d such as clay, sand, straw, rocks, bamboo and more.\n\nThe millenium-old methods also seek to use materials that are local, salvaged or recycled. Buildings are oriented on property to make the most use of sun and shade to minimize energy consumption.\n\nIn the same vein, her specialty extends to designing \u201ctiny houses,\u201d defined generally as homes less than 1,000 square feet. People seek the homes to simplify their lives, use less energy and spend less money.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s an earthen method or a conventional method, I am always incorporating passive solar design methods, working to reduce square footage, looking at locally sourced and milled materials, viewing the project in a holistic way, using the ethics of permaculture and always trying to incorporate it with nature and plant life to the best of my ability,\u201d she says.\n\nMagill, working with local structural engineer John Moore, has designed the first officially permitted rammed earth building in South Carolina. The building, set for construction in spring 2016, will be a classroom for the Barclay School at Columbia College in Columbia.\n\nShe has constructed several cob ovens, including one used for making wood-fired pizzas at Awendaw Green, an outdoor, live music venue .\n\nAnd while she is busy designing and building structures, spreading the word about natural building in the Lowcountry remains integral to her mission.\n\nNext weekend, she will hold her latest \u201cIntro to Cob & Natural Building: How to Build a Cob Oven\u201d at the Romney Street Urban Garden, aka RUG, located on a quarter acre owned by New Israel Episcopal Church. Youth leaders in the church want to include the oven in its urban garden in an effort to revitalize the blighted area.\n\n\u201cThis is a very positive project, as the youth group of the church decided to take this blighted dead end and turn it into a healthy, community space,\u201d says Magill, noting that the project has the approval of city building officials and is being funded by the Historic Charleston Foundation.\n\nCob, aka cobb or clom, construction originated in Wales and involves building with a mixture of sand, clay and straw packed into small round lumps. It is inexpensive, resistant to earthquakes and fireproof.\n\nMagill says cob ovens are ideal to demonstrate the building method and can be constructed in backyards in the same vein as barbecue pits and oyster roasters.\n\nPart of the beauty of the workshops, Magill adds, is that they are hands-on learning experiences that brings people together, which results in a long-lasting structure.\n\n\u201cPeople get stoked when they can build something with their own hands,\u201d says Magill.\n\nReach David Quick at 937-5516.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Architect teaching locals about building with earthen materials by holding cob oven workshops, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFood, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nHome & Garden, April Magill,cob construction,natural building,Romney Street Urban Garden,Root Down Designs,sustainable building", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When architect April Magill quit her traditional architecture job after eight years at the age of 30 to pursue \u201cnatural building\u201d and \u201csustainable architecture,\u201d she wasn\u2019t sure how much work she would get out of Ch", "title": "Architect teaching locals about building with earthen materials by holding cob oven workshops", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150523/150529751/architect-teaching-locals-about-building-with-earthen-materials-by-holding-cob-oven-workshops", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC1207/150529751/AR/0/AR-150529751.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC1207/150529751/AR/0/AR-150529751.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When architect April Magill quit her traditional architecture job after eight years at the age of 30 to pursue \u201cnatural building\u201d and \u201csustainable architecture,\u201d she wasn\u2019t sure how much work she would get out of Ch", "title": "Architect teaching locals about building with earthen materials by holding cob oven workshops", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150523/PC1207/150529751/AR/0/AR-150529751.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529751}}, "keywords": "Architect teaching locals about building with earthen materials by holding cob oven workshops , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFood, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nHome & Garden, April Magill,cob construction,natural building,Romney Street Urban Garden,Root Down Designs,sustainable building", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T15:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T15:37:00Z", "author": "David Quick"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "When architect April Magill quit her traditional architecture job after eight years at the age of 30 to pursue \u201cnatural building\u201d and \u201csustainable architecture,\u201d she wasn\u2019t sure how much work she would get out of Ch"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bb4\"", "article_summary": "And while she is busy designing and building structures, spreading the word about natural building in the Lowcountry remains integral to her mission.\nArchitect April Magill (upper right) uses cob oven workshops as a hands-on approach to teach about the construction method that originated in Wales about 1,000 years ago.\nNext weekend, she will hold her latest \u201cIntro to Cob & Natural Building: How to Build a Cob Oven\u201d at the Romney Street Urban Garden, aka RUG, located on a quarter acre owned by New Israel Episcopal Church.\nMagill says cob ovens are ideal to demonstrate the building method and can be constructed in backyards in the same vein as barbecue pits and oyster roasters.\nMagill, working with local structural engineer John Moore, has designed the first officially permitted rammed earth building in South Carolina."}
