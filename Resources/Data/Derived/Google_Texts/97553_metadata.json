The report found that 72% of bankruptcy filers owed money for medical-related debt, with a majority of the medical debt owed to an Oregon hospital system. The total medical debt in personal bankruptcy filings added up to $5.6 million for 2014.\n\n\u201cEven with expanded healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act, we still often hear from people in Oregon and Washington that rising hospital costs are pushing already struggling families over the edge, but until now we have lacked clear data about local impacts,\u201d said Meg Niemi, President of SEIU Local 49. \u201cThis study confirms that there is a real and troubling connection between the high cost of medical care and personal bankruptcy in our local communities.\u201d\n\nThe ten largest creditors in Lane County\u2014ranked by sum of liabilities and excluding collection companies\u2014are:\n\n1. PeaceHealth Sacred Medical Center \u2013 $1,196,584\n\n2. McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center \u2013 $881,847\n\n3. PeaceHealth \u2013 $788,949\n\n4. PeaceHealth Medical Group \u2013 $221,295\n\n5. Oregon Medical Group \u2013 $148,143\n\n6. Slocum Center for Orthopedics \u2013 $131,526\n\n7. Radiology Associates \u2013 $78,742\n\n8. Eugene Emergency Physicians \u2013 $74,928\n\n9. Northwest Anesthesia Physicians \u2013 $74,657\n\n10. Cottage Grove Community Hospital \u2013 $63,107\n\nThe hospital system holding the largest amount of debt in Lane County is non-profit PeaceHealth, which holds a total of 39% of the medical debt in the county, or a total of $2,344,863.\n\nIn one example included in the analysis, a patient who is also an employee at PeaceHealth had her wages garnished after being unable to pay her medical debt (U.S. Bankruptcy Court Case #15-62498-fra7).\n\nSaid Hollie Murphy, a certified nursing assistant at the hospital:\n\n\u201cI was forced into bankruptcy after being unable to pay for all the costs associated with a surgery I received. There were fees from the hospital, surgeon, anesthesiologist and more. I\u2019m a caregiver at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart, but my insurance still left me with thousands of dollars I couldn\u2019t pay. I tried to pay what I could, but was sent to collections and eventually had my wages garnished. This meant that after the various deductions, paying healthcare premiums for me and my family, and my wages garnished for medical debt for my surgery, I was left with only around $300, even with me working full time. That made it very difficult to pay rent, electricity, and other costs of daily living. My mother, even though on a fixed income herself, helped with groceries so we could have food on the table.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that more than 40 percent of those who filed for bankruptcy and had medical debt owed over $5,000 in medical expenses.\n\n\u201cWith non-profit hospitals receiving significant tax breaks as \u2018charitable\u2019 organizations and simultaneously sending people to collections, it\u2019s time to take a closer look at a broken system and strive toward a community where we all have access to affordable, quality care,\u201d said Niemi.\n\nAbout SEIU Act Now for a Healthy Oregon\n\nSEIU\u2019s Act Now for a Healthy Oregon campaign is working to achieve the goal of keeping our communities healthy by achieving the Triple Aim: improving quality, enhancing access, and increasing affordability of care.
