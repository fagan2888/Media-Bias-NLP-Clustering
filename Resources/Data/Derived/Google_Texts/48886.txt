Organizers encouraged everyone who attended the event to bring a new unwrapped toy to donate to the Toys for Tots Christmas toy drive.

Marines were on site collecting toys to give to more than 11,000 needy families in Pima and Santa Cruz counties.

Money raised from the annual Turkey Trot goes to the Southern Arizona Roadrunners and My Team Triumph (http://www.mtt-az.org/#)

Last year, the event raised more than $4,000.
