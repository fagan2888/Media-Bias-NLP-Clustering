From the rural towns like Bethany to the urban cities like Waterbury, from the millionaire homes on the Guilford coast to the homelessness in New Haven \u2026. Connecticut\u2019s District 3 has the extremes \u201cand everything in between,\u201d said Brown.\n\nThe number one issue on the candidate\u2019s mind as he speaks with people during his campaign, Brown said, is the \u201cdivisiveness in the nation \u2014 Democrats, Republicans; rich, poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are sick of blame and name-calling. It doesn\u2019t get us anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany, many people say \u2018thrown them all out\u2019 (of Congress). They are tired of the whole political system,\u201d Brown reports from the road.\n\n\u201cWhose fault it is doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cSolutions start with talking, and this tour is about talking.\u201d\n\nThe hike\n\nBrown\u2019s walking tour, or \u201cthe hike,\u201d as he called it, began Aug. 2 in Stratford, where he lives and coaches track for Bunnell High School. It is scheduled to end there Sat. Aug. 16. He, along with a volunteer, walk about 12 miles per day, creating a continuous route through each of the district\u2019s towns.\n\nOn Aug. 15 the accompanying volunteer was Ian LeComer, a Bunnell alumnus who now attends Central Connecticut State University.\n\nEach night Brown has gone to his home, and then re-started the next morning from where he ended the day before. He said he was \u201cvery sore first few days, and got blisters, but the blisters turned to calluses\u201d and the muscles aches got better.\n\nBeing on foot made it hard for him to have tightly scheduled meetings with local elected officials and other candidates, as he had originally hoped, so, instead, Brown said made the most of spontaneous opportunities to meet and speak with people.\n\nHe said found it remarkable when people stopped their travels to say hello and that they had heard about his campaign walk.\n\nNational issues are local\n\nDivisiveness and diversity came to mind during the tour also when he met some people who have been helped by the Affordable Care Act and others who have been hurt by it, for example. Or when, Brown said, some people said they want to receive more from the government, while others say the government should spend less on benefits.\n\nThe divisiveness surrounding the current debate on the country\u2019s immigration policies became clear to Brown, he said, when he heard a New Haven official offering to take in illegals and house and feed them, while there is a already large number of homeless people there.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d Brown said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Stratford Star", "description": "On walking tour candidate Brown sees diversity of District 3", "title": "On walking tour candidate Brown sees diversity of District 3", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://stratfordstar.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2014/08/BrownWalk1-150x150.jpg", "url": "http://www.stratfordstar.com/27064/on-walking-tour-candidate-brown-sees-diversity-of-district-3/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/StratfordStar", "section": "News", "tag": "U.S. Congress", "published_time": "2014-08-15T14:56:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Stratford Star", "description": "On walking tour candidate Brown sees diversity of District 3", "title": "On walking tour candidate Brown sees diversity of District 3", "image": {"src": "http://stratfordstar.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2014/08/BrownWalk1.jpg"}, "creator": "@stratfordstar", "site": "@stratfordstar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "On walking tour candidate Brown sees diversity of District 3", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Divisiveness and diversity are two words that are top-of-mind for James Brown as he nears the end of his campaign walk through the 25 towns that make up Connecticut\u2019s 3rd Congressional District.\nHe said found it remarkable when people stopped their travels to say hello and that they had heard about his campaign walk.\nConnecticut\u2019s District 3 has the extremes \u201cand everything in between,\u201d said Brown.\nThe number one issue on the candidate\u2019s mind as he speaks with people during his campaign, Brown said, is the \u201cdivisiveness in the nation \u2014 Democrats, Republicans; rich, poor.\u201d\u201cPeople are sick of blame and name-calling.\nEach night Brown has gone to his home, and then re-started the next morning from where he ended the day before."}
