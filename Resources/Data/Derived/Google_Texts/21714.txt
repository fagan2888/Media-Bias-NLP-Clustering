Cushing police arrested a woman for the possession of meth after they pulled her over for driving with a revoked license Monday night.

According to police, just after 7 p.m., officers received information that 45-year-old Heather Hesson was driving without a valid license.

An officer confirmed that Hesson’s license was revoked and pulled her over in the area of 5th and Independence. Hesson reportedly admitted that she knew her license was revoked, but she could not find anyone to drive her home.

Hesson was then arrested and placed in the officer’s patrol car. She then told officers that she had a “baggie of scrape” in her bra area, police said.



According to the report, an officer found two small baggies containing a crystal-like substance in Hesson’s possession. The substance later field-tested positive for meth.

Hesson now faces charges of driving while driver’s license is revoked, possession of meth within 1000 feet of a park after felony conviction, and possession of drug paraphernalia. She has been transported to the Payne County Sheriff’s Department Tuesday morning and is expected to appear in court in the afternoon.
