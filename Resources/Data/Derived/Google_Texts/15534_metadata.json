If abortion should be legal [then] it should be safe.\u201d\n\nTanning salons and restaurants, by contrast, are inspected annually.\n\nToday, 63 percent of the currently licensed abortion centers have gone between two and three and half years without inspections. But \u201c54 percent of Illinois women\u2019s clinics are unlicensed and have not received a health and sanitary inspection in 14 years.\u201d\n\n54 percent of Illinois women\u2019s clinics are unlicensed and have not received a health and sanitary inspection in 14 years.\n\nThe five Illinois Planned Parenthood abortion clinics have settled at least six malpractice lawsuits, including two over abortions that left the women dead.\n\nAnother woman who allegedly had a botched abortion at Planned Parenthood \u201csuffered amputation of [her] uterus and cervix.\u201d\n\nAbortion advocates generally oppose safety requirements for providers as a Trojan horse designed to eliminate the procedure altogether.\n\nIn 2011, unhealthy conditions at abortion clinics received national attention when Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of killing three babies at his \u201chouse or horrors\u201d clinic, which authorities had repeatedly failed to inspect.\n\nZender says that the bad publicity prompted the Illinois Department of Health then inspected all 14 licensed facilities.\n\nA total of 193 health and sanitary violations were found in all but one of the clinics.\n\nThey included:\n\nThe failure to employ a registered nurse during \u201can invasive and operative procedure.\u201d\n\nInadequate evaluation of patients before administering anesthesia\n\nA recovery room worker was observed covering a food tray with a paper towel he retrieved from the garbage\n\nSurgical tools \u201cwere stained with a brown substance.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health could not provide any evidence that it informed patients about the unsanitary and dangerous conditions it uncovered.\n\nThe report, composed with Illinois Department of Health documents obtained through FOIA requests, proposes a host of reforms. Zender says her top priority is mandating annual abortion clinic inspections. Illinois currently requires the Department of Health to inspect women\u2019s health clinics only \u201cas it deems necessary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Illinois Right to Life Committee\u2019s study determined that abortion facilities statewide are inspected on average once every nine years.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Illinois Right to Life Committee\u2019s study determined that abortion facilities statewide are inspected on average once every nine years.", "title": "Illinois Abortion Clinics Inspected an Average of Once Every 9 Years", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150116_AbortionClinic.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-16T00:44:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yq3hJT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Illinois Right to Life Committee\u2019s study determined that abortion facilities statewide are inspected on average once every nine years.", "title": "Illinois Abortion Clinics Inspected an Average of Once Every 9 Years", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150116_AbortionClinic.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-01-16T03:01:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T00:44:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion clinic, illinois, right to life, planned parenthood"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ab2\"", "article_summary": "The Illinois Right to Life Committee\u2019s study determined that abortion clinics statewide are inspected on average once every nine years.\nIllinois currently requires the Department of Health to inspect women\u2019s health clinics only \u201cas it deems necessary.\u201d\nThe five Illinois Planned Parenthood abortion clinics have settled at least six malpractice lawsuits, including two over abortions that left the women dead.\nZender says that the bad publicity prompted the Illinois Department of Health then inspected all 14 licensed facilities.\nBut \u201c54 percent of Illinois women\u2019s clinics are unlicensed and have not received a health and sanitary inspection in 14 years.\u201d54 percent of Illinois women\u2019s clinics are unlicensed and have not received a health and sanitary inspection in 14 years."}
