Transcript for Second Meningitis Outbreak Reported in West

Now, to the health scare spanning both coasts on college campuses. Health officials are urging the university of california at santa barbara, to suspend events after an outbreak of meningitis, just weeks after a similar outbreak at princeton in new jersey. Dr. Richard besser has the story. Reporter: This morning, health officials are working to contain an outbreak on the campus of u.C. Santa barbara. One student with a case so bad, he needed his legs amputated. I hope he's doing well. It's kind of scary because there's that constant fear. Reporter: Students being told to stay away from parties and social events, to keep the outbreaks from spreading. Rule of thumb, don't share bottles. Avoid kissing new girls. Just be safe. Reporter: This, after eight students at princeton were diagnosed with the same type of meningitis earlier this year. Are you worried about the meningitis that's going around? Yeah. Just like getting calls from your parents and relatives, asking about what's going on. A little bit scary. Reporter: Those infected may feel like they have the flu. Fever, headache, body pains. Then, comes the symptoms, a stiff neck. Without antibiotic treatment, 10% may die. Up to 20% who survive, are damaged. They're about to give princeton students a european vaccine that's not approved in the u.S. As for ucsb, they've handed out antibiotics to about 500 close contacts of the 4 sick undergrads. And they'll give out more today. Cdc says they don't have the same microscopic fingerprint. So, they're not connected. But the cdc just told me this morning they're prepared to make the european vaccine available if the situation changes and warrants it. That should help. Rich, thanks very much.
