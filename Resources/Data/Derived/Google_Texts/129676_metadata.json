In trade negotiations, even one\u2019s own country is troublesome, as the catfish conundrum illustrates. And the degree of difficulty in achieving a free-trade pact is proportional to the number of Democrats in Congress.\n\nAs U.S. trade representative, Froman\u2019s goal is completion and ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving the United States and 11 Asia-Pacific nations, from Chile to South Korea, that generate 37 percent of the world\u2019s economic product. The TPP aims not just to liberalize trade but also to reform some of these nations\u2019 domestic policies, particularly concerning labor and environmental issues, partly to entice certain Democratic constituencies to soften their opposition to free trade.\n\nSome developing nations, such as Vietnam, welcome some compulsory rationality \u2014 being required by trading rules to limit subsidies to sclerotic state-owned enterprises. But beware of ostensibly altruistic protectionism \u2014 protectionism with moral pretensions. Sometimes poorer nations want higher standards forced on them. Other times rich nations use higher standards to raise production costs in, and thereby lower the competitiveness of, poorer countries.\n\nNegotiation and ratification of the TPP will be easier if Congress gives Obama what prior presidents have received \u2014 \u201cfast-track\u201d authority guaranteeing an up-or-down vote on the agreement without amendments. But Obama\u2019s aggressive aggrandizement of executive power through unilateral actions (regarding the Affordable Care Act, immigration, etc.) has been unprecedented in its sweep and undisguised in its disdain for Congress. This has produced the much-praised but elusive joy of bipartisanship: Conservative Republicans, eager to express separation-of-powers rectitude, are joining liberal Democrats, eager to derail any agreement, in opposing fast track.\n\nImmersed in this political equivalent of three-dimensional chess, the administration is serenely confident that enough Democratic votes will join with large majorities of Republicans to ratify what is negotiated, even without fast track. Even if Republicans representing Southern catfish farmers must be mollified by restricting imports of Asian catfish that are processed in American plants in blue states.\n\nThe two largest achievements during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency occurred in spite of Democrats. Welfare reform was forced upon him by a Republican-controlled Congress (he vetoed it twice before relenting), and the North American Free Trade Agreement was ratified in spite of congressional Democrats (a majority of whom voted against it). Now, the TPP \u2014 potentially the best result of the Obama years \u2014 depends on Republicans.\n\nDemocrats are plucking up the protectionist banner unfurled by 19th-century Republicans, who were tireless defenders of the strong (manufacturers) against consumers. Today, many Democrats agree with Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who says that the United States \u201chas lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.\u201d Notice the slippery language (\u201csince NAFTA\u201d), and remember the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy: The rooster crows and then the sun rises, therefore the crowing caused the sunrise. Manufacturing jobs have been declining as a share of total employment since 1950 and in actual number since 1979. But because of productivity improvements, manufacturing production and exports are near all-time highs.\n\nGranted, Froman says, some imports substitute for domestic products. But many imports are \u201cintermediate goods\u201d that go into the production of domestic goods, some of which are exported. And, he says, 50 percent of imports from Canada and Mexico, our first- and third-largest trading partners, are used as inputs in the manufacturing of American products. Furthermore, Froman says, free trade is progressive in the sense that lower-income Americans spend a larger portion of their disposable income than more affluent Americans spend on such imports such as food and clothing.\n\nYou who are reading this column probably have a chronic, indeed incurable trade deficit with your barber or hair dresser. You regularly buy what he or she sells, yet he or she never buys anything from you. But things somehow work out. As they do between nations, because as the late Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, once wrote, \u201cInternational transactions are always in balance, by definition.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtectionism,\u201d said Clinton during the NAFTA debate, \u201cis just a fancy word for giving up; we want to compete and win.\u201d But now, even more than then, Democrats are the party of a United States in a defensive crouch, flinching from globalization\u2019s challenges. Besides, progressivism\u2019s constant agenda is to expand the role of government and contract the role of markets in allocating wealth and opportunity. Republicans rescuing Obama\u2019s best idea would be an interesting coda to his presidency.\n\nRead more from George F.
