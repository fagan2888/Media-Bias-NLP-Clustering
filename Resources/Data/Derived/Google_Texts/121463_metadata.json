But as often happens with great writing, the expressed sensibilities about one time in history also apply to others like, say, 21st century Washington.\n\nFor the seventh time President Obama staged a lavish state dinner Tuesday night, this one to celebrate President Francois Hollande and the United States\u2019 historic friendship with France. America\u2019s linguistic, cultural and political affinity for Great Britain usually take center-stage.\n\nTruth is, there might not be a United States as we recognize it without our even older friendship with France. Albeit with less than altruistic motives, France sided with the North American colonies against Britain in time to eke out a rebel victory in 1781.\n\nWith the French fleet blocking British escape by sea, the colonials and French troops bombarded Yorktown, Virginia for three weeks, forcing a royal surrender that effectively won the American Revolution.\n\nTuesday\u2019s state dinner was the usual self-indulgent Washington lavishness oblivious to the unemployed, food-stamped lives of millions of back-country Americans. The 350 strutting attendees playing dress-up were a combination of Obama cronies, B-level Hollywood types, media, campaign bundlers and assorted beltway politicos who can consider themselves D.C. royalty until Jan. 20, 2017.\n\nThey were over-fed and entertained in what passes for the Palace of Versailles in Washington, a heated tent on the White House lawn decorated like a Monet spring painting.\n\nStill, it felt good to celebrate an enduring national friendship, given that Obama\u2019s ignorance and naivete have iced relations with other friends, for now.\n\nBarack \u201cCinco de Quatro\u201d Obama opened the evening, as American presidents since Jefferson must, trying to make light of his linguistic ignorance. \u201cBonsoir!\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, have a seat. I have now officially exhausted my French.\u201d\n\nThe French president, as many foreign leaders can, spoke half his remarks in English and half in French. Bien fait!\n\nHollande, who earlier awarded France\u2019s Legion of Merit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers, expressed profound appreciation for American military assistance in World Wars I and II and, most recently, delivering French combat troops to prevent an al Qaeda coup in Mali.\n\n\u201cI promise we shall never forget them,\u201d said Hollande, who came to Washington wife-less this time, owing to some recent mistress messiness in French media.\n\nIn a sly rhetorical nod to bilateral discord over the centuries, Hollande added: \u201cWe love Americans, although we don\u2019t always say so. And you love the French, but you\u2019re sometimes too shy to say so.\u201d\n\nHe may also either have made news or been rather optimistic when he spoke about sanctions and talks with Iran in the past tense: \u201cTogether, we have removed the unacceptable threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nThe revealing details from the state visit may have come Monday as les deux presidents toured the unique Monticello home of Jefferson, an early U.S. ambassador to Paris. It\u2019s become a regular occurrence with Obama that his overheard asides reveal more about his attitudes and character than his increasingly lengthy and repetitive public statements.\n\nRemember when Obama was caught complaining to another French president about having to deal with Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu so often? (He\u2019s coming again March 3.) Or Obama\u2019s obsequious 2012 plea to a Russian leader for understanding until after his reelection when he could be more flexible on missile talks?\n\nAs Obama and Hollande exited Jefferson\u2019s Virginia home, the Chicagoan decided to depart from the schedule and walk the grounds. Obama was overheard saying to his hostess, \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about being president, I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\nThe regal comment is likely to resonate \u2014 much like \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d \u2014 because it fits the developing public perception of Obama as an imperious ruler. As he spoke in Virginia, the Democrat\u2019s administration announced in Washington a 27th unilateral change to the ObamaCare law \u2014 extending a business compliance deadline for another year beyond what Congress stipulated.\n\nObama attempts to portray it as a minor administrative adjustment to accommodate businesses, not as what it really is, a political postponement of the law\u2019s social and financial pain to save more Democrat derrieres in this year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe Obama banquet might have pleased old French royalty before losing their heads in la Revolution. But it would hardly fit into Michelle Obama\u2019s healthy menu for ordinary Americans. One estimate put the taxpayer-financed fare at 2,500 calories per person with 152 grams of fat.\n\nGuests were served caviar, quail eggs and 12 varieties of potatoes. Colorado rib-eye beef. A salad harvested from the White House garden by peasants. And Hawaiian chocolate-malted ganache, maple syrup fudge and cotton-candy balls.\n\nNot a single serving of American fries in sight.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhat Rand Paul needs to stop doing\n\nTime for a real executive as our chief executive\n\nNot a smidgen of credibility in Obama\u2019s IRS claim", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.\" In \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" Charles Dickens", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.\u201d In \u201cA Tale of Two Cities,\u201d Charles Dickens quilled those line\u2026", "title": "Obama\u2019s state dinner for France: Let them eat beef, caviar, fudge and cotton candy", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/andrew-malcolm/french-president-francois-hollande-obama-state-dinner/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-02-12 07:08:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-12T07:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5db0\"", "article_summary": "I have now officially exhausted my French.\u201dThe French president, as many foreign leaders can, spoke half his remarks in English and half in French.\nFor the seventh time President Obama staged a lavish state dinner Tuesday night, this one to celebrate President Francois Hollande and the United States\u2019 historic friendship with France.\nRemember when Obama was caught complaining to another French president about having to deal with Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu so often?\nTuesday\u2019s state dinner was the usual self-indulgent Washington lavishness oblivious to the unemployed, food-stamped lives of millions of back-country Americans.\nTruth is, there might not be a United States as we recognize it without our even older friendship with France."}
