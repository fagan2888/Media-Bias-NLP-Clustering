(Farida Jhabvala Romero/KQED)\n\nThis story originally appeared on KQED.org\n\nFacing a budget in the red and a loss of patients, UC San Francisco officials plan to close a beloved family planning clinic for low-income teens and young adults in the city\u2019s Mission district.\n\nThe New Generation Health Center, which has provided free reproductive health care for two decades to patients as young as 13, is scheduled to close its doors for good on July 31.\n\nHealth providers say the decision could imperil at-risk Latino and African American youth who already like and trust New Generation\u2019s confidential and prompt services. Concerned residents and others say they want to find funds, or pressure UCSF, to keep the clinic open.\n\nOver the last five years, the clinic\u2019s finances have been decimated by decreases in grant revenue and a potentially irreversible loss in patients, says Dr. Rebecca Jackson, a UCSF professor of obstetrics and gynecology and supervisor at New Generation.\n\n\u201cThis was an awful, awful, heart-wrenching decision to have to make,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cNew Gen is a very special place. They really take their mission seriously, which is empowering young people to make decisions in a world and in an age where it\u2019s hard to have a choice.\u201d\n\nJackson and her staff have been working for weeks to transition New Generation\u2019s 2,200 patients to nearby clinics with similar services, such as Mission Neighborhood Health Center and 3rd Street Youth Center & Clinic.\n\nResidents Vow to Fight for Clinic\n\nThe news of the closure did not sit well with several Mission residents, students, health providers and youth advocates at a forum with UCSF officials last week.\n\nA funeral-like mood pervaded a packed auditorium to discuss the clinic\u2019s closure. Jackson and Dr. Sue Carlisle, a UCSF Medical School vice dean, spoke about the financial reasons for the closure and efforts to ensure all patients are matched with \u201cbest fit\u201d clinics in the area.\n\nStill, speaker after speaker called on a new effort to save New Generation, not shutter it.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do as a community is not take this and stand together and fight back. We need to hold UCSF accountable,\u201d said Ronnishia Johnson, who grew up in the nearby Bayview neighborhood. \u201cFrom my perspective this is nothing but them turning their backs on the community.\u201d\n\nNataly Ortiz, who become a mom as a teen, says it\u2019s hard for local Latina and undocumented teens to get same or next-day appointments for reproductive health in clinics other than New Generation.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s a very emotional case of being scared of being pregnant at a very young age,\u201d said Ortiz, who refers patients to New Generation through her work at a neighborhood nonprofit.\n\n\u201cThey need a clinic like this. So for you to take it away, it\u2019s just saying our community doesn\u2019t matter, the people that benefit from this clinic don\u2019t matter. But I\u2019m here to tell you, we do matter!\u201d Ortiz said to UCSF officials.\n\nAffordable Care Act \u2018Hurting\u2019 Family Planning Clinics\n\nIronically, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is partly to blame for New Generation\u2019s troubles, says Jackson.\n\nUnder the ACA, more people have become eligible for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health insurance program for people who are low-income. Many New Generation clients are choosing to get their reproductive services addressed with their new doctor or medical clinic that handles all their health needs. Other family planning and specialty clinics are also feeling this squeeze.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, it\u2019s more convenient to get that [reproductive] care at the same time they are getting the rest of their health care,\u201d Jackson says.\n\nStill, she added, \u201ca small subset\u201d of patients want to keep reproductive health care separate.\n\nOne of those patients is Rocio Navarro, a student at Abraham Lincoln High School.\n\nRead the full story on KQED", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health care, UCSF", "og": {"site_name": "MissionLocal", "description": "This story originally appeared on KQED.org Facing a budget in the red and a loss of patients, UC San Francisco officials plan to close a beloved family planning clinic for low-income teens and young adults in the city\u2019s Mission district.
