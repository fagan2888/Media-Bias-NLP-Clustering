Panic quickly set in because her son was in a car seat sleeping. Tyson\u2019s uncle was in the house when his mom burst through the door. \u201cShe called 911 and I jumped in my truck and tried to track down where I thought he might have gone,\u201d said Tyler Nelson.\n\nDeputies found the truck running about 3 and a half miles down Thomas Road in a yard. The suspect ran due South into a nursery where he tried to get a ride. They ordered him to leave because he was acting sketchy. He then ran across the street to a restaurant\\bar but nobody would help him there either. He went upstairs to a marijuana dispensary and private smoking club and was able to convince someone to give him a ride out of the area.\n\nHe was caught on surveillance video and detectives are hoping someone can identify him.\n\nIf you know his name, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-tips. All calls are anonymous and there is a cash reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to an arrest.\n\nLittle Tyson was found snoozing in the back of the truck unharmed. \u201cHe`s actually still sleeping when I got there and they let him sleep for a few minutes then brought him over to me and I took him back to the house,\u201d said Tyler.", "article_metadata": {"description": "COVINGTON -- King County detectives have released new surveillance photos of a man who stole a truck near Covington with a sleeping 2-year-old boy sitting in the back in hopes someone recognizes him.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "b6228bea1d7671a78a13a75050035f3a"}, "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "COVINGTON \u2014 King County detectives have released new surveillance photos of a man who stole a truck near Covington with a sleeping 2-year-old boy sitting in the back in hopes someone recogniz\u2026", "title": "Investigators release new photos of man who stole truck with toddler sleeping inside", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2015/01/18/investigators-release-new-photos-of-man-who-stole-truck-with-toddler-sleeping-inside/", "image": {"width": 288, "identifier": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/kidnapping-suspect-2.jpg", "height": 328}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/kidnapping-suspect.jpg?w=240", "site": "@q13fox", "card": "summary", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
