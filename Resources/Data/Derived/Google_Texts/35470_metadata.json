The Sharks finished the game with 12 three-pointers.\n\nEastern Florida came out strong to start the second half and led 54-40 with 14 minutes and 53 seconds to play.\n\nBut 1: 48 later it was 54-46. Miami Dade got to within seven at 56-49 with 10:54 to play but Eastern Florida prevailed down the stretch, finishing with a 32-20 run.\n\nMiami Dade had defeated Broward College 101-78 on Wednesday and beat Eastern Florida 65-62 in Kendall on Jan. 17.\n\nBut Saturday belonged to the Titans behind 18 points from sophomore Payton Hulsey, 16 from classmate Kyle Meyer and freshman Djordje Beronja and 10 from freshman Daishon Smith.\n\n\u201cCoach just told me to be aggressive on the boards and be aggressive on offense,\u201d Hulsey said. \u201cWe had real extra incentive. They got us at their house so we wanted to get a little bit of revenge at home. This was a must-have and we had to go get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came out with a lot of energy and competed on the defensive end. It\u2019s a non-stop fight. Coach pushes us hard in practice and we transfer that in practice to the game.\u201d\n\nThe five conference teams play each other three times each to determine the top two finishers who advance to the FCSAA/NJCAA Region 8 tournament in Ocala in March.\n\nEastern Florida is the two-time defending champion but finds itself in a dogfight down the stretch having to win the remainder of its five games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of our guys tonight,\u201d said Eastern Florida head coach Jeremy Shulman whose team won its 45th straight game at home. \u201cI thought it was toughness throughout. We didn\u2019t necessarily play great at times. We didn\u2019t make shots. They were on fire offensively.\u201d We withstood every rally they had. We made the tough plays,\u201d said Shulman.\n\nAs for Hulsey\u2019s efforts: \u201cWe need our best players to step up and when our best players step up we\u2019re really good,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to have. Payton was just phenomenal tonight.\n\n\u201cThat was a big thing on our game plan was trying to hurt them inside on the boards because they\u2019ve got all the shooters. We tried having the muscle.\u201d\n\nNext up for the Titans is a 7 p.m. Wednesday game at Broward in Davie. Broward went into Saturday\u2019s game against Indian River at 5-2 in conference.\n\nEastern Florida\u2019s next home game is 7 p.m. Feb. 11 against Palm Beach State. The game will be televised live on WEFS-TV and streamed live at www.njcaatv.com/efsc\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "basketball,efsc,homepage,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/EFSC-Basketball-580-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Eastern Florida\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team roared out to a 22-point first half lead and never trailed in defeating Miami Dade College 86-69 on Saturday in the", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc002\"", "article_summary": "The victory moved Eastern Florida to 22-3 overall and 5-2 in the Florida College System Activities Association Southern Conference tying Miami Dade for first place.\nMiami Dade had defeated Broward College 101-78 on Wednesday and beat Eastern Florida 65-62 in Kendall on Jan. 17.\nMiami Dade got to within seven at 56-49 with 10:54 to play but Eastern Florida prevailed down the stretch, finishing with a 32-20 run.\nMiami Dade fell to 17-8 and 5-2.\nEastern Florida is the two-time defending champion but finds itself in a dogfight down the stretch having to win the remainder of its five games."}
