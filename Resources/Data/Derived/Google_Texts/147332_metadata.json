The cost to Medicare was an estimated $2.8 billion in 2011, investigators said. In 6 percent of the cases, poor care contributed to residents\u2019 deaths.\n\nThe findings were based on the review of medical records of a random sample of 653 residents whose nursing home stay of 35 days or less ended in August 2011.\n\nThe study comes as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for oversight, is developing new rules required by the Affordable Care Act to improve nursing home care by establishing \u201cquality assurance and performance improvement programs.\u201d As part of this effort, the CMS created a Web site last summer containing resources and training materials that have been used in 5,000 facilities to reduce residents\u2019 pressure ulcers and medication errors, a Medicare spokeswoman said.\n\nOnce those rules are issued, probably later this year, the agency will direct inspectors \u201cto review facility practices for identifying and reducing adverse events,\u201d CMS chief Marilyn Tavenner wrote in a response included in the IG report. The CMS contracts with states to inspect nursing homes, usually with at least one registered nurse on the inspection team.\n\nAfter reviewing a September draft of the IG report, Medicare officials became interested in using the IG\u2019s investigative techniques, methods not normally used in measuring nursing home quality, Dorrill said.\n\nFor example, the IG and the CMS are working to condense the report\u2019s list of 261 instances of actual harm so that nursing home operators and government inspectors can quickly spot health problems in a medical record that resulted from poor treatment, she added. The initial list of 261 instances was compiled by a team of physicians, geriatricians and nurse consultants who scoured the selected records to make these determinations on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAnother strategy that the CMS plans to use, Dorrill said, is the \u201ctrigger tool\u201d IG experts developed to identify potential harm. This tool is a list of 49 medical problems that are warning signs, such as when a resident has to go to the hospital or if a resident\u2019s blood glucose level drops dangerously low.\n\nThese strategies may help nursing home inspectors detect problems that do not emerge during typical inspections that focus on \u201cwhat\u2019s happening to residents today,\u201d said Jane Straker, a research scholar at the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University in Ohio.\n\nRoutine inspections \u2014 as opposed to inspections prompted by complaints \u2014 often take three days and occur every 9 to 15 months, said Robyn Grant, policy director for the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based national advocacy group. Inspectors look at the medical records of as many as 30 residents, depending on the size of the facility, and also check a range of other services, from housekeeping and food preparation to required social activities and protection of residents\u2019 rights. They also assign a severity level to any violation of Medicare rules that determines whether the facility will be fined, and if so, how much.\n\nAnd their arrival may not come as a surprise, Grant said. The predictable schedule of inspections may give nursing homes a rough idea of when to expect the next one. She said residents and their families have reported improvements in staffing and other preparations before an inspection.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
