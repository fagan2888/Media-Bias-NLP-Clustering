LOS ANGELES, Calif., Sept. 3, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - http://www.eFileMyForms.com is first-to-market with a complete online ACA reporting solution for tax forms 1095-B, 1095-C and their accompanying electronic transmittals, the 1094-B & 1094-C.

eFileMyForms has been an industry leading provider for information return reporting services of 1099, W-2, & 1042-S tax forms for nearly 15 years. In that time, eFileMyForms has grown to file over 10% of the information returns filed in the US, each year. With the addition of online 1094 & 1095 filing of ACA forms, eFileMyForms is on course to become one of the most dominant players in US information reporting. Customers can access the website immediately and have the option to choose between the full print/mail/eFile service for as low as $1.46/record or the eFile only service for as low as $.10/record!

For those who aren't familiar, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also referred to as ObamaCare, requires the mailing of "Health Coverage" or "Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage" 1095 statements to employees by February 1st, 2015 - with the electronic filing of these forms due to the IRS by the end of March. eFileMyForms appears to be the first comprehensive solution for printing & mailing the 1095 recipient copies and for online 1094 filing & online 1095 filing of ACA forms.

So what does the solution entail? According to Michael Stewart, Director of State Compliance at eFileMyForms, there are three key pieces to the solution.

IMPORTING & DATA ENTRY

eFileMyForms allows customers to import data from Excel files that can match preset import maps or be customized to the client's source system output file. The ability to key in data is available for one-off records that may have been overlooked in the import file creation process. Filer data, which is the filing entity's EIN related data, can also be keyed in or imported along with the record data in Excel.

PRINTING, MAILING, & ELECTRONIC FILING

eFileMyForms can accept print and mail submissions all the way up until midnight of the night before the Federal print and mail deadline of February 1, 2015. The print and mail service covers all expenses, including first class US postage, paper, and envelopes. Electronic filing of the XML submissions, via the AIR System, are accepted up until midnight of the night before the Federal eFile deadline of March 31, 2015.

The 1094-B and 1094-C electronic transmittals are available to be completed on the website before the submission of each order. Once an order is actually placed, PDF copies are made available for download at any time.

PROCESSING CORRECTIONS

Customers are bound to make mistakes on their ACA filings during the first year of reporting. Luckily, eFileMyForms' customers are able to visualize and correct IRS related errors, if found.

"In the end of the day, customers care about security when they choose an online solutions provider" says Michael Stewart. Upon further research, it would seem as if eFileMyForms has taken this commitment seriously. eFileMyForms is an authorized eFiler of information returns, supports the ACA XML format using the IRS A2A system, is Publication 5165 tested, encrypts every transaction, is SSAE 16 SOC I Type II audited & certified, and is HIPPA compliant.
