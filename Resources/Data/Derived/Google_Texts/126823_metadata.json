This will break the record of 61 closed rules set during Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 2007-2008 Congress \u2014 and John Boehner\u2019s House still has seven months in which to run up the score.\n\nTo put this in perspective, in 1975-1976, only three rules were designated as closed. Republicans complained when they took control of Congress in 1995 that the number of \u201copen rules\u201d \u2014 the sort of freewheeling debate that characterized the House for most of its history \u2014 had fallen to 30 percent of all debates in 1993-1994, from 85 percent in 1975-1976. And now? Open debates are 6 percent of the House total.\n\nThe increasingly undemocratic way in which the House is governed is both a symptom and a cause of the fierce partisanship that has seized the country, and the condition has worsened under both parties\u2019 rule. The frequent promise to \u201clet the House work its will\u201d is almost never honored \u2014 and not just on high-profile issues such as immigration reform, unemployment insurance and the minimum wage.\n\nBut although the blame is bipartisan, Republicans carry an additional burden of hypocrisy. After the bitter Obamacare debate, they justifiably complained that Democrats did not have a single open rule in 2009-2010, and they pledged changes.\n\n1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP.

There were no open rules in the House in the last Congress. In this one there will be many. . . . You will always have the right to a robust debate in an open process that allows you to represent your constituents, to make your case, offer alternatives and be heard.\u201d\n\nBut the closed rules continued their long-term growth. According to figures provided to me, which both Republican and Democratic officials on the Rules Committee say are accurate, there were nine closed rules in the 1991-1992 Congress, five in 1993-1994, 25 in 1995-1996, 23 in 1997-1998, 51 in 1999-2000, 29 in 2001-2002, 44 in 2003-2004, 56 in 2005-2006, 61 in 2007-2008, 37 in 2009-2010, and 53 in 2011-2012 before what probably will be 62 so far for 2013-2014.\n\nSome of the change can be attributed to the C-SPAN effect: With the TV cameras rolling, lawmakers are more inclined to play gotcha on the House floor, to force opponents to take embarrassing votes. In this situation, amendments are often meant to gum up the works rather than to offer good-faith improvements to legislation. Now there\u2019s also the Ted Cruz effect: The 2013-2014 tally is so high in part because of last year\u2019s government shutdown, when Republicans, following the Texas Republican senator\u2019s ill-advised plan of offering to reopen the government one piece at a time, approved 21 closed rules, including 11 in a single day.\n\nA spokesman for Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) noted Monday that there have been 22 open rules in the past four years, after none in the previous Congress, and he said GOP leaders have been using more \u201cstructured\u201d rules that allow for some Democratic amendments without making the floor debate unwieldy. But he agreed that, under both parties, \u201cthe majority\u2019s natural inclination is to try to exert more control over the process rather than less.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understandable inclination \u2014 as is the tendency to push through legislation under \u201cemergency\u201d rules rather than the more laborious process of following normal procedures. Roughly four in 10 measures were taken up under \u201cemergency\u201d rules last year, which, Democratic lawmakers say, doesn\u2019t give adequate time to read them.\n\nThe Republicans are free to do all this, and it\u2019s sometimes justified. But it\u2019s striking how quickly they dropped their vows of transparency and instead embraced and expanded the use of the Washington shenanigans they deplored.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans silence the House of Representatives.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans silence the House of Representatives.", "title": "Dana Milbank: Republicans\u2019 gagging hypocrisy", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-republicans-gagging-hypocrisy/2014/06/09/c279db60-f016-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/09/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Captured_Soldier_Boehner-013dd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-republicans-gagging-hypocrisy/2014/06/09/c279db60-f016-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, closed rule, house of representatives, closed debate, house rules committee, pete sessions, john boehner", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c279db60-f016-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, closed rule, house of representatives, closed debate, house rules committee, pete sessions, john boehner"}, "article_summary": "But although the blame is bipartisan, Republicans carry an additional burden of hypocrisy.\nThere were no open rules in the House in the last Congress.\nTwitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP.\nin a manner that restores and respects the time-honored right of the minority to an honest debate, a fair and open process,\u201d Boehner said upon assuming the speakership."}
