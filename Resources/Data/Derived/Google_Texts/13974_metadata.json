Happiness seemed to protect other patients from mortality risk; those who weren\u2019t depressed had an 80 percent lower mortality risk.\n\nIn the study, called OPERA-HF, researchers examined heart failure patients over 302 days; 103 patients weren\u2019t depressed, 27 had mild depression, and 24 had moderate to severe depression. Depression was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, which rates depression on a 0-21 scale. Over the course of 302 days, 27 of the patients died. It turned out that those with moderate to severe depression were five times more likely to die than patients with little to no depression.\n\n\u201cOur results show that depression is strongly associated with death during the year following discharge from hospital after an admission for the exacerbation of heart failure; we expect that the link persists beyond one year,\u201d Professor John Cleland, lead author of the study and professor of cardiology at Imperial College London and the University of Hull in the UK, said in the press release. \u201cThe association was independent of the severity of heart failure or the presence of comorbidities.\u201d\n\nThe researchers aimed to study heart failure in a more holistic fashion, which offered them clearer insights into mortality. \u201cThis included social, mental, and physical frailty, as well as comorbidities and the severity of heart failure,\u201d Cleland said in the press release. \u201cDepression has been reported to predict death in patients with heart failure, but until now it was thought that this could be because depressed patients have more severe heart failure and more comorbidities.\u201d\n\nDepression, the researchers note, is common in heart failure patients \u2014 up to 20 to 40 percent of them are affected by it. Depression is associated with sleep problems, a change in appetite, and either weight gain or weight loss; as well as lack of motivation to take care of yourself. This is possibly one of the reasons why there was an increased risk of mortality among heart failure patients who were depressed.\n\nUltimately, taking a holistic approach in treating heart failure patients (and hospital patients in general) might be the best way to alleviate symptoms and reduce mortality. More research is needed, however, for the researchers to move forward with appropriate treatment plans.\n\n\u201cOur research clearly shows a strong association between depression and risk of death in the year after discharge from hospital,\u201d Cleland said in the press release. \u201cRecognition and management of depression may reduce mortality for patients with heart failure.\u201d\n\nSource: Cleland J. et al.
