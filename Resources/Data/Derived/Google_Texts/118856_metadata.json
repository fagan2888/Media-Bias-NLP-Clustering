Then, silence.\n\nOh, but what a silence: \u201cI loved his answer, he just said, \u201cit sank,\u201d but that wonderful pause he took\u2026\u201d said King later. \u201cI find him engaging, I liked him right away.\u201d\n\nSo much did King like Putin, and perhaps vice-versa, that you can see them together again in an experiment that has made a lot of noise: bringing the octogenarian former CNN star interviewer of 25 years to RT, the English-speaking, anti-US news outlet created in 2005 as Russia TV, and funded with a generous budget from the Kremlin, rebranded RT in 2009.\n\nToday RT reaches more than 100 countries through 30 satellites and 500 cable companies, plus its website. It has and audience of 630 million people but its main target is the 90 million US viewers that watch it in their ordinary news cable package. It is not that Al-Jazeera, China Central Television and Press TV (Iran) do not air as well. But RT is the second foreign news channel preferred in the US, following BBC, while YouTube ranks it among the top 10 in its News and Politics channel.\n\nIt is strange to watch the good old suspenders in RT, the same channel where the most hilarious Wall Street-abhorring financial journalist, a former stockbroker himself, Max Keiser, repeats the mantras \u201cfinancial terrorism,\u201d \u201cbanking crime wave\u201d and \u201crigged stock markets.\u201d Or where Peter Lavelle, an US national living in Easter Europe and Russia for over 25 years, host of the flagship show CrossTalk, condemned the US \u201cculture of impunity\u201d for the powerful, or more recently asked \u201cHow can we expect democratic institutions to survive when there\u2019s global inequality?\u201d\n\nBut there is King, back in an uncharacteristic channel for the US audience with his characteristic attire. He seems to enjoy it to the point of criticizing his former home for its low ratings: \u201cPut SpongeBob on CNN \u2014 24 hours \u2014 until a big story breaks. Then we break into SpongeBob, and go to the hurricane, and then back to Spongebob.\u201d More interesting is the fact that his two shows, Larry King Now (barely different from Larry King Live, his CNN success) and the new PoliticKing, are produced by the interviewer\u2019s own company, OraTV, which is financed by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.\n\nRT\u2019s motto, \u201cQuestion More,\u201d could not be more foreign to the iconic interviewer smooth and non-confrontational style. Nevertheless, he has managed to keep his easygoing attitude to question little and allow people to express themselves.\n\nKing\u2019s unforeseen return ignited critical comments. The New York Times made its own and pointed towards others: \u201cGiven that the Kremlin-owned network devotes considerable airtime to critics of the American government, and finds fault with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule about as often as Fox News produces expos\u00e9s on the Republican Party, the hiring (of King) prompted a stream of mockery from Russian skeptics and the foreign press corps in Moscow.\u201d Mark Adomanis wrote in Forbes: \u201cOutside of nursing homes, it\u2019s hard to see who\u2019s going to be particularly excited by this latest development.\u201d Max Read satirized in Gawker: \u201cPrehistoric fertility god and former CNN host Larry King is bringing his current show, Tales from the Cryptkeeper, to Russia Today, and adding another show, to the Kremlin-funded cable news.\u201d Foreing Policy asked \u201cHey, Larry King: Have You Ever Watched Russia Today?\u201d\n\nOn December 16, 2010, the final edition of Larry King Live on CNN, predicted: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say except to you, my audience, Thank You! And instead of goodbye, how about so long?\u201d Soon he was back with Larry King Now, firstly distributed through Hulu, and through KremlinTV \u2014 as detractors dub the Russian channel. The show hardly differs from the famous one that helped him get the mark of 50,000 interviews in a career that began in Miami in 1957. But PoliticKing seems to make a difference by mixing hot issues with a weird lot of guests, from former vice-president Dick Cheney to ex wrestler and governor Jesse Ventura, almost anonymous GOP members according to Barack Obama\u2019s advocates.\n\nThe first programme (June 13, 2013) was about security vs. privacy: Representative Aaron Schock (Republican from Illionis), Democratic political strategist Peter Fenn and Politico\u2019s deputy managing editor Rachel Smolkin offered their foreseeable views. For Schock, they were talking about treason; for Fenn, \u201cyoung people do not have many expectations about privacy anymore\u201d; Smolkin held on to information.\n\nIn November he interviewed Cheney, who spoke in disturbing detail about heart failure and treatment and transplant \u2014 \u201c20 units of blood, nine hours of surgery, 35 weeks of rehabilitation, a pump I used that bought me 20 months\u201d \u2014 and of the book, Heart, that he co-authored with his cardiologist, but would not pronounce on his own the name of\u2026\n\n\u201cThe revelations are terrible,\u201d said Cheney, \u201cthere are reasons why we have classified programmes; and I think that this notion that\u2026 what\u2019s his name\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSnowden,\u201d said King.\n\n\u201cYes, Snowden. I think he is a traitor.\u201d\n\nAt the historic Hay-Adams Hotel, overlooking the White House, with \u201ca friend,\u201d King looked amused. \u201cDick Cheney and I share some bonds,\u201d he said, and described his own coronary ordeal. There were many pal-moments. Cheney explained why in 2004 the Republican Party caught 44 percent of Latino vote. \u201cGeorge Bush was not only pro-immigration: as a border-state governor he also had a great respect for the Mexican community, they liked him, he spoke the language, bad, as good as he spoke\u2026 English,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c80 percent,\u201d estimated King, laughing.\n\n\u201c80 percent,\u201d confirmed the guest.\n\nAnd then they got back to issues like Obamacare and treason.\n\nThis January King interviewed Snowden\u2019s legal adviser Ben Wizner, a member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). He said that his client was grateful for the global debate and the local support of those that have requested clemency for him. He explained that Snowden had said \u201cmission accomplished\u201d not in the same spirit than 80 percent-Bush, but meaning that his job, to bring to public debate what was a secret wrongdoing, was done.\n\n\u201cHow will history look at him?,\u201d asked the host.\n\n\u201cHistory is generous to whistleblowers.\u201d\n\nOr traitors \u2014 whatever.\n\nIn December, while discussing the Affordable Care Act with two doctors with very different opinions (a wealthy MD from New York City and a pro-public health activist in Washington, DC), King condemned: \u201cWe are the only industrialized nation in the world without a health plan for its citizens.\u201d This month, in the edition Can America fix its broken immigration system? he asked actor and director Edward James Olmos: \u201cObama has deported over two million undocumented aliens, more than any other administration before. Does that surprise you?\u201d It did not, Olmos said, and denunciated that the main issue was the reason why people crossed the border: \u201cWho is exploiting Latin America, why do they come in first place?\u201d King nodded.\n\nPerhaps nothing has beaten yet his dialogue with Donald Trump in the days of the government shutdown. He introduced the US business icon with the unmistakable pompadour: \u201cLove it or hate it, he can make or break someone\u2019s future with two words: you\u2019re fired!\u201d (thank God for the contraction). \u201cOne of my favourite people of all time, Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump said the shutdown was \u201ca mess,\u201d but added that he certainly understood the Republicans position. \u201cWe are not doing well as a country. We will no longer be the great economic power in 2016, China will replace us.\u201d King argued that Obamacare was a law and the Supreme Court had upheld it. Trump agreed but added: \u201cIt\u2019s turning out to be very negative. I have friends that are hiring only part-time people now, friends closing business because of Obamacare.\u201d Then they moved to possible candidates for 2016. The guest said that \u201cit may be none of the names most discussed now.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould it be Trump?,\u201d King asked.\n\n\u201cSo many people ask me that question. And so many people want me to do it! I was thinking about it\u201d, said the real estate magnate. But he has a passion for business, and for The Apprentice. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in 2014 and then I will make a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a piece of work,\u201d thanked him King.\n\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d Trump replied.\n\n@gesq", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gabriela Esquivada, from the US, Buenos Aires Herald, Herald, Breaking News, Latest News, Buenos Aires, Argentina, English, english-language, daily, newspaper, Latin America, world, analysis, commentarym, economy, markets, entertainment, sports, multimedia, classifieds, shipping", "og": {"url": "http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/151935/", "image": "/files/imagenes//201402/151935_11_232849.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Gabriela Esquivada, from the US (For The Herald in the US) - By Gabriela Esquivada from New York You have seen them both shaking hands with US presidents &mdash; one of them  has a bigger collection, starting with Richard Nixon; the other just met  the latest since Bill Clinton.", "title": "Larry King: now brought to you live by Kremlin television"}, "description": "By Gabriela Esquivada from New York You have seen them both shaking hands with US presidents &mdash; one of them  has a bigger collection, starting with Richard Nixon; the other just met  the latest since Bill Clinton."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce538\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat happened to the Kursk submarine?\u201d Larry King asked Vladimir Putin about the causes of the accident that killed 118 crew members of the nuclear transporter.\nThe guest said that \u201cit may be none of the names most discussed now.\u201d\u201cCould it be Trump?,\u201d King asked.\nAnd instead of goodbye, how about so long?\u201d Soon he was back with Larry King Now, firstly distributed through Hulu, and through KremlinTV \u2014 as detractors dub the Russian channel.\nThen we break into SpongeBob, and go to the hurricane, and then back to Spongebob.\u201d More interesting is the fact that his two shows, Larry King Now (barely different from Larry King Live, his CNN success) and the new PoliticKing, are produced by the interviewer\u2019s own company, OraTV, which is financed by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in 2014 and then I will make a decision.\u201d\u201cYou are a piece of work,\u201d thanked him King."}
