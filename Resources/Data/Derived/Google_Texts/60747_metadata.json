You \u201cdon\u2019t want to start getting a differentiation in how accessible the internet is to various users,\u201d Obama said, speaking at a White House forum for African business leaders. \u201cYou want to leave it open so that the next Google or the next Facebook can succeed.\u201d\n\nNet neutrality advocates seized on the moment, pointing out that Obama\u2019s comments were at odds with the world they fear that the Federal Communications Commission will create with a new set of proposed internet rules. Indeed, the FCC must uphold Obama\u2019s stance, and at least in his public comments, FCC Chairman Wheeler says the agency will. But Obama\u2019s comments were about much more than just U.S. policy.\n\nWhat\u2019s been lost in the debate over his statements to African leaders is a much more important issue: whether the internet\u2019s openness as a worldwide platform is under siege. The President also pointed out that there are countries \u201cthat feel comfortable with the idea of controlling and censoring Internet content in their home countries, and setting up rules and laws about what can or cannot be on the internet,\u201d and he believes this will inhibit the growth of these countries. \u201cClosed societies that are not open to new ideas\u2014eventually, they fall behind,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually, they miss out on the future because they\u2019re so locked into trying to maintain the past.\u201d\n\nTheir revenue is decreasing and they are concerned. Voice Over IP is illegal in many African countries\n\nIn many emerging markets, local telecommunications companies have seen the fees that they charge for completing U.S. long distance calls\u2014known as termination fees\u2014drop dramatically thanks to VOIP services such as Skype. And now a new generation of messaging apps such as WhatsApp are threatening SMS revenues too. That is scaring regional telecommunications companies, so they\u2019re cracking down on new technologies. \u201cTheir revenue is decreasing and they are concerned,\u201d says Dawit Bekele the Africa Regional Director with the Internet Society, the non-profit group that sets the internet\u2019s standards. \u201cVoice Over IP is illegal in many African countries.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the same approach that U.S. telecommunication companies floated more than a decade ago, when they tried to charge extra fees for services such as VOIP, VPNs, even home routers. Consumer outrage here in the U.S. thwarted theses efforts, and they also pushed net neutrality into the public consciousness\u2014so much so that Obama himself used it as a plank in his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that, six years later, President Obama still wants to sound strong on net neutrality here in the U.S. But the larger point to be made is that the U.S. must stand firm in order to show other countries the way, to support the internet as a worldwide network. The internet must continue to be the open platform that we\u2019ve come to know and love\u2014not a walled garden\u2014and it must remain global. \u201cRight now people think that Africa is a very small market and they don\u2019t really matter,\u201d says Bekele, \u201cbut Africa is a rising continent.\u201d The internet, he explains, must be open in places like this or ceases to be as useful across the world. \u201cIf this principle starts to be eroded, it should be of concern to everyone.\u201d\n\nThink about American communications services, for instance. They benefit\u2014and ultimately users benefit\u2014if they spread across the globe, and if the principle of openness is squashed in certain countries, they can\u2019t spread.\n\nOne of the surest ways the U.S. could help erode this principle is by letting the FCC blow it with its new regulations\u2014due out later this year\u2014and making it too hard for startups to compete with big companies. Over the past year, revelations about widespread NSA surveillance have made it harder for the U.S. to be a completely credible advocate for an free internet, but the rest of the world is still paying attention, says Nuala O\u2019Connor the president of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \u201cWhatever balance we strike in the States will be looked at closely everywhere else in the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's been lost in the debate over his statements to African leaders is a much more important issue: whether the internet's openness as a worldwide platform is under siege.", "application-name": "WIRED: WIRED", "Author": "Robert McMillan", "og": {"site_name": "WIRED", "description": "What's been lost in the debate over his statements to African leaders is a much more important issue: whether the internet's openness as a worldwide platform is under siege.", "title": "Why President Obama Cares About Net Neutrality in Africa", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/obama-africa-feat.jpg", "height": 330}, "url": "http://www.wired.com/2014/08/obama-net-neutrality/", "type": "article"}, "Section": "Blog", "msapplication-TileColor": "#cb0004", "msapplication-tooltip": "Read in-depth coverage of current and future trends in technology, and how they are shaping business, entertainment, communications, science, politics, and culture at Wired.com.", "news_keywords": "Africa, Barack Obama, FCC, Internet, Net Neutrality", "gmapkey": "ABQIAAAAF5yd_X_vTzike6sB6lp3wBQ4h890iMeKvsDZGQOc75SG0lWKAhQW755bw9E_-3ijKe6eqE5sg_NLEw", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373903654", "fb": {"page_id": 19440638720}, "Subsection": "WIRED", "article": {"section": "Enterprise", "tag": "Net Neutrality"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DisplayDate": "2014-08-08", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Why President Obama Cares About Net Neutrality in Africa\", \"link\": \"http://www.wired.com/2014/08/obama-net-neutrality/\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/obama-africa-feat-150x150.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1376991\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-08T10:02:49+00:00\", \"section\": \"WIRED\", \"author\": \"Robert McMillan\", \"tags\": [\"Africa\",\"Barack Obama\",\"FCC\",\"Internet\",\"Net Neutrality\"]}", "ExpiryDate": "2060-12-31", "twitter": {"domain": "WIRED", "description": "What's been lost in the debate over his statements to African leaders is a much more important issue: whether the internet's openness as a worldwide platform is under siege.", "creator": "@wired", "image": {"src": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/obama-africa-feat.jpg"}, "title": "Why President Obama Cares About Net Neutrality in Africa", "site": "@wired", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimal-ui, shrink-to-fit=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/themes/Phoenix/assets/images/favicon_ie.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf467\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s no doubt that, six years later, President Obama still wants to sound strong on net neutrality here in the U.S.\nPresident Barack Obama made his most forceful comments about net neutrality this week, saying he doesn\u2019t want an internet where governments act as censors or companies squash competitors with predatory pricing.\nIndeed, the FCC must uphold Obama\u2019s stance, and at least in his public comments, FCC Chairman Wheeler says the agency will.\nConsumer outrage here in the U.S. thwarted theses efforts, and they also pushed net neutrality into the public consciousness\u2014so much so that Obama himself used it as a plank in his 2008 presidential campaign.\nYou \u201cdon\u2019t want to start getting a differentiation in how accessible the internet is to various users,\u201d Obama said, speaking at a White House forum for African business leaders."}
