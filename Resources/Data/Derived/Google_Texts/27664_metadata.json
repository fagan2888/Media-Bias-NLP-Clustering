Employer Shared Responsibility\n\nThe Employer Shared Responsibility provision, also called ESR or the employer mandate, is the requirement for applicable large employers (ALEs) to either offer health insurance to employees, or pay a fee if/when an employee buys subsidized health insurance through the Marketplace.\n\nAll employers need to understand:\n\nDoes this provision apply to us? (Are we an applicable large employer with 50+ FTEs?)\n\nIf we offer coverage, does our health insurance plan satisfy the affordability and coverage requirements?\n\nIf we do not offer coverage that satisfies the mandate, what are the fees we could pay?\n\nHow does the transition relief impact our coverage requirements and reporting for 2015?\n\n2. Annual Healthcare Reporting\n\nIn addition to the Employer Shared Responsibility, ALEs need to understand new healthcare reporting requirements required under health reform law. Starting in January 2016, all ALEs are required to submit IRS Form 1095-C and Form 1094-C.\n\nALEs need to understand the new reporting requirements and be prepared to report on the following information:\n\nBasic employer information.\n\nThe months during the calendar year for which healthcare coverage was available.\n\nThe number of full-time employees for each month during the calendar year.\n\nWhether you, the employer, offered full-time employees and their dependents the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan (by calendar month).\n\nEach full-time employee's share of the lowest-cost monthly premium (self-coverage only) for coverage providing minimum value under an eligible employer-sponsored plan (by calendar month).\n\nThe name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of each full-time employee covered under any such health benefits plans.\n\nFor some employers, this information is straight-forward. For others, the reporting requirements are time consuming and complex. To help ease the administrative pain, numerous ACA compliance software platforms have popped up in the market to help employers accurately track, integrate, and report personnel and benefit information required for the new healthcare reporting.\n\n3. Exchange Notice Management\n\nAll employers, regardless of size or benefits offered, are required to provide employees notices of coverage available through the public Health Insurance Marketplaces.\n\nAll employers should verify they are meeting the Exchange (\u201cMarketplace\u201d) notice requirements, as well as other health plan notice requirements.\n\n4. Benefits Plan Structure\n\nUnder the ACA, there are several new rules about benefits plan structure and coverage. Most of the reforms went into effect in 2014 or 2015, but fees for non-compliance are steep.\n\nTo ensure compliance, employers offering health benefits should audit their plans annually to ensure compliance with group health plan reforms, such as:\n\nAnnual and Lifetime Limits Requirements\n\nPreventive Care Services Requirements\n\n90 Day Limitation on Waiting Periods\n\nEssential Health Benefit Rules\n\nHealth Plan Notice Requirements\n\nCost-Sharing Limitations\n\nTip - These are just some of the most common health plan reforms. Check with your insurance professional, health benefits company, or ACA compliance software provider for all reforms applicable to your health plans.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs employers prepare for the year of ACA reporting and compliance, Employer Shared Responsibility, healthcare reporting, notice management, and benefit plan structure should be top of mind.\n\nWhat else is top of mind to your business or your clients?
