Each year, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center honors people whose writing advances social justice and inspires action. This year, the two winners of the Student Stowe Prize crafted essays on two issues that are very important in 2014.

Madeline Sachs, a high school student from Chicago, spoke on the inequity of juvenile sentencing standards, an issue that’s important as Connecticut lawmakers grapple with -- and still fail to implement -- a new law to come into compliance with a Supreme Court ruling on the issue. We hear some of her presentation and talk with a civil rights lawyer.

Donya Nasser grew up seeing politics and women’s role in politics through the lens of her mother, who grew up in Iran’s very restrictive political system. She’s making the case for more young American women to get involved, and we talk to a political scientist about the issue.

We also hear the music of Yovianna García. She’s a young Puerto Rican guitarist who concentrates on the contemporary and traditional sounds of her home country.

Visit Yovianna García's website for more information and dates of upcoming performances.
