NFLX, +2.60% price target to $140 from $120 on the heels of the firm's recent survey of about 590 video consumers, which found 61% of respondents use Netflix. That is above competitors such as Amazon, at 37%, iTunes, at 19%, and Hulu, at 19%. Raymond James analyst Justin Patterson said in a note that while there's nothing to suggest that Netflix is a substitute for TV, given the advantage in live content, the company's growing and improving content library increases his confidence for the long-term. Patterson said Netflix has indicated plans to spend more than $6 billion on content in 2016, and he believes Netflix will be able to drive leverage against content expense over time and remain on track for more than $4.80 earnings per share by 2020. Netflix reported per share earnings of 6 cents during its second quarter of 2015. The company's shares are up 155% in the year to date, while the S&P is only up 1%.", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Trey Williams", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-price-target-raised-at-raymond-james-due-to-long-term-potential-2015-08-14", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Netflix price target raised at Raymond James due to long-term potential"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "creator": "@Trey3Williams", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Netflix price target raised at Raymond James due to long-term potential", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-14T09:38:00-04:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Trey Williams", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-price-target-raised-at-raymond-james-due-to-long-term-potential-2015-08-14", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "51ED021C-B703-46A3-B9DB-51EEA093BC7F"}, "article_summary": "Analysts at Raymond James bumped their Netflix Inc.
