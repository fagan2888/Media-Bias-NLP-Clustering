It's been one year since the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School transformed Newtown, Connecticut, the country, and the world. Over the last year, there have been countless musical tributes to the victims.

This hour, we share some of the music that came out of this tragedy.

Some of it comes from a concert broadcast on WNPR's Where We Live one week after the shooting. It was hosted at the Asylum Hill Congregational Church in Hartford, Connecticut.

We'll also hear music from the Strings For Newtown concert held on December 1, 2013 at Newtown Congregational Church.

There is one song that was recorded before the tragedy. Acclaimed jazz saxophonist Jimmy Greene recorded a song called "Ana Grace," which was for his daughter Ana MÃ¡rquez-Greene, who died one year ago today.

Listen to the full hour of music, remembering the victims of Newtown, CT on the one-year anniversary.
