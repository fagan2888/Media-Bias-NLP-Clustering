Omnidronez is a company in Tucson looking to take advertising to the next level with the use of "drone-vertising."

The company uses drones to fly banners and also carry a projector to show videos.

Omnidronez is one of only three companies in the world to use banner drone advertising. It is one of two to have the drone projection technology. Over the weekend he promoted the work Curtis Young, an up and coming rap artist and Dr. Dre's son.

"A lot of people stopped walking on Congress and looked up. You can hear the sound of bees buzzing overhead and they look up and they see this big projection the size of w movie theaters of video that we were putting up on the wall," said Robert Luscumb, owner of Omnidronez.

"It's great marketing. And I think that's a great way to advertise. And if they can do it and make money off of it, it's a great deal," said Shane Stevenson, a student at the U of A.

"I mean that's just creative advertising in my thinking," said Bob Paulsen, a Tucson resident.

Omnidronez is still in its early phases. Luscumb applied for and received an exemption to the FAA ban on commercial drone use.

Because it is one of only two companies in the world to do drone video projections, Luscumb said he is figuring it all out as he goes along.

"There's not really a set way to do this. We're the only ones doing it so we're pretty much inventing it as we go," Luscumb said.

Luscumb charges clients about $1000 an hour for "drone-vertising."
