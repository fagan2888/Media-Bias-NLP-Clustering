Rhapsody of the Seas was the first in January 2002.\n\nThe 90,090-ton ship set sail Saturday afternoon with about 2,100 passengers on a seven-day Western Caribbean cruise with scheduled ports of call in Key West; Cozumel and Grand Cayman, Mexico; and Roatan, Honduras.\n\nWhen the cruise liner returns to port next week, it will begin a series of four- and five-day cruises with ports of call in Cozumel and Costa Maya, Mexico.\n\nThe ship will be based in Tampa on a seasonal basis, sailing out of Cruise Terminal 3 at 815 Channelside Drive until May 1.\n\nThis mark\u2019s the ship captain\u2019s second stint in Tampa. Capt. Stig Nilsen served in the same capacity when Royal Caribbean\u2019s Jewel of the Seas sailed out of Tampa.\n\nDerrick and Tashawn Davis of Romulus, Mich., had been planning their first cruise for months.\n\nThey were unaware until Saturday that the Brilliance of the Seas was making its inaugural departure from the Port of Tampa.\n\nThe Davises, who have six children as a result of a blended family, said they also didn\u2019t know the Brilliance of the Seas had undergone an extensive overhaul this year, completed just in time for the ship\u2019s relocation to Tampa.\n\n\u201cWe are special, baby!\u201d Tashawn Davis said to her husband.\n\nRussell and Lorraine Seabol of Palm Harbor, who are traveling with their next-door neighbors, are on their eighth cruise. They wanted to be a part of the Brilliance of the Seas\u2019 debut voyage out of Tampa.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, the Tampa Port Authority arranged a tour of the 12-story Radiance-class ship for authority board members and news reporters.\n\nThe vessel has a glass enclosed, nine-story central atrium with glass-paneled elevators facing the atrium and the sea. There are floor-to-ceiling windows throughout. The ship\u2019s newest addition is a 48-seat movie theater installed during the ship\u2019s makeover.\n\nRoyal Caribbean International plans to deploy a second ship in Tampa for Caribbean cruises next year.\n\nA Tampa Port Authority official said that news marked a significant step toward the agency\u2019s goal eventually to serve more than 1 million cruise ship passengers annually.\n\n\u201cThat will be a major boost to our passenger volume, pushing us over the 1 million passenger mark for the first time,\u201d said Wade Elliott, the port authority\u2019s vice president of marketing and business development.\n\nkknight@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7413", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 16 Nov 2013 18:16:37 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Royal Caribbean International\u2019s newest vessel to home port at the Port of Tampa celebrated its inaugural voyage Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Royal Caribbean International\u2019s newest vessel to home port at the Port of Tampa celebrated its inaugural voyage Saturday.", "title": "\u2018Brilliance of the Seas\u2019 embarks on maiden voyage from Tampa", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/all/brilliance-of-the-seas-embarks-on-maiden-voyage-from-tampa-20131116/", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131116/ARTICLE/131119351/EP/1/2/EP-131119351.jpg", "height": 1200}, "updated_time": "2013-11-16T19:16:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Royal Caribbean International\u2019s newest vessel to home port at the Port of Tampa celebrated its inaugural voyage Saturday.", "title": "\u2018Brilliance of the Seas\u2019 embarks on maiden voyage from Tampa", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131116/ARTICLE/131119351/AR/0/AR-131119351.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-16T18:16:37Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-16T19:16:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d72\"", "article_summary": "TAMPA \u2014 Royal Caribbean International\u2019s newest vessel to home port at the Port of Tampa celebrated its inaugural voyage Saturday.\nThe Brilliance of the Seas is the ninth Royal Caribbean cruise ship to sail from Tampa in the past 13 years.\nTo celebrate the occasion, the Tampa Port Authority arranged a tour of the 12-story Radiance-class ship for authority board members and news reporters.\nThey wanted to be a part of the Brilliance of the Seas\u2019 debut voyage out of Tampa.\nThey were unaware until Saturday that the Brilliance of the Seas was making its inaugural departure from the Port of Tampa."}
