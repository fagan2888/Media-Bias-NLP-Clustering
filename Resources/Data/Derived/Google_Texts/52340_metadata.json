Of course, the contraceptive effects are great, too, as she emphasizes. Women who have effective contraception have healthier babies, because they choose when to get pregnant. They experience better life outcomes, too: \"Birth control allows women to achieve education and career goals, benefiting their families and society.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat Kiley fails to mention, however, is what I, a long-term pill user, can assure you is a wonderful side effect of this kind of contraception: It is great for your sex life. If you're in a monogamous and tested relationship, it means you can have sex whenever or wherever, without having to go hunting around for your condoms. If you're still playing the field, it makes sex with a condom more fun and more relaxed, since you're much less worried about what to do if the condom breaks. Easy access to emergency contraception has got to be a major worry-reducer for condom users, too.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Yes, the Birth Control Pill Has Side Effects.
