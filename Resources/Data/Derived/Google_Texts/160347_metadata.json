(REUTERS/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus)\n\n4654210\n\nFormer Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee predicted that Vice President Joe Biden will enter the 2016 race for the Democratic nomination during an interview Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to longtime host Larry King, Chafee said that he would put \u201ctwo dollars\u201d on a Biden bid, going on later to say \u201cI think he\u2019s going to get in.\u201d Chafee, who is also running and trailing significantly in the polls, pointed to Biden standing by President Barack Obama during big announcements and speeches, saying \u201cthat seems to signal something to me.\u201d\n\nLARRY KING: Do you buy anything to the possibility that Joe Biden might get in? LINCOLN CHAFEE: Well you\u2019re a race track guy. I\u2019d put two dollars on that. KING: You think he might? CHAFEE: I think he\u2019s going to get in. KING: Really? CHAFEE: I do. I\u2019d put two dollars. Yes I do. KING: Is that a gut or more than a gut. CHAFEE: Well I see him standing with President Obama in every photo. Especially the big main profile [photos]\u2014when the Supreme Court ruled in favor the Affordable Care Act, the deal with Iran, the opening of Cuba, it always seems the Vice President is standing right there. That seems to signal something to me. He\u2019s run before, he ran in 1988 and of course in 2008. And I served with him on the Foreign Relations Committee, we\u2019ve traveled together to Iraq. We\u2019ve done some trips together to Mexico. I\u2019ll put my two dollars that he gets in.\n\nWATCH:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "Former Rhode Island Gov.
