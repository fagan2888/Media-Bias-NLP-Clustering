Despite having insurance for the entire year, their tax form shows that they only had insurance for a couple of months.\n\n\"When we went to file our taxes we realized that we needed a 1095A form but when we looked at the ones that they sent us we realized that they're not complete,\" Kaylene said.\n\nThat's important because under the Affordable Care Act, if you don't have insurance you have to pay a stiff penalty on your taxes.\n\nKaylene and Edward have been battling with the healthcare marketplace for more than a month asking them to simply fix the form. They even arranged a three-way call so the insurance company could confirm that they had insurance all year. But they still can't get a corrected tax form.\n\n\"When I go to these people and I ask them to fix it, I get a lot of, 'I'm sorry for the inconvenience.' Well that doesn't help me,\" Edward said.\n\n\"It's very frustrating,\" Kaylene said.\n\nNot getting anywhere on their own with the federal agency, Kaylene and Edward decided to Get Gephardt.\n\nGet Gephardt reached out to the marketplace on Kaylene and Edward's behalf, not through one of the call centers but through its Denver-based spokesperson. He couldn't talk any specifics about Kaylene and Edward citing privacy concerns but promised to investigate. That investigation seems to have done the trick.\n\n\n\nJust like that, Kaylene and Edward got the piece of paper they've been requesting for six weeks that shows they had insurance all of 2015.\n\n\"Now we can do our taxes and do what we need to do,\" Kaylene said.\n\nIf you have a problem you'd like Matt to investigate, call us at 801-839-1250 or email gephardt@kutv.tv.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "(KUTV) Kaylene and Edward Fetzer simply want to file their taxes, but they can't.Kaylene and Edward get health insurance through the federal healthcare marketplace.
