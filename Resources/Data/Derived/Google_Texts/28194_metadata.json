Bowe Bergdahl, and his controversial Obamacare law.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently ruled 9-0 against Obama after his illegal appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has filed a lawsuit against the President for his lawlessness. In a CNN op-ed expalining his lawsuit, he wrote:\n\nToo often over the past five years, the President has circumvented the American people and their elected representatives through executive action, changing and creating his own laws, and excusing himself from enforcing statutes he is sworn to uphold \u2014 at times even boasting about his willingness to do it, as if daring the American people to stop him.\n\nOther Republicans, such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, have called for Obama\u2019s impeachment because of his lawlessness.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s rewarding of lawlessness, including his own, is the foundational problem here,\u201d Palin said in a Breitbart News exclusive, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s not going to get better, and in fact irreparable harm can be done in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along, and, mark my words, will next meddle in the U.S. Court System with appointments that will forever change the basic interpretation of our Constitution\u2019s role in protecting our rights.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Obama is planning to give some form of amnesty to as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million people who entered the country illegally. White House Senior Adviser Dan Daniel Pfeiffer explained to reporters last week that his decision would come at the end of the summer and would be based on \u201csolid legal footing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama: A Country Without Rule of Law 'Will Not Succeed'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama: A Country Without Rule of Law 'Will Not Succeed'", "title": "Obama: A Country Without Rule of Law 'Will Not Succeed' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/mexico-fence-reuters.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/28/obama-a-country-without-rule-of-law-will-not-succeed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama: A Country Without Rule of Law 'Will Not Succeed'", "title": "Obama: A Country Without Rule of Law 'Will Not Succeed' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/mexico-fence-reuters.jpg", "creator": "@charliespiering", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CNN, Supreme Court, White House,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-07-28T13:07:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef94\"", "article_summary": "According to the Los Angeles Times, Obama is planning to give some form of amnesty to as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million people who entered the country illegally.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring a town hall meeting at a summit with the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, President Obama explained to a young African student that to succeed, a burgeoning country required a system of laws.\nThe Supreme Court recently ruled 9-0 against Obama after his illegal appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has filed a lawsuit against the President for his lawlessness.\nObama made his remarks as critics have denounced his \u201clawlessness,\u201d particularly through his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) order, his decision to trade five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay for Sgt."}
