Members of the Community Action Partnership of Mid-Nebraska are lending a hand to help families sign up for health insurance.

The all day fair guided families or individuals on how to navigate through the healthcare system and choose the right plan.

Certified Affordable Care Act Navigators say those who have never signed up for health insurance or haven't had it in years, the process can be overwhelming.

"The bills really add up. I had a gentleman who in the past didn't have health insurance and he had a bout with cancer and he told me he was still paying and owed $20,000 to a hospital for treatment he had had. So now he is getting the insurance just so if anything ever happens again," said Kylie Nichols.

If you were not able to make it to Monday's meeting you can schedule an appointment with the Community Action Partnership of Mid-Nebraska by calling 308-221-5433.
