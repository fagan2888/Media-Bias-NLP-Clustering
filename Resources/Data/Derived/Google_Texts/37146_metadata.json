John Kasich on Wednesday accused Montana lawmakers of letting poor Montanans die by rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nKasich\u2019s meeting with state legislators in Helena marked the second Balanced Budget Forever event in as many days where the Republican governor promoted Medicaid expansion and bashed its critics.\n\nAsked about Obamacare after he gave a speech bemoaning out-of-control federal debt, Kasich defended his decision to take billions in new federal spending to extend Medicaid coverage to working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependent children.\n\n\u201cWell, I mean first of all, we have an opportunity to bring our money back from Washington to Ohio,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cSecondly, we have a lot of demands as you have in every state across the country for the mentally ill, the drug-addicted, the working poor, and we feel an obligation to help people get themselves out of a bad situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in addition to that, the expansion of Medicaid is not something that\u2019s unusual. Ronald Reagan himself expanded Medicaid,\u201d Kasich continued.\n\nAlthough Kasich asserts his Obamacare expansion is funded entirely with Ohio money, the expansion is projected to cost federal taxpayers more than $50 billion in its first decade.\n\n\u201cYou take somebody who, we have a big chunk of people that sit in our prisons right now, in our jails with mental illness. That\u2019s not where they should be. By getting them a coordinated care treatment, we can not only help them get on their feet, but become productive citizens. And I think that\u2019s what the Lord wants,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid has estimated \u201cabout half\u201d of those eligible under Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion are employed.\n\n\u201cSo, what I said to the federal government is, \u2018If you change the rules on me, then I have the right to withdraw from the program,'\u201d Kasich told his Montana audience. \u201cBut in the meantime as we are trying to figure all these things out, I\u2019m not going to be an ideologue here and say to people, \u2018Sorry, the door is closed and if you\u2019ve got these problems of addictions or mental illness and you\u2019re trying to work your way up and you\u2019re poor, ya know, we\u2019re not going to help you.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conservative proposition,\u201d Kasich concluded.\n\nKasich became visibly annoyed when his Obamacare expansion position was challenged again at a press conference during his Wednesday visit to Helena.\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts gave me an opportunity in the Supreme Court for the state to make a decision as to whether they want to reclaim this money or not,\u201d Kasich told state legislators, repeating a line he used in Pierre, S.D., the day before. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in Washington, it\u2019s my money, okay? And so, I brought my money back to Ohio.\u201d\n\nAs noted above, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion is expected to cost federal taxpayers over $50 billion in new spending through 2022. The only involvement Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court had in Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion was in empowering states to opt out.\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t know whether you ever read Matthew 25, but I commend it to you, the end of it, about do you feed the homeless and do you clothe the poor,\u201d Kasich continued. \u201cI\u2019m a believer that it is in the conservative tradition to make sure that we help people get on their feet so they, then, are not dependent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I gotta tell ya, turning down your money back to Montana on an ideological basis when people can lose their lives because they get no help doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me,\u201d Kasich said. Within hours, Democrat Montana Gov. Steve Bullock was using this quote to pressure Republicans into supporting Obamacare.\n\n\u201cGovernment is here to be as a last resort, not as a first resort,\u201d Kasich added. \u201cSo I read in The Wall Street Journal on Saturday about a doctor in Montana who\u2019s treating all these people who are sneakin\u2019 in there who aren\u2019t getting very good health care, and about a guy who froze to death. And I read that and I thought, you know, we gotta help those people.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s press secretary did not respond to a Watchdog.org request for comment on the governor\u2019s insinuation Obamacare opponents in Montana are ideologues who don\u2019t care about the poor.\n\nAfter stopping in South Dakota on Tuesday and in Montana on Wednesday, Kasich\u2019s Balanced Budget Forever trip is also taking him to Obamacare expansion holdouts Idaho, Wyoming and Utah this week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
