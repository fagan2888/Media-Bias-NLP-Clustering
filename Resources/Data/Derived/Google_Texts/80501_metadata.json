In continuing with tradition, the formal sound off beginning the ceremony was provided by the 101st Airborne Division Band led by Sgt. 1st Class John Ellis.\n\nThis celebration also marks the last Week of the Eagles observance under the command of Maj. Gen. James C. McConville. The 44th \u201cEagle Six\u201d will leave as the longest serving commander in the division\u2019s 72-year history and pass the title to a new commander in June.\n\nVietnam Veteran Mike Yancy, who served in the 101st in 1967 and 1968, was on hand as one of the distinguished visitors. \u201cThe 101st Airborne Division has been one of the greatest parts of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor just to be here.\u201d\n\nVisitors were also treated to a parachute jump by the 101st Parachute Demonstration Team, as they received an explanation of the mission of the 101st Airborne Division. Sgt. John Pitts of the 716th Military Police Battalion and Staff Sgt. Edward Sears landed expertly on the field to the sound of applause from the crowd.\n\nThe history of the 101st was highlighted as McConville and Command Sgt. Maj. Alonzo J. Smith, along with a group of special guests, mounted two humvees to begin the inspection of the gathered troops standing proud and ready. Once the inspection was complete, the colors from each battalion marched and centered upon the Nation\u2019s colors to begin the presentation of awards.\n\nThe Commander\u2019s Cup, presented for excellence in the events throughout the Week of Eagles, was presented to 3rd Brigade Combat Team \u201cRakkasans,\u201d who scored 1,725 points during the week\u2019s events.\n\nAlso presented with awards were: NCO of the year Sgt. Erin Squires of the 526th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Soldier of the year Spc. Jannise Rodriguez of the 626th Brigade Support Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team and Post Soldier of the year Spc. Nicole Faure from Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 86th Combat Support Hospital.\n\nUpon the closing of the awards presentation, the colors returned to their respective units as they prepared for the traditional pass in review. Led by their command teams, each unit marched past the post command and spectators; demonstrating the discipline and precision that the 101st Airborne Division is known for. Followed by a procession of vehicles from armored personnel carriers to Chinooks, the Soldiers left the parade field to continue the legacy of courage and strength that was established by those that came before them.\n\nMaj.
