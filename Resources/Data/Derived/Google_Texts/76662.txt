At least eight businesses along South Broadway were broken into by burglars early Sunday, according to Englewood Police.

The smash-and-grab robbers broke windows to enter businesses including a Great Clips, and Cafe 180, along a more than 10-block stretch of the artery from the 2700 to the 3300 blocks of Broadway, said Sgt. Chad Read, police spokesman.

Police believe the robberies began at about 1:45 a.m. “One of my officers took the last report around 7:30 (a.m.),” when that robbery was discovered.

The burglaries are the latest in a series of smash-and-grab entrances throughout the metro area. “We had a series of these back in the fall, they weren’t solved,” Read said.

Police are reviewing surveillance videos from the shops that were broken into.
