Madison – Dave Aranda’s hands are tied – by Wisconsin’s hiring protocol.



However, UW’s defensive coordinator was not tongue-tied Friday when talking about how much he has enjoyed his two seasons – his first two seasons – at UW.



Because of UW hiring policies, head coach Paul Chryst isn’t allowed to extend any job offers to assistants until after the Dec. 29 application deadline.



However, multiple media outlets have reported Aranda is set to return to UW in 2015.



Aranda, who is married and has three children, did address his experience at UW when asked about his job status.



“I love it here,” he said. “The players…I love their attitude, the work ethic, how they approach their business. They are, what I see, as being the biggest plus of this place.



“My family loves it here. My wife is well situated. My kids, good schools. Love their teachers. Love their friends.



“I’m going to go home tonight and there’s going to be about 20 kids at my house, going crazy. We’re used to that. We love that.”



In case you’re wondering, Aranda was smiling the whole time.
