Republicans as well as Democrats have responded to the move with such fury that unnamed sources clumsily suggested the letter was only a \u201ccheeky\u201d reminder that Congress should have a voice in negotiations. Sen. John McCain downplayed the extraordinary letter as business as usual: \u201cI sign lots of letters,\u201d he told Politico.\n\nBut the firestorm continues to rage. Newspaper editorials slam the senators who signed the bill; more than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition calling for the senators to be tried for treason; #47Traitors has been trending on Twitter. Why has this letter garnered such a visceral reaction when attacks on the president and his policies are the everyday currency of the modern Republican Party?\n\nIt has created a backlash because it shows, with crystal clarity, that the ideology of Movement Conservatives is not simply partisanship. It is an attack on American democracy itself.\n\nThe senators who signed the letter are trying to impose their will on a president they hate. This maneuvering is unusual but not novel. It has been central to most of the nation\u2019s internal crises. Whenever adherents of an ideological faction recognize that they do not have the popular support to control the president, they try to game the system. This happens on a grand scale, as when Southern whites so hated the outcome of the 1860 election that made Abraham Lincoln president, they picked up guns to get their way. It happens on smaller scales, as when Republicans in Congress today threaten to shut down the government to make President Obama do what they want. It\u2019s often hard to distinguish smaller-scale machinations from regular partisan politics.\n\nBut when a faction tries to gain the upper hand at home by interfering with our international relations, Americans are able to see their attack on our fundamental system for what it is. Crossing the water to find support for a domestic faction puts into stark relief that its adherents have no faith in voters\u2019 choice of leaders; rather, they feel justified in doing whatever it takes to override an elected president, even undercutting the nation\u2019s standing in the world.\n\nOn three dramatic occasions, factions have tried to use foreign affairs to wrest control from a president they hated. In the earliest days of the republic, when Americans were painfully aware the country might not survive, men split into two political camps. The Federalists supported President Washington and his efforts to show international powers that the American government was strong enough to last. The Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, insisted that the administration\u2019s establishment of a national bank proved that Washington was turning the fledgling democracy into a European-style monarchy. But while the Republicans\u2019 protests irritated the notoriously thin-skinned Washington, they gained little traction against the father of the country.\n\nWhen French revolutionaries overthrew the French monarchy in 1793, the Republicans saw a wedge issue that might swing voters against the administration. France was an important American ally, but the Federalists looked askance at the country\u2019s instability after the revolutionaries took power. When Washington\u2019s foreign minister signed a treaty of \u201camity\u201d with England in 1795, Republicans made common cause with the French revolutionaries to strengthen their own hand against the Federalists.\n\nRepublicans hoped their support for the democratic French Revolution would help them take power in America, but the French government seemed determined to undermine the cause. It seized American ships, refused to receive an American minister, and finally, in the notorious XYZ affair of 1798, demanded bribes before beginning negotiations to redress American grievances (a common practice in Europe at the time but anathema to cash-strapped Americans building a republic). Eager to promote his party\u2019s fortunes in America, prominent Pennsylvania Republican politician George Logan set off for France in 1798 to urge French officials to court American public opinion. There, he hobnobbed with French diplomats and offered advice on how to swing popular favor their way.\n\nFederalists in Congress were outraged that a private citizen was deliberately working to undercut the administration by negotiating with a foreign power. Free-for-all diplomacy had threatened to shatter the nation under the Articles of Confederation; it had been a driving force in the creation of a stronger government under the Constitution. With the infant country barely recognized by other nations, it was starkly obvious that trying to control internal politics by weakening the nation internationally was suicidal. When Logan came back home, he discovered that Congress had passed what we know as the Logan Act, making his actions a crime. Americans could argue among themselves, but disagreements must stop at the water\u2019s edge. For a faction to use foreign negotiations to trump elected politicians attacked the very existence of American democracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ideology of movement conservatives is not simply partisanship.
