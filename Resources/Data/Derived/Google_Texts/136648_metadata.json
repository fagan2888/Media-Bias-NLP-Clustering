That\u2019s up from 13 percent in 2007.\n\nClick here for the poll results.\n\nIn addition, the number reporting they have two or more tattoos has nearly doubled in the last seven years: 14 percent today, up from 8 percent in 2007.\n\nPeople under age 45 are twice as likely as those 45 and over to have one (31 percent vs. 14 percent).\n\nAnd the number goes up as the age goes down: A third of those under age 30 have a tattoo (34 percent). One in five in this age group has three or more (19 percent).\n\nAnd check out this gender gap: Nearly half of women under age 35 have gotten ink, almost double their male counterparts (47 percent vs. 25 percent).\n\nIt\u2019s the reverse among those 65 and over: three times as many senior men as women have a tattoo (14 percent vs. 4 percent).\n\nBy a 58-32 percent margin, voters say \u201cno\u201d when asked the simple question: Do you like tattoos? Yet 55 percent of those under age 35 say \u201cyes.\u201d That rises to 64 percent for women under 35.\n\nThe increase in body ink is not because people think tattoos are attractive: 6 in 10 think they make a person less attractive. That\u2019s more than seven times as many as say more attractive (eight percent). About a quarter says tattoos make no difference.\n\nEven tattoo wearers aren\u2019t wholehearted supporters: 24 percent think ink make a person more attractive, while 22 percent say less attractive. The largest number -- 42 percent -- says no difference.\n\nTen percent of tattooed Americans say they don\u2019t like tattoos.\n\nBy a 73-16 percent margin, most voters say they would hire someone who has a visible tattoo. Among tattoo wearers, 84 percent would hire the person, while 6 percent wouldn\u2019t.\n\nOverall, a wide range of groups are about equally likely to have skin in the game: Men (21 percent), women (22 percent), whites (21 percent), blacks (21 percent), Democrats (24 percent), independents (21 percent), Republicans (19 percent) and white evangelical Christians (18 percent).\n\nOn the other hand, more liberals (26 percent) have ink than conservatives (18 percent).\n\nMilitary veterans and those currently serving in the armed forces are bigger tattoo wearers: 36 percent have one. That\u2019s double the number for those who haven\u2019t served (18 percent).\n\nWhether a person has a tattoo or not makes no significant difference in their views of President Obama\u2019s job performance, views of Congress, vote preference in the midterm election or views of Obamacare.\n\nThe Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,002 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from March 2 to March 4, 2014. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for the total sample.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Fox News Poll", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-23 02:26:34 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A majority says they don\u2019t like tattoos, yet more Americans are getting them -- and getting more of them.", "twitter": {"description": "A majority says they don\u2019t like tattoos, yet more Americans are getting them -- and getting more of them.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1437852531696.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Fox News Poll: Tattoos aren\u2019t just for rebels anymore", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Fox News Poll\"],\"author\":\"Dana Blanton\",\"subSection\":\"us\",\"title\":\"Fox News Poll: Tattoos aren\\u2019t just for rebels anymore\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1437852531696.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-14T20:52:19Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"83b4b9e5-7f98-42ad-85d9-a5079f805562\",\"section\":\"us\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A majority says they don\u2019t like tattoos, yet more Americans are getting them -- and getting more of them.", "dc.identifier": "83b4b9e5-7f98-42ad-85d9-a5079f805562", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A majority says they don\u2019t like tattoos, yet more Americans are getting them -- and getting more of them.", "title": "Fox News Poll: Tattoos aren\u2019t just for rebels anymore | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1437852531696.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "fncpoll", "description": "A majority says they don\u2019t like tattoos, yet more Americans are getting them -- and getting more of them.", "prism.section": "us", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Fox News Poll: Tattoos Aren\u2019t Just For Rebels Anymore", "dcterms.created": "2014-12-23 02:26:34 EST", "column": "fox-news-poll", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-03-14", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Fox News Poll\"],\"author\":\"Dana Blanton\",\"subSection\":\"us\",\"title\":\"Fox News Poll: Tattoos aren\\u2019t just for rebels anymore\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1437852531696.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-14T20:52:19Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/14/fox-news-poll-tattoos-arent-just-for-rebels-anymore.html\",\"post_id\":\"83b4b9e5-7f98-42ad-85d9-a5079f805562\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"us\"}", "dc.creator": "Dana Blanton"}, "article_summary": "By a 58-32 percent margin, voters say \u201cno\u201d when asked the simple question: Do you like tattoos?\nThe latest Fox News poll finds 20 percent of voters, or one in five, has at least one tattoo.\nEven tattoo wearers aren\u2019t wholehearted supporters: 24 percent think ink make a person more attractive, while 22 percent say less attractive.\nBy a 73-16 percent margin, most voters say they would hire someone who has a visible tattoo.\nThe increase in body ink is not because people think tattoos are attractive: 6 in 10 think they make a person less attractive."}
