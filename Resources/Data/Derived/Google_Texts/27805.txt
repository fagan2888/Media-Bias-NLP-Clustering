Politico Magazine is an enterprising publication. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA), Politico Magazine whipped up a survey and secured WHCA’s cooperation in blasting it out to its members. Steve Thomma, senior White House correspondent for McClatchy and WHCA president, says, “The board decided that because of the centennial that we would distribute it” on the WHCA list, which includes more than 200 addresses. Politico Magazine got no access to the list itself.

The survey contains a total of 41 questions, though Thomma didn’t seek to exercise input on its content. “We don’t police the journalism of our members,” says Thomma, noting that Politico Magazine editor Susan Glasser and Politico are one of the WHCA’s “main” members. “I trusted that they weren’t going to ask something ridiculous.”

Trust redeemed, for the most part. As laid out below, the survey asks about quite a few pressing and consequential matters, including how useful reporters consider press briefings, how helpful certain White House officials have been, whether you’ve even been lied to by the Obama White House, whether you agree or disagree that this White House is the most secretive that the New York Times’s Jill Abramson has ever covered and so on.

Look closely, however, and you’ll find some demi-ridiculous material:

16. Do you think President Obama knows you by name? 17. Do you think Jay Carney knows you by name?

Watch out, White House correspondents: If too many of you answer yes to those questions, brace yourselves for a Politico Magazine subhead saying this, “Corps of self-importance — 92 percent of White House scribes think the president knows them by name!”

The folks at liberal-media-policing site NewsBusters would take comfort in the clear anti-Obama tilt in this one:

25. There have been more leak-related prosecutions under the Obama administration (seven) than under all previous presidents combined (three). On a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (absolutely), how much of a chilling effect has this had on your reporting?

And in a sign that Politico Magazine would like to harness the clicks that come from divining an ideological tilt in the White House press corps, witness this question:

33. Given what you know now, who do you think will be the next president?

If the answers to this trend the right way, bloggers will latch on to the finding. Imagine: “Survey: Most White House reporters think Hillary will be next prez. Why even have an election?”

Yet the few oddball questions aren’t really the survey’s main drawback. That would be the warning at the beginning of the questionnaire, which attempts to locate some mushy middle ground between attribution and non-attribution:

***ANONYMOUS SECTION: Your participation in the survey will be on the record, but your individual answers to these questions will not be attributed to you by name.***

This is Washington, where no one — not government officials, not reporters, not tourists — goes on the record about anything. How many WHCA types will want to share their sincerest thoughts about their work and the White House knowing they’ll be lodged in some Politico Magazine file cabinet in perpetuity?

Covering the White House

A POLITICO MAGAZINE Survey

The White House Correspondents’ Association was founded a century ago this year, in response to Woodrow Wilson’s threat to end presidential press conferences. And even though the president today is more visible than ever on social media and cable TV, the White House press is still fighting for access: Photographers want more chances to catch President Obama candidly on camera, while reporters vie for coveted interviews with him or simply for on-the-record quotes from administration officials addicted to anonymity.

So what’s changed in 100 years of journalism at 1600 Pennsylvania, and what changes should we expect in the years to come? POLITICO MAGAZINE is asking the members of the WHCA to share their thoughts for what we hope will be an honest, comprehensive look at the state of White House reporting. We’ll feature the results of this unique survey in our upcoming May/June issue of the magazine. Please send your responses to Margy Slattery (mslattery@politico.com) by next Friday, April 4, at noon. And please don’t hesitate to contact our editor, Susan Glasser (sglasser@politico.com, 703-842-1787), with any questions. We look forward to hearing from you.
