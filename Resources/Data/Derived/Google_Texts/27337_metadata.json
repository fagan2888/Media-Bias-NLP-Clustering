That is what Brian Rutter does. For him, Bernie Sanders is a muggle. Here is why.\n\n\u2014\n\nTo the generation who grew up mesmerized and transfixed by the magical, mystical world of Harry Potter, and who now flood the webosphere with incantations, clearly under an intoxicating revolutionary spell, I unfortunately need to let you in on a secret\u2026 Bernie Sanders is a Muggle.\n\nEven with the glowing white locks of Professor Dumbledore and the sage pontifications of a wizened wizard as old as time, he possesses no potions or mandrake root to end all the ills and vices brought on by the Dark Lord (aka Lloyd Blankfein) and his evil corporate followers at Goldman Sachs. He cannot just wave his wand of phoenix feathers and make the middle class rise and the \u201c1%\u201d fall.\n\nHe\u2019s just like you and me, an ordinary person living in a world where 24/7 newsfeed fears frighten us. And while as a president, he can propose how to spend trillions of dollars on what he desires for the American people \u2013 free healthcare, free public college \u2013 Fort Knox is not Gringotts. College debt cannot be replaced with governmental insolvency. We cannot overtax and over promise to leave our country under water.\n\nEnthusiasm is exhilarating and just like Hogwarts\u2019 students standing eagerly at King\u2019s Cross Station, we should all be excited about a future that waits beyond the wall. We should all want to break down the walls of racism and xenophobia, greed and middle-aged complacency. But just like a box of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavour Beans, with the sweet can also come the bitter\u2026 the bitter taste of disappointment from unrealized legislation or budgetary shortfalls.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to hate bumbling bureaucrats and authoritative technocrats that stagnate and stall progress. Umbridge\u2019s and Fudge\u2019s who feed off the status quo. Who restrict and constrict in an effort to maintain established power. Regular people with regulatory power.\n\nBut I have tell you\u2026 Bernie Sanders is one of those bureaucrats. Most of his career has been spent in the deathly hallowed halls of governmental edifices and sitting on committee after committee. He is part and parcel of the governmental juggernaut he continues to rail against.\n\nTo foster innovation, promote learning and protect our freedoms, it will take more than revolutionary recriminations and a cave inimicum spell to keep enemies from our shores. It will take real leadership and global experience.\n\nI would like to believe hipsters in skinny jeans fueled by shouts of \u201cIncendio!\u201d will set a fire under Middle America orthodoxy\u2026 but what will rise from the ashes of a ruined, bloated economy? Not sure \u201cfeeling the bern\u201d will feel all that good for tens of millions of Americans working good corporate jobs and sending their children off to college, public and private.\n\nNo invisibility cloak will protect us from the realities of downsizing and outsourcing. It will take collective, practical solutions to address this global problem. Slaying political dragons is one thing\u2026 decimating the Affordable Care Act is another. For a generation used to downloading free music and apps, the best things in life aren\u2019t always free. Everyone has to pay in the end.\n\nSo I leave you with this\u2026 it\u2019s okay that Bernie is a Muggle like you and me. Ordinary citizens can do extraordinary things. A boy scarred by life\u2019s injustices and circumstance can change the world. Good can triumph over evil polluters and foreign despots. There is always magic in the making.\n\nBut we don\u2019t need magical thinking to make magic happen. Flowery rhetoric is not the same as results. To make things grow, to identify concrete paths to solve everyday problems, to keep those death-panel eaters from taking the White House, we may just need a Muggle with the brains, tenacity and common-sense answers we\u2019ve been looking for.\n\nAnd as any Harry Potter fan knows, that\u2019s Hermione. Need I say more?\n\nPhoto: Flickr/ Karen Roe and Marc Nozell", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Good Men Project", "description": "Leave it to a dad to put the current political landscape into Harry Potter terms.
