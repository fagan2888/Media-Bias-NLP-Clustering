You hold a doctorate in social work and spent a large portion of your early career working in military hospitals. How does that experience translate into your role as a hospice administrator?\n\nMy advanced education in social work focused a great deal on family systems theory, which emphasizes how individuals and families adjust to changes. This is very closely related to people dealing with terminal illness and/or loss of a loved one. With over 22 years of active duty in the United States Army, I had the opportunity to work in many different locations throughout the world and in many different social work disciplines. All of these experiences culminate in a better understanding of human dynamics and a better understanding of how people deal with stress and crisis situations, including death. All of these experiences have made me a better clinician and administrator.\n\n2. What insights about the elderly have you gained from your work on the board of the Clay County Senior Advocacy Council?\n\nThe Clay County Senior Adult Advocacy Council is a nonprofit organization in Clay County that advocates for senior citizens in the county. Through my involvement, I was afforded many opportunities to learn about the variety of organizations in Clay County that serve the elderly and how we can all be more effective in improving the quality of life for this rapidly growing segment of our population. Most of my insights about the elderly have come from the past eight years of working as the executive director of the Councils on Aging in Nassau and Clay counties.\n\n3. Hospice care is a relatively new concept in the U.S., having first been introduced to this country in the mid-1970s. What are the differences between hospice care and traditional nursing home care?\n\nTraditional nursing home care focuses primarily on caring for individuals who are no longer able to care for themselves and have an illness that may still be receiving treatment. Their stay in the nursing home may be for a prolonged period of time. Hospice care is designed for patients that have a life-limiting illness with a life expectancy of six months or less. The primary focus is palliative care, which is intended to keep the patient comfortable and free of pain.\n\n4. How will the Affordable Care Act affect hospice operations, from a patient perspective as well as that of staff?\n\nUntil it has been in place for an extended period of time, it will be difficult to determine the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on hospice services. Sequestration, however, does negatively impact hospice services. On April 1, Congress allowed dramatic across-the-board spending cuts to be implemented through sequestration. As part of this process, Medicare reduced reimbursement to all providers (including hospices) by 2 percent per year for 10 years. Consequently, Haven (and all other hospice programs) received a 2 percent reimbursement reduction on April 1 which was followed by another 2 percent reduction on Oct. 1 (the start of the 2014 federal budget), with an additional 2 percent reduction annually on October 1 for the next eight years. Subsequently, we cannot underestimate the importance of philanthropy to the ongoing financial viability of our special community programs and services.\n\n5. Haven Hospice has been recognized for its leadership in promoting advance directives, as well as for its innovations in palliative and end-of-life care. What other new developments can we expect from the organization in the near future?\n\nAt Haven, we believe everyone deserves companionship through life\u2019s journeys. With Haven Transitions, we provide education and support that can make a world of difference to someone facing a serious or life-limiting illness, but who is not yet ready for hospice care. This program includes services such as supportive phone calls, education and information about and referrals to community resources, education to help with understanding care options and choices, advance care planning and volunteer companionship.\n\nCamp Safe Haven is another example of an unfunded program that we offer. For the first time this past summer, we offered two distinct camp experiences \u2014 one for children and the other for families who have experienced the loss of a loved one. In October, we expanded the program and offered the first overnight teen camp at Camp Immokalee in Keystone Heights. The teen campers participated in sports events, fitness exercises and group activities to help them understand their feeling of loss and give them an opportunity to heal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breaking news, photos, videos and blogs from Orange Park, Middleburg, Fleming Island, Camp Blanding, Green Cove Springs and the Orange Park Mall.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "On Oct. 17, Haven Hospice celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Custead Care Center, the organization's fifth free-standing hospice facility in North Florida and the only such location in Clay County.
