Is there some senator or member of Congress who wants dangerous bridges, who\u2019s happy with trains that shake, rattle and roll, that ramble along like a farmer\u2019s buckboard? Like the Acela between D.C. and New York?\n\nIs anyone happy that Memorial Bridge, which we marched across in the March on the Pentagon in 1967 against the Vietnam War, is crumbling?\n\nDoes anyone wish that President Eisenhower had not built the interstate highway system that unites this country \u2013 Route 95 that cuts north and south, Route 70 and Route 80, that cut across the continent uniting east and west?\n\nIsn\u2019t there a way in all the clatter of opportunities (the trade bill, a minimum wage hike, Keystone, infrastructure spending) that grown-ups can find ways to jam things together and make a go of it? Does everything have to die in the logjam? Does everything we need to get done need to rot on the tracks? Is everything about killing something, like Obamacare?\n\nCan\u2019t the pols find a way to get something done by letting some things live?\n\nWhere are the LBJs, the Tip O\u2019Neills the Bob Doles, the Bill Clintons?\n\nLincoln built the transcontinental railway in the middle of the Civil War, the land-grant college system, and with it scientific agriculture, in the same war.\n\nI\u2019m waiting for a presidential candidate of either party to propose a deal that will actually get done.
