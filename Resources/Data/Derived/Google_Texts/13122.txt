VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was hired as a consultant for a mechanical contractor after his conviction in a federal corruption case.

Bay Mechanical Inc. CEO Rod Rodriguez tells The Virginian-Pilot (http://bit.ly/1BIXoKg) he offered McDonnell the job in September. It was about a week after the former governor and his wife, Maureen, were found guilty of taking gifts and loans from a vitamin executive in exchange for promoting his products.

Rodriguez, who has known McDonnell for about a decade, said he simply wanted to help a friend in need.

“I just said, ‘What can I do to help?’” Rodriguez said Friday. “He didn’t say, ‘Give me a job.’”

McDonnell started the new job in October. Rodriguez said McDonnell has worked 24 to 30 hours a week at the company’s Virginia Beach headquarters.

Rodriguez said the former governor’s monthly salary is around $5,000.

McDonnell’s work has yet to produce new contracts, but “we are getting more and more calls from people he met with,” Rodriguez said.

There’s been no backlash over the hiring, he said.

“There are so many people in this area that feel about Bob like I do that I knew it would not hurt me,” Rodriguez said.

The job offered occurred at the home of McDonnell’s sister, Maureen Carney McDonnell.

Although he had other consulting job offers, Bob McDonnell “decided working with Rod would be the best fit for him,” she said. “Rod is a great business leader, Bob is a great businessman himself, and so the two got along.”

McDonnell was sentenced earlier this month and is scheduled to begin his two-year prison term Feb. 9. McDonnell’s wife will be sentenced Feb. 20.
