Ted Cruz, R-Texas, \u201cWould you ever conceive of threatening to shut down the government again?\u201d Cruz replied that Schieffer had his facts wrong:\n\nCruz: I didn't threaten to shut down the government the last time. I don't think we should ever shut down the government. I repeatedly voted to fund the federal government.\n\nSchieffer: Senator, if you didn't threaten the shut down the government, who was it that did? ...\n\nCruz: It was Harry Reid and President Obama. \u2026 The reason we had a shutdown\u2014Look, the Democrats were very candid. I know they told you, they said, \u201cWe think the shutdown benefits us politically.\u201d Right now the Democrats are telling you that they want another shutdown, because they think it benefits them politically. Why is it hard to understand that they forced the shutdown, when they think it benefits them politically?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a rational argument. The politicians who saw the shutdown as politically advantageous were the ones who caused it. So says Ted Cruz.\n\nBut what was Cruz saying during the shutdown? Here\u2019s what he told Republican senators on Oct. 9, 2013, according to David Drucker\u2019s astute reporting in the Washington Examiner:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz during a closed-door lunch on Wednesday argued to his Republican colleagues that the campaign he led to defund Obamacare has bolstered the GOP\u2019s political position in dealing with the government shutdown.\n\nRepublicans who attended the weekly lunch hosted by Senate conservatives confirmed that Cruz presented a poll that the Texan paid for. Cruz\u2019 pollster, Chris Perkins, was there for a portion of the discussion to help walk members through the poll and discuss the party's messaging strategy.\n\nDrucker\u2019s report illustrates the truth about the shutdown: Politicians on both sides\u2014Obama, Reid, and dozens of Tea Party Republicans in the House and Senate, led by Cruz\u2014thought the fiscal standoff over Obamacare would benefit their party. That\u2019s why the standoff happened.\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\nWhen Cruz advises you to blame the politicians who thought they would benefit, that\u2019s generally sound advice. What he neglects to mention is that he was among them. In fact, he was the leader on the Republican side. As Charles Krauthammer patiently explained at the time, Cruz was disastrously wrong about the political fallout.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "Ted Cruz shutdown, Ted Cruz government shutdown, Ted Cruz debt ceiling, Ted Cruz shutdown poll, Ted Cruz caused shutdown, Ted Cruz blames Obama shutdown", "sailthru.author": "William Saletan", "description": "Yesterday on Face the Nation, Bob Schieffer asked Sen.
