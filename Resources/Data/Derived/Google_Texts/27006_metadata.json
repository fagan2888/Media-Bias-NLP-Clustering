Jerry Brown has a message for Republican governors planning to visit California to woo business from the state: Welcome.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott is the latest governor to say he\u2019s planning a recruiting trip to California. A letter he sent to shipping companies in the state takes shots at Brown\u2019s \u201ctax and spend administration.\u201d\n\nBrown, a Democrat, says the governors should \u201ccome on out and make your case\u201d but California is growing faster than the national average.\n\nBrown cited a recent report from Bloomberg calling California the best state for business. The report looked at the market returns for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that are headquartered in the nation\u2019s five largest states. The California companies returned 134 percent since January 2011.\n\n\u201cRepublicans say don\u2019t deal with climate change, don\u2019t deal with immigrants, don\u2019t do the Affordable Care Act, don\u2019t tax high-income people. California is doing all of that and we\u2019re prospering,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown\u2019s comments about the state\u2019s economy came during a news conference he called Friday after visiting with senior White House officials. This is not the first time he\u2019s been confronted with a Republican governor barnstorming California and badmouthing the state\u2019s business climate. In 2013, Texas Gov. Rick Perry bragged about how Austin was poised to become the next Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThat fellow from Texas who is running for president and some of these other people, come on out and make your case,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWhile many companies in California such as Apple and Google are helping to drive the state\u2019s economy forward, it\u2019s not without problems and many people are struggling. The U.S. Census Bureau has pegged the state\u2019s poverty rate 23.4 percent, the highest in the nation.\n\nBrown said he was using the trip to Washington to meet with officials about climate change, water and health care. He also defended President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, calling them within the law and trying to help hard-working people.\n\nObama\u2019s administration is trying to spare from deportation millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally. California is one of 14 states plus the District of Columbia that has filed a brief in support of lifting an injunction intended to stall Obama\u2019s actions.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
