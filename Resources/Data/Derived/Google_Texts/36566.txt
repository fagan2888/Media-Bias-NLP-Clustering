AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — The Detroit Pistons say they have hired Stan Van Gundy as their coach and president of basketball operations.

The team will introduce Van Gundy at a news conference Thursday.

Owner Tom Gores said Wednesday that Van Gundy is a proven winner and a teacher who can help shape the franchise. Van Gundy says he’s honored to help Gores build the Pistons into a team that competes for championships.

Van Gundy is 371-208 in seven-plus seasons as a coach with Miami and Orlando. He reached the NBA Finals in 2009 with the Magic.

Detroit went 29-53 last season, missing the playoffs for a fifth straight year. That was the end of Joe Dumars’ tenure as team president. Coach Maurice Cheeks was fired in February.
