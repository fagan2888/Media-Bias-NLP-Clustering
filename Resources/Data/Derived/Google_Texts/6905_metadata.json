Plymouth Rock is located in what would later become known as Massachusetts, and a group of citizens there are now seeking to remove \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nOn Sept. 4, the Massachusetts Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on whether the daily recitation of the pledge in school violates students\u2019 rights due to the inclusion of those two words, according to Religion News Service.\n\nAlthough the controversy centers on the words, \u201cunder God,\u201d plaintiffs in Doe v. Action-Boxborough Regional School District are departing from the usual First Amendment religious violation claim, alleging instead that compulsory recitation violates the state\u2019s equal protection laws. That is the same theory used to successfully argue for same-sex marriage.\n\nThe plaintiffs, an anonymous atheist couple, are represented by the American Humanist Association. According to the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom:\n\nOn October 21, 2011, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty filed a request to intervene in the case on behalf of students who want to continue saying the Pledge of Allegiance, their parents, and the Knights of Columbus. The Becket Fund entered the case to defend the Pledge from yet another constitutional challenge to the words \u201cunder God\u201d. * * * On June 8, 2012, a Massachusetts state court upheld the Pledge as constitutional. The case is now before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. The court has scheduled oral argument for September 4, 2013.\n\nThe change in tactics, if successful, could lead to similar lawsuits filed in other state courts, experts predict.\n\n\u201cYou would then see a rash of state court lawsuits challenging the pledge all over the country,\u201d said Eric Rassbach, deputy general counsel for the Becket Fund. \u201cA win for us would completely avoid that unnecessary harm. And it would affirm that it is not discriminatory to have the words \u2018under God\u2019 in the pledge.\n\n\u201cThere is disagreement, but there is not discrimination,\u201d Rassbach added. \u201cThat is what is at the heart of this \u2014 disagreement about what the government should do.\u201d\n\nDecades ago, the late comedian Red Skelton made a remarkable recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and no one has topped it since. If you\u2019re surprised about his deletion of the words, \u201cunder God,\u201d continue watching until the end \u2014 it\u2019ll all make sense.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The pilgrims first set foot in the New World on Plymouth Rock in search of religious freedom.
