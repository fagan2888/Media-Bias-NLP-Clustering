Obama quipped after the midterms that he didn\u2019t have a bucket list, but he has something that rhymed with bucket list. Immigration executive action, bucket it.\n\nThe President made a joke about being a secret Muslim. Obama made a joke about his looks, \u201cI look so old, John Boehner\u2019s has already invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral.\u201d The president said that his legacy is beginning to take shape. He said today, thanks to Obamacare you no longer have to worry about losing your health insurance if you lose your job. You\u2019re welcome Senate Democrats.\u201d\n\nObama leveled Dick Cheney, \u201cA few weeks ago Dick Cheney said he thinks I am the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe President next took out Mike Huckabee for saying that Americans shouldn\u2019t join the military until Obama leaves office, \u201cMike Huckabee recently said people should join our military until a true conservative is elected president. Think about that. It was so outrageous that forty-seven Ayatollahs wrote us a letter trying to explain how our system works.\u201d\n\nObama took out Michele Bachmann for her prediction that he would bring about the end of days, \u201cNow, that\u2019s a legacy. Lincoln, Washington, they didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama made a Hillary Clinton joke. I have one friend just a few weeks ago she was making millions of dollars a year, and she is now living out of a van in Iowa.\u201d\n\nObama took a jab at the media, including CNN. The President drew groans for a joke about MSNBC\u2019s record low ratings.\n\nPresident Obama pounced on Jeb Bush for identifying himself as Hispanic, \u201cLook, I understand. It\u2019s an innocent mistake. It reminds of when I identified myself as an American in 1961.\u201d\n\nNone of the jokes were hurtful or malicious, but President Obama definitely brought the funny to the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. His other jokes included takedowns to Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum.\n\nObama took out the Koch brothers and compared Rubio, Cruz, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker to The Bachelor. Obama took out the Kochs and said it was insulting to the candidates that the Koch brothers have to spend a billion dollars to get voters to like them.\n\nThe highlight of the event came at the end when Keegan-Michael Key came out to act as Obama\u2019s anger translator Luther.\n\nThis was one of the best sets of jokes from Obama at the WHCD during his presidency. It was great fun and a must watch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama came out swinging and pulled no punches while taking out Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, and devoted an entire segment to the Koch Brothers during his White House Correspondents' Dinner remarks.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama came out swinging and pulled no punches while taking out Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, and devoted an entire segment to the Koch Brothers during his White House Correspondents' Dinner remarks.", "title": "Obama Takes Down Dick Cheney and The Koch Brothers At White House Correspondents' Dinner", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/25/183992.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/obama-whcs.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-25T23:41:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,best obama jokes white house correspondents dinner,obama jokes white house correspondents dinner,obama white house correspondents dinner,President Obama,white house correspondents dinner,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-04-25T22:48:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-25T23:41:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "best obama jokes white house correspondents dinner, obama jokes white house correspondents dinner, obama white house correspondents dinner, President Obama, white house correspondents dinner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde116\"", "article_summary": "President Obama came out swinging and pulled no punches while taking out Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, and devoted an entire segment to the Koch Brothers during his White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner remarks.\nObama took out the Koch brothers and compared Rubio, Cruz, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker to The Bachelor.\nPresident Obama pounced on Jeb Bush for identifying himself as Hispanic, \u201cLook, I understand.\nIt reminds of when I identified myself as an American in 1961.\u201dNone of the jokes were hurtful or malicious, but President Obama definitely brought the funny to the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\nObama took out the Kochs and said it was insulting to the candidates that the Koch brothers have to spend a billion dollars to get voters to like them."}
