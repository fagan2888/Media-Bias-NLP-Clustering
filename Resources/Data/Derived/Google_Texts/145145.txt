BANGI: Malaysia's medical costs are the cheapest worldwide, thanks to the Government's continuous efforts to formulate policies for the benefit of the people.

Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak (pic) said these policies were proof of the Government's commitment to reduce the financial burden of the people.

"In Malaysia, one can see a doctor at government hospitals or clinics for just RM1, and with RM5 or US$1.50, you can see a specialist.

"I can say this is the cheapest in the world," he said, adding that even US President Barack Obama could not carry out such a policy.

"Obamacare cannot compete with Malaysia Care," he told the audience at the opening ceremony of a roundtable discussion to brainstorm ways of coping with the cost of living in the country, organised by he Malaysian Young Thinkers Association, at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia here Saturday.

Najib also said public universities, which were largely subsidised by the Government, had cultivated many talents regardless of their financial background.

"We want to make sure that financial barriers are not a hindrance to quality and higher education access," he said.

The discussion was attended by some 30 young Malaysians from various professions, including doctors, teachers, engineers, fishermen and cabbies.

Twenty-four resolutions, including the setting up of a mall for young entrepreneurs, were submitted to Najib for consideration.
