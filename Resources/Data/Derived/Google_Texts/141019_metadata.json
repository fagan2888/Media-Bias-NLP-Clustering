That\u2019s the next step for him. He showed up really well last night, so we will give him opportunities. I\u2019m not necessarily committing to anything, but I think the way Tommy performed last night, he gets a shot.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies thought they struck gold with Adam Ottavino as their closer early in the season before he underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery. Then John Axford stepped into the role and performed well until faltering over the last month.\n\nKahnel, 0-0 with a 2.60 ERA in 27 \u2154 innings, said he approaches his job the same way, no matter if it\u2019s the seventh inning or the ninth.\n\n\u201cI try not to let anything affect how I pitch,\u201d Kahnle said. \u201cI just go out and attack hitters.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tommy Kahnle is Rockies\u2019 new closer, at least for the time being", "title": "Tommy Kahnle is Rockies\u2019 new closer, at least for the time being", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/tommy-kahnle-is-rockies-new-closer-at-least-for-the-time-being/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_035219_tommy-kahnle.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_035219_tommy-kahnle.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T15:50:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:12:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Effective enough for right-hander Tommy Kahnle to land the job as the Rockies\u2019 closer, at least for the time being.\n\u201cBut I have been wanting to see Tommy in that ninth inning.\nI\u2019m not necessarily committing to anything, but I think the way Tommy performed last night, he gets a shot.\u201dThe Rockies thought they struck gold with Adam Ottavino as their closer early in the season before he underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery.\n\u201cOver the last week or so, the plan was to mix and match in that ninth inning and play matchups \u2014 who\u2019s the freshest, all of those things are a factor.\n\u201cI try not to let anything affect how I pitch,\u201d Kahnle said."}
