But four important pocket-book issues got an airing:\n\nSocial Security\n\nFox News moderator Chris Wallace got Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee to go head-to-head on entitlement programs\u2014that is, Social Security and Medicare.\n\nChris Christie claimed the current system will either \u201cbankrupt our country or lead to massive tax increases\u201d in the long run, and advocated for a shift towards one that benefits only those who actually need it. Christie\u2019s 12-point plan on entitlement, unveiled back in April, includes a proposal to shift back the Social Security retirement age by 2 years\u2014from 67 to 69\u2014over the next 25 years. It also calls for the Medicare eligibility age to be raised from 65 to 67, and for reduced Social Security benefits for Americans making over $80,000 a year in other income. Christie also wants to eliminate these benefits altogether for anyone making over $200,000.\n\nHuckabee attacked Christie\u2019s proposal. \u201cLets all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security\u201460 million,\u201d he said. \u201cA third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security.\u201d Huckabee has said in the past that cutting benefits now would be breaking a promise to the American people who have been forced to pay Social Security taxes throughout their careers. He insisted all our current system needs is some funding, and that a national retail sales tax\u2014an idea branded as the \u201cFairTax\u201d\u2014could add to Social Security\u2019s funding by bringing in more taxpayers, including the \u201cillegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers\u2014all the people that are freeloading off the system now.\u201d The sales tax was one of two unusual, far-reaching tax proposals discussed Thursday night.\n\nTaxes\n\nHuckabee\u2019s tax plan would eliminate the income tax altogether, instead instituting a single national retail sales tax on all goods and services. Huckabee\u2019s idea that the tax would capture the income of people in the underground economy, such as drug dealers and prostitutes, comes from the fact that they\u2019d pay a sales tax whenever they purchased goods. (However, if they are not paying income taxes now, they might also under the new system collect their earnings without charging a sales tax.)\n\nHuckabee also noted another group that does not currently pay taxes into Social Security. \u201cMost of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and capital gains,\u201d he said. A flat sales tax would capture a share of any income they spent. However, it could lower the effective tax rate of wealthy people who are able to save much of their income.\n\nNeurosurgeon Ben Carson outlined a proposal for a flat taxation system he said would be similar to the Biblical practice of tithing, saying, \u201cI think God is a pretty fair guy.\u201d Just as many Christians set aside a flat 10% of their income for giving, Carson wants a flat tax across the board, with everyone paying the same rate. \u201cYou make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way,\u201d said Carson. \u201cAnd you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes.\u201d\n\nCarson called his proposal a \u201cproportional tax.\u201d A proportional tax is different from our current system, which charges higher rates to higher earners. Proportional taxes can impose a heavier effective burden on lower earners, since high earners tend to have more money left over after paying for necessities.\n\nStoking economic growth\n\nThere was much talk of job creation: Christie spoke about creating 192,000 private sector jobs in New Jersey in the past five-and-a-half years, then John Kasich touted his addition of 350,000 jobs in Ohio in the past three-and-a-half. Scott Walker had to defend an earlier growth promise: Wisconsin only gained half the 250,000 jobs in his first term that he promised during his campaign to govern the state.\n\nJeb Bush was thrust into the center of the discussion when moderator Chris Wallace asked him about his claim that he would deliver 4% economic growth and 19 million jobs if he manages to be elected for two terms in office. Bush accused the political left of being complacent with \u201c2% growth,\u201d saying that the United States has achieved 4% growth 27 times since World War II.\n\nIn terms of action to get there, Bush said the U.S. will need to \u201cfix a convoluted tax code,\u201d axe regulations, and repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He also said he would \u201cembrace the energy revolution.\u201d\n\nFact-checkers at the New York Times say that only four presidential terms since WWII have included 4% growth, and that while Democrats including Hillary Clinton have also expressed a need for exceeding 2%, a sustained 4% rate is unlikely unless our economy can either gain workers or increase efficiency.\n\nHealth care reform\n\nTwo candidates were questioned by moderators for championing policies traditionally associated with Democrats.\n\nMegyn Kelly grilled Ohio governor John Kasich on his expansion of Medicaid in Ohio to prisoners and the mentally ill, a move she said is \u201calready over budget\u2026by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.\u201d\n\nKasich shot back by comparing himself to Ronald Reagan, who expanded Medicaid multiple times, and defended the expansion as a move to get Ohio\u2019s working poor and its prison populations \u201con their feet.\u201d\n\nModerator Brett Baier noted that in the past, businessman Donald Trump openly favored a single-payer healthcare system, a universal system in which the government funds all care via taxes. Trump didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cIt works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland,\u201d he said. And he said universal health care might have worked in the U.S. \u201cin a different age.\u201d\n\nTrump said he now supports a private healthcare system. Echoing John McCain\u2019s 2008 health-plan proposals, Trump wants to see America \u201cget rid of the artificial lines around every state,\u201d allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. As for \u201cpeople who can\u2019t take care of themselves,\u201d Trump suggested he\u2019ll have \u201ca different system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What the Presidential hopefuls say they'd do about Social Security, taxes, health care and economic growth", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "These important pocket-book issues got an airing.", "title": "4 Times the Republican Candidates Talked About Your Money", "url": "http://time.com/money/3988865/republican-debate-financial-money/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/150807_em_debate.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/150807_em_debate.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "These important pocket-book issues got an airing.", "site": "MONEY", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "4 Times the Republican Candidates Talked About Your Money"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", 2016 election, 2016 republicans, debate, donald trump, dr. benjamin s. carson, jeb bush, mike huckabee, politics", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "GOP, Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Republican, Debate, 2016, Mike Huckabee, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Presidential, taxes, FairTax, Taxes, tithing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9458\"", "article_summary": "TaxesHuckabee\u2019s tax plan would eliminate the income tax altogether, instead instituting a single national retail sales tax on all goods and services.\nHuckabee also noted another group that does not currently pay taxes into Social Security.\nChristie\u2019s 12-point plan on entitlement, unveiled back in April, includes a proposal to shift back the Social Security retirement age by 2 years\u2014from 67 to 69\u2014over the next 25 years.\nBut four important pocket-book issues got an airing:Social SecurityFox News moderator Chris Wallace got Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee to go head-to-head on entitlement programs\u2014that is, Social Security and Medicare.\n(However, if they are not paying income taxes now, they might also under the new system collect their earnings without charging a sales tax.)"}
