The number of absent fathers has increased over the end of the 20th century, and according to one branch of evolutionary theory called Life History Theory, it might be because animals face a trade-off between mating and parenting. Existing research suggests that men with more testosterone might lean towards mating and away from parenting. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looks at men\u2019s mating efforts, nurturing parental behavior, and relevant brain activity related to\u2026testicle size. And there\u2019s a correlation, because, of course there is.\n\nMethodology: Researchers measured testes volume, controlling for differences caused by height, and surveyed fathers\u2019 desire to be caregivers as well as the actual level of care they gave their children. They showed dads pictures of their kids and measured whether the region of the brain associated with nurturing sparkled with love for their loin-product. Following in the footsteps of the previous research, they also measured dads' testosterone levels.\n\nResults: As suspected, the more testosterone dads had raging through their systems, the less involved they were with their kids. But the researchers also found that testicle size was correlated with caregiving. Big-balled dads were less into it, small-balled dads I guess have more stamina for patty-cake and, you know, shaping kids into good humans.\n\nImplications: \u201cTesticular volume is most directly related to spermatogenesis and sperm quality,\u201d the study reads, and so perhaps men with larger testes are prone to choose mating over parenting, evolutionarily speaking, so they can sow their wild oats, be fruitful and multiply, etc. However, the researchers note that it\u2019s unclear if testicle size is a \u201ccause or a consequence of male life-history strategies.\u201d\n\nThe study, Testicular volume is inversely correlated with nurturing-related brain activity in human fathers, appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Testicle size is inversely correlated with parental nurturing.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Testicle size is inversely correlated with parental nurturing.", "title": "Study: Small-Balled Dads Are the Best Dads", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/3875245604_32d81b0f1d_o/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/study-small-balled-dads-are-the-best-dads/279536/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc12\"", "article_summary": "Following in the footsteps of the previous research, they also measured dads' testosterone levels.\nResults: As suspected, the more testosterone dads had raging through their systems, the less involved they were with their kids.\nBig-balled dads were less into it, small-balled dads I guess have more stamina for patty-cake and, you know, shaping kids into good humans.\nThey showed dads pictures of their kids and measured whether the region of the brain associated with nurturing sparkled with love for their loin-product.\nMethodology: Researchers measured testes volume, controlling for differences caused by height, and surveyed fathers\u2019 desire to be caregivers as well as the actual level of care they gave their children."}
