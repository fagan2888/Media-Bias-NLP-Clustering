The clinic will be for anyone, regardless of insurance \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 and it all will be free.\n\nThe clinic will be the second held by MOM-n-PA, (Mission Of Mercy in Pennsylvania) a nonprofit dedicated to providing dental care to anyone who needs it. More than 1,000 volunteers, including 160 dentists, as well as hygienists, translators, navigators and office workers, will staff the clinic from 5 a.m.-5 p.m. both days.\n\nAccording to Charles Incalcaterra, a dentist from Bethlehem, organizers are expecting to treat 2,000 people over the two days.\n\n\"There's a pretty big need here in the [Lehigh] Valley,\" he said, noting that the region's hospital dental clinics are \"overwhelmed.\"\n\nThe program is first-come, first-served, and if it's anything like the initial MOM-n-PA mission held last year in Philadelphia, people looking for care should arrive early. Patients began lining up for care the evening before the program began, said Gary Davis, chairman of MOM-n-PA.\n\n\"I arrived at 4 a.m. last year and there were well over 200 people in line,\" he said.\n\nRegistration is not required. Caregivers will provide blood pressure screenings and refer patients for further evaluation if they appear to be at risk for diabetes or other chronic conditions, Incalcaterra said. Dentists and other caregivers then will be able to provide a number of basic services \u2014 cleanings, fillings, extractions and minor repairs to dentures. Some root canals will be done, but considering the time and demand, they only can be done on front or side teeth, and the tooth must be restorable, Incalcaterra said.\n\nPatients with multiple needs will have the most pressing issues addressed, Incalcaterra said. They are permitted to rejoin the line for a second session, he said.\n\nPediatric specialists also will be on hand, mostly on Saturday, Incalcaterra noted.\n\nSeveral dentists have agreed to be available for follow-up care for those who need it, he added.\n\nThe organization has raised $150,000 from insurance companies, foundations, dentists, the Pennsylvania Dental Association and private individuals to stage the clinic. Davis said with that support, patients will receive an aggregate of around $1 million in free care.\n\nAccording to Davis, 40 percent of the patients at the Philadelphia program had dental insurance, but still needed the clinic because of limitations in their coverage. Medicaid, for instance, has dollar limitations on coverage and provides little or no coverage for crowns and orthodontic work.\n\nMedicaid reimbursements also don't cover the cost of services, so many dentists do not accept Medicaid patients. By volunteering with MOM-n-PA, dentists have a way of giving back to the underserved community, Incalcaterra said.\n\nLack of insurance is a bigger problem. Only about 62 percent of American adults have dental coverage, a rate that hasn't changed since the mid-90's, a report last year from the U.S. Governmental Accountability Office said. Many individuals with dental pain go years without seeing a dentist, he said, adding that some Philadelphia patients shed tears of joy after getting long-standing problems addressed.\n\n\"It really is sad,\" Davis said. \"One of the goals of MOM-n-PA is to show legislators and community leaders about the need. I think they don't realize how much people need dental care.\"\n\nChildren's health insurance programs do cover dental work, so the state of their dental health is not as poor as many adults'. Dental care is not one of the essential health benefits required in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe said he hopes lines of people waiting for care will \"open the eyes\" of state legislators.\n\n\"We don't think MOM-n-PA is a solution to the need,\" Davis said, \"but it can help.\"\n\ntim.darragh@mcall.com\n\nTwitter: @timdarragh\n\n610 778-2259", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Free dental clinic coming to Allentown", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "The Allentown Fairgrounds will be buzzing Friday and Saturday \u2014 but it won't be just farmers market shoppers looking for bargains.", "title": "Free dental clinic coming to Allentown", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/health/mc-allentown-free-dental-clinic-20140909-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54101686/turbine/mc-allentown-free-dental-clinic-20140909", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Free, dental, clinic, Allentown", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/81321296", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-09", "Description": "Free dental clinic in Allentown to aid 1,000 patients", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Free, dental, clinic, Allentown"}, "article_summary": "The buzz also will come from up to 100 dental drills as part of a huge dental clinic that will set up at the Agri-Plex.\nDental care is not one of the essential health benefits required in the Affordable Care Act.\nI think they don't realize how much people need dental care.\"\nThe clinic will be the second held by MOM-n-PA, (Mission Of Mercy in Pennsylvania) a nonprofit dedicated to providing dental care to anyone who needs it.\nThe clinic will be for anyone, regardless of insurance \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 and it all will be free."}
