But for a small company with low profit margins, it\u2019s a scalping, it\u2019s not a haircut.\u201d\n\nEckberg said if the medical devices tax stands, it\u2019s likely to stifle innovation and result in job losses.\n\n\u201cFor the industry it takes a $50,000 a year job off the balance sheet, that pays $33,000 in benefits, every 20 minutes. It\u2019s an amazing drain on an otherwise innovative industry and it\u2019s just going to chase companies off-shore because they need to do something about lowering taxes.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the tax say industry estimates of costs and job losses simply don\u2019t add up.\n\nThey argue that the influx of around 30 million new health care consumers expected when the Affordable Care Act kicks in will help to offset the tax for companies in the medical device sector.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the stalemate in Congress enters its second week, the Affordable Care Act remains at the center of the budget debate.
