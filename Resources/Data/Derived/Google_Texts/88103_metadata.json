Police said the jilted girlfriend put rat poison pellets in her ex's coffee container, tucked a severed electric blanket cord under a mattress, and peed in his mouthwash.\n\nPollard's former lover, Joshua Brewster, had her evicted Dec. 1. When he allowed her to return to collect some of her things three days later, she reportedly threatened to burn the house down with him in it.\n\nPollard was discovered cutting the blanket cord by Brewster's friend, who'd gone to the house at his request to see if she'd come back.\n\nThe woman reportedly told the friend, \"Payback's a bitch\" and described her plans, the Journal Star reports. The friend called police, who discovered the rat poison.\n\nPolice said Pollard told them she was \"hurt and angry\" over her abrupt eviction. Pollard's Facebook status updates allude to her being \"happy\" and \"in a relationship\" shortly before the events unfolded.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Marriages That End In Murder Marriages That End In Murder\n\n1 of 17 Marcus Crosby The Will County, Ill.
