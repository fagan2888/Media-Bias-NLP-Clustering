Fortunately, Seattle offers discounts to poor households.\n\nRelated Content\n\nUnfortunately, few are enrolled. Although Seattle\u2019s Utilities Discount Program (UDP) could halve the utility bills of roughly 72,000 eligible Seattle households, only about 17,600 households are enrolled in the program.\n\nThe Human Services Department handles enrollment and outreach for UDP on behalf of City Light and Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), at an annual cost of $1.5 million. Human Services managed to bump up the number of net new enrollments by a record-breaking 3,000 last year\u2014but the lion\u2019s share of that bump happened in early 2014. Since then, enrollment growth has slowed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d says city councilmember Sally Bagshaw. \u201cThey got 3,000 [households] enrolled in a year.\u201d Then her voice drops to a whisper: \u201cBut Metro just got 9,000 [people] done in 90 days.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s referring to Metro\u2019s infant ORCA-LIFT program, which made national news as a bold experiment in economic progressivism and has become the UDP\u2019s embarrassingly successful younger sibling. LIFT discounts ORCA transit passes by more than 50 percent for poor riders. Metro contracts with Seattle/King County Public Health for outreach and enrollment, just as SPU and City Light contract promotion of UDP to Human Services.\n\nBut where UDP\u2019s enrollments fluttered, LIFT\u2019s skyrocketed\u2014it\u2019s on track to recruit 40,000 people by the end of its first year. To be fair, UDP enrollments are counted by household, LIFT\u2019s by individual, so a side-by-side comparison of enrollment numbers is unfair to UDP. It also means that UDP can\u2019t easily piggyback on other programs\u2014such as LIFT\u2014that have already verified individuals\u2019 income.\n\nStill, this enrollment disparity has raised eyebrows at City Hall. At a recent meeting of the Public Utilities and Neighborhoods Committee, which Bagshaw chairs, she was briefed by city employees on UDP\u2019s lackluster enrollment\u2014and then by county employees on LIFT\u2019s stellar enrollment. It was, by all appearances, a frustrating experience for the District 7 incumbent.\n\n\u201cWe are paying, between Seattle City Light and Public Utilities, $1.5 million\u201d per year to Human Services to do outreach and enrollment for UDP, she told county representatives during their briefing. \u201cSo you can understand that I\u2019m over here having a small fit, thinking that you are doing what you\u2019re doing at almost a quarter of the cost.\u201d\n\nBagshaw has been steadfastly Seattle Polite in discussing the programs. \u201cThis is not my effort to try to cast aspersions on any department or on the mayor,\u201d who oversees Human Services, says Bagshaw. \u201cI really want us to be working together, and I can\u2019t say that loudly enough.\u201d\n\nBut you know what they say about protesting too much. At that same committee meeting in May, she told Metro representative Matt Hansen that \u201cI\u2019m looking at the comparison of the city of Seattle slide, a historical enrollment of clients in the [UDP] program which is just about flatlined, until 2015 where we\u2019ve added some, and what you\u2019ve done in 90 days. I mean, I hate to compare, but this is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nWhy has UDP enrollment been so disappointing? In the middle of a city housing crisis, you\u2019d think there would be a line out the door for any government programs offering subsidies.\n\nOne answer: Enrollment is an onerous crawl through paperwork hell. \u201cAnalysis and client feedback,\u201d an internal review of the program published in May notes, \u201cindicated a lack of available access and information regarding UDP, and frustration with the length of time from application to confirmation of enrollment because of the paperwork required to validate eligibility.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, ORCA LIFT applicantscan walk into a Public Health office (or an office of one of their eight agency partners), slap down their ID, and quickly get enrolled in a variety of programs. LIFT has been able to do this by using data collected during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. If someone has already qualified for a program with comparable income requirements (say, Medicaid), then Public Health employees can deduce that their income also qualifies them for LIFT.\n\nDaphne Pie, who coordinates LIFT outreach at Public Health, says that using pre-existing databases to verify income eligibility allows Public Health to \u201csay to the client, let us look at the existing systems first . . . and look at your eligibility there, so that we reduce that paperwork nightmare that clients have to go through in order to get eligible for a program.\u201d\n\nHuman Services has begun to streamline paperwork requirements for UDP, looking for common-sense ways to make it easier for Seattleites to get into UDP and stay there. Human Services managed to hang onto 346 enrolled households by no longer making people reapply to UDP when they move to a new address, and they say they\u2019ve managed to get the time from an application\u2019s submission and its first look-over by staff down to less than three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe want to find ways to [coordinate with Human Services] even more,\u201d says Public Health\u2019s Jerry DeGrieck. \u201cI think that the city of Seattle and HSD and Public Health are very motivated to make improvements at UDP . . . as soon as possible\u201d\u2014potentially within months.\n\nJason Johnson, the Human Services deputy director in charge of UDP, agrees, saying that he expects an agreement with Public Health by the end of the year that will grant Human Services access to the same state and federal databases that Public Health has used to quickly verify LIFT income eligibility.\n\nBut for Bagshaw, the changes so far are just nibbling at the edge of a problem that deserves voracious mastication. The application form \u201creally set me back on my heels,\u201d she told the city briefers. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at this,\u201d she told them before reading the form\u2019s list of 10 different income categories. \u201cIf I had to provide that stuff myself, with files and Xerox copy machines available, I\u2019m not sure how I would do that, let alone if you\u2019re under stress of income deprivation.\u201d\n\ncjaywork@seattleweekly.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rent is too damn high\u2014and so are the utility bills.
