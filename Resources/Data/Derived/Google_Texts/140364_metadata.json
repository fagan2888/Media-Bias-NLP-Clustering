Canary, an epidemiologist at the disease control agency.\n\nMedicaid programs in most states \u201cration this lifesaving treatment\u201d in ways that conflict with guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, she said.\n\nThe guidelines recommend treatment \u201cfor all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection,\u201d except those who have a life expectancy of less than a year because of some other disease.\n\nDr. David L. Thomas, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and co-chairman of the panel that wrote the guidelines, said the new drugs worked far better, and were much less toxic, than older treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing,\u201d said Dr. Thomas, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on hepatitis. \u201cWe can cure most patients with as few as 84 pills.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe treatments are eventually cost-effective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to treat patients than to wait for them to develop cirrhosis and complications and then get a liver transplant.\u201d\n\nIf left untreated, infections can lead to liver cancer and liver failure. The new drugs block the replication of the hepatitis C virus. About one-fourth of people with H.I.V. are also infected with the hepatitis C virus.\n\nSovaldi and Harvoni are made by Gilead Sciences. Other new hepatitis drugs include Viekira Pak, made by AbbVie, and Daklinza, which is made by Bristol-Myers Squibb and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on July 24.\n\nIn meetings over the last nine months, advocates for hepatitis patients have urged the Obama administration to issue guidance to state Medicaid directors on appropriate coverage of the new drugs, but federal officials have been noncommittal.\n\n\u201cStates have flexibility to determine the best way to manage their Medicaid benefits, including drug benefits,\u201d said J. Timothy Gronniger, a senior official at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who worked at the White House until recently.\n\nOther administration officials said they wanted to ensure access to the new hepatitis drugs, but also had to consider the financial effect on the federal government, which pays at least half of the cost for Medicaid patients in every state.\n\nMoreover, federal officials said they were being cautious because any directives for Medicaid coverage of hepatitis drugs could set a precedent affecting new drugs for other conditions, and many expensive drugs are in the pipeline.\n\nThe administration of President Bill Clinton took a more aggressive stance in 1996, when states were limiting access to a new generation of potent but costly drugs for H.I.V. and AIDS.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Clinton administration told state Medicaid directors that they had to cover the new AIDS drugs, known as protease inhibitors. States could impose certain limits on use of the drugs, but the limits must not \u201cexcessively or unreasonably restrict coverage of effective treatments\u201d for people with H.I.V. and AIDS, the Clinton administration said.\n\nCindy Mann, the top federal Medicaid official from 2009 to January of this year, said there was \u201can increasing consensus among health care professionals\u201d about the circumstances in which the new hepatitis drugs should be provided. But this consensus is not reflected in state policies, she said, so the federal government \u201cneeds to provide some guidance and clarification\u201d to states.\n\nRyan D. Clary, the executive director of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, a coalition of 250 organizations working to end the epidemic, said: \u201cThe promise of the Affordable Care Act was to provide access to quality, affordable care regardless of a person\u2019s pre-existing conditions. People are now mandated to have insurance. But many people with hepatitis C are finding themselves unable to obtain curative treatment for the condition that kept them from getting insurance before the health care law.\u201d\n\nOne reason, Mr. Clary said, is the stigma attached to hepatitis C. Many people are infected through blood on needles or other equipment used to inject unlawful drugs.\n\n\u201cIf there were a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s or breast cancer that cost $40,000 or $50,000, we would not be having this conversation,\u201d Mr. Clary said.\n\nPrice negotiations are secret. But Matt D. Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, which represents state officials, said he understood that the new hepatitis drugs could sometimes be obtained for $50,000 a person, down from $84,000 last year.\n\n\u201cPrices have come down,\u201d Mr. Salo said. \u201cCompetition is working, but not enough to make a significant difference. Prices are nowhere near where they need to be to make hepatitis C treatment available to all who need it.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccriteria for prior approval\u201d of the new hepatitis drugs in Illinois illustrate the policies that have been adopted, in some form, by many state Medicaid programs. In Illinois, a patient must have advanced liver disease, as indicated by a biopsy or other test showing extensive damage to the liver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, the rules say that a patient must not have received a diagnosis or treatment for alcohol or drug abuse in the last 12 months, and that the patient must have a urine test to check for recent drug use.\n\nJohn K. Hoffman, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Health Care and Family Services, said the criteria were \u201cbased on commonly accepted medical practices.\u201d\n\nBut Robert L. Greenwald, an expert on health law and policy at Harvard Law School, said: \u201cThese criteria defy clinical guidelines and best practices. Rather than recommending the exclusion of people who inject drugs, we should encourage earlier treatment as a way to prevent transmission of the virus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150825114515, "twitter": {"description": "Advocates for patients have urged federal officials to guide state Medicaid directors on appropriate coverage of the drugs, including one that can cost up to $1,000 a pill.", "title": "White House Is Pressed to Help Widen Access to Hepatitis C Drugs via Medicaid", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/us/wider-reach-is-sought-for-new-hepatitis-c-treatments.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003867636"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/25/us/26MEDICAIDWEB1/26MEDICAIDWEB1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/us/wider-reach-is-sought-for-new-hepatitis-c-treatments.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003867636", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/us/wider-reach-is-sought-for-new-hepatitis-c-treatments.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "White House Is Pressed to Help Widen Access to Hepatitis C Drugs via Medicaid", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 25, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Hepatitis,Medicaid,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Health Insurance and Managed Care,States (US)", "news_keywords": "Hepatitis,Medicaid", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/25/us/26MEDICAIDWEB1/26MEDICAIDWEB1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Advocates for patients have urged federal officials to guide state Medicaid directors on appropriate coverage of the drugs, including one that can cost up to $1,000 a pill.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/25/us/26MEDICAIDWEB1/26MEDICAIDWEB1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Advocates for patients have urged federal officials to guide state Medicaid directors on appropriate coverage of the drugs, including one that can cost up to $1,000 a pill.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 25, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-08-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "States (US)", "published": "2015-08-25", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "26medicaid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150826131131, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/us/wider-reach-is-sought-for-new-hepatitis-c-treatments.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/25/us/26MEDICAIDWEB1/26MEDICAIDWEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Advocates for patients have urged federal officials to guide state Medicaid directors on appropriate coverage of the drugs, including one that can cost up to $1,000 a pill.", "title": "White House Is Pressed to Help Widen Access to Hepatitis C Drugs via Medicaid"}, "pdate": 20150825, "des": "States (US)", "articleid": 100000003867636, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "White House Is Pressed to Help Widen Access to Hepatitis C Drugs via Medicaid", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The new drugs block the replication of the hepatitis C virus.\nare also infected with the hepatitis C virus.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Clinton administration told state Medicaid directors that they had to cover the new AIDS drugs, known as protease inhibitors.\nMoreover, federal officials said they were being cautious because any directives for Medicaid coverage of hepatitis drugs could set a precedent affecting new drugs for other conditions, and many expensive drugs are in the pipeline.\nThe guidelines recommend treatment \u201cfor all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection,\u201d except those who have a life expectancy of less than a year because of some other disease."}
