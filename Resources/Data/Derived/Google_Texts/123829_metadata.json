That is a significant step forward,\u201d Coredini told The Associated Press.\n\nAlthough there are still particulars to hammer out, Coredini said the development is a big deal for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n\n\u201cThe LGBT community faces many challenges more significant than this parade, but the parade has been historically been the symbol of those challenges that we face,\u201d Coredini said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 years since openly LGBT people have been able to march in this parade.\u201d\n\nThe Boston parade, sponsored by the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, has had a long and torturous history on the question of whether gay groups can march.\n\nState courts forced the sponsors to allow the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston to march in the parade in 1992 and 1993. In 1994, the sponsors canceled the parade rather than allow the group to participate.\n\nIn 1995, the sponsors made participation by invitation only and said the parade would commemorate the role of traditional families in Irish history and protest the earlier court rulings. But several months later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Massachusetts courts had previously violated the parade sponsors\u2019 First Amendment rights when they forced them to allow the gay group to participate.\n\nWalsh, the son of Irish immigrants, had threatened to boycott the city\u2019s annual parade unless gay groups are allowed to march. He told The Boston Globe the agreement is a breakthrough.\n\nA spokeswoman for Walsh said the mayor and U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch met parade organizers on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt was a very positive meeting, and they remain optimistic that a solution can be reached that will work for all parties involved,\u201d spokeswoman Kate Norton said.\n\nA message left for a parade organizer was not immediately returned.\n\nWalsh\u2019s predecessor, Mayor Tom Menino, boycotted the parade after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe parade has traditionally honored Irish-Americans and also celebrates \u201cEvacuation Day,\u201d George Washington\u2019s victory that forced British troops out of Boston in 1776.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boston could ease 20-year ban on gays in St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade", "title": "Boston could ease 20-year ban on gays in St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/02/boston-could-ease-20-year-ban-on-gays-in-st-patricks-day-parade/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140302__p_b7a5291e-2040-43b2-b96a-010ba60f35e1lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140302__p_b7a5291e-2040-43b2-b96a-010ba60f35e1lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-02T07:25:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:38:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb36\"", "article_summary": "Walsh\u2019s predecessor, Mayor Tom Menino, boycotted the parade after the Supreme Court ruling.\nThe parade has traditionally honored Irish-Americans and also celebrates \u201cEvacuation Day,\u201d George Washington\u2019s victory that forced British troops out of Boston in 1776.\nWalsh, the son of Irish immigrants, had threatened to boycott the city\u2019s annual parade unless gay groups are allowed to march.\nState courts forced the sponsors to allow the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston to march in the parade in 1992 and 1993.\nIn 1994, the sponsors canceled the parade rather than allow the group to participate."}
