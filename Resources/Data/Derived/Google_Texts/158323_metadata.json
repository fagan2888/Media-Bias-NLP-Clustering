Though he felt fine and was an otherwise healthy 18-year-old, an MRI would soon reveal he had a slow-growing tumor pressed against his brainstem and wrapped around several major arteries. Later that year, Sommer travelled to Pittsburgh to undergo a complicated 10-hour operation to remove the growth. Only after the surgery did his doctor make an official diagnosis: chordoma, a malignant form of bone cancer so rare it occurs in just one out of every one million people. Removing a chordoma in its entirety\u2014if possible\u2014does not guarantee it will not grow back. Chordoma arises when a leftover cell from the notochord, the embryonic precursor to the spinal cord, changes over time and becomes cancerous. Chordomas typically develop at the base of the skull, the lower spine, or the tailbone and often invade the surrounding bone and tissue. For the 300 people in the United States diagnosed with the disease each year, surgery to remove the chordoma, often in combination with radiation, is the best shot at treating the disease. Unfortunately, the proximity of most chordomas to vital structures in the nervous system makes them difficult to remove without serious, sometimes debilitating, complications.\n\nMaking matters worse, removing a chordoma in its entirety\u2014if possible\u2014does not guarantee it will not grow back. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for a patient to have five, 10, sometimes 15 surgeries to keep removing the tumor until that\u2019s no longer possible,\u201d said Sommer. He spent much of his recovery reading as much as he could about the disease, and was devastated to learn that that if his chordoma were to recur, another risky surgery and radiation was his only option. \u201cThere were no drugs approved to treat the disease and, at the time, none in clinical trials either,\u201d he said. With such limited treatment options, most chordoma patients are expected to live an average of seven years after their diagnoses\u2014a statistic he \"refused to accept.\" By the time Sommer returned to school in the fall, he was determined to do whatever he could to try to change his prognosis. For him, that meant working in the country\u2019s only federally-funded laboratory focused on chordoma\u2014serendipitously located at Duke, in a building Sommer had biked past countless times on his way to class. \u201cI had no experience, but a lot of motivation,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cFrom the beginning, he was shooting really high: a cure for chordoma, and he was approaching that in a very rational, tactical way,\u201d said Michael Kelley, an oncologist and associate professor of medicine at Duke, whose lab was leading the effort. Under Kelley\u2019s mentorship, Sommer joined the lab\u2019s ongoing efforts to identify genes linked to chordoma. Soon after, Sommer was running his own experiments. He began taking fewer engineering classes and more microbiology classes to better understand the disease. Most chordomas were thrown away after surgery, so tissue samples needed to understand the fundamental biology of the disease were scarce. But despite his deepening understanding of chordoma and the progress they were making\u2014Kelley\u2019s lab was pivotal in elucidating the role of a gene called brachyury in the development of chordoma\u2014Sommer was disheartened by the challenges in studying such a rare disease in a research environment in which progress moved at a glacial pace.\n\n\u201cI could see we would only get so far without hitting a wall,\u201d he said. Money was a major issue. Government agencies tend to fund research that will have the biggest effect across the population, so common cancers\u2014breast cancer, prostate cancer, and so on\u2014usually receive the most funding. Similarly, pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms tend to fund research only if it is likely to be profitable. Insufficient funding was only one of many challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have materials needed to study the disease,\u201d Sommer says. Most chordomas were thrown away after surgery, so tissue samples needed to understand the fundamental biology of the disease were scarce. Cell lines\u2014models of disease made by taking cells from a patient\u2019s tumor and growing it in a plastic dish\u2014were just as hard to come by. Both were needed to understand chordoma at its most basic level and to identify drugs most likely to be effective in patients. \u201cMany researchers\u2019 attempts to study the disease were hamstrung, while others were deterred from undertaking chordoma research projects altogether,\u201d he said. Perhaps most problematic, though, was the lack of a community and the basic infrastructure to support collaboration. \u201cIn science, one discovery informs the next. That was not happening in chordoma.\u201d Disseminating research findings or sharing research materials, if it happened at all, could take years. So isolated were researchers, adds Kelley, that it was not immediately clear who was working on the disease to begin with. \u201cHow can you collaborate when you don\u2019t even know who potential collaborators are?\u201d he said. An Atlantic Special Report\n\nRead More Once Sommer realized that the biggest barriers were not necessarily scientific problems, but human ones, he became even more determined to solve them. In 2007, he and his mother co-founded the Chordoma Foundation, where he remains executive director today. To date, the Durham, North Carolina-based foundation has raised almost $5 million to jumpstart research in the disease and encourage widespread collaboration. One of the first orders of business was building a network of researchers and establishing a conference where researchers worldwide could exchange data. Now a bi-annual event, the conference has helped build a community of more than 200 researchers in labs worldwide.\n\nThe foundation also worked to license cell lines from the institutions in which they were created and distribute them freely to chordoma researchers. The availability of such critical research resources made it possible to generate the convincing pre-clinical data that lay the groundwork for clinical trials. These advances alone, Kelley says, have \u201ccreated a very active chordoma research community\u201d and \u201cdramatically accelerated the pace of research\u201d in the disease. Forbes magazines agrees; it recently named Sommer to its \"30 Under 30\" list of innovators who are transforming science and health for the second year in a row. Having created the necessary infrastructure, the foundation is now supporting research aimed at developing new chordoma treatments. One such project screened more than 2,800 FDA-approved drugs in chordoma cell lines to determine whether any could be repurposed to treat the disease. Another invites researchers or companies to submit investigational drugs to be screened to determine their potential in treating chordoma. \u201cThere might already be drugs out there that are effective in treating chordoma, and we\u2019re determined to find out,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019ll have to develop them ourselves, which of course requires a major investment and much more time.\u201d So far, more than 40 drugs screened have shown activity in chordoma; the most promising are now undergoing additional testing. More recently, the foundation partnered with the National Cancer Institute to expand its ongoing clinical trial of a new treatment called GI-6301, which targets a wayward protein found in most chordomas, as well as in breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers. The foundation helped complete enrollment in the trial\u2014one of the most time-consuming and costly phases of clinical research\u2014within days of announcing it to the foundation\u2019s active social media community. \"On most days I'm able to put my own disease out of my head. But there's always a what if?\" \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a small disease like chordoma, you can\u2019t wait for researchers and companies to come to you,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cWe had to make a case that we could help gain eventual FDA approval by efficiently recruiting for a trial.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "How one college student turned his struggle with chordoma into a successful research foundation", "author": "Aimee Swartz", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "How one college student turned his struggle with chordoma into a successful research foundation", "title": "The Man Working to Cure His Own Cancer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/10818457336_b477bfe089_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/the-man-fighting-to-cure-his-own-cancer/284091/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "In 2007, he and his mother co-founded the Chordoma Foundation, where he remains executive director today.\nThese advances alone, Kelley says, have \u201ccreated a very active chordoma research community\u201d and \u201cdramatically accelerated the pace of research\u201d in the disease.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have materials needed to study the disease,\u201d Sommer says.\nBoth were needed to understand chordoma at its most basic level and to identify drugs most likely to be effective in patients.\n\u201cMany researchers\u2019 attempts to study the disease were hamstrung, while others were deterred from undertaking chordoma research projects altogether,\u201d he said."}
