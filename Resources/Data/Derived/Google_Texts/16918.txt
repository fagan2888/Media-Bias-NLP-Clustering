Looks like it will be a Ruby Tuesday.

The billboards that popped up Friday -- with a "Tuesday" and a tongue -- suggest that the Rolling Stones North American tour finally will be revealed on Tuesday.

The Stones are expected to confirm a June 20 date at Heinz Field.

The billboards first turned up two weeks ago, hinting at a March 19 announcement, but that was postponed.

Tuesday is also the announce date for the Three Rivers Arts Festival music lineup. You can hear those names revealed every hour on WYEP 91.3 FM starting at 9 a.m.

And on Wednesday, a historic concert announcement is coming from the Andy Warhol Museum that should excite fans from the old-school.
