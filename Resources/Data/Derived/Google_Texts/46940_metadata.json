He also sold or closed about half of the company's hospitals and used the proceeds to invest in the remaining facilities and to pay a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nDespite the closures, Tenet also expanded during its turnaround. From 2006 to 2012, the health system aggressively increased the number of its outpatient facilities even as it avoided major hospital acquisitions. Then in late 2013, Tenet acquired Nashville, Tennessee-based Vanguard Health Systems, a move that Fetter credits primarily for Tenet's 50 percent spike in revenue in 2014.\n\nTenet also helped boost its profits by embracing the Affordable Care Act through its \"Path to Health\" program, which enrolls eligible patients in ACA-related coverage plans, according to FierceHealthFinance. Overall, the Morning News states, the company went from a $134 million loss in 2003 to $12 million in net income in 2014.\n\nTenet's recent moves on the merger and acquisition front have not been without controversy, however. Last December, the company scrapped a deal to buy five Connecticut hospitals after Tenet clashed with state regulators regarding conditions they placed on converting the not-for-profit facilities to for-profit ones.\n\nPatient safety issues also have come back to haunt the chain, as a recent CNN investigation into infant heart surgery deaths at Tenet-owned St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, led the federal government to eye the hospital and St. Mary's to discontinue the procedure.\n\nBut despite the challenges his health system still faces, Fetter says he's refocused Tenet to prioritize providing quality care at competitive prices, according to the Morning News. \"There are some major trends developing in healthcare, and we have positioned Tenet in front of those trends,\" he said.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nACA helps fatten for-profit hospitals' bottom lines\n\nTenet decides against buying Connecticut hospitals\n\nHow does Tenet keep doing it?\n\nACHE 2015: 4 habits of highly effective healthcare leaders\n\n5 steps healthcare leaders can take to nurture innovation", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tenet Healthcare Corp.\u00a0has come a long way since it faced a series of crises in 2003, and it owes much of its success to its CEO, Trevor Fetter, the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Tenet Healthcare Corp.\u00a0has come a long way since it faced a series of crises in 2003, and it owes much of its success to its CEO, Trevor Fetter, the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0reports.", "title": "How CEO Trevor Fetter brought Tenet back from the brink", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-ceo-trevor-fetter-brought-tenet-back-brink/2015-06-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Compliance Issues,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Outpatient Care,Population Health Management,Tenet Healthcare Corp.,Trevor Fetter", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd10f\"", "article_summary": "Tenet Healthcare Corp. has come a long way since it faced a series of crises in 2003, and it owes much of its success to its CEO, Trevor Fetter, the Dallas Morning News reports.\nThen in late 2013, Tenet acquired Nashville, Tennessee-based Vanguard Health Systems, a move that Fetter credits primarily for Tenet's 50 percent spike in revenue in 2014.\nTo right the Dallas-based health system's ship, Fetter first hired a compliance officer who reported ethics and quality issues directly to its board of directors, according to the article.\nBut despite the challenges his health system still faces, Fetter says he's refocused Tenet to prioritize providing quality care at competitive prices, according to the Morning News.\n\"There are some major trends developing in healthcare, and we have positioned Tenet in front of those trends,\" he said."}
