Dividends not only pad your wallet and help buoy your portfolio during downturns, but they also act as beacons to draw your attention to well-run companies. Think about it: A company wouldn't share its profits with investors if its long-term outlook wasn't rock-solid.\n\nOne dividend stock to rule them all\n\nHowever, more than 3,000 stocks have paid a dividend over the past year, making the process of choosing one quite difficult -- unless, of course, we're talking about the one dividend stock to rule them all: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).\n\nWhy is Johnson & Johnson a no-brainer dividend stock to consider buying? To start with, how about its practically unparalleled healthcare diversification!\n\nJohnson & Johnson is comprised of three operating segments -- consumer healthcare products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals -- with each serving a critical role.\n\nJ&J's formula for success\n\nThe consumer healthcare products segment, which includes brand-name juggernauts such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, Listerine, and Aveeno, offers the slowest growth rate, but delivers the most predictable and consistent cash flow. Because a number of J&J's consumer products offer inelastic demand, meaning they'll be bought at a fairly stable rate regardless of whether we're in a growing or slowing economy, the company is able to raise its prices to at least match the current rate of inflation.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's medical device segment has recently been growing at a slower pace than its historical average, largely because competition around the globe has increased. But, you won't find any worries here because J&J's globally diversified device business should benefit from an aging population domestically and abroad. This is a long-tail growth opportunity that shareholders can wait to see develop thanks to J&J's consumer products cash flow and its rapidly growing pharmaceutical segment.\n\nFinally, J&J relies on its brand-name drug development pipeline to pump up its margins and drive its growth. Between 2009 and 2014, J&J brought 14 new molecular entities to market, seven of which became blockbusters (by definition, drugs that generate $1 billion or more in sales annually). Looking ahead, Johnson & Johnson anticipates filing for FDA approval for 10 expected blockbusters by the end of the decade. Its latest approved drug, Darzalex, a third-line treatment for multiple myeloma, could be the first of many new blockbusters.\n\nPutting J&J over the top\n\nBut, there's more than just J&J's balanced business model that makes it the premier dividend stock to own.\n\nFor instance, J&J is also looking to grow by acquisition. The company is sporting $37 billion in cash and $17 billion in net cash, giving it remarkable flexibility to find the right deals. Purchasing another company is a quick way J&J can boost its profitability and deliver for its shareholders.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also one of just three U.S. companies that still bears a AAA-credit rating, along with software giant Microsoft and oil juggernaut ExxonMobil. This rating, handed out by Standard & Poor's, implies that J&J's outlook and cash flow leave little doubt that it'll be able to meet its debt obligations.\n\nAnd, of course, we have Johnson & Johnson's practically unparalleled streak of raising its dividend for 53 straight years. Only 10 of the more than 7,000 publicly listed companies boast longer streaks of raising their payouts. Johnson & Johnson's current dividend yield of 3% handily trumps the average 2% yield of the S&P 500, and its expected payout ratio of 49% in 2015 suggests its streak isn't in danger of ending anytime soon.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is truly the dividend stock to rule them all!", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "08:39", "date": "2015-11-27T13:39:00Z", "description": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the greatest dividend stock of them all?", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the greatest dividend stock of them all?", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the greatest dividend stock of them all?", "title": "1 Dividend Stock to Rule Them All --  The Motley Fool"}, "tags": "Yahoo", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the greatest dividend stock of them all?", "title": "1 Dividend Stock to Rule Them All --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/27/1-dividend-stock-to-rule-them-all.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F186806%2F17283526416_a5327bfdd5_z.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "article_type": "article", "headline": "1 Dividend Stock to Rule Them All", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "ab2ac870-933a-11e5-b332-0050569d4be0", "pitch": 2518, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2015 11 27", "tickers": "JNJ,MSFT,XOM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One dividend stock to rule them allHowever, more than 3,000 stocks have paid a dividend over the past year, making the process of choosing one quite difficult -- unless, of course, we're talking about the one dividend stock to rule them all: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).\nJohnson & Johnson is truly the dividend stock to rule them all!\nLooking ahead, Johnson & Johnson anticipates filing for FDA approval for 10 expected blockbusters by the end of the decade.\nWhy is Johnson & Johnson a no-brainer dividend stock to consider buying?\nJohnson & Johnson is also one of just three U.S. companies that still bears a AAA-credit rating, along with software giant Microsoft and oil juggernaut ExxonMobil."}
