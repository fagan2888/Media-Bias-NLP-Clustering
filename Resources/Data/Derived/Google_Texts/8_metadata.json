The country is currently embroiled in a high stakes legal battle with Phillips Morris, the world\u2019s largest cigarette manufacturer. The industry giant, whose annual profits outsize Uruguay\u2019s entire yearly GDP, is suing the government of Uruguay over a 2008 law that requires cigarette packs to be 80 percent covered by health warnings.\n\nUntil Phillips Morris decided to punish Uruguay for its anti-smoking campaign, the country\u2019s efforts to combat tobacco use looked like a success story. In 2006, Uruguay became the first Latin American nation to ban smoking in enclosed public places. The 2008 law mandating that cigarette packs feature graphic warnings depicting the consequences of smoking seemed like the logical next step in the process.\n\n\u201cStudies show that we really improved our cardiovascular health between 2006 to 2010,\u201d cardiologist Eduardo Bianco, the president of the Tobacco Epidemic Research Center in Montevideo, explained in an interview with ThinkProgress. Stunningly, tobacco consumption among Uruguayans age 15 to 24 dropped 44 percent in just three years.\n\nBut Phillips Morris argues the regulations went too far. The company claims the stricter measures against smoking violate a 1988 bilateral investment treaty between Uruguay and Switzerland, where Phillips Morris is headquartered, and infringe on their intellectual property rights by forcing them to change packaging designs. Now, Phillips Morris has slammed Uruguay with a $25 million lawsuit.\n\nThat could deliver a huge setback to public health in the South American nation of 3.5 million, which Bianco told Think Progress has historically featured the highest proportion of smokers in all of Latin America. \u201cUruguay has the highest rates of death from lung cancer among men in Latin America. Ninety percent of these deaths are related to tobacco,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost of tobacco-related health care spending per year is at least triple the amount of revenue the government receives from tobacco. It is affecting our health, our economy and our development.\u201d\n\nLegal fees for the country\u2019s defense are already expected to come at a hefty price of $8 million. According to Bianco, this is part of Phillip Morris\u2019 plan to intimidate developing nations \u2014 where four out of every five smokers lives \u2014 and prevent them from enacting anti-smoking policies. He pointed to recent cases in which the governments of Australia and Norway ended up in court over their smoking prevention policies. The difference, according to Bianco, is that Uruguay doesn\u2019t have the funds to spare \u2014 and Phillips Morris knows that. He said that if Phillips Morris wins, they will be able to \u201csend a message to mainly developing countries that if you make tobacco prevention measures, you will be treated the same way.\u201d\n\nUruguay\u2019s top political leaders have made upholding their tobacco laws a top concern. In a May, Uruguay\u2019s current President Jos\u00e9 Mujica told President Obama, \u201cWe are in an arduous fight, very arduous, and we must fight against very strong interests\u2026 Nobody must be distracted in this fight for life, because out of all values, the most important one is life itself.\u201d Frontrunner candidate for the upcoming elections and former president Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, who is also a cancer expert, said Phillips Morris was attempting to use Uruguay as a \u201ctest case\u201d to scare off other nations from acting to improve public health.\n\nReferring to the upcoming 2015 Uruguayan presidential election, Bianco noted, \u201cIn order to avoid this kind of legal treatment, the new government could think about modifying our tobacco control procedures,\u201d which would prohibit further progress. A decision on the case is expected in 2015.\n\nWill Freeman is an intern with Think Progress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Uruguay is trying to uphold its anti-smoking policies in the face of a high stakes lawsuit -- and Big Tobacco is hoping the country won't be able to afford to keep fighting.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Uruguay is trying to uphold its anti-smoking policies in the face of a high stakes lawsuit -- and Big Tobacco is hoping the country won't be able to afford to keep fighting.", "title": "How Big Tobacco Went To War With A Tiny Country", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/21/3462255/latin-american-country-big-tobacco/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP9144811112641.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP9144811112641-321x214.jpg", "title": "How Big Tobacco Went To War With A Tiny Country", "description": "Uruguay is trying to uphold its anti-smoking policies in the face of a high stakes lawsuit -- and Big Tobacco is hoping the country won't be able to afford to keep fighting.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThinkProgress"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP9144811112641.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP9144811112641.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-21T16:11:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7bf0\"", "article_summary": "The country is currently embroiled in a high stakes legal battle with Phillips Morris, the world\u2019s largest cigarette manufacturer.\nHealth How Big Tobacco Went To War With A Tiny Country CREDIT: AP ImagesThe small South American nation of Uruguay might be forced to pay a heavy price for trying to curb smoking and avert a public health disaster.\nUntil Phillips Morris decided to punish Uruguay for its anti-smoking campaign, the country\u2019s efforts to combat tobacco use looked like a success story.\nBut Phillips Morris argues the regulations went too far.\nThe difference, according to Bianco, is that Uruguay doesn\u2019t have the funds to spare \u2014 and Phillips Morris knows that."}
