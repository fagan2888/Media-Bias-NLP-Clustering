(Photo: David Simpson)\n\nAn all-star musical lineup of Wayne Toups, Keith Frank and Cupid will entertain for Lafayette\u2019s Road to Recovery Concert at 6:30 p.m. Aug. 14 at Parc International in downtown Lafayette. Country singer Blaine Roy and accordion ace Joel Martin are also part of the lineup.\n\nAdmission is $10, with proceeds going to a mental health fund that concert organizers have set up with the Community Foundation of Acadiana. CFA serves as a resource that connects donors to organizations in need.\n\nChris Foreman, a concert co-organizer with Patrick Mould, said the event was sparked by musicians wanting to help victims of the July 23 shooting at the Grand Theatre. But since a number of memorials and vigils have accomplished that goal, Foreman said the event\u2019s focus was shifted to mental health awareness.\n\nOfficials said the theater shooter, who killed two and injured nine, had a history of mental issues. Last year, the National Alliance for Mental Illness reported that between 2009 and 2012, states cut $4.35 billion from their mental health budgets, raising concerns about public safety and more.\n\nForeman said the CFA will distribute funds raised to NAMI, a grassroots organization with volunteers across the country. The Extra Mile and other local groups working in mental health awareness may also receive help.\n\n\u201cWhen you ask the social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists about where\u2019s the best place for this money to go to, the first, the first word out of their mouth is NAMI,\u201d said Foreman. \u201cThe Community Foundation also has a list of foundations that would also fit the criteria for mental health awareness.\n\n\u201cThe money we would raise would be added to the funds already in that category. When those people need money, they apply for a grant and the Community Foundation decides if they issue a grant.\n\n\u201cThe money will go to the Community Foundation first, so it will go where it needs to go eventually.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, this is more about the big picture and long term,\u201d said Mould. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about what the long-term ramifications of this shooting are going to be on the people of Lafayette. That\u2019s why we wanted to bring some awareness for the forefront.\u201d\n\nBeer, soft drinks, water, hamburgers and hot dogs will be sold at the concerts. Ice chests are not allowed.\n\nFor more information, visit the Lafayette\u2019s Road to Recovery Concert page on Facebook.\n\nWant to go?\n\nLafayette\u2019s Road to Recovery Concert\n\n6:30 p.m. Aug. 14\n\nParc International, downtown Lafayette\n\nAdmission: $10\n\nInformation.
