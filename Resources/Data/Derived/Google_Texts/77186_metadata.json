Yet, when a U.S. drone strike aimed at al-Qaeda leaders had inadvertently killed two hostages held by the terror group \u2013 including an American -- he largely took a pass.\n\nAppearing on CNN Sunday morning, McCain conceded that there had been a mistake but largely defended the program of drone strikes begun under President George W.

I don\u2019t have any doubt about that.\u201d\n\nEven Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), who last year mounted a filibuster on the Senate floor attacking the use of U.S. drone attacks against American citizens who travel to the Middle East to fight on behalf of terrorist organizations, was silent this week after the news of another U.S. attack likely killed two such citizens in January.\n\nRelated: How Hillary\u2019s Email Mess Revived Benghazi\n\nWhile there appears to be little interest in curtailing the drone program, McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, did say that he expects Congress to take a fresh look at whether the program, currently under the supervision of the Central Intelligence Agency, would be more properly housed within the Department of Defense.\n\n\u201cThere is an internal struggle going on within the administration and within the Congress as to whether it should be an armed services operation\u2026or should it be done by the CIA,\u201d McCain said. \u201cObviously, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I have some bias, but it seems to me that as much as we [can we should] give responsibility and authority over to the Department of Defense\u2026because that\u2019s really not the job of the intelligence committee.\u201d\n\nMcCain said that congressional hearings on the subject were likely in the near future.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Members of the U.S. national security community may be loath to advertise the remote control killing of U.S. adversaries, but they are also in no hurry to call off the drones.", "title": "Hostage Deaths Aside, Support for Drone Strikes Still Strong in DC", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Hostage-Deaths-Aside-Support-Drone-Strikes-Still-Strong-DC", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-10-18T233231Z_1_CBRE99H1TEE00_RTROPTP_2_USA-PAKISTAN-DRONES.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Hostage-Deaths-Aside-Support-Drone-Strikes-Still-Strong-DC", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-10-18T233231Z_1_CBRE99H1TEE00_RTROPTP_2_USA-PAKISTAN-DRONES.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Members of the U.S. national security community may be loath to advertise the remote control killing of U.S. adversaries, but they are also in no hurry to call off the drones.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: \u2018JihadiCare\u2019 \u2013 ISIS Launches Its Own, Weird \u2018National Health Service\u2019\u201cThere was an obvious breakdown in intelligence,\u201d McCain said.\nSenator John McCain (R-AZ) rarely misses an opportunity to criticize the Obama administration when it comes to foreign policy issues, especially those that relate to national security.\nAppearing on CNN Sunday morning, McCain conceded that there had been a mistake but largely defended the program of drone strikes begun under President George W.
