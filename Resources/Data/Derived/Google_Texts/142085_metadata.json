But the warnings were either not communicated across the agency or not acted upon, the report says.\n\nOne lower-level agency worker told the IG investigators: \u201c[CMS senior officials] would sit in meetings across from me and not know there is an enormous fire burning behind them.\u201d\n\nJust one month before the Oct. 1, 2013 launch, CMS officials requested a live demonstration of the application process from CGI Federal, one of the main contractors. But the contractor provided only snapshots of the software, rather than an actual demonstration. But, according to the report, the incident didn\u2019t set off alarm bells among CMS leadership.\n\nA CMS technical official told the IG, \u201cYou can\u2019t test drive a Ferrari just by looking at pictures of a Ferrari going fast.\u201d\n\nCMS technical staff also often avoided reporting bad news, the report says.\n\n\u201cCorrespondence indicated that this was driven in large part by the belief that they would be able to succeed in the end, and thus there was little benefit to causing alarm,\u201d the IG report reads.\n\nThe IG says that just days before the launch, CMS officials visited the offices of another contractor, Terremark, after realizing the site\u2019s capacity needed to be doubled.\n\nThere was also a lack of testing to make sure the system worked, the report found. One CMS technical official \u201ccharacterized the launch itself as a test of the system.\u201d\n\nStill, the IG reports that CMS leadership held no formal discussion about delaying the website launch date. CMS officials told the IG they \u201cdid not understand the depth of the technical problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cCMS leadership and staff took little action to respond to warnings, remaining overly optimistic about the launch, and developing few contingency plans,\u201d the IG report states.\n\nAnd when the site did crash upon its debut, efforts to fix the problems went into overdrive. But repair work was hampered by a lack of tools to monitor problems.\n\n\u201cA member of the ad hoc technology team noted that in the absence of comprehensive monitoring tools, \u2018There was no place to look to find out whether the site was up today or not except CNN, which was literally how we found out about problems a good part of the time in the beginning,\u2019\u201d the report states.\n\nAn influx of new staff, including experts from the private sector, helped right the ship and register nearly 5.5 million people by the end of that first year\u2019s enrollment period. A less hierarchical, \u201cbadgeless\u201d work environment contributed to the improvement, the report found.\n\nCMS said in response to the IG report that it has made improvements to how the agency operates. For example, there is now a Marketplace CEO within CMS \u2013 previously, there was no single person with clear leadership over the health insurance exchange.\n\nCMS also ended its contract with CGI and awarded a different type of contract to Accenture, with a structure aimed at rewarding performance.\n\n\u201cThe lessons learned from the initial problems in 2013 and CMS\u2019 subsequent improvements to the website have also been applied throughout the organization in order to improve management with a clear focus on leadership, accountability, and prioritization of deliverables,\u201d CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement.\n\nBut the report found that some problems persisted beyond the first year. CMS\u2019 2014 efforts to fix major problems with the site ultimately delayed work on an automated financial management system. The IG later found that the manual system in place in the interim \u201ccould not confirm the accuracy of payments.\u201d\n\nThe report says that CMS plans to complete the automated payment system this year, which the IG called \u201cthe most significant technical challenge facing CMS.\u201d\n\nThe IG also found that CMS is taking steps to improve employee morale.\n\n\u201cA sense of CMS staff fatigue is unlikely to be abated in the near future with an aggressive schedule for the Federal Marketplace planned through 2016,\u201d the report finds.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "One employee said the federal agency tied to the site ignored the \"enormous fire burning behind them.\"", "description": "One employee said the federal agency tied to the site ignored the \"enormous fire burning behind them.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "One employee said the federal agency tied to the site ignored the \"enormous fire burning behind them.\"", "title": "Agency ignored ObamaCare website warning signs: report", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/270413-watchdog-points-to-healthcaregov-management-failures", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacare101615_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T13:13:41-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-23T13:13-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/270413-watchdog-points-to-healthcaregov-management-failures", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-23T12:14-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "ObamaCare, Affordable Care Act,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-23T12:14:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T13:13:41-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/270413-watchdog-points-to-healthcaregov-management-failures", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "One employee said the federal agency tied to the site ignored the \"enormous fire burning behind them.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Agency ignored ObamaCare website warning signs: report"}, "dcterms.title": "Agency ignored ObamaCare website warning signs: report"}, "article_summary": "A new report dives into the problem-plagued development of the ObamaCare website and finds repeated warning signs that went unheeded before its failed launch.\nCMS said in response to the IG report that it has made improvements to how the agency operates.\nBut, according to the report, the incident didn\u2019t set off alarm bells among CMS leadership.\nThe IG says that just days before the launch, CMS officials visited the offices of another contractor, Terremark, after realizing the site\u2019s capacity needed to be doubled.\nBut the warnings were either not communicated across the agency or not acted upon, the report says."}
