Univ. of Texas at Austin , U.S., 14-981, argued 12/9/15;\n\n, U.S., 14-981, argued 12/9/15; Whether Texas's abortion regulations are unduly burdensome in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt , U.S., No. 15-274, argued 3/2/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1253, 3/3/16);\n\n, U.S., No. 15-274, argued 3/2/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1253, 3/3/16); If Puerto Rico can address its debt crisis or if it must rely on Congress to do so in Puerto Rico v. Franklin Calif. Tax-Free Tr. , U.S., No. 15-233, argued 3/22/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1394, 3/24/16);\n\n, U.S., No. 15-233, argued 3/22/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1394, 3/24/16); Whether the federal government must exempt religious nonprofit organizations from the Affordable Care Act's \u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d in Zubik v. Burwell , U.S., No. 14-1418, argued 3/23/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1394, 3/24/16);\n\n, U.S., No. 14-1418, argued 3/23/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1394, 3/24/16); If President Obama has the authority to defer deportation and allow temporary work authorization for more than four million immigrants who entered the country illegally in United States v. Texas , U.S., No. 15-674, argued 4/18/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1557, 4/21/16); and\n\n, U.S., No. 15-674, argued 4/18/16 (84 U.S.L.W. 1557, 4/21/16); and Whether former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's honest services fraud conviction will stand in McDonnell v. United States, U.S., No. 15-474, argued 4/27/16 (see related story).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable, if you think about it,\u201d Wexler said. The court \u201cis always able to get through everything it needs to get through by the beginning of summer so they can start the next term anew in October (with the occasional exception of a case reset for argument, or something like that),\u201d he said.\n\nExtra Work\n\nThis term that herculean task is complicated by the vacancy left by Scalia.\n\nThe justices will likely have to put in additional work to come up with compromises that avoid 4-4 ties, Wexler said.\n\nOn top of that each justice will probably have to write extra opinions that they had not foreseen, he said.\n\nThat includes not just majority opinions, but possibly separate concurrences and dissents too, Wexler added.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kimberly Strawbridge Robinson in Washington at krobinson@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessie Kokrda Kamens at jkamens@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/life-scotus-arguments-n57982070416/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "This term's oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court wrapped up April...", "title": "Life at SCOTUS After Arguments: Now It Gets Intense"}, "csrf-token": "VR1cCHL1FHpNfMzYDDmnAbHO5FC3mTwexXvwOQIYjCOIZuksSyAJBo-PiutDKDaf_CjvUWjUyGxCmXluNf53yYaNsNida-y-DDUYXleFBJc1:HF3zE-R9gYPyzAuezy7xCXG0OcfKoVVHDfByyX7-mPk8dlFk3fmcuXUqkPRKr_3Umc4k_ddSkkc9UImIuDQprw6_O3XVDy-ONVhPmUQqLDs1", "description": "This term's oral arguments at the U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Opinions Starting to Fly\u201cIn one sense, without oral arguments, the day-to-day life of the Court is quieter,\u201d Shanmugam said.\n14-1418, argued 3/23/16 (84 U.S.L.W.\n15-233, argued 3/22/16 (84 U.S.L.W.\n15-274, argued 3/2/16 (84 U.S.L.W.\n15-674, argued 4/18/16 (84 U.S.L.W."}
