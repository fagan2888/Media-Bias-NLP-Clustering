As a point of comparison, the Kochs spent at least $8.5 million on political campaigns in 2014 alone\u2014to the benefit of Republicans across the country, and the dismay of Democrats.\n\nThe Kochs say they\u2019re concerned about mass incarceration, too many criminal laws, and a system that disproportionately weighs on the poor and minorities. And over the next year, they promise to refocus on criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cWe do believe we can be one of many thought leaders on this issue,\u201d Mark Holden, a senior VP and general counsel at Koch Industries, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe encourage dialogue to find common ground and, as we have for more than a decade, we will continue to collaborate with all people and groups of good faith to bring about positive change in our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of unrest due to police killings in Ferguson and Staten Island, the Kochs also see their work as helping to reduce the tension between law enforcement and citizens in America today. The Koch brothers and their associated organizations envision a holistic approach to reforming the criminal justice system: one that changes that way America treats the accused during the pre-trial process as much as it helps de-stigmatize inmates who have served their sentences.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that by addressing overcriminalization, the relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve will improve,\u201d Holden said. \u201cCriminal justice reform is not a conservative or liberal issue, or a rich or poor issue, although the disadvantaged are the most negatively impacted by the abuses in our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nThrough their foundation and related entities, five Koch staffers work full- or part-time on criminal justice issues. But they could not pledge that the amount spent on criminal justice reform in 2015 would definitely exceed that of previous years. \u201cWe can confirm it will be in the same range as previous years,\u201d a Koch spokesperson said.\n\nBut given the influence the Koch name now has, their emphasis on the issue comes with consequence. It gives cover to Republican politicians and candidates everywhere to pursue criminal justice reform\u2014after all, who could be considered a squishy moderate if they agree with the Kochs, so long vilified by the left? Still, the emphasis on the issue comes with consequence. And it sends a signal to the groups who receive funds from the Kochs that they\u2019re trying to pursue the issue.\n\nFor example, Generation Opportunity, a Koch-affiliated libertarian group that targets young voters, is already collaborating with Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) to produce a documentary on a man unjustly ensnared by mandatory minimums.\n\nAnd reform groups are more than happy to incorporate the Kochs\u2014and their funds\u2014into their issue campaigns. David Koch had been a longtime and annual supporter of FAMM, said group spokesman Mike Riggs: \u201cThey\u2019re super eager.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Koch groups also collaborated with the ACLU on the issue of providing lawyers to those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\nThe Kochs are aware that pursuing criminal justice reform will make them appear less political. After all, striking down mandatory minimums and slamming sentencing disparities has traditionally been a purview of the left.\n\nAnd it could put Koch opponents in an uncomfortable position. A spokesperson for frequent Koch critic Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, didn\u2019t respond to a Daily Beast inquiry about whether he\u2019d be open to work with the Kochs on this issue.\n\nOther longtime critics just aren\u2019t buying it. Tia Lessin, who co-directed the documentary Citizen Koch, which was critical of the brothers\u2019 use of money in politics, dismissed their criminal justice efforts.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the Kochs have deployed a small fortune to attack laws and public policies that protect society\u2019s most vulnerable\u2014the sick, the elderly, the working poor. This is the latest in a PR campaign to re-brand the billionaire extremists as men who care about \u2018the disadvantaged,\u2019\u201d Lessin said.\n\nAnd Robert Greenwald, the filmmaker behind Koch Brothers Exposed, pointed out that Kochs had spent millions and millions on Republican candidates who might oppose criminal justice reform, far more than on the issue of criminal justice reform itself.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the day the Kochs\u2026 instruct their staff to no longer fund candidates who work against improving the safety of Americans,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cThe Kochs\u2019 words about criminal justice cannot be taken seriously until they back up their words with their dollars by ceasing to fund the numerous organizations, think tanks, and elected officials who believe locking up more and more people will make us safer.\u201d\n\nStill, with a Democratic president and a Republican Congress, the matter of criminal justice reform might be one of the few issues of potential collaboration. It\u2019s one where the ACLU and the Heritage Foundation can find common ground, where lefty favorite New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker can work with libertarian Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nWith the partisanship of the 2010 midterms now four years behind us, and just two years left in the Obama presidency; with the country seized by a collective conversation on the dignity of minorities\u2014this just might be a moment when the Kochs\u2019 criminal justice reform efforts take hold.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "timkmak"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Koch Brothers", "publicationDate": 201501131045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Koch brothers are turning their attention and resources to reforming the criminal justice system.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Koch Bros to Bankroll Prison Reform", "tags": "topic:politics,entity:person/koch-brothers", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Koch Bros to Bankroll Prison Reform\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47372297.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-13T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Tim Mak\",\"tags\":[\"politics\",\"koch-brothers\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics, Koch Brothers", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Tim Mak", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-13T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/tim-makhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Koch brothers are turning their attention and resources to reforming the criminal justice system.", "title": "Koch Bros to Bankroll Prison Reform", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1421168916957.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/t/tim-mak", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd72a6\"", "article_summary": "But they could not pledge that the amount spent on criminal justice reform in 2015 would definitely exceed that of previous years.\nAnd over the next year, they promise to refocus on criminal justice reform.\nThe Kochs are aware that pursuing criminal justice reform will make them appear less political.\nAnd Robert Greenwald, the filmmaker behind Koch Brothers Exposed, pointed out that Kochs had spent millions and millions on Republican candidates who might oppose criminal justice reform, far more than on the issue of criminal justice reform itself.\nThe libertarian-leaning billionaires who funded an endless stream of anti-Obamacare ads against Democratic candidates in 2014 are turning their focus to a new mission: galvanizing conservatives to pass meaningful criminal justice reform."}
