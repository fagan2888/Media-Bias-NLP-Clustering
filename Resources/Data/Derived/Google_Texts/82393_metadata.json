It can also cost you a lot of money if you make the incorrect choice.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMillions of Americans will be getting new health insurance next year, prompting many to look for doctors. Choosing any in-network primary care physician is the easy and often common way to do it, but asking questions before making your choice can save you a ton of money as well as improve your level of care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a relative shortage of primary care physicians as a result of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Tom Doerr, an internist in St. Louis and director of innovation research at medical technology company Lumeris www.lumeris.com. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sign up for a primary care physician only to discover the next appointment is six weeks from now.\u201d\n\nFrom making sure the doctor is in-network to seeing if the physician performs certain procedures on their own, here\u2019s a look at five questions that can save you a lot of money.\n\nLoyalty can cost you\n\nLoyalty pays isn\u2019t always the case when it comes to health insurance. Many people are loyal to a particular doctor or specialist and will keep going, even if the caregiver isn\u2019t in the insurance plan\u2019s network. That\u2019s fine if you have excess cash laying around, but for most people being loyal is going to cost them a lot. \u201cTypically out of network charges subject you to your deductible and the average deductible is now $4,000 to $5,000,\u201d says Carrie Mclean, director of customer care at eHealth.com www.ehealthinsurance.com. \u201cYou will have to pay out of pocket for those doctor visits up until you reach the deductible.\u201d According to Mclean if you have a doctor you want to keep seeing make sure he or she accepts your particular plan. It\u2019s not enough to say do you take XYZ insurance. You need to give them the exact name and type of health insurance.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat\u2019s the access like after-hours\n\nAfter-hours access to your doctors isn\u2019t only a convenience it can also save you potentially thousands of dollars if you can avoid a visit to the emergency room or urgent care facility. That\u2019s why experts say it\u2019s important to find out what happens if you need to reach your doctor when the office is closed. According to Doerr, ideally you want to hear the doctor say he or she is reachable via cell phone at any time or at the very least they have an answering service that will call you back. \u201cYou want to be able to get advice about healthcare issues when your office is closed instead of just going to the ER or urgent care center,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go to the ER it\u2019s going to cost more money out of pocket.\u201d\n\nIs this considered preventive care?\n\nWhile this question won\u2019t come up until you are actually seeing the doctor, it\u2019s an important one because the answer could mean the difference between paying nothing and paying a lot. \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, many preventative care services are free if you have health insurance. However, not everything is free,\u201d says Michael Mahoney, senior vice president of consumer market at GoHealth www.gohealth.com. \u201dFor example, your doctor may order tests that are not considered covered preventive services, so you may be required to pay a copayment or bill that will count toward your annual deductible.\u201d\n\nAnother money saving questions to ask your doctor when prescribing treatment is whether the service is optional or highly encouraged. That\u2019s important because it may end up the treatment isn\u2019t necessary and could result in an expensive mistake whether it\u2019s something routine or a major procedure, says Mahoney.\n\nDo you do office procedures or outsource them\n\nYour primary care physicians can\u2019t do it all but if you can avoid going to a specialist for certain producers it can save you money on co-payments and co-insurance. According to Doerr it\u2019s important to know what type of procedures they do themselves and which ones are referred to a specialist before you choose your doctor. It\u2019s particularly important if you need regular treatments. \u201cAn orthopedic surgeon can charge $300 for an injection and I charge around $65,\u201d says Doerr. Asking that question, he says can give you an indicator of the scope of the doctor\u2019s capabilities and also save you money in the long run.\n\nDoes the doctor prescribe only brand name drugs\n\nAnyone who has to take medication on a regular basis knows how expensive it can get, especially if you are paying for brand name drugs. Because of that, experts say it behooves you to find a primary care physician who is willing to provide alternatives to costly medication. \u201cAsking the doctor is there is a generic version can save a lot of money,\u201d says eHealth\u2019s Mclean.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 12:32:36 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article",
