My anxiety immediately kicked into overdrive. It was summer; it was night; and the caller ID read \u201cBig Mike.\u201d These were all signs of the perfect storm. Big Mike\u2014or Elder Michael Cummings\u2014had once been a gang member and drug dealer; he still played multiple roles in Watts but now worked as a combination tow-truck driver, activist, and street interventionist. More than anything, he was a man devoted to keeping the peace in Watts. He responded to any street violence with a bagful of strategies for de-escalating tension and preventing retaliation. I dreaded answering his call, knowing something major\u2014perhaps tragic\u2014had probably occurred.\n\n\u201cDoctorjorjaleap,\u201d he began, running my official title and first and last name all into one word. \u201cYou\u2019re a master social worker.\u201d This was clearly a question disguised as a statement. While I knew a great deal about his life and work, when it came to describing my job, Big Mike was on shaky ground. He was aware that I taught at the University of California at Los Angeles and that my writing had something to do with gangs and public policy, but beyond that he didn\u2019t quite know what I did. Most days, neither did I. Officially, I was a combination researcher-writer-activist. As impressive as this looked on paper, I was less a Renaissance woman than an anthropologist with a perpetual identity crisis. Nevertheless, I possessed the necessary MSW and had been on the faculty of the UCLA Department of Social Welfare for over twenty years, so I could in good faith answer yes.\n\n\u201cOkay, good. We\u2019re starting a fathers\u2019 group at Jordan Downs and we need a master social worker. Can you be our social worker?\u201d I exhaled. Nothing tragic had occurred. Despite the sense of relief, my heart kept pounding. What I was experiencing was pretty much the professional equivalent of bumping into an old boyfriend. Watts\u2014the most crime-ridden community in South Los Angeles\u2014and I had broken up long before, and I had moved on to work with gangs in other settings throughout California. But, deep in my heart, I still carried a torch for three violence-torn public housing projects in a corner of South Los Angeles: Jordan Downs, Nickerson Gardens, and Imperial Courts. In my rush to get back to the streets of Watts, I answered yes with such force and enthusiasm that Big Mike was taken aback.\n\n\u201cI would love to!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, slow down. We\u2019re gonna see if this even happens. Can you be at Jordan Downs next Wednesday night? You, Andre, and me\u2014we\u2019ve gotta have a planning meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. I am excited. And I\u2019m gonna slow down. But you need to tell me what this is about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get a group of men together to meet and talk about fatherhood. We\u2019re gonna try to help them to be good fathers to their children. You know, a lotta these guys have been locked up, so we are gonna help them after they get out of prison or support them if they\u2019re tryin\u2019 to stay out of prison.\u201d\n\nDespite my enthusiasm, I felt wary. Somehow this need for a social worker smacked of institutional accountability\u2014someone, somewhere was trying to cover his ass.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s organizing this, Mike?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of something called Project Fatherhood. Do you know Dr. Hershel Swinger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know Dr. Swinger. I worked with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, I knew you were the right one to ask. Dr. Swinger is helpin\u2019 us to set up Project Fatherhood because he wants us to teach men how to be good fathers.\u201d\n\nWhatever Big Mike might be talking about, if Hershel Swinger was involved, it had something to do with strengthening families\u2014 an approach Swinger and many others believed in passionately. This was not a Trojan horse trotted through the community gates by social conservatives, promoting \u201cfamily values\u201d while sneaking in hopelessly discriminatory legislation. Instead, it was a school of thought that advocated turning traditional ideas about families\u2014particularly poor families\u2014upside down. Rather than searching for dysfunction, mainly among marginalized and impoverished families, this approach identified and built upon the families\u2019 strengths. Instead of wishful thinking, it offered a nuanced view of families bound and gagged by a system that failed to understand the complexities of their lives. Early in my career,\n\nI had quickly learned that every family I encountered\u2014even the most troubled\u2014invariably had positive characteristics somewhere, operating in some ways. None of this knowledge came from published research.\n\nI knew this from my Rolodex of shot-callers, people who would have made great attorneys or finance experts; they were the ones who \u201cprovided\u201d for brothers and sisters and aging grandparents. I had \u201ccase managed\u201d too many drug dealers who multitasked and orchestrated the exchange of cash for product, even as they responded to phone calls from multiple baby mamas. They picked their kids up from school and took them on camping trips, all while they were dealing meth or heroin or marijuana. The picture was complicated. Their lives and their families were complicated.\n\nThis whole notion of \u201cfamily strengths\u201d went against the helping professions\u2019 past conventional wisdom, which had been all about pathology. Traditionally, social workers and therapists were trained to identify problems and develop plans to solve them. I practically had been breastfed this worldview in graduate school, from Daniel Moynihan\u2019s observations on \u201cblack matriarchy\u201d to Oscar Lewis\u2019s analysis of the \u201cculture of poverty.\u201d The focus on deficits reinforced the idea that poor families were dysfunctional, and it mainly implicated families that were African American or Latino. These discussions, both inside and outside of the classroom, contrasted with explorations of other ethnic groups\u2014Japanese, Chinese, or other Asians\u2014whose families were often portrayed as integrated and strong. Of course, the era gave rise to the smug aphorism \u201cfamily is just a synonym for dysfunction,\u201d with its implied message that professionals knew what families needed, and that they were in the best position to correct things. Even as an inexperienced and na\u00efve social worker in the 1970s and 1980s, I was uncomfortable with this approach. The chain of cause and effect didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me; pathology involved multiple factors, including biology, history, and economics, much more than it did problematic families. Despite its shortcomings, the perspective guided most social work interventions and approaches, until the idea of family strengths emerged in the mid-1980s.\n\nChanging the dominant mindset was not easy. Resistance was everywhere, including among thought leaders who emphasized a combination of marriage, chastity, and religion as the best and only answer to the struggles parents and children faced. And then there was the challenge of just how to use hidden talents and strengths to solidify families. All this percolated as I was making changes in my own work, turning from practice and training to research and evaluation. Strangely enough, my new work brought me into direct contact with Dr. Hershel Swinger.\n\nI got to know Swinger when I worked as part of a research team led by Dr. Todd Franke evaluating the effectiveness of the Partnership for Families (PFF), a child-abuse prevention initiative dedicated to strengthening families. Swinger, an African American professor with a PhD in clinical psychology, emerged as a voice for family strengths. He was one of the key designers of the PFF program, sponsored by First Five LA as part of its comprehensive state effort offering programs for children during their first five years of life. Everyone in the Los Angeles social work and human services community knew Dr. Swinger; his work commanded respect. It went beyond examining family strengths to shed light on how children dealt with the trauma they suffered as a result of community and family violence. In particular, Swinger\u2019s work illuminated how children with absentee fathers suffered more anxiety and depression, and experienced higher rates of drug abuse, school dropout, and\u2014the most common item on the urban curriculum vita\u2014involvement with the criminal justice system. What I didn\u2019t know until the call came from Big Mike was that Swinger had been talking about fatherhood long before it became a rallying cry of politicians and policymakers.\n\nIn 1996, Swinger began organizing and implementing Project Fatherhood. The program was structured to reduce child abuse, neglect, and involvement with children\u2019s protective services by supporting and strengthening high-risk, urban fathers. Swinger\u2019s emphasis on the critical role of fathers eventually attracted national attention from both Republicans and Democrats. After the program received a $7.5 million federal grant in 2006 under the Bush administration, Swinger oversaw its replication at fifty agencies throughout Los Angeles County. In 2010, the Obama administration recognized Project Fatherhood as a \u201cmodel program.\u201d\n\nBut I knew very little about this. When I told Big Mike I would show up for the planning meeting at Jordan Downs, I had only a rough sense that I was joining an effort that included work in child abuse prevention but encompassed a great deal more. It was an undertaking that went beyond issues of gangs or violence\u2014right to questions of fatherhood, male identity, and families\u2019 experiences of both pain and loss. I wasn\u2019t thinking too deeply about any of this. All that played in my head was the mantra I want to get back to Jordan Downs. I want to go home to Watts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Watts, I worked with men trying to rebuild their lives while also being there for their kids.
