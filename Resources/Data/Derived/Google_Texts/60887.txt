Sean Hannity devoted an entire segment of his Hannity show last night to questioning whether or not Jimmy Fallon might tilt The Tonight Show to the left. As if Hannity doesn’t stack his own program so far to the right it might topple over one day.

Hannity announced in his introduction for the discussion:

Now that Jimmy Fallon has taken over The Tonight Show, will he treat political guests from both sides of the aisle fairly or will the show now become a safe haven for the left?

As suspicious evidence, Hannity played a clip of Fallon interviewing Michelle Obama about ObamaCare on The Tonight Show last week. Apparently, since Fallon didn’t grill her on “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” or – better yet - Benghazi, that was a sign of unconscionable bias.

Hannity called Fallon's predecessor, Jay Leno, “an equal opportunity joke teller,” adding, “I never sensed any political agenda from him.” Which is Hannity lingo for Leno told enough anti-Democratic jokes to suit him.

Hannity’s guest, Dave Berg, a former Tonight Show producer said he thinks it’s too soon to tell if Fallon, as Hannity put it, “has that same ability.” But, Berg said, Fallon seems to have made a choice to be much less political than Leno overall.

But here’s the thing. I don’t remember any slogan from NBC calling The Tonight Show “fair and balanced” or claiming that The Tonight Show is anything but a variety show with comedy and music. Hannity, on the other hand is a prime time show on a cable news network that does have that slogan.

So which show’s fairness should we really care about?
