Well, not quite. In fact, your food goes through a lot to make it to you, from being treated with antibiotics to getting a chlorine bath and a wax coating. Many of these steps are no big deal (and we want to silence any fears you may have about them), but some are bad for your health and others huge money wasters.\n\nHealth.com: 30 Healthy Foods That Could Wreck Your Diet\n\nProduce gets a wax coating\n\nTo prevent bruising, mold growth, and dehydration in storage, some fruit and veggies (apples, cucumbers) are coated with a drop or two of food-grade wax. Your body doesn't digest them, and there's no reason to avoid eating them, said Luke LaBorde, associate professor of food science at Penn State University. If you want to avoid waxed foods anyway, the FDA doesn't require them to be labeled as such, so look for signs that say they've been coated (a suspicious shine is your first clue). To do so, don't peel your produce\u2014much of the fiber and phytonutrients are located in or just underneath the skin, said Joan Salge Blake, RD, nutrition professor at Boston University and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead, wash with a bit of soap and water.\n\nHealth.com: 26 Quick, Healthy Juice and Smoothie Recipes\n\nSalmon is made pinker\n\nThe salmon you see at the fish counter almost always sports a bright pinkish-orange hue, but in fact, salmon is naturally a greyer shade. The swimmers take on their classic coloring in one of two ways: wild-caught salmon eat krill, while farm-raised salmon are fed pigment pellets. But don't let that stop you from buying farmed fish. Though wild-caught salmon is technically better for you than farmed\u2014it naturally contains half the fat, and is slightly higher in zinc, iron, and potassium\u2014it's three to four times pricier.\n\n\"Whether farm-raised or wild, there are so many benefits of eating salmon, namely its rich source of omega 3 fatty acids that we don't get enough of,\" said Blake. Buy whatever is on sale and aim for two servings of fatty fish a week.\n\nHealth.com: 20 Healthy Salmon Recipes\n\nSome oranges are dyed\n\nBelieve it or not, the dye Citrus Red No. 2 is sprayed on some Florida oranges early in the season to brighten their coloring. These oranges are usually used for juicing, but some end up on grocery store shelves. The dye is FDA-approved and used in small concentrations, but the Center for Science in the Public Interest warns this dye is related to health risks, including cancer, in lab animals. (It's not allowed to be used on California oranges.) Bags of these oranges need to include a label that says color has been added. The dye still isn't meant for eating, so don't make candied orange peel or zest them for cooking.\n\nHealth.com: 12 Foods With More Vitamin C Than Oranges\n\nActually, tons of foods are dyed\n\nMany foods are dyed to appear healthier or more appetizing. Caramel color, for example, is often added to wheat or pumpernickel breads to make them look like they contain more wheat than they do. The same colorant is used in some roast beef deli meats for a beefier look. Meanwhile, yellow dyes are added to pickles so the spears appear more vibrant. They dyes are usually safe to consume, but when you spot them on an ingredients label, take it as a sign that the food may also harbor other ingredients commonly found in highly processed foods, like added sodium and sugar, said New York City registered dietitian Marjorie Nolan Cohn, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nOlive oil may be mixed with a cheaper variety\n\nExtra virgin olive oil has come under fire for not actually being olive oil. Many bottles are mixed with cheaper oils like soybean or canola, according to Consumer Reports, and shipped to the United States where you pay a premium price. In addition to wasting your money, you're also losing out on the heart-health perks of the monounsaturated fats you'd find in pure olive oil, Cohn said.\n\nChicken is given a bath\n\nThe journey a chicken takes from the farm to your kitchen table is not pretty. After slaughter, warm chickens need to be cooled down, so they're placed in a big tank of cold water and a sanitizer, like chlorine, to control harmful bacteria and contamination, explained Don Schaffner, of the department of food science at Rutgers University. The FDA and USDA say this process is safe, Schaffner said, but you can avoid chickens that have been treated this way by choosing air-chilled poultry.\n\nOne not-so-healthy thing some manufacturers do to your chicken: inject saltwater into raw meat to enhance its flavor. Considering most Americans consume far more sodium than they should, you'll want to read nutrition labels carefully\u2014unaltered chicken contains 40 to 70 milligrams of sodium per 4-ounce serving, while injected chickens pack in 300 milligrams or more.\n\n12 Food-Industry Tricks That Undermine Clean Eating originally appeared on Health.com.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/NUTRITION and FITNESS/Nutrition", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 03:19:35 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "The process of getting that apple on your plate sounds simple enough: farmer picks apple, apple gets loaded on a truck and shipped off to the grocery store where it lands in your cart.
