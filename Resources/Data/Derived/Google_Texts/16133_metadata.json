It\u2019s not clear what other information may be accessible.\n\nThe AP report came as President Obama planned to announce new initiative during Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address to protect personal data online against hackers.\n\nThe government said the information being disseminated by HealthCare.gov is being used to analyze and improve the consumer experience, and outside firms are not allowed to use the data for their own interests. Third parties that are able to access the data include Google, Twitter, and many online advertising providers.\n\nThe AP reported that there is no evidence the personal data has been misused, but it raises specific concerns regarding online privacy. Google and other companies tailor ads to users\u2019 interests based on previous internet activity that has been tracked on a computer or mobile device.\n\nAlthough, Obama spokesman Aaron Albright said outside vendors \u201care prohibited from using information from these tools on HealthCare.gov for their companies\u2019 purposes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3582542, "userid": 352440}, "description": "The website, which serves as an online market exchange for health coverage, was sharing some details about its users with third party data...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
