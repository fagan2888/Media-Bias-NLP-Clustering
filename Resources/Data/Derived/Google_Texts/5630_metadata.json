HHS: Obamacare website is safe\n\nAmericans\u2019 personal information is safe on HealthCare.gov, says a senior Obamacare official, seeking to allay public concerns as the days count down to the start of the second open enrollment season on Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no higher priority than protecting consumer information and maintaining trust for the consumers,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, who has been in charge of the health exchanges since late June.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s a point he made more than once during a Wednesday interview with POLITICO, where he discussed behind-the-scenes work to beef up security. Slavitt pointed to cooperation with the Homeland Security Department and outside security certification of the data centers hosting the website as evidence the site is safe.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Top Republicans: Get ready to make deals)\n\nAnd well he might \u2014 in the wake of massive data breaches at Target and other major retailers, Obamacare opponents have been quick to seize on website security concerns as another way of attacking the health care law. Although there\u2019s no evidence that any personal data have been stolen from the site, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other top Republicans have issued dire warnings that it \u201cremains unsecure and millions of people\u2019s sensitive personal information is at risk.\u201d\n\nSecurity concerns aren\u2019t purely a partisan fantasy. Over the summer, unknown attackers hacked into a supposedly isolated test server, infecting it with malware used to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office in September published a report containing no fewer than 22 confidential technical recommendations. A few weeks later, Health and Human Services Department auditors criticized their agency for not properly fixing a handful of server-based critical vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cAnybody who told you a system was foolproof didn\u2019t understand their own system, or didn\u2019t understand the environment they\u2019re living in,\u201d Slavitt said Wednesday. The summer hacking incident was \u201cwhat I think anybody in the private sector would consider to be a very minor and inconsequential penetration,\u201d he added.\n\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)\n\nHealthCare.gov was safe for users last year, and it\u2019ll be safe this year, Slavitt stressed.\n\nLast year there was \u201ca small period of time when a number of consumers who had the same name\u201d were able to see \u201ca very limited amount of data\u201d entered by their name mates, he acknowledged. But Americans\u2019 sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or financial data, never leaked, he said.\n\n\u201cWe all feel like we had a successful first year in terms of protecting consumer information and the security of the site,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s an assessment few Republicans on Capitol Hill would accept, though House committee staff with oversight responsibilities say they are withholding judgment for now.\n\n( WATCH: Election Day 2014 videos)\n\nThese days, the site gets scanned for vulnerabilities and threats three times a day, administration officials say: Once by CMS, once again by HHS, and additionally by the Homeland Security Department\u2019s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center.\n\n\u201cWe are testing this system more than any system I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Nelson, the CMS chief information officer.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "These days, the site gets scanned for vulnerabilities and threats three times a day.", "title": "HHS: Obamacare website is safe", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/obamacare-website-safe-healthcaregov-112638.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/24/141024_obamacare_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Health", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "These days, the site gets scanned for vulnerabilities and threats three times a day.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde88f\"", "article_summary": "HHS: Obamacare website is safeAmericans\u2019 personal information is safe on HealthCare.gov, says a senior Obamacare official, seeking to allay public concerns as the days count down to the start of the second open enrollment season on Nov. 15.\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)HealthCare.gov was safe for users last year, and it\u2019ll be safe this year, Slavitt stressed.\nSlavitt pointed to cooperation with the Homeland Security Department and outside security certification of the data centers hosting the website as evidence the site is safe.\nBut Americans\u2019 sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or financial data, never leaked, he said.\n\u201cWe are testing this system more than any system I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Nelson, the CMS chief information officer."}
