Panama City Beach, FL---The Aquatic Center at Frank Brown Park continued a huge weekend in the pool as the Panama City Swim team is hosting the Nike Paradise Invitational Swim Meet this weekend.

Over 600 swimmers as young as eight to as old as 20 are lining the lanes in PCB, repressing 19 different club teams from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.

The best of the best from the entire Southeast are facing off, including a record 136 PCST participants from all age groups.

"I think anytime you're able to bring in top-notch competition from across the southeast in, it's great for our area, but it's also great for our kids. It exposes them to competition you they don't always get to see, and it's only going to make us better. This is about as many people as we can host here, and, we've been fortunate to have a few right around this size."

For all this talent to be gathered in the Panhandle, only Frank Brown Park has the capabilities to host an event of this magnitude and depth.

"No this is the only facility probably from here to Pensacola that could host anything like this. And to be able to do this outdoors with nice weather makes it that much better for everyone."

The action at Frank Brown Saturday finished up at just at 6:00, but by no means is that an end to excitement. The competition continues Sunday, starting at 8:30 am and going till about 5 PM.
