(Photo: Henrietta Wildsmith, Gannett Louisiana)\n\nEvery now and then someone unexpected drops in to visit Carol and Odell Cason at their shop in Mira off U.S. 71.\n\nThe fabric and carpet store Designs by Carol has its regular shoppers but as much as 30 percent of its business comes from customers who\u2019ve never been inside before. The couple expects Interstate 49 to steal all that away.\n\n\u201cA lot of our business is tourists who stop off 71, and I bet 90 percent of them won\u2019t be stopping anymore,\u201d Odell Cason said. \u201cHere there\u2019s nothing to pull off for. If I\u2019m traveling on the Interstate and I need gas or something to eat, if I can\u2019t see it from the exit I won\u2019t pull off.\u201d\n\nThe Shreveport-to-Texarkana stretch of the cross-state roadway recently opened in full, and while it runs through the Casons\u2019 front yard, I-49 doesn\u2019t feed their business.\n\nHighway 71 used to be the fastest route from north Caddo to Shreveport, two-and-a-half hours\u2019 drive north of Opelousas, but it isn\u2019t any more.\n\nNorth and south of St. Landry Parish, changes to I-49 will likely shape the year ahead for drivers in Louisiana.\n\nIn October the results of a study conducted by the I-49 South Feasibility and Funding Task Force concluded that collecting an 18-cents-per-mile toll could pay for 30-40 percent of I-49 South between Lafayette and New Orleans.\n\nIn this part of the state, much of the attention toward completing I-49 has focused in and around Lafayette. If enacted, a toll could also affect St. Landry Parish residents who work in or visit Lafayette and Iberia parishes.\n\nThe newly-completed interstate closer to Shreveport could prove a double-edged sword for many people in north Caddo Parish.\n\nThe towns of Gilliam, Hosston and Ida, all intersected by Highway 71, have a total and steadily falling population of about 700. That population is aging, too. Only a few businesses without shuttered windows operate in any of those hamlets.\n\nThe folks who do own businesses struggle to keep them populated with employees and customers. Many people who worked in Shreveport-Bossier City tackled the long, often-difficult commute down Highway 71 before the Interstate opened.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many things that have shut down. There\u2019s nowhere for people to use a restroom. There\u2019s nowhere for gas. I get people coming in here and they\u2019re desperate,\u201d said Hosston library manager Becky Dean. \u201cThey get about this far and suddenly get concerned if they\u2019ll make it to Shreveport, or vice versa to Texarkana.\u201d\n\nThe mood over I-49 is mostly positive in Hosston, Dean said, because the faster route is expected to take nearly all the big rig traffic off Highway 71. That\u2019s a big deal for elderly drivers but everyone knows the roadway is dangerous.\n\n\u201cYou try to go the speed limit and you\u2019re going to get people trying to run you off the road,\u201d Dean said.\n\nFor those who work in Shreveport-Bossier City but live in one of those northern towns, the commute time will fall drastically. It\u2019ll mean a lot for Ida\u2019s 24-year-old Paige Welch, now six months pregnant.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be moving. I lived here all my life. I love the small-town community and everyone I know,\u201d Welch said. \u201cPeople can probably sleep a little longer in the mornings now that the Interstate has opened up, and it\u2019ll be a lot easier when I go into labor.\u201d\n\nResidents are looking for \u2014 or expecting \u2014 a change in their rural way of life. What they do expect is a few more conveniences around the Interstate interchanges \u2014 drug stores, groceries and gas stations.\n\n\u201cIt will be a real boost to the economy of north Caddo,\u201d said I-49 International Coalition executive director Gard Wayt. \u201cThere\u2019ll be more of this and more of that. These interchanges are where that all begins.\u201d\n\nWhere I-49 has sliced through from Fort Smith to Fayetteville, Arkansas, Wayt said those kind of stores and service stations are popping up regularly, both a symptom and cause of development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown like Topsy. It\u2019s one of the fastest growing areas in the country every year, and I expect that kind of influence in north Caddo,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s the same story in Missouri, where I-49 is winding its way through the state as part of the future corridor that will take motorists from New Orleans to Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely changed things for us. It\u2019s made things much more efficient and safer in our area,\u201d said Andy Determan, manager for the Scoular Co. in Adrian, Missouri, which has been growing along the new corridor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expand because of it, but we wouldn\u2019t have expanded without it.\u201d\n\nI-49 continues to replace U.S. 71 in Barton County, Missouri, and if it isn\u2019t actually drawing in industry and commerce, it\u2019s at least giving the Chamber of Commerce in Lamar, the county\u2019s seat, more ammunition to market their area.\n\n\u201cNow we have all these things that make us a better package for large industry to take a look at us,\u201d said Chamber executive director Astra Ferris. \u201cSome of our businesses are seeing a 40 to 60 percent increase in business.\u201d\n\nI-49 north by the numbers\n\nTotal cost: $670 million\n\nLength: 36 miles\n\nCurrent accessibility: from North Market Street uninterrupted to Texarkana, Arkansas\n\nCompleted: Nine of 11 segements (30 miles) are completed. The segment from MLK Blvd. to La. 1 began in April 2013 and will be completed in 2015. The segment from I-220 to MLK Blvd. is estimated to be completed by late 2016 or early 2017.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/louisiana/2015/01/01/construction-finishes-change-follows/21159075/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I-49 will stretch one day from New Orleans to Canada.", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "I-49 will stretch one day from New Orleans to Canada.", "title": "Where I-49 construction finishes, change follows", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/louisiana/2015/01/01/construction-finishes-change-follows/21159075/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I-49 will stretch one day from New Orleans to Canada.", "title": "Where I-49 construction finishes, change follows", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf5be0de101e2d0fada7275d0be9efec20ea63e5/c=500-0-2508-2008&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/LafayetteLA/2015/01/01/B9315709556Z.1_20150101155051_000_G7M9ID9S8.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc606\"", "article_summary": "In October the results of a study conducted by the I-49 South Feasibility and Funding Task Force concluded that collecting an 18-cents-per-mile toll could pay for 30-40 percent of I-49 South between Lafayette and New Orleans.\n\u201cIt will be a real boost to the economy of north Caddo,\u201d said I-49 International Coalition executive director Gard Wayt.\nNorth and south of St. Landry Parish, changes to I-49 will likely shape the year ahead for drivers in Louisiana.\nIt\u2019s one of the fastest growing areas in the country every year, and I expect that kind of influence in north Caddo,\u201d he said.\nHighway 71 used to be the fastest route from north Caddo to Shreveport, two-and-a-half hours\u2019 drive north of Opelousas, but it isn\u2019t any more."}
