“There’s nowhere more exciting to stare at your phone than #@TheGym. Come for the workout, stay for the WiFi.”

That’s the motto of Youtube comedian Razmig’s imagined gym made just for millennials.

Razmig created a fake commercial for his gym, appropriately titled #@TheGym, and listed the amenities as “dozens of benches where you can comfortably check your twitter feed,” hundreds of charging stations, a barista, fro-yo and an Apple Genius bar.

He told the Huffington Post that he was inspired to make the video after an encounter at his own gym, which is “a very very small employee-only-company-gym, where there is only one bench.”

“There’s a gentleman that comes in every day for an hour, and will park on that bench,” says Razmig. “He does two sets of three reps (I counted) of really heavy weights, and then just takes phone calls and answers emails the rest of the time. He also doesn’t bring a water bottle and goes through 15 paper cups per session … which I also sadly counted. This is in no way an exaggeration.”

Gym time could only be improved with the perfect place to take a selfie…Or at least Kim Kardashian thinks so.
