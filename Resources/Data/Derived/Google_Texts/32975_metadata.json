They also look ahead to potential issues that may arise as ACA-related Medicaid waivers granted to certain states hit new milestones.\n\nThe team, from the U-M School of Public Health, Medical School and Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, find that only 15 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to fully comply with the ACA as originally designed by creating a state-based exchange and expanding Medicaid. But 23 states took neither of these steps.\n\nPartisan politics plays a role, they find. All but two of the 15 states that started their own exchange and expanded Medicaid are led by Democratic governors, and all but three of the 23 states that did neither are led by Republican governors.\n\nBut party control doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, they say. In all, 11 states expanded Medicaid and went with the federal or a federal-state partnership exchange, including six led by Republican governors.\n\nOne of them, Michigan, just began enrolling residents in its Healthy Michigan Plan on April 1, and initial reports suggest rapid and smooth progress. Idaho is the only state to have said no to Medicaid expansion but created a state exchange.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an important issue because of the coverage gap that will leave nearly 6 million people uninsured who are living below the poverty level or just above it in states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid,\u201d says Phillip Singer, MHSA, one of two U-M doctoral students who carried out the analysis.\n\nHe and his colleagues focused on the waivers that conservative-leaning states have asked the federal government to approve, allowing them to customize the Medicaid program during expansion.\n\n\u201cEach state seems to be pushing a little further to tailor the Medicaid program to fit their political ideology, and we don\u2019t know where this is going to end or where the federal government will say a state has gone too far,\u201d says Singer, who is working toward a degree in the U-M School of Public Health\u2019s Health Services Organization and Policy program.\n\nThe team compiled data on the current state of Medicaid expansion and state-level insurance exchanges across the country. Co-author David Jones, MSPH, M.A., also conducted interviews over nearly three years with leaders in 25 states as part of his doctoral work in the same program.\n\nJohn Ayanian, M.D., MPP, director of the\n\nU-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation\n\nSenior author John Ayanian, M.D., MPP, explored the politics of Michigan\u2019s Medicaid expansion and its potential as a model for other Republican-governed states in a previous article in the New England Journal of Medicine. (Summary available here)\n\nArkansas and Iowa also sought waivers, and Indiana and Pennsylvania currently have proposed waivers before the federal Department of Health and Human Services, with other states such as Missouri and Utah working toward possibly proposing waivers in order to customize Medicaid.\n\nThe waivers states have sought allow or would allow them to include conservative-favored options in expanded Medicaid programs, including cost-sharing, health savings accounts, and financial incentives for healthy behaviors or disincentives for certain health care-related actions \u2013 for example visiting an emergency department for a condition that could have been treated in a primary care clinic.\n\n\u201cThese waivers are very important politically, enabling governors to persuade enough conservatives in their legislatures to support a modified Medicaid expansion,\u201d says Ayanian, who is the Alice Hamilton Collegiate Professor of Medicine in the Medical School\u2019s Department of Internal Medicine. \u201cThis approach allows Republicans to pursue Medicaid waivers they view as beneficial for their states without endorsing other components of the ACA.\u201d A member of the Division of General Medicine, Ayanian is also a professor in the U-M School of Public Health and the Ford School of Public Policy.\n\nOver the next six years, as waivers begin to expire and states must begin to shoulder part of the expense of people enrolled under expanded Medicaid criteria, the political tides will play a major role in whether states continue to participate, the authors predict.\n\n\u201cWaivers are a way for Republican governors and legislators to say they are reforming Medicaid instead of embracing Obamacare, while still accepting federal money available because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Jones. \u201cHospitals, providers, and small businesses are advocating strongly in favor of Medicaid expansion. But there are many states where any chance of Medicaid expansion will depend on policymakers finding a middle way.\u201d\n\nThe current state harkens back to the original creation of Medicaid in 1965 \u2013 and the slow process of getting the second half of states to sign on, with Arizona finally joining in 1983. But, the U-M authors say, the federal waiver process gives states much more flexibility than they had when Medicaid was launched.\n\nReference: JAMA Viewpoint - online first doi:10.1001/jama.2014.3700", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the political divide over health care reform still strong going into this year\u2019s elections, a new analysis of state-level decisions shows signs of an emerging middle way toward reducing the ranks of the uninsured.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "abstract": "u of m hospital, university of michigan hospital", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a5d\"", "article_summary": "The team compiled data on the current state of Medicaid expansion and state-level insurance exchanges across the country.\n\u201cHospitals, providers, and small businesses are advocating strongly in favor of Medicaid expansion.\nIdaho is the only state to have said no to Medicaid expansion but created a state exchange.\nThey also look ahead to potential issues that may arise as ACA-related Medicaid waivers granted to certain states hit new milestones.\nthree way intersection sign.jpg A new U-M analysis shows an emerging middle path for states looking to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."}
