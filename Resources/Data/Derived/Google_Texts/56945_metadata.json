(They may also suffer from a political problem in that, outside of their base, most voters don\u2019t buy this trickle-down business \u2014 see Romney, Mitt \u2014 but let\u2019s stick with the economics.)\n\nThis post focuses on problem No. 2: making the tax code more regressive. In this regard, Sen. Marco Rubio takes the cake. If you were thinking: \u201cwhat tax change could I implement that would be most helpful to the wealthiest households?\u201d you\u2019d quickly come to the same conclusion as Rubio: zero out taxes on capital gains and dividends. That\u2019s because taxation on these forms of income, currently taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent, is highly concentrated: according to the Tax Policy Center, 79 percent of the tax take from this asset-based income comes from the top 1 percent, 5 percent from the bottom 90 percent.\n\nEver since this plan came out, my Center on Budget colleague and tax expert Chuck Marr has been bugging me about these unique data, produced by the IRS, on the 400 taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross income (AGI). Well, to get him off my back, I finally took a close look and \u2026 OMG!\n\nThe average amount of capital gains held by these wealthiest of taxpayers in 2012, the most recent year for these data, is $230 million. Just to be clear, that\u2019s the average value of capital gains \u2014 the money these wealthy people make from selling appreciated assets \u2014 held by the richest 400 taxpayers in 2012. Multiply that by 400, and you get back the total taxable base for these folks: $92 billion. Actually, in the context of this discussion, I guess I should call it the existing tax base, since Rubio wants to take it off the tax table.\n\nThat $92 billion was 12 percent of total taxable cap gains in 2012. I repeat: 12 percent of all capital gains subject to taxation was held by the richest 400 taxpayers. You often hear about the top 1 percent in these discussions. Well, those folks comprise the top 0.0003 percent.\n\nWhy would you do this? Jeb Bush and Donald Trump both take the rate on cap gains and dividends down to 20 percent (the extra 3.8 percent helps to fund the Affordable Care Act, which they both whack); John Kasich goes down to 15 percent, Ted Cruz is at 10 percent. But zero? Really?\n\nIt\u2019s the same old trickle-down rap. I\u2019ve tried to do my part to shine some factual light on this fatuous claim, showing the absence of any correlation between the tax rate on gains and investment. I\u2019ve quoted an actual investor by the name of Warren Buffett: \u201cI have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone \u2014 not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 \u2014 shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain.\u201d\n\nNoted tax expert Len Burman, a guy known for keeping his thumb off the scale, writes:\n\n\u201cIf low capital gains tax rates catalyzed economic growth, you\u2019d expect to see a negative relationship [between the cap gains rate and growth] \u2014 high gains rates, low growth, and vice versa \u2014 but there is no apparent relationship between the two time series. The correlation is 0.12, the wrong sign and not statistically different from zero. I\u2019ve tried lags up to five years and also looking at moving averages of the tax rates and growth. There is never a statistically significant relationship.\u201d\n\nTax analyst Chye-Ching Huang has looked for the relationship and also come up dry:\n\n\u201cNot only is there no evidence that raising capital gains taxes reduces private saving, but because the revenues generated may be used to reduce deficits, the overall impact of a capital gains tax increase may be to increase national saving and investment.\u201d\n\nYes, I know. Facts aren\u2019t exactly the coins of this realm. And the fact that the top 0.0003 percent tend to finance these candidates should not be overlooked. They\u2019re smart investors.\n\nBut it\u2019s even worse \u2014 with Rubio\u2019s tax plan, we may have entered a prevarication realm. If you follow this stuff, you may recall a dust-up in the last Republican debate wherein Rubio claimed that his tax plan delivers more money, at least in percent terms, to the poorest families. Obviously, they\u2019re not getting a break from his capital gains tax cut, so how can it be that the Tax Foundation, when they score the distributional impacts of Rubio\u2019s plan, do, in fact, get this result?\n\nThe reason is that the plan they score basically gives thousands to all of the poorest households, with no strings attached, regardless of whether they have any earnings. This is a negative income tax, or a \u201cbasic income,\u201d as it\u2019s called these days.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio filed for the N.H. presidential primary. \"We have a chance to be greater than we've ever been,\" Rubio said. (Reuters)\n\nPoor Kevin Drum has practically blown a gasket trying to figure out what the heck\u2019s going on here. He cites a Rubio spokesman implying that the Tax Foundation\u2019s assumptions are wrong, and that \u201crules would be tailored to ensure that our reforms would not create payments for new, non-working filers,\u201d which would of course be way more consistent with the brand. But the Rubio camp continues to be squishy on this point and seems to be citing the Tax Foundation anyway, so we don\u2019t really know.\n\nEither way, we can be certain that the Rubio plan will hemorrhage revenues while bequeathing a massive gift of wealth to the top 0.0003 percent. Apparently, he\u2019s decided that America\u2019s big economic challenge is that those rich people aren\u2019t rich enough. And damn it, he\u2019s gonna fix that!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why, in the name of either inequality or fiscal rectitude, would you zero out taxes on capital gains?", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Why, in the name of either inequality or fiscal rectitude, would you zero out taxes on capital gains?", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s tax plan gives a huge gift to the top 0.0003 percent", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/05/marco-rubios-tax-plan-gives-a-huge-gift-to-the-top-0-0003-percent/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/02/Editorial-Opinion/Images/213600566.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@econjared"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/05/marco-rubios-tax-plan-gives-a-huge-gift-to-the-top-0-0003-percent/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capital gains, taxes, Rubio, inequality", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capital gains, taxes, Rubio, inequality"}, "article_summary": "Either way, we can be certain that the Rubio plan will hemorrhage revenues while bequeathing a massive gift of wealth to the top 0.0003 percent.\nBut it\u2019s even worse \u2014 with Rubio\u2019s tax plan, we may have entered a prevarication realm.\nThis is a negative income tax, or a \u201cbasic income,\u201d as it\u2019s called these days.\nI\u2019ve tried lags up to five years and also looking at moving averages of the tax rates and growth.\nObviously, they\u2019re not getting a break from his capital gains tax cut, so how can it be that the Tax Foundation, when they score the distributional impacts of Rubio\u2019s plan, do, in fact, get this result?"}
