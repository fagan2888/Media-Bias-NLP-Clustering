It stands out among dozens of pictures of his three children and seven grandchildren. The protagonist of the comic-book series, He-Man, is depicted mounted atop his heroic lion, Battle Cat. His muscles are bulging; his sword is thrust into the air. Battle Cat\u2019s mouth is open, his fangs exposed. They are a formidable pair.\n\nA small gold plaque sits below the drawing in the same frame. Etched on it are a portion of the remarks Sessions delivered on the Senate floor in June 2007, two days before the comprehensive immigration-reform bill championed by President George W. Bush and several prominent Republicans was defeated in the Senate. Sessions led the opposition to that bill, and his efforts were among the reasons for its unexpected collapse. \u201cNo one small group of people have a right to meet in secret with special-interest groups and write an immigration bill and ram it down the throat of this Senate,\u201d he told his colleagues. \u201cI oppose it. It is not right.\u201d\n\nThe artwork was a gift from Cindy Hayden, Sessions\u2019s former chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee, after the 2007 bill was defeated. Sessions called the \u201csmall group\u201d that had hashed out the legislation \u2014 the politicians, political strategists, and special-interest groups \u2014 the \u201cmasters of the universe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of his favorite political put-downs. He refers to the CEOs and corporate interests that support amnesty for illegal immigrants as the \u201cmasters of the universe in glass towers and suites.\u201d Politicians like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have repeatedly tried to push a path to citizenship through Congress, are the \u201cWashington masters of the universe.\u201d Economists, too, are masters of the universe, and former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was the \u201cmaster master.\u201d\n\nSessions, 67, is a low-profile guy. Though he is not well known nationally, he has for years now been the instrumental force in quashing repeated attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform. He has a gentle, almost grandfatherly quality, but he doesn\u2019t shy away from combat. He derided the 2007 bill as \u201cno illegal alien left behind\u201d; in a single press conference, he blasted it as a \u201ccolossal error,\u201d an \u201cabsolute scandal,\u201d and a \u201cfiscal disaster.\u201d He declared: \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d All of this prompted the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank to call him the \u201cLou Dobbs of the Senate.\u201d\n\nBy the time Sessions was done, on the eve of the Senate vote, calls from the bill\u2019s opponents had shut down the Capitol switchboard. \u201cPeople were sending bricks through the mail and saying, \u2018Use this to build a wall,\u2019 that sort of thing,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Senate in 1996, Sessions had no special interest in immigration but, as a career prosecutor, he says the 2007 bill, which would have granted amnesty to the millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States, \u201cjust went against my understanding of what law in America was about.\u201d\n\nSessions grew up in the rural town of Hybart, Ala., where his family ran a country store and, he has said, he learned \u201cthe value of hard work and being honest.\u201d He was a Republican even when the South was strongly Democratic. At Huntingdon College in the late 1960s, he was involved with the GOP, and in his senior year he became chairman of the campus chapter of the Young Republicans.\n\nEven before he came to Washington he had spent much of his career in public service, first as a U.S. attorney in Mobile and then as state attorney general. In 1986, when Sessions was 39, President Reagan nominated him to the federal district court in Alabama.\n\nSessions has always been willing to take on unpopular fights. As U.S. attorney, he prosecuted a group of African-American civil-rights activists for voter fraud, and his nomination prompted charges of racism from local and national officials. Colleagues at the Department of Justice accused him of racism, too, and the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy warned that he would be a \u201cthrowback to a shameful era.\u201d A black colleague and even a local black journalist testified on his behalf. Ultimately, his nomination was defeated. In an unusual turn of events, Senator Howell Heflin, a conservative Democrat who was expected to support his fellow Alabamian, bucked tradition and cast the deciding vote against him.\n\nSessions ran for the Senate in 1996 after serving two years as state attorney general and got some revenge: He won the seat held by the retiring Heflin. His victory was important for the GOP, too, as part of Alabama\u2019s political realignment and that of the South more broadly. In 1994, Republicans had won the governorship and several other statewide offices. The 1996 elections tested the permanence of those victories, and Sessions\u2019s triumph helped to consolidate the GOP\u2019s gains.\n\nSessions says that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform, which would address many of the thorny immigration issues facing the country in a single bill rather than in smaller pieces, began redoubling their efforts on June 8, 2007, the day after a Bush-backed bill to bring it about was defeated. To the rest of us, it wasn\u2019t until the day after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in the 2012 presidential election that a new immigration bill began to look not just realistic but inevitable. Three days after the election, former George W. Bush aide Mark McKinnon opined, \u201cThe best thing about Republicans\u2019 losing is that it will likely force them to cut an immigration deal.\u201d An NBC News headline declared, \u201cGOP resistance to immigration reform could be a casualty of 2012 election.\u201d The Washington Post explained that \u201cthe GOP needs to do immigration reform \u2014 now.\u201d The Republican National Committee, in its postmortem election report, came to the same conclusion.\n\nA year and a half later, the landscape looks much different. House majority leader Eric Cantor is widely considered a casualty of the immigration issue. And, with Central American children flooding over the southern border, comprehensive immigration reform is, for the time being, all but dead.\n\nMore than any other national figure, Sessions is responsible for that turn of events. As the Senate debated the proposal of a group of eight senators \u2014 known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2014 for comprehensive reform last year, and then as the House toyed with passing it in various incarnations throughout the spring, Sessions\u2019s office served as Ground Zero for the opposition. His staff circulated scholarly studies on Capitol Hill, sent dozens of policy memos to sway ambivalent lawmakers, and relentlessly hassled reporters about the perceived biases in their coverage.\n\nSessions himself met privately with Republicans in both houses of Congress to persuade them of his views. He also broadcast them in public, taking the Senate floor more than any other lawmaker last year. He spoke for a total of 39 hours, more even than did his colleagues Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who made national headlines for staging hours-long filibusters. \u201cWithout Sessions, I see that amnesty probably would\u2019ve been rammed through,\u201d says radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham, who undertook her own crusade to scuttle the legislation.\n\nSessions opposes not only providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u2014 many Republicans are against that \u2014 but also raising the level of legal immigration. The Gang of Eight\u2019s bill would have markedly increased it, and Sessions was one of the few voices on Capitol Hill arguing that even legal immigration hurts Americans, particularly when the economy is weak and unemployment high.\n\nHe has cast himself as a Beltway champion of the middle class, and his message of economic populism is part of a broader attempt to revitalize it. For Sessions, the issue of immigration illustrates better than anything else the divide between the ruling class \u2014 the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d \u2014 and working-class Americans, with the vast majority of CEOs and business owners favoring reform that, as he sees it, would deal a blow to America\u2019s poor and middle-class workers. He has time and again cited Congressional Budget Office findings that increased immigration lowers wages overall but particularly for the poor. And, though many Republicans have called for allowing high-skilled immigrants into the U.S., particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, Sessions has repeatedly drawn attention to statistics suggesting we have more than enough.\n\nSo when, less than two months after Romney\u2019s loss, Florida senator and Republican rising star Marco Rubio made it clear he would take the lead in negotiating an immigration-reform proposal with Democrats and the Obama administration, Sessions prepared for battle. Rubio had nearly all of the major financial forces in the GOP behind him; Sessions had history on his side.\n\nHe compares the efforts of the pro-reform crowd to a highly orchestrated presidential campaign: \u201cThey had exceedingly capable political consultants, they had pollsters to ask the right questions to get the best possible polling numbers, they had TV advertisements, they had rock-star Republicans supporting it, and they felt the train couldn\u2019t be stopped,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to the Sunlight Foundation, business and political groups spent more than $1.5 billion between 2008 and 2012 on pro-reform lobbying. Norm Coleman\u2019s American Action Network aired ads on Fox News urging viewers to call Rubio to \u201cthank him for keeping his promise, and fighting to secure the border.\u201d Americans for a Conservative Direction, led by former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, ran ads calling on viewers to \u201cstand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.\u201d Americans for Prosperity, a nonprofit group funded by the Koch brothers\u2019 donor network, moved its 2013 conference from Washington, D.C., to Orlando, Fla., and featured Rubio as the keynote speaker. It was the rare issue, says Ingraham, on which the Left and the Right were \u201ccompletely in cahoots with one another.\u201d\n\nAs the legislation took shape, Sessions tried to slow it down in part by drawing attention to the swiftness with which some lawmakers were trying to move it through the Senate. Lawmakers had had two and a half weeks to read the 844-page bill when Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy scheduled it for a markup. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t think we want is delay just for delay\u2019s sake,\u201d New York senator Chuck Schumer, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said at a committee hearing in late April 2013. Schumer\u2019s strategy, says a Sessions aide, was \u201cto move faster than the truth can travel.\u201d\n\nAt the same committee hearing, Sessions gave Schumer a reason for delay. He pointed to an article in the Christian Science Monitor noting that even those involved in crafting the legislation didn\u2019t know exactly how many new immigrants it would allow into the country. He went on to read from the text of the bill to illustrate why it was difficult for some to parse. \u201cThe discretionary authority under clause one i may not be used to waive\u201d \u2014 he paused, right hand in the air \u2014 \u201croman numeral one, sub-paragraph b, c, d 2, i, e, g, h, or i of section 212 a-2, then, roman numeral two, section 212 a-3, then, roman numeral three, sub-paragraph a, c, d, e of section 212 a-10.\u201d His staff, he told his colleagues, had been working for days \u201ctrying to decipher this gobbledygook.\u201d Flashing a smile, he looked at Schumer and said that he\u2019d do his best to be ready to vote on the legislation. \u201cBut count me as a, a bit of a protest.\u201d\n\nAs the bill moved through the Senate, Sessions used details like these to embarrass its supporters. His efforts were aimed not at them but at the few senators who hadn\u2019t yet made up their minds and, even more important, at the dozens of undecided Republicans in the House of Representatives, which would ultimately decide the bill\u2019s fate. Sessions likes to refer to \u201ctrue facts,\u201d and he says he felt a \u201cduty to try to educate people on what I thought were the true facts.\u201d\n\nSenator David Vitter was a key ally, and together they plotted legislative strategy. The Louisiana Republican, Sessions says, is \u201cextremely effective in understanding Senate procedures,\u201d and he raised questions about the Gang of Eight\u2019s commitment to securing the border when he forced the Senate to vote on, and reject, an amendment to the bill that would have prohibited legalization before the implementation of a biometric border-check-in system. In April, the duo exasperated Democrats again when Vitter wrote, and Sessions raised on the Senate floor, an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez: Vitter noted Chavez\u2019s support for a \u201csecure Southern border\u201d and \u201cenforcement of our immigration laws.\u201d That put New Jersey\u2019s Robert Menendez, who had introduced the resolution, in an awkward position as he objected to the amendment.\n\nThe Gang of Eight\u2019s bill passed 68 to 32. Its supporters had hoped for 70 yea votes. \u201cIt was wounded when it got to the House, wasn\u2019t any doubt about that,\u201d Sessions says.\n\nThe events that unfolded over the next few months didn\u2019t help it. On July 2, the Obama administration quietly announced in a blog post that it would delay for a year the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate. With that, Vitter says, skepticism among Republicans that the president could be trusted to enforce the proposed immigration legislation \u201cwent on steroids.\u201d When House members returned from their July 4 recess, says one Republican congressman, \u201canybody who opposed amnesty-first-type legislation could simply say, \u2018Look, if he\u2019s not going to enforce a core part of his namesake legislation, what makes you think he\u2019s going to enforce anything that we pass?\u2019\u201d\n\nNonetheless, July was filled with talk about whether House leaders would use a conference committee to resolve their disputes with the Senate over the bill. On her radio show, Laura Ingraham sought to prevent them from doing so. Her interviews with GOP House members, regardless of the topic, ended with the same question: \u201cWill you go to conference on immigration, yes or no?\u201d She also made a presidential endorsement. \u201cJeff Sessions, we need Jeff Sessions for president,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, is there anyone out there who is better than Jeff Sessions on any of these issues?\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers left Washington for their annual August recess, Sessions sent House Republicans home with a memo. Dated July 29, 2013, and addressed to \u201cRepublican colleagues,\u201d it sought to refute the political and economic arguments in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans lost the 2012 election not because Mitt Romney won too few Hispanic votes, he said, but because the GOP \u201chemorrhaged support from middle- and low-income Americans.\u201d While many Republicans had argued that an influx of immigration would aid American businesses, Sessions asked, \u201cWhat about the needs of workers?\u201d He urged them to embrace a \u201chumble and honest populism.\u201d\n\nThe argument took. Among House members, the political argument was particularly effective. After the 2012 election, says one Republican congressman, \u201cit was almost just accepted that you\u2019d do the amnesty and then you\u2019d do better amongst Latino voters.\u201d Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did relatively well among Hispanics: Reagan won 37 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1984, and Bush won 40 percent in 2004. Though both supported amnesty, neither campaigned on the issue. In the first election after Reagan signed the 1986 immigration bill, which legalized over 2 million people, George H. W. Bush earned just 30 percent of the Hispanic vote. John McCain, who had for years championed comprehensive immigration reform, did little better.\n\nEventually even Republican supporters began to concede there would be no political payoff. In a closed-door meeting, says the congressman, \u201cPaul Ryan eventually said immigration reform won\u2019t help us win more votes, but \u2018this is something we need to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the new year, House leaders had decided to scrap the Senate bill entirely. But opponents of amnesty like to refer to comprehensive immigration reform as a \u201czombie issue\u201d \u2014 one that time and again springs back to life \u2014 and the House leadership decided to sell their colleagues on a set of immigration principles, including a path to citizenship, unveiled shortly before their January retreat at a golf resort in Cambridge, Md.\n\nOn January 28, the day before they decamped from D.C., Sessions sent a 30-page memo to House Republicans. He said that the principles unveiled by House leaders resembled in every important way what he referred to as the \u201cSenate Democrat / White House plan.\u201d Complete with a table of contents that catalogued the \u201cmyths\u201d propagated by the bill\u2019s supporters, Sessions argued in footnote-full and chart-filled detail against the claims put forward by House leaders. The memo also included a \u201cchartbook\u201d on the adverse economic impact of mass immigration.\n\n\u201cLots of members rebelled against the principles,\u201d says a House member who was in on several private discussions. The congressman says that when they were discussed in a closed-door meeting of the Republican conference back in Washington, Boehner addressed the room and said, \u201cLook, I got the message.\u201d\n\nIn early February, both Boehner and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said they couldn\u2019t see an immigration deal happening, but the issue popped up again in April when the Wall Street Journal reported that Boehner had told donors at a Las Vegas fundraiser he was \u201chell-bent\u201d on passing an immigration bill in 2014. The speaker finally threw his hands up at the end of the month. \u201cEvery time the president ignores the law like the 38 times he has on Obamacare,\u201d he said, \u201cour members look up and go, \u2018Wait a minute.\u2019\u201d\n\nSessions characterizes Eric Cantor\u2019s primary defeat in June and the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the southern border as \u201cexclamation points\u201d on his efforts over the past year. The latter has proved disastrous for the Obama administration and for those who supported the Gang of Eight bill, offering a national illustration of the catastrophic impact of lax immigration laws. \u201cA few years ago,\u201d says a Republican congressman who opposes amnesty, \u201cpeople like me could predict what was going to happen. Now we don\u2019t have to predict, we just point.\u201d\n\nCongress has yet to come up with any viable legislation to stem the tide of illegal immigrants and young children pouring over the border. The House last week passed a symbolic bill that increases funding to deploy National Guard troops to the border and closes a loophole in a 2008 law, making it easier to deport the unaccompanied minors entering the country. The Democratic Senate blocked the bill and jetted off on vacation.\n\nThe result of Sessions\u2019s efforts is that the president is now left with just one option to accomplish his goal: implementing an executive order that would grant amnesty to between 6 and 9 million illegal immigrants. It won\u2019t be couched in the feel-good language of the Gang of Eight bill, and it will come with enormous political costs.\n\nThe denouement, if you can call it that, offers an important political lesson: Intensity matters. It is said more often of the fight over gun control, but it is true of all political battles. Opponents of amnesty, Sessions chief among them, proved more passionate and energetic than their adversaries. For over a year, Sessions and his staff owned the immigration issue every day. Though supporters of the legislation, both in 2007 and 2013, peddled a narrative of inevitability, Sessions helped nurture and give expression to the skepticism of many Republican voters whose voices weren\u2019t represented by the CEOs and lobbyists who helped craft the bill.\n\nAnd he won, both times. That might not make him a master of the universe, but it makes him one of the most important assets that the Right has.\n\n\u2014 Eliana Johnson is a national reporter for National Review Online.

Norm Coleman\u2019s American Action Network aired ads on Fox News urging viewers to call Rubio to \u201cthank him for keeping his promise, and fighting to secure the border.\u201d Americans for a Conservative Direction, led by former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, ran ads calling on viewers to \u201cstand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.\u201d Americans for Prosperity, a nonprofit group funded by the Koch brothers\u2019 donor network, moved its 2013 conference from Washington, D.C., to Orlando, Fla., and featured Rubio as the keynote speaker. It was the rare issue, says Ingraham, on which the Left and the Right were \u201ccompletely in cahoots with one another.\u201d\n\nAs the legislation took shape, Sessions tried to slow it down in part by drawing attention to the swiftness with which some lawmakers were trying to move it through the Senate. Lawmakers had had two and a half weeks to read the 844-page bill when Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy scheduled it for a markup. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t think we want is delay just for delay\u2019s sake,\u201d New York senator Chuck Schumer, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said at a committee hearing in late April 2013. Schumer\u2019s strategy, says a Sessions aide, was \u201cto move faster than the truth can travel.\u201d\n\nAt the same committee hearing, Sessions gave Schumer a reason for delay. He pointed to an article in the Christian Science Monitor noting that even those involved in crafting the legislation didn\u2019t know exactly how many new immigrants it would allow into the country. He went on to read from the text of the bill to illustrate why it was difficult for some to parse. \u201cThe discretionary authority under clause one i may not be used to waive\u201d \u2014 he paused, right hand in the air \u2014 \u201croman numeral one, sub-paragraph b, c, d 2, i, e, g, h, or i of section 212 a-2, then, roman numeral two, section 212 a-3, then, roman numeral three, sub-paragraph a, c, d, e of section 212 a-10.\u201d His staff, he told his colleagues, had been working for days \u201ctrying to decipher this gobbledygook.\u201d Flashing a smile, he looked at Schumer and said that he\u2019d do his best to be ready to vote on the legislation. \u201cBut count me as a, a bit of a protest.\u201d\n\nAs the bill moved through the Senate, Sessions used details like these to embarrass its supporters. His efforts were aimed not at them but at the few senators who hadn\u2019t yet made up their minds and, even more important, at the dozens of undecided Republicans in the House of Representatives, which would ultimately decide the bill\u2019s fate. Sessions likes to refer to \u201ctrue facts,\u201d and he says he felt a \u201cduty to try to educate people on what I thought were the true facts.\u201d\n\nSenator David Vitter was a key ally, and together they plotted legislative strategy. The Louisiana Republican, Sessions says, is \u201cextremely effective in understanding Senate procedures,\u201d and he raised questions about the Gang of Eight\u2019s commitment to securing the border when he forced the Senate to vote on, and reject, an amendment to the bill that would have prohibited legalization before the implementation of a biometric border-check-in system. In April, the duo exasperated Democrats again when Vitter wrote, and Sessions raised on the Senate floor, an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez: Vitter noted Chavez\u2019s support for a \u201csecure Southern border\u201d and \u201cenforcement of our immigration laws.\u201d That put New Jersey\u2019s Robert Menendez, who had introduced the resolution, in an awkward position as he objected to the amendment.\n\n#page#The Gang of Eight\u2019s bill passed 68 to 32. Its supporters had hoped for 70 yea votes. \u201cIt was wounded when it got to the House, wasn\u2019t any doubt about that,\u201d Sessions says.\n\nThe events that unfolded over the next few months didn\u2019t help it. On July 2, the Obama administration quietly announced in a blog post that it would delay for a year the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate. With that, Vitter says, skepticism among Republicans that the president could be trusted to enforce the proposed immigration legislation \u201cwent on steroids.\u201d When House members returned from their July 4 recess, says one Republican congressman, \u201canybody who opposed amnesty-first-type legislation could simply say, \u2018Look, if he\u2019s not going to enforce a core part of his namesake legislation, what makes you think he\u2019s going to enforce anything that we pass?\u2019\u201d\n\n#ad#Nonetheless, July was filled with talk about whether House leaders would use a conference committee to resolve their disputes with the Senate over the bill. On her radio show, Laura Ingraham sought to prevent them from doing so. Her interviews with GOP House members, regardless of the topic, ended with the same question: \u201cWill you go to conference on immigration, yes or no?\u201d She also made a presidential endorsement. \u201cJeff Sessions, we need Jeff Sessions for president,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, is there anyone out there who is better than Jeff Sessions on any of these issues?\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers left Washington for their annual August recess, Sessions sent House Republicans home with a memo. Dated July 29, 2013, and addressed to \u201cRepublican colleagues,\u201d it sought to refute the political and economic arguments in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans lost the 2012 election not because Mitt Romney won too few Hispanic votes, he said, but because the GOP \u201chemorrhaged support from middle- and low-income Americans.\u201d While many Republicans had argued that an influx of immigration would aid American businesses, Sessions asked, \u201cWhat about the needs of workers?\u201d He urged them to embrace a \u201chumble and honest populism.\u201d\n\nThe argument took. Among House members, the political argument was particularly effective. After the 2012 election, says one Republican congressman, \u201cit was almost just accepted that you\u2019d do the amnesty and then you\u2019d do better amongst Latino voters.\u201d Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did relatively well among Hispanics: Reagan won 37 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1984, and Bush won 40 percent in 2004. Though both supported amnesty, neither campaigned on the issue. In the first election after Reagan signed the 1986 immigration bill, which legalized over 2 million people, George H. W. Bush earned just 30 percent of the Hispanic vote. John McCain, who had for years championed comprehensive immigration reform, did little better.\n\nEventually even Republican supporters began to concede there would be no political payoff. In a closed-door meeting, says the congressman, \u201cPaul Ryan eventually said immigration reform won\u2019t help us win more votes, but \u2018this is something we need to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the new year, House leaders had decided to scrap the Senate bill entirely. But opponents of amnesty like to refer to comprehensive immigration reform as a \u201czombie issue\u201d \u2014 one that time and again springs back to life \u2014 and the House leadership decided to sell their colleagues on a set of immigration principles, including a path to citizenship, unveiled shortly before their January retreat at a golf resort in Cambridge, Md.\n\nOn January 28, the day before they decamped from D.C., Sessions sent a 30-page memo to House Republicans. He said that the principles unveiled by House leaders resembled in every important way what he referred to as the \u201cSenate Democrat / White House plan.\u201d Complete with a table of contents that catalogued the \u201cmyths\u201d propagated by the bill\u2019s supporters, Sessions argued in footnote-full and chart-filled detail against the claims put forward by House leaders. The memo also included a \u201cchartbook\u201d on the adverse economic impact of mass immigration.\n\n\u201cLots of members rebelled against the principles,\u201d says a House member who was in on several private discussions. The congressman says that when they were discussed in a closed-door meeting of the Republican conference back in Washington, Boehner addressed the room and said, \u201cLook, I got the message.\u201d\n\nIn early February, both Boehner and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said they couldn\u2019t see an immigration deal happening, but the issue popped up again in April when the Wall Street Journal reported that Boehner had told donors at a Las Vegas fundraiser he was \u201chell-bent\u201d on passing an immigration bill in 2014. The speaker finally threw his hands up at the end of the month. \u201cEvery time the president ignores the law like the 38 times he has on Obamacare,\u201d he said, \u201cour members look up and go, \u2018Wait a minute.\u2019\u201d\n\nSessions characterizes Eric Cantor\u2019s primary defeat in June and the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the southern border as \u201cexclamation points\u201d on his efforts over the past year. The latter has proved disastrous for the Obama administration and for those who supported the Gang of Eight bill, offering a national illustration of the catastrophic impact of lax immigration laws. \u201cA few years ago,\u201d says a Republican congressman who opposes amnesty, \u201cpeople like me could predict what was going to happen. Now we don\u2019t have to predict, we just point.\u201d\n\nCongress has yet to come up with any viable legislation to stem the tide of illegal immigrants and young children pouring over the border. The House last week passed\u00a0a symbolic bill that increases funding to deploy National Guard troops to the border and closes a\u00a0loophole in a 2008 law, making it easier to deport the unaccompanied minors entering the country. The Democratic Senate blocked the bill and jetted off on vacation.\n\nThe result of Sessions\u2019s efforts is that the president is now left with just one option to accomplish his goal: implementing an executive order that would grant amnesty to between 6 and 9 million illegal immigrants. It won\u2019t be couched in the feel-good language of the Gang of Eight bill, and it will come with enormous political costs.\n\nThe denouement, if you can call it that, offers an important political lesson: Intensity matters. It is said more often of the fight over gun control, but it is true of all political battles. Opponents of amnesty, Sessions chief among them, proved more passionate and energetic than their adversaries. For over a year, Sessions and his staff owned the immigration issue every day. Though supporters of the legislation, both in 2007 and 2013, peddled a narrative of inevitability, Sessions helped nurture and give expression to the skepticism of many Republican voters whose voices weren\u2019t represented by the CEOs and lobbyists who helped craft the bill.\n\nAnd he won, both times. That might not make him a master of the universe, but it makes him one of the most important assets that the Right has.\n\n\u2014 Eliana Johnson is a national reporter for National Review Online.\u00a0This piece is adapted from an article that appeared in the August 11, 2014, issue\u00a0of\u00a0National\u00a0Review.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "| National Review", "og": {"site_name": "National Review Online", "description": "A Masters of the Universe drawing hangs in a frame above the desk in the Capitol Hill office of Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. It stands out among dozens of pictures of his three children and seven grandchildren. The protagonist of the comic-book series, He-Man, is depicted mounted atop his heroic lion, Battle Cat. His muscles are bulging; his sword is thrust into the air. Battle Cat\u2019s mouth is open, his fangs exposed. They are a formidable pair.\n\nA small gold plaque sits below the drawing in the same frame. Etched on it are a portion of the remarks Sessions delivered on the Senate floor in June 2007, two days before the comprehensive immigration-reform bill championed by President George W. Bush and several prominent Republicans was defeated in the Senate. Sessions led the opposition to that bill, and his efforts were among the reasons for its unexpected collapse. \u201cNo one small group of people have a right to meet in secret with special-interest groups and write an immigration bill and ram it down the throat of this Senate,\u201d he told his colleagues. \u201cI oppose it. It is not right.\u201d\n\n#ad#The artwork was a gift from Cindy Hayden, Sessions\u2019s former chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee, after the 2007 bill was defeated. Sessions called the \u201csmall group\u201d that had hashed out the legislation \u2014 the politicians, political strategists, and special-interest groups \u2014 the \u201cmasters of the universe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of his favorite political put-downs. He refers to the CEOs and corporate interests that support amnesty for illegal immigrants as the \u201cmasters of the universe in glass towers and suites.\u201d Politicians like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have repeatedly tried to push a path to citizenship through Congress, are the \u201cWashington masters of the universe.\u201d Economists, too, are masters of the universe, and former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was the \u201cmaster master.\u201d\n\nSessions, 67, is a low-profile guy. Though he is not well known nationally, he has for years now been the instrumental force in quashing repeated attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform. He has a gentle, almost grandfatherly quality, but he doesn\u2019t shy away from combat. He derided the 2007 bill as \u201cno illegal alien left behind\u201d; in a single press conference, he blasted it as a \u201ccolossal error,\u201d an \u201cabsolute scandal,\u201d and a \u201cfiscal disaster.\u201d He declared: \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d All of this prompted the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank to call him the \u201cLou Dobbs of the Senate.\u201d\n\nBy the time Sessions was done, on the eve of the Senate vote, calls from the bill\u2019s opponents had shut down the Capitol switchboard. \u201cPeople were sending bricks through the mail and saying, \u2018Use this to build a wall,\u2019 that sort of thing,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Senate in 1996, Sessions had no special interest in immigration but, as a career prosecutor, he says the 2007 bill, which would have granted amnesty to the millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States, \u201cjust went against my understanding of what law in America was about.\u201d\n\nSessions grew up in the rural town of Hybart, Ala., where his family ran a country store and, he has said, he learned \u201cthe value of hard work and being honest.\u201d He was a Republican even when the South was strongly Democratic. At Huntingdon College in the late 1960s, he was involved with the GOP, and in his senior year he became chairman of the campus chapter of the Young Republicans.\n\nEven before he came to Washington he had spent much of his career in public service, first as a U.S. attorney in Mobile and then as state attorney general. In 1986, when Sessions was 39, President Reagan nominated him to the federal district court in Alabama.\n\nSessions has always been willing to take on unpopular fights. As U.S. attorney, he prosecuted a group of African-American civil-rights activists for voter fraud, and his nomination prompted charges of racism from local and national officials. Colleagues at the Department of Justice accused him of racism, too, and the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy warned that he would be a \u201cthrowback to a shameful era.\u201d A black colleague and even a local black journalist testified on his behalf. Ultimately, his nomination was defeated. In an unusual turn of events, Senator Howell Heflin, a conservative Democrat who was expected to support his fellow Alabamian, bucked tradition and cast the deciding vote against him.\n\nSessions ran for the Senate in 1996 after serving two years as state attorney general and got some revenge: He won the seat held by the retiring Heflin. His victory was important for the GOP, too, as part of Alabama\u2019s political realignment and that of the South more broadly. In 1994, Republicans had won the governorship and several other statewide offices. The 1996 elections tested the permanence of those victories, and Sessions\u2019s triumph helped to consolidate the GOP\u2019s gains.\n\nSessions says that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform, which would address many of the thorny immigration issues facing the country in a single bill rather than in smaller pieces, began redoubling their efforts on June 8, 2007, the day after a Bush-backed bill to bring it about was defeated. To the rest of us, it wasn\u2019t until the day after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in the 2012 presidential election that a new immigration bill began to look not just realistic but inevitable. Three days after the election, former George W. Bush aide Mark McKinnon opined, \u201cThe best thing about Republicans\u2019 losing is that it will likely force them to cut an immigration deal.\u201d An NBC News headline declared, \u201cGOP resistance to immigration reform could be a casualty of 2012 election.\u201d The Washington Post explained that \u201cthe GOP needs to do immigration reform \u2014 now.\u201d The Republican National Committee, in its postmortem election report, came to the same conclusion.\n\nA year and a half later, the landscape looks much different. House majority leader Eric Cantor is widely considered a casualty of the immigration issue. And, with Central American children flooding over the southern border, comprehensive immigration reform is, for the time being, all but dead.\n\n#page#More than any other national figure, Sessions is responsible for that turn of events. As the Senate debated the proposal of a group of eight senators \u2014 known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2014 for comprehensive reform last year, and then as the House toyed with passing it in various incarnations throughout the spring, Sessions\u2019s office served as Ground Zero for the opposition. His staff circulated scholarly studies on Capitol Hill, sent dozens of policy memos to sway ambivalent lawmakers, and relentlessly hassled reporters about the perceived biases in their coverage.\n\nSessions himself met privately with Republicans in both houses of Congress to persuade them of his views. He also broadcast them in public, taking the Senate floor more than any other lawmaker last year. He spoke for a total of 39 hours, more even than did his colleagues Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who made national headlines for staging hours-long filibusters. \u201cWithout Sessions, I see that amnesty probably would\u2019ve been rammed through,\u201d says radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham, who undertook her own crusade to scuttle the legislation.\n\n#ad#Sessions opposes not only providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u2014 many Republicans are against that \u2014 but also raising the level of legal immigration. The Gang of Eight\u2019s bill would have markedly increased it, and Sessions was one of the few voices on Capitol Hill arguing that even legal immigration hurts Americans, particularly when the economy is weak and unemployment high.\n\nHe has cast himself as a Beltway champion of the middle class, and his message of economic populism is part of a broader attempt to revitalize it. For Sessions, the issue of immigration illustrates better than anything else the divide between the ruling class \u2014 the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d \u2014 and working-class Americans, with the vast majority of CEOs and business owners favoring reform that, as he sees it, would deal a blow to America\u2019s poor and middle-class workers. He has time and again cited Congressional Budget Office findings that increased immigration lowers wages overall but particularly for the poor. And, though many Republicans have called for allowing high-skilled immigrants into the U.S., particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, Sessions has repeatedly drawn attention to statistics suggesting we have more than enough.\n\nSo when, less than two months after Romney\u2019s loss, Florida senator and Republican rising star Marco Rubio made it clear he would take the lead in negotiating an immigration-reform proposal with Democrats and the Obama administration, Sessions prepared for battle.

The speaker finally threw his hands up at the end of the month. \u201cEvery time the president ignores the law like the 38 times he has on Obamacare,\u201d he said, \u201cour members look up and go, \u2018Wait a minute.\u2019\u201d\n\nSessions characterizes Eric Cantor\u2019s primary defeat in June and the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the southern border as \u201cexclamation points\u201d on his efforts over the past year. The latter has proved disastrous for the Obama administration and for those who supported the Gang of Eight bill, offering a national illustration of the catastrophic impact of lax immigration laws. \u201cA few years ago,\u201d says a Republican congressman who opposes amnesty, \u201cpeople like me could predict what was going to happen. Now we don\u2019t have to predict, we just point.\u201d\n\nCongress has yet to come up with any viable legislation to stem the tide of illegal immigrants and young children pouring over the border. The House last week passed\u00a0a symbolic bill that increases funding to deploy National Guard troops to the border and closes a\u00a0loophole in a 2008 law, making it easier to deport the unaccompanied minors entering the country. The Democratic Senate blocked the bill and jetted off on vacation.\n\nThe result of Sessions\u2019s efforts is that the president is now left with just one option to accomplish his goal: implementing an executive order that would grant amnesty to between 6 and 9 million illegal immigrants. It won\u2019t be couched in the feel-good language of the Gang of Eight bill, and it will come with enormous political costs.\n\nThe denouement, if you can call it that, offers an important political lesson: Intensity matters. It is said more often of the fight over gun control, but it is true of all political battles. Opponents of amnesty, Sessions chief among them, proved more passionate and energetic than their adversaries. For over a year, Sessions and his staff owned the immigration issue every day. Though supporters of the legislation, both in 2007 and 2013, peddled a narrative of inevitability, Sessions helped nurture and give expression to the skepticism of many Republican voters whose voices weren\u2019t represented by the CEOs and lobbyists who helped craft the bill.\n\nAnd he won, both times. That might not make him a master of the universe, but it makes him one of the most important assets that the Right has.\n\n\u2014 Eliana Johnson is a national reporter for National Review Online.\u00a0This piece is adapted from an article that appeared in the August 11, 2014, issue\u00a0of\u00a0National\u00a0Review.", "title": "Amnesty\u2019s Worst Enemy", "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/384665/amnestys-worst-enemy-eliana-johnson", "image": "http://c4.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_related_080614_SM_Jeff-Sessions-G.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/384665/amnestys-worst-enemy-eliana-johnson", "image": "http://c5.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_giant_080614_SM_Jeff-Sessions-G.jpg", "description": "A Masters of the Universe drawing hangs in a frame above the desk in the Capitol Hill office of Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. It stands out among dozens of pictures of his three children and seven grandchildren. The protagonist of the comic-book series, He-Man, is depicted mounted atop his heroic lion, Battle Cat. His muscles are bulging; his sword is thrust into the air. Battle Cat\u2019s mouth is open, his fangs exposed. They are a formidable pair.\n\nA small gold plaque sits below the drawing in the same frame. Etched on it are a portion of the remarks Sessions delivered on the Senate floor in June 2007, two days before the comprehensive immigration-reform bill championed by President George W. Bush and several prominent Republicans was defeated in the Senate. Sessions led the opposition to that bill, and his efforts were among the reasons for its unexpected collapse. \u201cNo one small group of people have a right to meet in secret with special-interest groups and write an immigration bill and ram it down the throat of this Senate,\u201d he told his colleagues. \u201cI oppose it. It is not right.\u201d\n\n#ad#The artwork was a gift from Cindy Hayden, Sessions\u2019s former chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee, after the 2007 bill was defeated. Sessions called the \u201csmall group\u201d that had hashed out the legislation \u2014 the politicians, political strategists, and special-interest groups \u2014 the \u201cmasters of the universe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of his favorite political put-downs. He refers to the CEOs and corporate interests that support amnesty for illegal immigrants as the \u201cmasters of the universe in glass towers and suites.\u201d Politicians like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have repeatedly tried to push a path to citizenship through Congress, are the \u201cWashington masters of the universe.\u201d Economists, too, are masters of the universe, and former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was the \u201cmaster master.\u201d\n\nSessions, 67, is a low-profile guy. Though he is not well known nationally, he has for years now been the instrumental force in quashing repeated attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform. He has a gentle, almost grandfatherly quality, but he doesn\u2019t shy away from combat. He derided the 2007 bill as \u201cno illegal alien left behind\u201d; in a single press conference, he blasted it as a \u201ccolossal error,\u201d an \u201cabsolute scandal,\u201d and a \u201cfiscal disaster.\u201d He declared: \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d All of this prompted the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank to call him the \u201cLou Dobbs of the Senate.\u201d\n\nBy the time Sessions was done, on the eve of the Senate vote, calls from the bill\u2019s opponents had shut down the Capitol switchboard. \u201cPeople were sending bricks through the mail and saying, \u2018Use this to build a wall,\u2019 that sort of thing,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Senate in 1996, Sessions had no special interest in immigration but, as a career prosecutor, he says the 2007 bill, which would have granted amnesty to the millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States, \u201cjust went against my understanding of what law in America was about.\u201d\n\nSessions grew up in the rural town of Hybart, Ala., where his family ran a country store and, he has said, he learned \u201cthe value of hard work and being honest.\u201d He was a Republican even when the South was strongly Democratic. At Huntingdon College in the late 1960s, he was involved with the GOP, and in his senior year he became chairman of the campus chapter of the Young Republicans.\n\nEven before he came to Washington he had spent much of his career in public service, first as a U.S. attorney in Mobile and then as state attorney general. In 1986, when Sessions was 39, President Reagan nominated him to the federal district court in Alabama.\n\nSessions has always been willing to take on unpopular fights. As U.S. attorney, he prosecuted a group of African-American civil-rights activists for voter fraud, and his nomination prompted charges of racism from local and national officials. Colleagues at the Department of Justice accused him of racism, too, and the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy warned that he would be a \u201cthrowback to a shameful era.\u201d A black colleague and even a local black journalist testified on his behalf. Ultimately, his nomination was defeated. In an unusual turn of events, Senator Howell Heflin, a conservative Democrat who was expected to support his fellow Alabamian, bucked tradition and cast the deciding vote against him.\n\nSessions ran for the Senate in 1996 after serving two years as state attorney general and got some revenge: He won the seat held by the retiring Heflin. His victory was important for the GOP, too, as part of Alabama\u2019s political realignment and that of the South more broadly. In 1994, Republicans had won the governorship and several other statewide offices. The 1996 elections tested the permanence of those victories, and Sessions\u2019s triumph helped to consolidate the GOP\u2019s gains.\n\nSessions says that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform, which would address many of the thorny immigration issues facing the country in a single bill rather than in smaller pieces, began redoubling their efforts on June 8, 2007, the day after a Bush-backed bill to bring it about was defeated. To the rest of us, it wasn\u2019t until the day after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in the 2012 presidential election that a new immigration bill began to look not just realistic but inevitable. Three days after the election, former George W. Bush aide Mark McKinnon opined, \u201cThe best thing about Republicans\u2019 losing is that it will likely force them to cut an immigration deal.\u201d An NBC News headline declared, \u201cGOP resistance to immigration reform could be a casualty of 2012 election.\u201d The Washington Post explained that \u201cthe GOP needs to do immigration reform \u2014 now.\u201d The Republican National Committee, in its postmortem election report, came to the same conclusion.\n\nA year and a half later, the landscape looks much different. House majority leader Eric Cantor is widely considered a casualty of the immigration issue. And, with Central American children flooding over the southern border, comprehensive immigration reform is, for the time being, all but dead.\n\n#page#More than any other national figure, Sessions is responsible for that turn of events. As the Senate debated the proposal of a group of eight senators \u2014 known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2014 for comprehensive reform last year, and then as the House toyed with passing it in various incarnations throughout the spring, Sessions\u2019s office served as Ground Zero for the opposition. His staff circulated scholarly studies on Capitol Hill, sent dozens of policy memos to sway ambivalent lawmakers, and relentlessly hassled reporters about the perceived biases in their coverage.\n\nSessions himself met privately with Republicans in both houses of Congress to persuade them of his views. He also broadcast them in public, taking the Senate floor more than any other lawmaker last year. He spoke for a total of 39 hours, more even than did his colleagues Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who made national headlines for staging hours-long filibusters. \u201cWithout Sessions, I see that amnesty probably would\u2019ve been rammed through,\u201d says radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham, who undertook her own crusade to scuttle the legislation.\n\n#ad#Sessions opposes not only providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u2014 many Republicans are against that \u2014 but also raising the level of legal immigration. The Gang of Eight\u2019s bill would have markedly increased it, and Sessions was one of the few voices on Capitol Hill arguing that even legal immigration hurts Americans, particularly when the economy is weak and unemployment high.\n\nHe has cast himself as a Beltway champion of the middle class, and his message of economic populism is part of a broader attempt to revitalize it. For Sessions, the issue of immigration illustrates better than anything else the divide between the ruling class \u2014 the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d \u2014 and working-class Americans, with the vast majority of CEOs and business owners favoring reform that, as he sees it, would deal a blow to America\u2019s poor and middle-class workers. He has time and again cited Congressional Budget Office findings that increased immigration lowers wages overall but particularly for the poor. And, though many Republicans have called for allowing high-skilled immigrants into the U.S., particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, Sessions has repeatedly drawn attention to statistics suggesting we have more than enough.\n\nSo when, less than two months after Romney\u2019s loss, Florida senator and Republican rising star Marco Rubio made it clear he would take the lead in negotiating an immigration-reform proposal with Democrats and the Obama administration, Sessions prepared for battle. Rubio had nearly all of the major financial forces in the GOP behind him; Sessions had history on his side.\n\nHe compares the efforts of the pro-reform crowd to a highly orchestrated presidential campaign: \u201cThey had exceedingly capable political consultants, they had pollsters to ask the right questions to get the best possible polling numbers, they had TV advertisements, they had rock-star Republicans supporting it, and they felt the train couldn\u2019t be stopped,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to the Sunlight Foundation, business and political groups spent more than $1.5 billion between 2008 and 2012 on pro-reform lobbying. Norm Coleman\u2019s American Action Network aired ads on Fox News urging viewers to call Rubio to \u201cthank him for keeping his promise, and fighting to secure the border.\u201d Americans for a Conservative Direction, led by former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, ran ads calling on viewers to \u201cstand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.\u201d Americans for Prosperity, a nonprofit group funded by the Koch brothers\u2019 donor network, moved its 2013 conference from Washington, D.C., to Orlando, Fla., and featured Rubio as the keynote speaker. It was the rare issue, says Ingraham, on which the Left and the Right were \u201ccompletely in cahoots with one another.\u201d\n\nAs the legislation took shape, Sessions tried to slow it down in part by drawing attention to the swiftness with which some lawmakers were trying to move it through the Senate. Lawmakers had had two and a half weeks to read the 844-page bill when Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy scheduled it for a markup. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t think we want is delay just for delay\u2019s sake,\u201d New York senator Chuck Schumer, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said at a committee hearing in late April 2013. Schumer\u2019s strategy, says a Sessions aide, was \u201cto move faster than the truth can travel.\u201d\n\nAt the same committee hearing, Sessions gave Schumer a reason for delay. He pointed to an article in the Christian Science Monitor noting that even those involved in crafting the legislation didn\u2019t know exactly how many new immigrants it would allow into the country. He went on to read from the text of the bill to illustrate why it was difficult for some to parse. \u201cThe discretionary authority under clause one i may not be used to waive\u201d \u2014 he paused, right hand in the air \u2014 \u201croman numeral one, sub-paragraph b, c, d 2, i, e, g, h, or i of section 212 a-2, then, roman numeral two, section 212 a-3, then, roman numeral three, sub-paragraph a, c, d, e of section 212 a-10.\u201d His staff, he told his colleagues, had been working for days \u201ctrying to decipher this gobbledygook.\u201d Flashing a smile, he looked at Schumer and said that he\u2019d do his best to be ready to vote on the legislation. \u201cBut count me as a, a bit of a protest.\u201d\n\nAs the bill moved through the Senate, Sessions used details like these to embarrass its supporters. His efforts were aimed not at them but at the few senators who hadn\u2019t yet made up their minds and, even more important, at the dozens of undecided Republicans in the House of Representatives, which would ultimately decide the bill\u2019s fate. Sessions likes to refer to \u201ctrue facts,\u201d and he says he felt a \u201cduty to try to educate people on what I thought were the true facts.\u201d\n\nSenator David Vitter was a key ally, and together they plotted legislative strategy. The Louisiana Republican, Sessions says, is \u201cextremely effective in understanding Senate procedures,\u201d and he raised questions about the Gang of Eight\u2019s commitment to securing the border when he forced the Senate to vote on, and reject, an amendment to the bill that would have prohibited legalization before the implementation of a biometric border-check-in system. In April, the duo exasperated Democrats again when Vitter wrote, and Sessions raised on the Senate floor, an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez: Vitter noted Chavez\u2019s support for a \u201csecure Southern border\u201d and \u201cenforcement of our immigration laws.\u201d That put New Jersey\u2019s Robert Menendez, who had introduced the resolution, in an awkward position as he objected to the amendment.\n\n#page#The Gang of Eight\u2019s bill passed 68 to 32. Its supporters had hoped for 70 yea votes. \u201cIt was wounded when it got to the House, wasn\u2019t any doubt about that,\u201d Sessions says.\n\nThe events that unfolded over the next few months didn\u2019t help it. On July 2, the Obama administration quietly announced in a blog post that it would delay for a year the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate. With that, Vitter says, skepticism among Republicans that the president could be trusted to enforce the proposed immigration legislation \u201cwent on steroids.\u201d When House members returned from their July 4 recess, says one Republican congressman, \u201canybody who opposed amnesty-first-type legislation could simply say, \u2018Look, if he\u2019s not going to enforce a core part of his namesake legislation, what makes you think he\u2019s going to enforce anything that we pass?\u2019\u201d\n\n#ad#Nonetheless, July was filled with talk about whether House leaders would use a conference committee to resolve their disputes with the Senate over the bill. On her radio show, Laura Ingraham sought to prevent them from doing so. Her interviews with GOP House members, regardless of the topic, ended with the same question: \u201cWill you go to conference on immigration, yes or no?\u201d She also made a presidential endorsement. \u201cJeff Sessions, we need Jeff Sessions for president,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, is there anyone out there who is better than Jeff Sessions on any of these issues?\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers left Washington for their annual August recess, Sessions sent House Republicans home with a memo. Dated July 29, 2013, and addressed to \u201cRepublican colleagues,\u201d it sought to refute the political and economic arguments in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans lost the 2012 election not because Mitt Romney won too few Hispanic votes, he said, but because the GOP \u201chemorrhaged support from middle- and low-income Americans.\u201d While many Republicans had argued that an influx of immigration would aid American businesses, Sessions asked, \u201cWhat about the needs of workers?\u201d He urged them to embrace a \u201chumble and honest populism.\u201d\n\nThe argument took. Among House members, the political argument was particularly effective. After the 2012 election, says one Republican congressman, \u201cit was almost just accepted that you\u2019d do the amnesty and then you\u2019d do better amongst Latino voters.\u201d Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did relatively well among Hispanics: Reagan won 37 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1984, and Bush won 40 percent in 2004. Though both supported amnesty, neither campaigned on the issue. In the first election after Reagan signed the 1986 immigration bill, which legalized over 2 million people, George H. W. Bush earned just 30 percent of the Hispanic vote. John McCain, who had for years championed comprehensive immigration reform, did little better.\n\nEventually even Republican supporters began to concede there would be no political payoff. In a closed-door meeting, says the congressman, \u201cPaul Ryan eventually said immigration reform won\u2019t help us win more votes, but \u2018this is something we need to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the new year, House leaders had decided to scrap the Senate bill entirely. But opponents of amnesty like to refer to comprehensive immigration reform as a \u201czombie issue\u201d \u2014 one that time and again springs back to life \u2014 and the House leadership decided to sell their colleagues on a set of immigration principles, including a path to citizenship, unveiled shortly before their January retreat at a golf resort in Cambridge, Md.\n\nOn January 28, the day before they decamped from D.C., Sessions sent a 30-page memo to House Republicans. He said that the principles unveiled by House leaders resembled in every important way what he referred to as the \u201cSenate Democrat / White House plan.\u201d Complete with a table of contents that catalogued the \u201cmyths\u201d propagated by the bill\u2019s supporters, Sessions argued in footnote-full and chart-filled detail against the claims put forward by House leaders. The memo also included a \u201cchartbook\u201d on the adverse economic impact of mass immigration.\n\n\u201cLots of members rebelled against the principles,\u201d says a House member who was in on several private discussions. The congressman says that when they were discussed in a closed-door meeting of the Republican conference back in Washington, Boehner addressed the room and said, \u201cLook, I got the message.\u201d\n\nIn early February, both Boehner and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said they couldn\u2019t see an immigration deal happening, but the issue popped up again in April when the Wall Street Journal reported that Boehner had told donors at a Las Vegas fundraiser he was \u201chell-bent\u201d on passing an immigration bill in 2014. The speaker finally threw his hands up at the end of the month. \u201cEvery time the president ignores the law like the 38 times he has on Obamacare,\u201d he said, \u201cour members look up and go, \u2018Wait a minute.\u2019\u201d\n\nSessions characterizes Eric Cantor\u2019s primary defeat in June and the humanitarian crisis unfolding on the southern border as \u201cexclamation points\u201d on his efforts over the past year. The latter has proved disastrous for the Obama administration and for those who supported the Gang of Eight bill, offering a national illustration of the catastrophic impact of lax immigration laws. \u201cA few years ago,\u201d says a Republican congressman who opposes amnesty, \u201cpeople like me could predict what was going to happen. Now we don\u2019t have to predict, we just point.\u201d\n\nCongress has yet to come up with any viable legislation to stem the tide of illegal immigrants and young children pouring over the border. The House last week passed\u00a0a symbolic bill that increases funding to deploy National Guard troops to the border and closes a\u00a0loophole in a 2008 law, making it easier to deport the unaccompanied minors entering the country. The Democratic Senate blocked the bill and jetted off on vacation.\n\nThe result of Sessions\u2019s efforts is that the president is now left with just one option to accomplish his goal: implementing an executive order that would grant amnesty to between 6 and 9 million illegal immigrants. It won\u2019t be couched in the feel-good language of the Gang of Eight bill, and it will come with enormous political costs.\n\nThe denouement, if you can call it that, offers an important political lesson: Intensity matters. It is said more often of the fight over gun control, but it is true of all political battles. Opponents of amnesty, Sessions chief among them, proved more passionate and energetic than their adversaries. For over a year, Sessions and his staff owned the immigration issue every day. Though supporters of the legislation, both in 2007 and 2013, peddled a narrative of inevitability, Sessions helped nurture and give expression to the skepticism of many Republican voters whose voices weren\u2019t represented by the CEOs and lobbyists who helped craft the bill.\n\nAnd he won, both times.
