Everyone knows why the White House set up an interview for President Obama with Zach Galifianakis on “Between Two Ferns” on FunnyorDie.com. The site, founded in 2007, appeals to just the audience that the administration needs to reach as it seeks out young and healthy people to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

A rep for FunnyorDie.com tells the Erik Wemple Blog that the site’s demographic is 60 percent male with “an age demo of 18-34.” It racks up north of 60 million video views per month. Says Susan Etlinger, an analyst with the Altimeter Group: “If you want to reach young people, you have to go where they are, and where they are is web TV.”

And if you want to reach old people, you have to go where they are, and where they are is Fox News. As Gallup reported last year, “nearly two-thirds of Fox News-oriented news consumers are 50 and older, compared with barely a third of CNN-oriented news consumers.” New York Magazine reported in January that Fox News has a median viewer age of 68, eight years higher than CNN and MSNBC.

Perhaps without even intending to, the president has reached the older set with the Galifianakis session. This morning’s edition of “Fox & Friends,” for example, replayed a key segment for its viewers. Sure, co-host Brian Kilmeade declared the whole thing “so inappropriate,” but the program replayed Obama saying the following: “Healthcare.gov works great now, and millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans and what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable health care.”

Later in the day, on Fox News’s “Happening Now,” the Obama-Galifianakis repartee got another round of re-airing and analysis. And the day’s still young! Who knows what Van Susteren and O’Reilly and Kelly and Hannity have planned for the primetime hours?

Kilmeade asked, “Should the president of the United States be doing this online?” If Fox News agrees to share so prodigiously, then yes.
