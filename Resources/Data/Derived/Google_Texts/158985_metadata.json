Medics were called to Rogers\u2019 home in Seattle around 12:45 pm local time to see Rogers unresponsive.\n\nPolice officers were called and Rogers was declared dead at the scene from a suspected drug overdose, reports KIRO-7. Rogers\u2019 death was a sad ending to a once-promising career.\n\nThe US football star was an All-American and first-round NFL draft pick. Rogers was drafted by the Detroit Lions in 1987, but experienced his first troubles with the law shortly after when he killed three teenagers in a DUI crash in 1988.\n\nRogers\u2019 blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit and he ultimately spent one year in jail after he was found guilty of negligent homicide. The Lions dropped him during that time, notes The Seattle Times.\n\nThe former football player\u2019s record included six DUI convictions and he was under investigation for domestic violence charges at the time of his incident stemming from an incident involving his wife earlier this month.\n\nReggie Rogers allegedly grabbed his wife by the collar of her bathrobe during a fight on October 7 and hit her over the head with a flashlight. He also threw the object at her when she left through the kitchen door. The 56-year-old woman ran to a neighbor\u2019s house and called 911 on Rogers.\n\nThe man was arrested and charged in the incident. Rogers entered a not guilty plea to the charges and had a domestic violence pre-custody hearing scheduled for Monday. Rogers was the younger brother of Don Rogers, an All-American safety at UCLA and NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year with the Cleveland Browns. Don died in 1986 at the age of 23 of a heart attack related to a cocaine overdose.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what Reggie Rogers\u2019 cause of death was.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former University of Washington football star Reggie Rogers died on Thursday morning at the age of 49.
