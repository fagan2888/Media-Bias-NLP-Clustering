Hockey fans lent a helping hand at the Ralston Arena Sunday.

From 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. the Omaha Lancers held their annual blood drive.

Lucky fans got the chance to meet their favorite players and some even took home prizes.

Players said it’s a great chance to meet their biggest supporters.

"Get to know the fans, the reason we get to play in this great facility. We appreciate everything they do, so we're just trying to give back a little bit,” said Jimmy Schuldt, of the Omaha Lancers.

Everyone who donated Sunday took home tickets to Tuesday’s Lancers versus Des Moines Buccaneers game.
