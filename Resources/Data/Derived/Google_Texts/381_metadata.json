Kiz, tell me you\u2019re not another one of those guys who can quote every Peyton Manning stat in the book. There are two kinds of quarterbacks. One focuses on the numbers he will put down in the stat book; the other is focused on the numbers he will put up on the scoreboard. Manning is the former. Brock Osweiler is the latter. The latter wins Super Bowls. The former crumbles under pressure during the playoffs.\n\nL.T., representing the 970\n\nKiz: There\u2019s a great divide in Broncos Country that I didn\u2019t see coming. Those who really love Osweiler often really dislike Manning. Why? Well, here\u2019s my theory: Rocky Mountain raised, Osweiler was welcomed into the family from Day One of his NFL career. Hey, Brock: Can we buy you a beer? On the other hand, Manning \u2014 cerebral, a little distant and definitely not a cowboy \u2014 will forever be viewed by some fans as an Indianapolis Colt in Broncos clothing. Hey, Peyton: You ain\u2019t from around here, are you?\n\nJournalistic jerk. I found it interesting that you wrote a column about how Nuggets rookie Emmanuel Mudiay remains confident despite his struggles. You shed a national light on Mudiay being \u201cthe worst point guard in the NBA\u201d and perhaps do worse damage to his confidence than his performance warrants. No one expects you to be the best writer in the world, but try not to be an un- warranted jerk.\n\nMatt, roots for home team\n\nKiz: Yes, Mudiay is only 19 years old. He\u2019s also paid $3 million to do a job. And, right now, he can\u2019t do that job as well as teammate Jameer Nelson. If you\u2019re coach Michael Malone, and you regularly sacrifice victories so Mudiay can learn from his mistakes, the strategy invites cynical eye rolls by the veteran Denver players who really do want to win. That\u2019s one way a team quits on a season.\n\nSchool of hardwood. Nice column on Mudiay. It needed to be said. He\u2019s not ready to be where he\u2019s at. Mudiay has a real shaky handle, a flawed, staggered-foot jumper and not enough hops to finish when he penetrates to rim. I know he\u2019s young, and sounds like a great kid, but he wouldn\u2019t be a starter for a lot of top Division I college teams. Just saying.\n\nTerry, Highlands Ranch\n\nKiz: Mudiay is a prime example of why the NBA might be a wonderful place to get paid, but college is a far better place for a young player\u2019s basketball education.\n\nTable for two. And today\u2019s parting shot throws respected, intelligent and (darn handsome, I might add) television journalist Vic Lombardi under the same bus as yours truly. We\u2019re gonna need a bigger bus!\n\nI have met the enemy, Kiz. You have a bad attitude about the Broncos. It\u2019s OK to point out their weaknesses so they can improve, but to hate and condemn and spit on this team is a disgrace. You and Lombardi belong in the same pit: junk mail.\n\nAndrew, bandwagon driver", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Final score: Brock Osweiler beats Peyton Manning on the \u2018board", "title": "Final score: Brock Osweiler beats Peyton Manning on the \u2018board", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/final-score-brock-osweiler-beats-peyton-manning-on-the-board/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__SP24FBNBRONCOS_KN10913p1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__SP24FBNBRONCOS_KN10913p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T21:12:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:41:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Brock Osweiler, Kickin' It With Kiz, Peyton Manning"}, "article_summary": "Kiz, tell me you\u2019re not another one of those guys who can quote every Peyton Manning stat in the book.\nThose who really love Osweiler often really dislike Manning.\nI know he\u2019s young, and sounds like a great kid, but he wouldn\u2019t be a starter for a lot of top Division I college teams.\nWell, here\u2019s my theory: Rocky Mountain raised, Osweiler was welcomed into the family from Day One of his NFL career.\nI found it interesting that you wrote a column about how Nuggets rookie Emmanuel Mudiay remains confident despite his struggles."}
