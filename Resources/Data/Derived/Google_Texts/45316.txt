Chris Matthews had some very bleak words for President Obama on Friday's "Morning Joe."

When asked who he thought were the "political losers" of 2013, Matthews declared that it was none other than the president.

The MSNBC host said it's been a "terrible year" for Obama. Matthews — who has been a vocal supporter of Obama in the past — sighed when Joe Scarborough noted that the president's second-term inauguration was just last year.

“It’s not just a bad year in terms of the rollout,” Matthews said, referring to the White House's botched attempts to implement Obamacare. “There’s an erosion in interest. It feels like a very long presidency now. It feels like the seventh or eighth year of a presidency. It doesn’t feel like the fifth. There wasn't that rejuvenation that comes with a re-election. There was no sense of wow. I think that's hurt him a lot."

He added that other presidents have made comebacks during the latter portion of their terms. "But he's gotta be better than that," Matthews said about Obama. "He's young. He's got to come back with some gusto and I don't see him rebuilding a team."
