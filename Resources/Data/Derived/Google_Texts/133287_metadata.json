Stephanie Saenz/Special to the Times Record News A Midwestern State nursing student practices checking a patient's pulse.\n\nBy Stephanie Saenz\n\nThe new school year for many college students is well underway. While there are numerous majors to choose from, a rise in the number of nursing and other health care majors is steadfast.\n\nBefore the 2014-15 school year, 33 percent of Midwestern State University enrollment was devoted to health care. That number has risen to 39 percent, said Dr. James Johnston, dean of the College of Health and Human Services. The increase, he added, is due to demand and stability.\n\nJohnston explained that when the economy gets bad, people tend to look for a stable career.\n\nHealth care, Johnston said, traditionally fits that bill, since there is also always going to be a demand for health services, students feel comfortable making the decision to choose a major in that field.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) added anywhere between 30 (million) and 40 million people to insurance,\u201d Johnston said, \u201cwhich ultimately meant that more people were added to an already overburdened system.\u201d\n\nThe \u201chigher than usual demand\u201d can be consequential to the number of people living in the baby boomer generation versus the \u201cbaby bust\u201d generation.\n\n\u201cThe smaller baby bust generation is nearly required to care for the larger group of now older people who have access to health care, well care, and have overcome chronic illnesses,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the numbers within the two generations can\u2019t balance, demand for health services will nearly always be greater than supply.\n\nJohnston said that every year, 180 students are accepted into the nursing program, more than 60 into the radiology program, and many more into other health care programs.\n\n\u201cWichita Falls cannot support as many (students) that graduate each year, but the state and country can.\u201d\n\nThis provides a sense of mobility and security among current students, and soon-to-be or recently graduated students.\n\nAlthough the health care field has been primarily female students, more male students are making their way into this career field, as well. Men are joining the nursing and radiology programs more frequently than before.\n\nThe age of those studying health care varies greatly. However, there are more traditional students now.\n\nJohnston reasons that \u201cattending college depends on economic factors.\u201d Many people are delayed in going to college but still have those dreams, which is where the smaller number of nontraditional students comes from.\n\nThe growth in health care studies, the dean stated, is very proportionate with the university as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe increase is good for the university. It is not just a human services growth but a university growth as well,\u201d adding that the College of Health and Human Services must grow proportionately with the university to be a success.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Economy, ACA bring growth to MSU health sciences college", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesrecordnews.com/lifestyle/economy-aca-bring-growth-to-msu-health-sciences-college-ep-614158444-332462742.html", "image": {"width": 314, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/msu_nursing1_8041091_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "The new school year for many college students is well underway.
