TRENTON — Steve Lonegan isn’t the only former Republican U.S. Senate candidate making another appearance this year.

Dr. Alieta Eck, who lost badly to Lonegan in the August 2013 GOP primary, plans to kick off a campaign for Congress in the 12th Congressional District on Thursday, her campaign announced today.

A press release from Eck teased a Thursday afternoon “major political announcement” at the Zarephath Health Center in Somerset. Eck’s spokesman, Chris Pordon, confirmed that it is to kick off her campaign.

Eck, who mainly based her campaign against Obamacare, hopes to run against longtime Democratic incumbent Rush Holt. Holt is one of the most liberal members of Congress. Holt supports Obamacare but doesn’t think it goes far enough, preferring a single-payer option.

Eck founded the health care center where she will kick off her campaign. It serves as a clinic for the poor and uninsured. She'll have a tough battle if she wins the GOP nomination. Holt has held the seat since 1998. And while the district was once competitive, it has gotten increasingly Democratic.

Lonegan is moving to South Jersey where he plans to run for the seat being vacated by two-term U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan (R-3rd Dist.)
