Nancy Pelosi in 2009. (AP / Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill keep telling everyone how terribly shocked they are by the tawdry tale of Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House indicted last week for violations of federal money-laundering statutes in an effort to cover up alleged sexual abuse of a male high-school student many years ago.\n\nLong upheld as a paragon of Midwestern conservative values, Hastert represented a suburban Illinois district and became his party\u2019s longest-serving speaker. Like Newt Gingrich, who preceded him in that post, Hastert avidly prosecuted the impeachment of Bill Clinton for trying to conceal an extramarital affair. Unlike Gingrich, whose own serial adulteries became a national joke, Hastert was evidently never suspected of any such \u201cmisconduct,\u201d as the indictment described it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how this didn\u2019t come up on the radar before,\u201d said a former Hastert aide following the release of his indictment. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of beyond belief.\u201d\n\nBut is it truly beyond belief, at this very late date, to learn that yet another moralizing politician or preacher was always just a hypocrite? Not unless you haven\u2019t been paying attention for the past two decades or so. Or not you\u2019ve been mesmerized into believing the propaganda that claims only one party\u2014the GOP\u2014represents \u201cfamily values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nA decade ago, Hastert was hailed as a partisan symbol of superior virtue, notably in John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge\u2019s \u201cThe Right Nation: Conservative Power in America,\u201d which gleefully predicted endless victories for the Republicans and doom for the Democrats. Written by a pair of British Tories who then held top positions at The Economist magazine, that work invidiously contrasted then-Speaker Hastert with Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, his counterpart on the other side of the aisle\u2014and described their districts as symbols of red and blue America.\n\nMicklethwait and Wooldridge waxed on lyrically and at great length in praise of Coach Denny and \u201cHastertland,\u201d while they cast a censorious gaze upon Nancy and \u201cPelosiville,\u201d also known as San Francisco or in their words, \u201cthe capital of gay America.\u201d Their description of Hastert\u2014\u201ca fairly straightforward conservative: antiabortion, anti-gay marriage\u201d\u2014rings with irony today. So does their depiction of Pelosi\u2019s urban constituency as \u201ca peculiar mix of blue bloods and gays, dotcom millionaires and aging hippies,\u201d set against the \u201cresolutely \u2018normal\u2019 \u201d people represented by Hastert, who \u201cthink of themselves as typical Americans.\u201d\n\nKey to understanding the two districts and therefore American politics, according to the authors, were differing attitudes toward \u201cthe importance of family life,\u201d orthodox religion, and \u201csocial disorder.\u201d In Hastertland, churches and families were growing, streets were clean, and vagrancy eliminated\u2014and in Pelosiville exactly the reverse, with secularism rampant, bums everywhere and even an outpost of the Church of Satan.\n\n\u201cLooking at \u2018Pelosiville\u2019 and \u2018Hastertland,\u2019 \u201d they concluded, \u201cit is not difficult to see why American politics has shifted to the Right.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, \u201cThe Right Nation\u201d was mostly wrong, about the fates of the two major parties and much else besides. But what was most wrong was the insinuation that Republicans stand for more elevated values than Democrats, or that conservatives are morally purer than liberals. To take their own example, we now know what we know about Hastert\u2014and we also know that Pelosi, mother of five, grandmother of eight, married more than 50 years to the same husband, advocate of gay marriage and reproductive rights, is today far more credible as a symbol of \u201cfamily values\u201d and family life.\n\nNone of this should be surprising, with all due respect to the shocked, shocked, shocked Republicans. In 2003, after Hastert already had ascended to third in line from the presidency, I reviewed the endless ranks of right-wing moral mountebanks\u2014the cheating celebrity evangelists, the homophobic gay politicians, the lecherous legislators, and others too raunchy to mention here\u2014in one chapter of a book called \u201cBig Lies.\u201d I included many stories about Hastert\u2019s House colleagues, partying amid their pursuit of Clinton; some were amusing, some quite depressing. Of course, I didn\u2019t know about \u201cCoach Denny\u201d back then.\n\nBut with or without his sad story, the conclusion would be the same: Liberals \u201ccare about families and children just as much as conservatives do\u2014and that their more tolerant, humane policies do more to help families than the selfish and self-righteous approach of the Republican right.\u201d\n\nWhat should have changed by now, whenever conservatives start to cluck about their rectitude and piety, is whether anybody still listens.\n\n\n\nTo find out more about Joe Conason and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "dennis hastert, family values, hastert scandal, house speaker, joe conason, nancy pelosi, politics, speaker hastert", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Republicans on Capitol Hill keep telling everyone how terribly shocked they are by the tawdry tale of Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House indicted last week on charges of money-laundering in an effort to cover up alleged sexual abuse of a male high school student many years ago. \n - 2015/06/06", "title": "Dennis Hastert, Nancy Pelosi and America\u2019s \u2018Family Values\u2019: Joe Conason", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/dennis_hastert_nancy_pelosi_and_americas_family_values_20150606", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/pelosihastert_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans on Capitol Hill keep telling everyone how terribly shocked they are by the tawdry tale of Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House indicted last week on charges of money-laundering in an effort to cover up alleged sexual abuse of a male high school student many years ago.", "title": "Dennis Hastert, Nancy Pelosi and America\u2019s \u2018Family Values\u2019 | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/dennis_hastert_nancy_pelosi_and_americas_family_values_20150606/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/pelosihastert_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Dennis Hastert, Nancy Pelosi and America\u2019s \u2018Family Values\u2019, dennis hastert, family values, hastert scandal, house speaker, joe conason, nancy pelosi, politics, speaker hastert", "article": {"tag": "dennis hastert, family values, hastert scandal, house speaker, joe conason, nancy pelosi, politics, speaker hastert", "published_time": "2015-06-06T07:00:43-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-06T07:17:44-08:00"}, "description": "Republicans on Capitol Hill keep telling everyone how terribly shocked they are by the tawdry tale of Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House indicted last week on charges of money-laundering in an effort to cover up alleged sexual abuse of a male high school student many years ago. \n - 2015/06/06"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9565\"", "article_summary": "None of this should be surprising, with all due respect to the shocked, shocked, shocked Republicans.\nBy Joe ConasonCurrent House Speaker John Boehner, left, with former Speaker Dennis Hastert and Rep.
