The more money goes in, the more terrorism comes out.\n\nImprisoned Palestinian terrorist Husni Najjar explained to Israeli Police that he planned a second terror attack in order to be captured and imprisoned by Israel a second time, so that he would receive the salaries the Palestinian Authority pays to prisoners while in jail and following their release\n\nHe explained that PA law grants terrorists imprisoned for more than five years a salary of 4,000 shekels ($1140) a month, which continues for three years following their release from prison. This is in addition to monthly salary payments while in prison.\n\nThe terrorist explained that because his first imprisonment for planning a suicide terror attack (which was foiled) lasted less than five years, it was not enough to prompt the 4,000 shekels ($1140) monthly salary upon release. He therefore planned another attack in order to reach a total of five years in prison, which would entitle him to the additional salary upon his second release, which would cover his debts.\n\nPrisoner Najjar: \"And after [my] release [from prison]... I had a bank account with 45,000 shekels ($12,822) from [my] salary from the Palestinian Ministry of Prisoners' Affairs... and there remained a deficit of 30,000 shekels ($8548) for the wedding...\n\nI decided to arrange an imaginary plan for the Israeli Shabak [Israel's General Security Service] so that I would be arrested... After I would spend five years [in prison] I would receive a salary of about 4,000 shekels ($1140) [upon release], and this amount would be for three years. That means there would be a total amount of 135,000 shekels ($38467) (the correct amount would equal 144,000 shekels ($41,031) - Ed.) and then I would cover my debts.\"", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The Palestinian Authority is one big magnet for terrorism.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The Palestinian Authority is one big magnet for terrorism.", "title": "Muslim Terrorist in Israel Plotted Terror Attack for US Tax Dollars", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/218994/muslim-terrorist-israel-plotted-terror-attack-us-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:46:58-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/218994/muslim-terrorist-israel-plotted-terror-attack-us-daniel-greenfield", "description": "The Palestinian Authority is one big magnet for terrorism.", "card": "summary", "title": "Muslim Terrorist in Israel Plotted Terror Attack for US Tax Dollars"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T11:26:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:46:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb266\"", "article_summary": "The terrorist explained that because his first imprisonment for planning a suicide terror attack (which was foiled) lasted less than five years, it was not enough to prompt the 4,000 shekels ($1140) monthly salary upon release.\nThat means there would be a total amount of 135,000 shekels ($38467) (the correct amount would equal 144,000 shekels ($41,031) - Ed.)\nThis is yet another example of how the Palestinian Authority is one big magnet for terrorism.\nHe therefore planned another attack in order to reach a total of five years in prison, which would entitle him to the additional salary upon his second release, which would cover his debts.\nPrisoner Najjar: \"And after [my] release [from prison]..."}
