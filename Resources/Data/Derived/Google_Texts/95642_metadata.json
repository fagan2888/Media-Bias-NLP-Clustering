With the help of the Chamber, Knight toured several businesses in the Santa Clarita Valley and talked with their owners about the challenges they face in growing their operation. As a member of the House Small Business Committee, Knight has championed multiple bills that would address these problems at the federal level.\n\nRepresentative Steve Knight, (R-Antelope Valley), represents California\u2019s 25th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives, which includes the communities throughout the Antelope, Santa Clarita and Simi Valleys.\n\nEd.
