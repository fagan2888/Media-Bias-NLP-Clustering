Recent studies by government agencies, organized labor and human rights groups show that they suffer a disproportionate amount of of abuse and injury in the workplace. Latinos also have some of the lowest wages in the U.S., thanks in part to the fact that they are more often robbed of their earnings through various forms of wage theft like the denial of overtime and the denial of the minimum wage.\n\nLabor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA) sent us a new study that, among other things, observed that Latinos are dying more in the workplace, despite declines in deaths of workers in other groups. Here are our top 5 takeaways from that report.\n\nDeath: LCLAA writes that \u201c797 Latinos died at the workplace [in 2013], constituting the highest death toll for Latinos since 2008 and higher than any other working minority. Of those 797 Latinos, 527 were immigrants,\u201d citing a 2015 U.S Department of Labor study.\n\nLatinos suffer a higher incidence of injury in death because they are more represented in dangerous industries like construction, agriculture and transportation.\n\nInjury and illness: cases of injury and illness are actually down among Latino workers, as they are with workers in general. However, work conditions are improving at a slower rate for Latinos.\n\nThe result? They\u2019re baring a bigger proportion of those cases, from 9 percent in 1995 to 12 percent in 2012, according to U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures cited in an AFL-CIO report .\n\nBenefits, like Health Care: Despite gains following the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), around a quarter of Latino workers are still uninsured.\n\nWith lower than average educational attainment, especially among the foreign-born, Latinos are less likely to work jobs that provide benefits like maternity leave.\n\nLow wages: Hispanics made $578 per week in 2013, according to the BLS. That\u2019s significantly less than the next-less-paid group, blacks, who make $629. Whites made an estimated $978 per week that year. (LCALAA notes that unionized Latinos made $838 per week.)\n\nSexual assault, harassment: Two-thirds of Latinas in the Southern U.S. say that sexual assault is a major issue at their work, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center*. While Hispanic men are more likely work in accident-heavy industries that result in bodily injury, Latinas are more likely to work in companies that have high rates of sexual harassment such as hotels and restaurants.\n\n*Defined as \u201cany unwanted sexual act, including but not limited to touching, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexual assault and rape, perpetrated against a person through force or coercion.\u201d\n\nHave you been mistreated at work?
