Snopes deflates (or verifies) 15 Texas urban legends

The rumors and outright lies spread so fast through Texas that it can be hard to keep up.

Does the Texas Capitol face south to honor a horrific Texas Revolution massacre? Nah. Did a shark appear in local streets during Houston flooding last May? Definitely not. Did University of Texas at Austin medical students help rob a hard-partying student of his kidney? The Austin institution doesn’t even have a medical school!

But these urban legends keep coming up again and again. Luckily, Snopes (and PolitiFact) are there to save us from fishy social media posts and dubious chain e-mails forwarded by older relatives.

Sometimes, however, there turns out to be truth to what’s out there. In the seventies, Texas legislatures did pass a resolution to honor the Boston Strangler (by accident). And the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is based on a true story (sorta).
