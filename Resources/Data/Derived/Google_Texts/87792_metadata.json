Performance funding will help ensure colleges are offering meaningful degrees that will better prepare students for jobs and success careers.\n\nThe Florida House is committed to keeping the cost of higher education affordable in our state so more students have the opportunity to pursue their educational goals. This bill will help open doors to students who may think that college is out of their reach because of the financial hardship.\n\nHouses Passes Local Pension Reform\n\nThis week, the House passed Senate Bill 172 to reform local retirement plans for our city firefighters and police officers. The bill proposes what I believe are reasonable changes to city firefighter and police officer pension plans to help ensure the plans are stable and well-funded for the future.\n\nBy reforming these plans now, I believe we are taking the steps necessary to keep the retirement plans sustainable for our brave public servants and their families. By doing so, I also believe we are protecting the future of our police officers and firefighters who work hard to protect us from harm every day.\n\nEmpowering Persons with Disabilities\n\nThis week, the House passed several bills to expand pathways to economic independence for persons with disabilities, an important component of our Work Plan 2015 agenda.\n\nSenate Bills 642, 644, and 646 implement the federal ABLE Act in Florida. The Florida ABLE program created by these bills will assist individuals with disabilities and their families to save funds needed for future services without losing their eligibility for state and federal benefits.\n\nSimilar to the tax-advantaged college savings plans that allow families to responsibly save for their children\u2019s education, the ABLE program will establish a tax-exempt investment plan for beneficiaries, who may use the funds to pay for qualified disability expenses.\n\nPersonal Learning Scholarships Accounts\n\nSB 602 expands eligibility for Personal Learning Scholarships Accounts so a greater number of students with disabilities can benefit from the educational opportunities provided by the program.\n\nThese scholarships empower parents of students with disabilities to create a customized education plan by selecting appropriate placements or services that best meet the needs of their child.\n\nI believe it is important to provide educational opportunities that will provide families the ability to achieve more successful outcomes for their children with disabilities.\n\nI applaud the efforts of the Legislature to improve economic independence for persons with disabilities across our state.\n\nFor regular updates on House District 51, be sure to follow me on Facebook (Steve Crisafulli) and Twitter (@SteveCrisafulli).\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "florida house,homepage,slider,steve crisafulli", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CRISAFULLI-435.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "The House spent the majority of Week 8 on the floor discussing, debating, and voting on numerous pieces of legislation.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0569\"", "article_summary": "Florida House Passes Legislation To Make College More AffordableBy Steve Crisafulli // April 26, 2015Legislative Session UpdateTALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA \u2014 The House spent the majority of Week 8 on the floor discussing, debating and voting on numerous pieces of legislation.\nOne of the most important bills we passed this week was HB 7125, legislation designed to make college education more affordable for Florida families.\nThe Florida House is committed to keeping the cost of higher education affordable in our state so more students have the opportunity to pursue their educational goals.\nHouses Passes Local Pension ReformThis week, the House passed Senate Bill 172 to reform local retirement plans for our city firefighters and police officers.\nThis good bill, part of our Work Plan 2015 joint legislative agenda, addresses college affordability issues in several ways."}
