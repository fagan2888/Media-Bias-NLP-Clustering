It could lead to legal trouble for the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education, which oversees higher education in the Palmetto State.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s preliminary to say, but it\u2019s definitely our understanding that this is widespread,\u201d said Sam Brooke, a senior staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nS.C. Sen. Larry Grooms, R-Bonneau, said he stands by the state\u2019s policy. Grooms, who sponsored a major immigration-reform bill two years ago, said the tuition issue comes down to fairness.\n\n\u201cI think the policy should be the same if your parents are from Texas or from Mexico,\u201d he said. If the policy were to be changed, it would favor students with parents who are illegal, \u201cbecause parents from another state wouldn\u2019t benefit from in-state tuition in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nA similar policy already has been challenged in Florida, where the Southern Poverty Law Center last year filed suit against the agencies that oversee higher education there. The center won the case when a judge blocked the Sunshine State\u2019s tuition policy that forced U.S. citizens to pay out-of-state tuition because they were unable to prove their parents\u2019 federal immigration status.\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center officials wouldn\u2019t say if they plan to file suit in South Carolina, but Brooke said the state should \u201cread the tea leaves\u201d in regards to what happened in Florida.\n\n\u201cWe hope South Caroling will do the right thing. If they don\u2019t do the right thing, litigation might be necessary,\u201d Brooke said. \u201cWhether that will happen, I can\u2019t say. We hope that would never be necessary.\u201d\n\nJulie Carullo, spokeswoman for the S.C. Commission on Higher Education, said residency decisions are the responsibility of the schools based on \u201cfacts presented in each situation\u201d and following state laws and regulations. She said students also have the option of appealing, where they can provide additional information for consideration.\n\nBrooke said the Southern Poverty Law Center has assisted four students involving five universities in South Carolina, including the University of South Carolina and the College of Charleston, in the last two years to appeal the out-of-state tuition rates imposed.\n\nThe University of South Carolina did not respond to a request for comment. A College of Charleston representative said the school follows the commission\u2019s residency policies.\n\nBrooke said the center has reached out to the commission, and that placing the responsibility on the schools for the residency policy is \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true the schools make the ultimate decisions regarding applicants, it\u2019s the commission\u2019s job to enforce the rules. So for them to try to wash their hands of this is disingenuous.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s foul\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center filed suit in Florida in October 2011 against the two agencies overseeing higher education, the Florida Department of Education and the Board of Governors, as well as several colleges in the state.\n\nThe center claimed the agencies and schools were using a discriminatory practice.\n\nA year later a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida issued an order ruling that the policy was unconstitutional, violating the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. The order blocked the policy and forced the agencies to notify the schools and students about the change.\n\nJulie Alexander, the vice chancellor of academic and student affairs of the Florida Department of Education, which oversees the state\u2019s colleges, said dependents\u2019 parents would still have to prove residency in Florida, but no longer would use their immigration status as criteria.\n\n\u201cI think that it kind of alleviated some of the process implications for the colleges. Now they\u2019re not having to go that extra initial step to verify legal status,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cSo, from a process perspective, it made it a little easier.\u201d\n\nAlexander said the colleges didn\u2019t see a huge influx of students in this particular scenario entering the college system following the change. Some students already enrolled in college did get the opportunity to be reclassified, she said.\n\nBrittany Davis, spokeswoman for the Board of Governors, which oversees Florida\u2019s university system, said last year that very few students responded to the notice that the universities sent out, and fewer than 20 students were reclassified as in-state residents under the new parameters.\n\nCommission\u2019s say\n\nThe S.C. Commission on Higher Education\u2019s regulations are under review, including the residency provisions, according to its spokeswoman, Carullo.\n\nShe said any revisions that result from the review would be submitted in early 2015 to the state Legislature.\n\nCarullo said there are differences and similarities between South Carolina\u2019s and Florida\u2019s residency statutes.\n\n\u201cWe are working to clarify issues such as those raised by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Florida case you have referenced concerning provisions affecting U.S. citizens who are dependents of undocumented parents or guardians,\u201d Carullo said. \u201cWe have initiated conversation with the Southern Poverty Law Center to more clearly identify their concern.\u201d\n\nCostly difference\n\nThe students who can\u2019t prove their parents\u2019 federal immigration status are facing a major difference in their tuition rates, Brooke said.\n\nAt the University of South Carolina, the out-of-state annual tuition is $17,670 higher than the in-state tuition rate. The College of Charleston\u2019s out-of-state tuition is $16,464 higher than the in-state tuition rate. For a Trident Technical College student taking 12 to 15 credits, it would cost $1,695 more than residents of Charleston, Berkeley or Dorchester counties.\n\nThe Post and Courier spoke to one Lowcountry high school student, who did not want to be identified out of fear that her parents could be deported, who said she was told by Trident Tech that she would be charged out-of-state tuition because she couldn\u2019t prove her parents\u2019 federal immigration status.\n\nShe said her parents are undocumented and have lived in the United States for the past 20 years, and the student is a U.S. citizen.\n\nRepresentatives from Trident Tech, like the College of Charleston, said they follow the residency-requirement policy of the S.C. Commission on Higher Education.\n\nBut, in most of the instances in which the center has become involved in assisting the students on the appeals, Brooke said the schools found ways to reverse the initial charge.\n\n\u201cWhenever they become aware we\u2019re working on the outskirts, all of a sudden things get fixed,\u201d he said.\n\nTrident Tech spokesman David Hansen said in some instances the school can consider options in circumstance and documentation.\n\n\u201cThat is where we exercise judgment in determining whether the student has met the requirements of the regulations. Policy allows students to appeal,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nBut Brooke said not all students seek his organization\u2019s help in appealing those initial determinations. \u201cHow many of these students were told, \u2018You\u2019re not eligible for this\u2019? How many have the gumption to say. \u2018I don\u2019t believe you and I want this to be reviewed by someone else.\u2019 That\u2019s a tall order for 18-year-olds,\u201d he said.\n\nState scholarships\n\nThe South Carolina Appleseed Legal Justice Center, based in Columbia, has been working with the Southern Poverty Law Center to investigate the cases in South Carolina.\n\nStaff Attorney Tammy Besherse said the agency has received several calls from students facing higher tuition costs because their parents are undocumented residents.\n\n\u201cAll of them were born in the state, raised in the state and never lived anywhere else. Yet they\u2019re being told they\u2019re out-of-state residents,\u201d Besherse said. \u201cI\u2019d like to know where they are residents of.\u201d\n\nBesherse said schools in the state are treating U.S. born youths as \u201csecond-class citizens.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only about tuition, according to Brooke and Besherse. Some U.S.-born students are also being denied state scholarships based on their parents\u2019 immigration status.\n\nThe Post and Courier spoke to another student, who also did not want to be identified out of fear her parents could be deported, said she was ruled ineligible for the state\u2019s Life Scholarship, based on her parents\u2019 immigration status.\n\nThe student is a U.S. citizen, but her parents are undocumented residents. She said it was disconcerting because she was the first person in her family to attend college.\n\nShe attended Charleston Southern University for a semester, but wasn\u2019t told about the scholarship ineligibility until December, according to the student.\n\nBrooke said CSU stepped in, though, and gave the student the amount equivalent to the scholarship money she lost.\n\n\u2018The disadvantaged\u2019\n\nAt West Ashley High School, five to 10 students a year have been faced with the decision to appeal a university\u2019s or college\u2019s initial ruling to charge out-of-state tuition because of their parents\u2019 status, Principal Mary Runyon said.\n\n\u201cA majority of them are not emotionally prepared to fight the battle,\u201d Runyon said.\n\nOthers are afraid of fighting the schools because they don\u2019t want to bring unnecessary attention to themselves or their parents, who could be deported.\n\nSo Runyon said many of them look for other options outside of school, like finding technical jobs or work in the fast-food industry, wherever they can earn a living.\n\nGrooms said that is a consequence of their own parents\u2019 actions.\n\n\u201cThe children of parents who violate the law are often disadvantaged, and the children of parents who break immigration laws are disadvantaged,\u201d Grooms said.\n\nGrooms helped push through immigration-reform legislation in 2011 that not only required proof of citizenship for employment in South Carolina, but also called for giving law enforcement the power to demand proof of citizenship during traffic stops. That part of the law remains in legal limbo after a federal judge temporarily halted the provision.\n\nGrooms said students with undocumented parents have other options, such as emancipating from their parents or becoming dependants, then claiming residency themselves for in-state tuition.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what students whose parents live in other states have to do,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the policy is an unfair advantage for parents who are in the state and country illegally, and if the courts force the state to change the policy, he vows to \u201cdo everything in my power that those living legally in the United States aren\u2019t put at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\nBut Runyon said the students dealing with these roadblocks are unfairly disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cYou can kind of begin to see where the education system is truly on the horns of a dilemma. We\u2019re not able to help them fulfill their potential,\u201d Runyon said. \u201cA segment of our population is being deprived of a post-secondary education. I know a lot of people wouldn\u2019t agree with that opinion.\u201d\n\nReach Natalie Caula Hauff at 937-5594.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tuition based on parents\u2019 immigration status may be headed for court fight, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nNorth Charleston, \r\nNorth Charleston,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Born and living in South Carolina, some college-bound students are being charged out-of-state tuition based on their parents\u2019 immigration status, a practice that some civil rights groups say is illegal.", "title": "Tuition based on parents\u2019 immigration status may be headed for court fight", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20140118/140119383/tuition-based-on-parents-x2019-immigration-status-may-be-headed-for-court-fight", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140118/PC16/140119383/AR/0/AR-140119383.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140118/PC16/140119383/AR/0/AR-140119383.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Born and living in South Carolina, some college-bound students are being charged out-of-state tuition based on their parents\u2019 immigration status, a practice that some civil rights groups say is illegal.", "title": "Tuition based on parents\u2019 immigration status may be headed for court fight", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140118/PC16/140119383/AR/0/AR-140119383.jpg?201401182240", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 140119383}}, "keywords": "Tuition based on parents\u2019 immigration status may be headed for court fight , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nNorth Charleston, \r\nNorth Charleston", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-18T22:40:00Z", "author": "Natalie Caula Hauff"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Born and living in South Carolina, some college-bound students are being charged out-of-state tuition based on their parents\u2019 immigration status, a practice that some civil rights groups say is illegal."}, "article_summary": "The center won the case when a judge blocked the Sunshine State\u2019s tuition policy that forced U.S. citizens to pay out-of-state tuition because they were unable to prove their parents\u2019 federal immigration status.\nStaff Attorney Tammy Besherse said the agency has received several calls from students facing higher tuition costs because their parents are undocumented residents.\nBorn and living in South Carolina, some college-bound students are being charged out-of-state tuition based on their parents\u2019 immigration status, a practice that some civil rights groups say is illegal.\nSome U.S.-born students are also being denied state scholarships based on their parents\u2019 immigration status.\nGrooms said students with undocumented parents have other options, such as emancipating from their parents or becoming dependants, then claiming residency themselves for in-state tuition."}
