There are also collages devoted to famous figures such as Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Pope Paul II, Natalie Wood and John Belushi, as well as politically charged topics like gun control and Watergate. 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Thursday; and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday, through Jan. 3, at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, 756 N.
