If you think you;ve heard everything in this campaign, you actually haven’t. For all the opposition there’s been to Obamacare, the GOP candidates have been surprisingly muted on the topic.

Surprising, because one of the absolute bedrock positions of the Republican Party has been that Obamacare would be a “disaster.” This formulation of “disaster” or some close variant of “disaster” was near unto holy writ. It did not need to be explained in any detail. “Disaster” would suffice.

It was an article of faith on the order of the certainty that climate science was “made up.”

Too bad that just like with climate, continuous measurement happens out there in the real world. And just like with climate, the numbers stubbornly refuse to follow GOP orthodoxy. Obamacare is working, more or less as advertised.

And health care is real enough to people that they actually want to have some. They have a strange disinclination to suffer a disease and go bankrupt, just to satisfy a party’s orthodoxy.

So IS there a demand to “repeal and replace” Obamacare? Only to the extent that people would like to go all the way to single payer so they can stop worrying about the subject altogether.
