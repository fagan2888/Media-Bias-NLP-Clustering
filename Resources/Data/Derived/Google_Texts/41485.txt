Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said determining what steps the federal government should take to respond to the opioid crisis was complicated in a recent interview with Louisville’s WHAS11.

“Figuring out what to do at the federal level to be helpful was not as simple as it sounds,” McConnell said. Leaders at all levels of government are taking steps on the issue, he added.

The Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act last month, which McConnell praised as a “very significant bill.” He said he has been in talks with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) about the legislation and that he expects the House to move quickly on the issue.

McConnell added that about two years ago he was “naive” about the scope of the epidemic, thinking it was limited to Northern Kentucky. Senators who were campaigning for president in New Hampshire frequently commented on the issue there, he said.

“Our presidential candidates who were competing in New Hampshire who are in the Senate would come back and say the biggest issue in New Hampshire is heroin,” he said. “This whole opioid epidemic is horrendous.”
