It\u2019s fair to say that we have never seen anything quite like this before in terms of the scale.\u201d \u2013Peter J. Spiro, Temple University law professor\n\nWhen James Madison first proposed the balance of power concept for the newly created Federal government with three equal branches of government \u2013 each independent of the other with clearly defined responsibilities, he may not have anticipated, despite its enshrinement in the Constitution, how easily that balance of power could be so shrewdly subverted.\n\nWhile President Obama\u2019s recently announced Executive Order makes sweeping changes to the country\u2019s immigration system without Congress, the emerging legal question is whether the President has overstepped his Executive authority and is ultimately usurping constitutional authority in exceeding existing immigration law which requires that those who arrive in this country illegally be deported. While many of us may not like aspects of that law, it is, nevertheless, the law.\n\nIn July, 2014, well-known liberal constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley testified before the House Rules Committee that:\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s pledge to effectively govern alone is alarming, and what is most alarming is his ability to fulfill that pledge. When a president can govern alone, he can become a government unto himself, which is precisely the danger the framers sought to avoid . .\u201d\n\nAnd since the President announced his immigration Executive Order (EO) on November 20th, Turley added:\n\n\u201cWhat the President is suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the constitution. We have a separation of powers that gives us balance and that doesn\u2019t protect the branches. It\u2019s not there to protect the executive branch or the legislative branch, it\u2019s there to protect liberty. It\u2019s there to keep any branch from assuming so much control that they become a threat to liberty.\u201d \u201cWhat the Democrats are creating is something very very dangerous. They\u2019re creating a president who can go at it alone and to go at it alone is something that is a very danger that the framers sought to avoid in our constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate the separation of powers,\u201d Turley said. \u201cNo president can take on the power of all three branches and that\u2019s what he seems to be doing. He certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. He isn\u2019t being particularly coy about this, you know he says \u2018this is what I wanted to get out of legislation and I\u2019m going to do it on my own\u2019 and that does become a government of one.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Turley represented a bipartisan group of 10 House members who challenged Obama\u2019s constitutional authority to prosecute the war in Libya without congressional approval. Currently, Turley is representing the US House of Representatives in their lawsuit challenging the President\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional and unlawful actions\u201d regarding his \u201cunilateral implementation\u201d of the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare.\n\nIn use by every president since George Washington, Presidential EO\u2019s, originally informal housekeeping directives to Federal officials and agencies, have grown in substance with the \u2018full force of law\u2019 as if Congress had acted. EO\u2019s are temporary until the next Executive acts and are subject to judicial review (although courts are reluctant to intervene) while Congress frequently looks the other way. Today, EO\u2019s provide a perfect foil in which to change existing law without encountering significant media or public scrutiny and avoid pesky Congressional oversight.\n\nIn addition, it is now apparent that an EO may not be necessary for a scoundrel President to alter the specific language of an established law when, for example, a bill\u2019s original intent is not sufficient to address new circumstances or an essential concept that was mistakenly omitted or simply because the Executive can do whatever the Executive wants. As Madison and the Founders intended, under the US Constitution, the Congress makes the laws and the President is charged with implementation.\n\nWhile Presidential power is derived from the Constitution\u2019s implied authority contained in the broadly-interpreted\u2018executive power shall be vested in the President\u2019 directive (Article I, section 1, clause 1) as well as Presidential responsibility to\u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed\u201d (Article II, section 3, clause 5), there is no legal mandate that allows the Congress or President to fudge their Constitutional lines of responsibility, regardless of what political differences may exist.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the President risks being accused of an overreach of \u2018executive power\u2019 that inevitably raises essential constitutional concerns. The question arises that by deferring enforcement action while establishing a newly created special status for a group of citizens, the President is, in effect, violating the immigration law as enacted by Congress and that the President has gone beyond prosecutorial discretion and into the area of legislating.\n\nNicholas Q. Rosenkranz, Georgetown University law professor offered that \u2018pre-emptively announcing that you will not enforce the law against a population of millions ..is several orders of magnitude beyond traditional case-by-case \u2018prosecutorial discretion.\u2019 In this case, the president is reportedly considering affirmative action that would purport to confer some legal status. This is a giant step beyond traditional prosecutorial discretion.\u201d\n\nMany of us may be so jaded as to not be shocked that a sitting President, fully conscious of his constitutional duties, would willfully misdirect or specifically alter Congressionally-approved language so as to substantially modify a piece of legislation and its intent. It is the height of malfeasance to rationalize an \u2018improvement\u2019 to existing law or to direct a department to act contrary to its legislative mandate using a popular issue as \u201ccover \u201c for official misconduct. Cloaking precedent-setting wrongdoing in the cushion of a publicly-accepted issue (like immigration or health care) has the effect of relegating the Constitution to a lesser piece of paper and minimizing public scrutiny.\n\nOne concern at stake is whether a policy initiative that failed to be adopted by Congress can then be repackaged as a constitutionally valid EO and whether the President\u2019s EO sets an historic precedent that allows for an expansion of Executive authority as a common tool whenever the President is thwarted by Congress or in order to bypass Congress.\n\nDavid Martin, University of Virginia law professor has suggested that beyond the question of whether Mr. Obama was staying within the bounds of his power, is the bigger problem of \u201cprecedent\u201d and that even if Mr. Obama\u2019s directive is legally defensible, he may be \u201cpaving the way for future Republican presidents to act similar to contravene laws that Democrats cherish.\u201d\n\nWith regard to Executive orders, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 2014 report Executive Orders: Issuance, Modification, and Revocation states that\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s authority to issue executive orders does not include a grant of power to implement policy decisions that are not otherwise authorized by law\u201d and that\n\n\u201c.. it is equally well established that the substance of an executive order, including any requirements or prohibitions, may have the force and effect of law only if the presidential action is based on power vested in the President by the U.S. Constitution or delegated to the President by Congress.\u201d\n\nRegarding EO\u2019s, the CRS determined that \u201cThe U.S. Constitution does not define these presidential instruments and does not explicitly vest the President with the authority to issue them. Nonetheless, such Orders are accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power.\u201d\n\nIt should not escape notice that the very deportations that the Obama EO is designed to alter are the very deportations that his Administration has so dramatically increased over the last six years.\n\nFormer New Jersey Superior Court Judge Anthony Napolitano has suggested that \u201cwhen he suspends deportation and when he imposes his own conditions on those suspensions, he is effectively rewriting the law and that violates his oath to enforce and uphold the law as it has been written\u201d concluding that the president would be in violation of his responsibility to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the law and that \u201cwhile every president has prosecutorial discretion, they cannot suspend or rewrite existing statute.\u201d\n\nAccording to Napolitano, President Eisenhower \u201callowed suspension of deportations on the basis of existing statute but that Obama has disregarded existing statute and set out his own standards. He is not a law maker; he is the law enforcer.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that immigration reform and halting the Obama Administration\u2019s widespread deportations (over two million to date) is a valid and long overdue social dilemma that deserves to be resolved on a permanent basis with a formal legislative solution. Immigration is of such significance to the nation that affects 11 million citizens, it deserves to be deliberated in a formal quasi-judicial forum (like the Senate) without the controversy and uncertainty sure to result from the President\u2019s EO. Immigration reform and those citizens most directly affected deserve to have the formal force of Congressionally-adopted law with its bi-partisan sponsors, committee amendments and rigorous floor debate standing behind it, granting it the unquestionable constitutional authority that an EO does not offer.\n\nThe President had months earlier promised the EO but delayed issuance until after the election in order to protect many of those vulnerable Senate Democrats who went down in defeat anyway. The willingness to delay the EO spoke volumes to Hispanic voters \u2013 most of whom favor the Democratic party. The irony of shelving the EO until after the election must still sting with a rank bitterness \u2013 if not the president, who is more often concerned with his own political fortunes, but for those Democrats who were defeated in states with an immigrant population like Sen. Mark Udall (D-Co), Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark) and Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC).\n\nAfter the 2008 election there was every expectation that an ethnically diverse President would instinctively resonate with the plight of the country\u2019s long-time immigrants and their children, officially recognizing their hopes for citizenship. Six years later, the painful reality is that an ethnically diverse president can just as easily disregard the country\u2019s immigrant population as well as any Caucasian president.\n\nIn response to activist criticism that he had not issued an Executive Order to stop deportations, the President acknowledged, in a September, 2013 Telemundo interview that \u201cIf we start broadening that (referring to his earlier Dreamer protection), then essentially I\u2019ll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that\u2019s not an option.\u201d\n\nMore recently, in a November 17th Washington Post editorial entitled \u201cIn Mr. Obama\u2019s Own Words, Acting Alone is Not How Democracy Works\u201d posited a fanciful analogy with newly-elected president Ted Cruz using an EO as a unilateral tool to accomplish his political agenda at the expense of the Constitution. The editorial further quoted the President, in explaining his own inaction to suspend deportations \u201cThat\u2019s not how our Constitution is written.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "Chinks Out of the Constitution", "title": "Presidential Overreach", "url": "http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/11/28/presidential-overreach/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-28T12:44:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-12T00:11:14+00:00"}, "description": "Chinks Out of the Constitution", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4ff\"", "article_summary": "It is against this backdrop that the President risks being accused of an overreach of \u2018executive power\u2019 that inevitably raises essential constitutional concerns.\n.\u201dAnd since the President announced his immigration Executive Order (EO) on November 20th, Turley added:\u201cWhat the President is suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the constitution.\nIn use by every president since George Washington, Presidential EO\u2019s, originally informal housekeeping directives to Federal officials and agencies, have grown in substance with the \u2018full force of law\u2019 as if Congress had acted.\n\u201cNo president can take on the power of all three branches and that\u2019s what he seems to be doing.\nAs Madison and the Founders intended, under the US Constitution, the Congress makes the laws and the President is charged with implementation."}
