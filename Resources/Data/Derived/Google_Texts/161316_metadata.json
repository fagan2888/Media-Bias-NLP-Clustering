The applications go back nearly two decades, and officials said some applicants may have died years ago.\n\nMore than half the applications listed as pending do not have application dates, and investigators \"could not reliably determine how many records were associated with actual applications for enrollment\" in VA health care, the report said.\n\nThe report also says VA workers incorrectly marked thousands of unprocessed health-care applications as completed and may have deleted 10,000 or more electronic \"transactions\" over the past five years.\n\nLinda Halliday, the VA's acting inspector general, said the agency's Health Eligibility Center \"has not effectively managed its business processes to ensure the consistent creation and maintenance of essential data\" and recommended a multi-year plan to improve accuracy and usefulness of agency records.\n\nHalliday's report came in response to a whistleblower who said more than 200,000 veterans with pendingapplications for VA health care were likely deceased.\n\nThe inspector general's report substantiated that claim and others, but said there was no way to tell for sure when or why the person died. Similarly, deficiencies in the VA's information security \u2014 including a lack of audit trails and system backups \u2014 limited investigators' ability to review some issues fully and rule out data manipulation, Halliday said.\n\nThe VA has said it has no way to purge the list of dead applicants, and said many of those listed in the report are likely to have used another type of insurance before they died. Officials are reviewing enrollment data to ensure integrity, said VA spokeswoman Walinda West.\n\nThe Health Eligibility Center has removed a \"purge and delete functionality\" from a computer system used to track agency workloads, West said. VA will provide six months of data to demonstrate that any changed or deleted data on VA workloads has undergone appropriate management review, with approvals and audit trails visible, West said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The VA is having trouble sorting through the back log.", "title": "Nearly 900,000 US veterans are waiting on healthcare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-watchdog-900000-vets-have-pending-health-care-applications-2015-9", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/55e762ddbd86ef21008b7b56-506-253/nearly-900000-us-veterans-are-waiting-on-healthcare.jpg", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "defense-contributor,politics,defense,main-contributor", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Associated Press, Politics, Veterans Affairs, Military, Matthew Daly", "description": "The VA is having trouble sorting through the back log.", "author": "Matthew Daly, Associated Press", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-02", "sailthru.title": "Nearly 900,000 US veterans are waiting on healthcare", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53aabc5269beddb06dc768a3-50-50/nearly-900000-us-veterans-are-waiting-on-healthcare.jpg", "news_keywords": "Associated Press, Politics, Veterans Affairs, Military, Matthew Daly", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/53aabc5269beddb06dc768a3/nearly-900000-us-veterans-are-waiting-on-healthcare.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-09-02", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "sailthru.description": "The VA is having trouble sorting through the back log.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The VA is having trouble sorting through the back log.", "title": "Nearly 900,000 US veterans are waiting on healthcare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-watchdog-900000-vets-have-pending-health-care-applications-2015-9", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55e762ddbd86ef21008b7b56-1190-625/nearly-900000-us-veterans-are-waiting-on-healthcare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Nearly 900,000 US veterans are waiting on healthcare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/53aabc5269beddb06dc768a3/nearly-900000-us-veterans-are-waiting-on-healthcare.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "defense-contributor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd79b0\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 900,000 military veterans have officially pending applications for health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the department's inspector general said Wednesday, but \"serious\" problems with enrollment data make it impossible to determine how many veterans were actively seeking VA health care.\nHalliday's report came in response to a whistleblower who said more than 200,000 veterans with pendingapplications for VA health care were likely deceased.\nAbout one-third of the 867,000 veterans with pending applications are likely deceased, the report says, adding that \"data limitations\" prevent investigators from determining how many now-deceased veterans applied forhealth care benefits or when.\nThe applications go back nearly two decades, and officials said some applicants may have died years ago.\nThe report also says VA workers incorrectly marked thousands of unprocessed health-care applications as completed and may have deleted 10,000 or more electronic \"transactions\" over the past five years."}
