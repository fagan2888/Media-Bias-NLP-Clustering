That was a sight. Lots of railing against Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich and pretty much every other candidate for supporting \u201camnesty\u201d and \u201cmagnets\u201d for \u201cillegals,\u201d while supporting \u201cself-deportation\u201d \u2014 aka starving undocumented immigrants until they returned home \u2014 himself. Oh, and fencing \u2014 lots and lots of fencing. Primary-Mitt was one tough cookie when it came to immigration.\n\nHe was, of course, bullshitting, and just saying that to get through the primary. Within about four seconds of sealing the nomination, Romney was trying to change his tune, proposing \u201camnesty\u201d \u2014 which in the lexicon of GOP primary politics refers to anything short of roundin\u2019 \u2019em up and throwin\u2019 \u2019em back over the danged fence \u2014 for certain undocumented immigrants and, all in all, attempting to sound like a real swell, understanding guy.\n\nThis obviously didn\u2019t work out for poor old Mittens, in the end. Boo hoo. But there\u2019s little reason to doubt that his general-election stance of \u201cnot giving a shit\u201d about a path to citizenship was closer to his true beliefs. If Mitt Romney can be characterized as anything \u2014 and he tries really hard to avoid characterization! \u2014 it\u2019s as a business Republican. He\u2019s not a culture warrior. He cares about cutting taxes and eliminating regulations and lowering the cost of labor. He\u2019s the perfect avatar for Chamber of Commerce Republicanism.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that he and the chamber have more or less supported the same batch of candidates this primary season. Both, for example, have supported Joni Ernst in the Iowa Republican Senate primary on Tuesday. Romney even starred in a pro-Ernst ad for the Chamber of Commerce. And on Friday, following a campaign stop with Ernst, Romney told reporters that he believes the party must take up immigration reform, and soon.\n\n\u201cI do believe it\u2019s important for us, before the presidential contest in 2016, to finally have immigration reform in place,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for the country to continue to have this issue open and unresolved, particularly with so many families that are waiting for the answers.\u201d Some families have been \u201cwaiting for years and years to understand what the status is of those who have come here illegally in the past, and those that want to come here legally to know what their prospects are.\u201d Romney thinks people who have come to the United States illegally \u201cshould not be given a special pathway to citizenship or permanent residency.\u201d But, he said with a laugh: \u201cI didn\u2019t get elected, so I\u2019m not sure my view is the one that will carry the day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitt Romney supports a path to citizenship, but his endorsees don't.
