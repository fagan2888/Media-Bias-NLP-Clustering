The clinic is offering free help to assist people signing up for medical coverage during the Affordable Care Act open enrollment period.\n\nAs an in-person assister at Federal Way\u2019s Cornerstone Medical Services clinic, Lauren Tran helps people sign up for Washington healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe are here to help anyone who needs help getting health insurance,\u201d Tran said. \u201cWhether he/she or a family qualifies for free insurance (Apple Health) or paid insurance (Quality Healthcare Plan - QHP), we can help. We are here especially for those who don\u2019t understand the website and just want a little reassurance that they are enrolling correctly.\u201d\n\nThe clinic started offering free services in 2009. It is now a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization committed to providing comprehensive primary care to members of the community who are uninsured and/or medically underserved. The clinic caters to clients seeking help with English and specializes in Korean and Vietnamese.\n\n\u201cWe do all we can to help people understand what is available to them and connect them to the right services,\u201d Tran said.\n\nThe clinic is promoting their Affordable Care Act open enrollment period. Those who are above the Medicaid income level have until Feb. 15 to enroll or change plans.\n\nPatients can apply for health insurance and compare plans directly by going to wahealthplanfinder.org. Cornerstone Medical Services are available to assist patients for free, by appointment on Wednesdays.\n\nIt is this dedication to patients that brought Tran to Cornerstone.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a way to volunteer and really make an impact in the community and somehow was introduced to Cornerstone,\u201d Tran recalled. \u201cI had hoped to volunteer in the clinic by helping doctors with whatever they needed, which in my experience, was getting equipment ready for them and helping them stay organized with their paperwork and patients.\u201d\n\nTran said working as an in-person assister at Cornerstone has opened her eyes.\n\n\u201cI understand that the Washington Healthplan Finder website has a lot of kinks in it and signing up and finding a healthcare plan to choose from is not simple,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so great that Cornerstone has such a focus on helping those with limited English (mainly Korean and Vietnamese clientele) sign up for healthcare. However, I know that it is a complicated process to a lot of people and want the community to know that this is a completely free service and that we will try our hardest to help anybody who comes in, despite language barriers.\u201d\n\nOn the first day of the clinic in June 2008, there were two doctors and four patients. Since then, 24 volunteer healthcare professionals from a broad range of disciplines (conventional medicine, nursing, chiropractic, naturopathic medicine and east Asian medical practice) have seen an average of 65 patients every clinic day.\n\nThe clinic has been open regularly on the first and the third Saturdays of each month since the first opening in 2008. They serve more than 1,000 patients per year and are in the process of expanding their services.\n\nThe clinic pursues a multidisciplinary and integrated approach, offering diverse practices in the fields of allopathy (traditional medicine), naturopathy, east Asian medicine and chiropractic.\n\nThe clinic relocated from Renton to Federal Way in 2012. For the first time, the clinic rented 1,000 square feet just for the Cornerstone use only.\n\nIn August, the clinic held a \u201csports physical\u201d outreach for high school students in Federal Way and Lynnwood. There are now around 16 providers, eight nurses and 26 administrative volunteers.\n\nTran says it\u2019s the people in her office and her clients that make her enjoy her job.\n\n\u201cThe gratitude that I\u2019ve seen from some clients is something that I wasn\u2019t expecting,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce these clients give us all their information, and we help them make an informative decision on what plans would best suit them and their family, it\u2019s like a huge weight has been lifted. It\u2019s a great thing to see how secure and safe people feel once enrolled in healthcare.\u201d\n\nTo make an appointment, call 253-252-2095.\n\nFor more information, visit www.cmsclinic.org.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "As an in-person assister at Federal Way\u2019s Cornerstone Medical Services clinic, Lauren Tran helps people sign up for Washington healthcare.", "og": {"site_name": "Federal Way Mirror", "description": "As an in-person assister at Federal Way\u2019s Cornerstone Medical Services clinic, Lauren Tran helps people sign up for Washington healthcare.", "title": "Federal Way medical clinic offers free services to those in need - Federal Way Mirror", "url": "http://www.federalwaymirror.com/business/289063661.html", "image": "http://media.bclocalnews.com/images/77042fedwayCornerstone_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"ipad": "Federal Way Mirror", "iphone": "Federal Way Mirror", "googleplay": "Federal Way Mirror"}, "id": {"ipad": 382923229, "iphone": 382923229, "googleplay": "com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_17693c91d9204b7a7646284bb3adb603"}}, "image": {"src": "http://media.bclocalnews.com/images/77042fedwayCornerstone_1.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@fwmirror"}, "fb": {"app_id": 203545909685437}, "msvalidate.01": "87E5B723352F7F19F9D4F82B38A4E2DB", "verify-v1": "xp46D8SohxCVm32IcD0J/9dlxOyum45B4gGBJuzIPBI=", "viewport": "width=1228"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a79\"", "article_summary": "As an in-person assister at Federal Way\u2019s Cornerstone Medical Services clinic, Lauren Tran helps people sign up for Washington healthcare.\nCornerstone Medical Services staff.\nCornerstone Medical Services are available to assist patients for free, by appointment on Wednesdays.\nThe clinic is offering free help to assist people signing up for medical coverage during the Affordable Care Act open enrollment period.\n\u201cWhether he/she or a family qualifies for free insurance (Apple Health) or paid insurance (Quality Healthcare Plan - QHP), we can help."}
