He's trying to change that, one flight at a time.\n\n\"I want to show that these are good because the media displays drones as killers, media displays drones as things that hurt people,\" Tenold said. \"I want to show that they can do a lot of good.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old high school junior from Reva in northwestern South Dakota hopes to join the Air Force and eventually have a private-sector career in drone construction and operation. He has a good start, building and flying his own drones along with more traditional remote-control airplanes in his dad's auto shop.\n\nIt's big, beautiful country, but not without its complications. Strong winds and electrical storms will ground the battery-powered drones, which are affected by storms 30 miles away.\n\nBrandon doesn't fly when the wind is more than 20 mph. But when he does send up his drone, it offers a unique look at the landscape. Equipped with a GPS system, auto pilot, video gear and a recorder, the drone can quickly offer images that would otherwise take horses, pickups and even larger airplanes.\n\nFederal regulations prevent him from flying his drones above 500 feet.\n\nBut the benefits of drones will become clearer in coming years, as they are used to benefit people in agriculture and other industries, Brandon says.\n\n\"With this you can check your cattle from a couple miles away,\" Tenold said. \"If you have a dead calf, or a dead cow somewhere, you can fly over it and see exactly where it is. It's also good for agricultural, such as crops.\"\n\nThere's another great thing about a drone that has appeal to a teenager.\n\n\"They are incredibly fun to fly,\" Tenold said.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\n\nAn extra word was deleted.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Brandon Tenold thinks drones get a bad rap.
