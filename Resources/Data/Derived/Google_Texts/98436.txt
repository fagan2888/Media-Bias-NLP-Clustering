This April, we hosted the inaugural 2016 Northern California State of Reform Health Policy Conference. It was an honor to convene a group of the most influential and respected minds in health care in the state today. Dr. Ira Byock, M.D., Chief Medical Officer for the Providence Institute for Human Caring, kicked off the morning keynote. He discussed systemic changes to lower health care costs and improve quality of care. Quality requires a partnership, that shared decision-making among patients, practitioners, and families when appropriate. This is not ancillary, itâ€™s core.

Sec. Diana Dooley of the California Health and Human Services Agency delivered the lunch keynote address and discussed how well California has implemented the Affordable Care Act during her term and her vision for the future. See her full keynote here.

Our day concluded with a panel discussion that weighed the cost of innovation, what it will take to move to value, and where the system should focus in the next 12 to 18 months ahead. Panelists included, Peter V. Lee, Executive Director of Covered California; James Hereford, Chief Operating Officer of Stanford University Medical Center; Sara Radcliffe, Chief Executive Officer of California Life Sciences Association; and Charles Baachi, President and CEO of California Association of Health Plans.
