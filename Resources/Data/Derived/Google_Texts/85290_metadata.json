The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas developed a model to look at the impact on jobs. It predicts the lower prices will translate to a 1.2 percent drop in Texas employment, which equals about 140,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cSo this would be mining jobs, finance, real estate, legal,\u201dsays Jesse Thompson, a business economist at the Dallas Fed\u2019s Houston branch. \u201cThis would encompass the entire spectrum of employment impacts as a result of the price declines.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn oil pump in west Texas.\n\nHouston will fare worse than the state on average. But it won\u2019t do as badly as areas closer to the oil fields in South and West Texas.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of construction activity going on as a result of the shale gas production boom in the downstream side, in the refining and petrochemicals, that are going to sort of buttress us against these declines in mining employment,\u201d Thompson says.\n\nThe Dallas Fed also forecasts that \u2013 even with all the layoffs tied to the oil sector \u2013 Texas should still see a gain of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent in total job growth in 2015.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: For more on the economic impact of the drop in oil prices, tune in to a special series of stories starting Tuesday on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on News 88.7.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "description": "Refining and petrochemical production will provide a buffer for Houston, but economists say the region is still in for significant economic pain.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Refining and petrochemical production will provide a buffer for Houston, but economists say the region is still in for significant economic pain.", "title": "Federal Reserve Bank Of Dallas: Oil Price Drop To Cost Texas About 140,000 Jobs | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/02/28/58339/federal-reserve-bank-of-dallas-oil-price-drop-to-cost-texas-about-140000-jobs/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/28120000/west-texas-oil-pump-400px-tn_home.png", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/28120000/west-texas-oil-pump-400px-tn_home.png", "height": 160, "width": 300, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/28120000/west-texas-oil-pump-400px-tn_home.png", "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "org_id": 220, "twitter": {"description": "Refining and petrochemical production will provide a buffer for Houston, but economists say the region is still in for significant economic pain.", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/02/28/58339/federal-reserve-bank-of-dallas-oil-price-drop-to-cost-texas-about-140000-jobs/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/28120000/west-texas-oil-pump-400px-tn_home.png", "title": "Federal Reserve Bank Of Dallas: Oil Price Drop To Cost Texas About 140,000 Jobs", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Schneider", "wordCount": 238, "datePublished": "2015-02-28T06:00:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "keywords": "Business, News, business, economy, employment, news, oil", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "oil", "published_time": "2015-02-28T06:00:00+00:00"}, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec36\"", "article_summary": "It predicts the lower prices will translate to a 1.2 percent drop in Texas employment, which equals about 140,000 jobs.\n\u201cThis would encompass the entire spectrum of employment impacts as a result of the price declines.\u201dAn oil pump in west Texas.\nBut it won\u2019t do as badly as areas closer to the oil fields in South and West Texas.\nEditor\u2019s Note: For more on the economic impact of the drop in oil prices, tune in to a special series of stories starting Tuesday on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on News 88.7.\n/ DownloadThe price of a barrel of crude oil has fallen by more than 50 percent since last June."}
