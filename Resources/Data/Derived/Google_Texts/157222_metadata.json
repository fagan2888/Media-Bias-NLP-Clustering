Burwell. (Those of us who write about the most recent cases sometimes do not have a work-free July 4th weekend, but the Justices always do. The justices like a summer vacation longer than just a few weeks, so I can confidently predict we will know the answer before July 4, and most likely before the end of June.)\n\nKing v. Burwell involves the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [Pub. L. No. 111-148]\u2014popularly called either the \u201cACA,\u201d or \u201cObamacare\u201d by both its opponents and its proponents. The litigation now before the Supreme Court is, on the surface, a simple issue of statutory interpretation. Only millimeters beneath the surface is a broader issue\u2014how far will the courts go in allowing administrators to change the law by simply redefining terms that are not vague at all. This issue is peculiarly significant because the agency doing the redefining is the Internal Revenue Service. The first named defendant is Sylvia Burwell, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, but another defendant is the IRS, and it is the agency doing the redefining. No case has ever held that Congress could delegate to the IRS the power to raise or lower taxes.\n\nThe ACA, in Section 1311 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18031], provides that states shall create Health Benefit Exchange (\u201cHealth Exchanges\u201d). If they meet certain criteria, they are \u201cQualified Health Exchanges.\u201d The qualified Exchanges qualify for federal subsidies. Nonqualified exchanges do not.\n\nThe Court has consistently held that Congress does not have the constitutional power to order or commandeer states to enact particular laws. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997). While Congress cannot force a state to enact a qualified Health Exchange, it can use its taxing and spending power to \u201cbribe\u201d states by offering various incentives to states that enact and implement the kind of laws that Congress wants. That is what the ACA does.\n\nIt provides that if a state creates a qualified Health Exchange by January 1, 2014, then another section of the law\u201426 U.S.C. \u00a7 36B, in the Internal Revenue Code \u2014offers generous subsidies. The subsidies are in the form of \u2018\u2018premium assistance tax credits\u201d and \u201crefundable tax credits.\u201d They not only reduce tax liability but also provide for federal money paid to private insurance companies.\n\nCongress also created a fallback position: if a state refuses to set up a State Health Exchange, a different section of the ACA [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18041(c)] authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set up Federal Exchanges in those states that refuse to set up a State Exchange.\n\nNo provision of the ACA offers any tax subsidies or payments for federally created (as opposed to state created) Health Exchanges. That supports the carrot-and-stick approach to encourage states to create, implement, and maintain state Health Exchanges. In other words, if the state creates a Health Exchange, its citizens secure valuable tax benefits in addition to acquiring health insurance. If the state refuses to create, implement, and maintain a Health Exchange, that state\u2019s citizens do not receive the financial benefits, but they will have to pay federal taxes that finance the subsidies that residents in other states (those with state-created Exchanges) will receive.\n\nBesides to the financial incentives (carrots), the ACA has disincentives (sticks) to prod states to set up Health Exchanges. For example, the law penalizes states that do not create Exchanges by barring them from narrowing their state Medicaid programs until \u201can Exchange established by the State . . . is fully operational.\u201d [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(gg)]\n\nAs one proponent of the law explained,\n\n[I]f you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits\u2014but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So, you\u2019re essentially saying [to] your citizens you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country.\n\nCongress expected that all or most states would take this \u201cbribe\u201d because it gave an offer that was hard to refuse.\n\nNonetheless, some states\u2014actually a lot of states, 34 of them \u2014 did not pick up the free federal subsidies (the carrots) and were willing to put up with the disincentives (the sticks). They simply refused to establish State Exchanges. It turned out that the ACA has not been as popular as its proponents believed it would be. Indeed, polls show that the more people learn about the law, the less favorably they view it. Moreover, many individuals have concluded that it is quite rational to not pay for health insurance until they get sick, because the fines are often not very much and the ACA does not allow insurance companies to refuse coverage because of preexisting medical conditions.\n\nFor those people who do want to purchase insurance, they are even less likely to do so if the federal subsidies do not exist, for the simple reason that the cost of health insurance (without subsidies) will be higher, often much higher. When 34 states refused to create Exchanges, the Administration did not seek to amend the law to extend the subsidies to the Federal Exchanges. Instead, the IRS simply announced that when Section 36B refers to Section 1311 and State Exchanges, there is some sort of ambiguity and it really means to refer to Sections 1311 and 1321 and Federal or State Exchanges. The IRS, in effect, defined \u201c1311\u201d to mean \u201c1311 or 1321.\u201d The IRS is defining sections of the law that another federal department implements.\n\nAdministration supporters claim that there was simply an obvious drafting error. That is hard to swallow. First, no section of the ACA defines \u201cState\u201d to include the federal government. Second, other provisions make clear that Congress knew how to draft language that treated a non-state as a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of any provision of the ACA.\n\nFor example, the ACA provides that territories of the United States (e.g., Guam) are \u201cStates,\u201d for purposes of this law. Section 1323 states that if a \u201cterritory\u201d creates an Exchange, it \u201cshall be treated as a State\u201d under this law. Another section, Section 1304(d), provides that Washington, D.C. is a \u201cState\u201d for purposes of the subsidy dealing with State Health Exchanges. \u201cIn this title, the term \u2018State\u2019 means each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia.\u201d [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18024).] However, no section of the law defines \u201cState\u201d to include the federal government.\n\nAn earlier version of the bill\u2014one that Congress did not enact\u2014provided that \u201cany references in this subtitle to the Health Insurance Exchange . . . shall be deemed a reference to the State-based Health Insurance Exchange.\u201d That would treat Federal Exchanges the same as State Exchanges. Congress did not enact that version. The fact that it considered but did not adopt such express language is evidence that Congress knew how to provide that the law would treat a State-created Exchange and a Federal Exchange the same.\n\nUnelected administrators, hidden from public view, decide significant and controversial issues such as \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d or whether they should regulate the Internet. Regulators (and the president who appoints them) can use complex regulations to reward political friends and burden political enemies. One of the complaints about the enactment of Obamacare was that the president issued \u201cwaivers\u201d of various provisions\u2014waivers that the statute did not authorize \u2014 that rewarded the president\u2019s political supporters or undercut objections to the law. Recall that when the president announced that he was changing the effective date of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a supporter of the law, asked, \u201cThis was the law. How can they change the law?\u201d Good question.\n\nHow the Supreme Court rules in King v. Burwell should tell us whether the trek towards government by administrators slows down or accelerates.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://verdict.justia.com/2015/03/30/is-the-federal-government-really-a-state-if-the-irs-says-it-is", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/scotus_steps.jpg?resize=426%2C350&quality=90&strip=all&fit=1000%25", "description": "By July 4, the Supreme Court will have decided King v.
