They graduated with student loans into a terrible job market. So, it\u2019s no wonder that retirement took a back burner for many of them while they were underemployed and living in their parents\u2019 basements.\n\nHalf of millennials don\u2019t have a 401(k) and only three in ten are actively planning for retirement, according to a recent study. At the same time, a whopping 60 percent of millennials believe Social Security\u2014a key retirement component\u2014will go bankrupt before they retire, another study found.\n\nAs the employment picture brightens, millennials have a second chance to bolster their finances, including putting together a basic plan to meet their retirement goals. Here are seven common mistakes that millennials are making while planning for the future.\n\nThey don\u2019t have a rainy day fund. An emergency fund doesn\u2019t seem like part of retirement planning. But having one will keep you from dipping into your retirement funds to cover an unexpected event like a car breakdown or big medical bill. Only one in five millennials have at least five months\u2019 worth of expenses saved up, according to a recent Bankrate survey, even though the rule of thumb is six. \u201cI know it seems ridiculous to have money sitting around in the bank earning nothing,\u201d says Lynn Ballou, a managing partner with Ballou Plum Wealth Advisors \u201cBut an emergency fund is your best friend.\u201d It also helps you avoid costly penalties that come with early retirement withdrawals and saves you from losing years of earned interest. Think about it: a $5,000 withdrawal that would have earned 5 percent equals a loss of $35,200 after 40 years, or when you\u2019re closing in on retirement. That\u2019s not chump change.\n\nRelated: 5 Key Retirement Strategies for Millennials to Use Right Now\n\nThey\u2019re underestimating their costs. Seven in 10 millennials think they\u2019ll spend less than $36,000 a year in retirement, or 30 percent less than what average retirees are spending now ($46,757), according to a recent survey by Generational Kinetics. That average will increase considerably with inflation over the next thirty years. \u201cMillennials are unrealistic about retirement,\u201d says Wayne Copelin, founder and president of Copelin Financial Advisors in Sugar Land, Texas. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018No, I can live on less than that.\u2019\u201d They\u2019re not saving enough. At a minimum, millennials should be saving enough in their 401(k)s to get the full employer match if one is offered, but two in five are leaving some or all of this extra benefit on the table, according to a July report by T. Rowe Price. That\u2019s free money and a 100 percent return on investment. Overall, millennials should be aiming to set aside at least 10 percent to 15 percent of their salary for retirement, instead of the current 6 percent median for this group. Consider this: A 23-year-old who saves 10 percent per year can retire comfortably at 70, or five years earlier than those saving only 6 percent. Saving 15 percent would bring the retirement age down to 65, according to a recent analysis by NerdWallet. In 2015 and 2016, millennials can save up to $18,000 in a 401(k) account.\n\nRelated: The Rise of a New Economic Underclass\u2014Millennial Men\n\nThey\u2019re missing out on an opportunity to invest in a Roth. Unlike a 401(k) or a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) allows after-tax savings that can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. Those are great vehicles for young savers who are likely in a lower tax bracket than they will be in retirement. \u201cThe beauty of being younger is that generally your income won\u2019t disqualify you from any retirement savings tool,\u201d says Craig LeMoine, a professor of financial planning at The American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa. Roth accounts also offer some tax flexibility for withdrawals when paired with more traditional retirement accounts. For example, if withdrawing from a traditional IRA or 401(k) would push you into higher income bracket, then you could withdraw the money from a Roth account instead. This year, millennials can put a total of $5,500 in a Roth IRA, a traditional IRA or a combination of the two. Their investment mix is too conservative. Perhaps because they witnessed the carnage in the stock market during the financial crisis of 2008, millennials are risk-averse investors, to the detriment of their retirement savings. While 85 percent of millennials are saving for retirement, only a quarter of them own stocks, a Bankrate survey this spring found. \u201cStaying out of stocks is a mistake,\u201d says Joshua DeJohn a financial advisor with Waterstone Financial Services in Pittsford, N.Y. \u201cYou need to have long-term exposure to equities in order to grow your assets.\u201d That\u2019s because stocks offer bigger returns over time, so the growth in your savings can outpace inflation.\n\n\n\nUse an online asset allocation calculator to determine an appropriate blend of stocks and bonds for your risk tolerance, or select a target-date fund that will automatically rebalance investments to become less risky as you approach retirement. They\u2019re putting too much money toward their kids\u2019 education. Since many millennials are still paying off student loans, they know first-hand the burden that college debt can be in the early years of adulthood. To shield their children from this strain, millennials are increasingly over-investing in their children\u2019s 529 college accounts at the expense of their own retirement. Millennial parents want to cover on average three-quarters of their children\u2019s college costs, and half want to pay the entire bill, according to\n\na Fidelity report in September. Fund your retirement first, because you can\u2019t borrow to pay for your golden years. Then help your children select an affordable college and a major that provides a decent return on investment to pay back any student loans.\n\nRelated: Are 401(k) Plans Setting Up Millennials for Pain?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The transition into financial adulthood hasn\u2019t been easy for millennials.", "title": "7 Ways Millennials Are Getting Retirement Saving\u00a0Wrong", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/20/7-Ways-Millennials-Are-Getting-Retirement-Saving-Wrong", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09272012_retirement_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/20/7-Ways-Millennials-Are-Getting-Retirement-Saving-Wrong", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09272012_retirement_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The transition into financial adulthood hasn\u2019t been easy for millennials.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Unlike a 401(k) or a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) allows after-tax savings that can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.\nHalf of millennials don\u2019t have a 401(k) and only three in ten are actively planning for retirement, according to a recent study.\nWhile 85 percent of millennials are saving for retirement, only a quarter of them own stocks, a Bankrate survey this spring found.\nThis year, millennials can put a total of $5,500 in a Roth IRA, a traditional IRA or a combination of the two.\n\u201cMillennials are unrealistic about retirement,\u201d says Wayne Copelin, founder and president of Copelin Financial Advisors in Sugar Land, Texas."}
