Guilt can motivate, but it can also undermine diets: after eating chocolate or a big piece of cake, guilt may spur you to continue your weight loss efforts, or it may trigger surrender.\n\nResearchers Dr. Roeline Kuijer and Jessica Boyce wanted to find out whether eating-induced guilt was an incentive to improve weight-loss efforts, or if it undermined the person\u2019s desire to continue their diet. Their study found that if a person associated chomping down chocolate cake with guilt, they actually ended up having a harder time moving forward with weight loss. \u201cThis study did not find any evidence for adaptive or motivational properties of guilt,\u201d the researchers wrote in their abstract.\n\nThe study first examined what people associated with eating chocolate cake: either guilt or \u201ccelebration.\u201d The researchers wanted to measure \u201cdifferences in attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and intentions in relation to healthy eating.\" Secondly, they wanted to rate levels of weight gain or loss in the participants over a period of 18 months. Some 300 participants, aged 18 to 86, were measured and questioned about whether eating cake was enjoyable or made them feel guilty; 27 percent associated it with guilt, and 73 percent with celebration.\n\nPeople who felt guilty reported a sense of lost control over their eating because they indulged in cake; this led them to drop their weight-loss goals. The guilty eaters did not report any more positive attitudes or stronger intentions to eat healthy, and were not as successful at maintaining their weight. \u201cEnjoyment of food is essential to people\u2019s well-being,\u201d the researchers said in their report, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cThis study shows those who consume a \u2018forbidden food\u2019 with celebration and view it as a treat do better in terms of weight management. Enjoyment of food should receive more attention than it has in the past.\u201d\n\nPsychologists have differing opinions on guilt\u2019s purpose. Some say it works as approach motivation, while others believe it doesn\u2019t have much of a motivating purpose and could even be linked to depression. Several studies have also identified guilt as an aspect of many eating disorders. A 1991 study found that women with eating disorders tend to have more shame and guilt in relation to eating than women who eat normally.\n\n\u201cWhen you feel like you should be holding a pitchfork while eating your meal, you are not enjoying it,\u201d Rebecca Scritchfield writes on U.S. News. \u201cYou feel awful, like you\u2019re being bad, and you\u2019ll never reach your health goals \u2026 That\u2019s a lot of baggage that is not only unnecessary, it\u2019s misguided \u2026 In fact, struggling with guilt or anxiety over foods is less healthy than learning how to let yourself enjoy them in moderation.\u201d\n\nSource: Kuijer R, Boyce J.
