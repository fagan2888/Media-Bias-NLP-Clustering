ASHLAND, Pa. (AP) â€” Police say a woman killed two roosters who kept coal miners company in central Pennsylvania because their crowing woke her up.

Ashland police have charged 21-year-old Jenna Caso with shooting the birds, which had been donated to the Pioneer Tunnel Coal Mine. The birds were donated after another rooster called "Big Red" and a hen named "Anne-thracite" died of natural causes.

Tony Loftus works at the mine and tells WNEP-TV (http://bit.ly/1TfjGg4 ) the birds followed him around, kept the workers company and crowed when the sun came up.

But police say Caso didn't like being awakened by the roosters and shot them on March 17.

Online court records don't list an attorney for Caso, who faces a preliminary hearing May 4.

The mine is about 50 miles northeast of Harrisburg.
