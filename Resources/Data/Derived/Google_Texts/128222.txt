Don’t be fooled Broncos fans, Von Miller is not back on Twitter and did not offer up an apology to you.

Miller’s official account, @MillerLite40, which previously had a blue check mark for verification, has been deactivated for months. But, starting Wednesday morning, one day after it was reported Miller was in trouble with the law again, tweets began going out from the account, including an apology to fans.

Around 10 a.m., the account tweeted: “I know I’ve made mistakes but I’m doing my best to correct them everyone. I will do better in the future and make Broncos fans proud!”

Don’t get too excited. Again, it is not Miller.

The current, fake account, has only 19 followers. Miller’s official account with that handle had tens of thousands of followers.

Miller is currently serving a six-game suspension for violating the league’s drug policy, which he did actually tweet about on his official account before it went dark.

“See reports abt 4 game susp. I know I did nothing wrong. I’m sure this’ll be resolved fairly. Disapp. Broncos have 2 open camp like this.”

That tweet was sent July 22, at 12:49 p.m.
