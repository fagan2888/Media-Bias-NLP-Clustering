Completely predictable \u2013 and predicted.\n\nWhat else are these failed states contemplating?\n\nStates Quietly Consider ObamaCare Exchange Mergers\n\nMany of the 13 state-run ObamaCare exchanges are worried about how they\u2019ll survive once federal dollars supporting them run dry next year\u2026.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is states are figuring out the money is running out,\u201d said Jim Wadleigh, the director of Connecticut\u2019s exchange\u2026.\n\nUmm, the law from its inception sunset the federal coin. To these panicking states one can only say \u201cDuh.\u201d\n\nBut a shared marketplace\u2026has become an increasingly attractive option for states desperate to slash costs.\n\nI get it \u2013 miserable loves company. But I\u2019m not sure how taking two (or more) individual state failures and combining them \u2013 is a solution to anything.\n\nHaving the makers of the Chevrolet Corvair, the Edsal and the DeLorean combine forces doesn\u2019t seem to be a winner. Multiple people who can\u2019t swim desperately clutching at one another \u2013 just means they\u2019ll all sink together.\n\nIt certainly won\u2019t slash costs. Quite the opposite \u2013 there will be additional, huge expenses attending these states attempting their misery mergers.\n\nBy most accounts, creating a multi-state marketplace would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that states could ever merge the full responsibilities of a marketplace, such as regulating plans and managing risk pools.\n\nBut even with a simpler model, like a shared call center or website platform, there are big questions about how states could share those costs and duties.\n\nJennifer Tolbert, a state health expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, said \u201cone of the trickiest issues\u201d would be determining a governing structure for multi-state exchanges.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how that would be resolved,\u201d she said.\n\nAgain, if none alone can get it together \u2013 how will their getting together help? Indeed, it won\u2019t.\n\nThese hurdles have been big enough to thwart multiple states from moving forward with their plans. Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia, which commissioned a study on the option in June 2013, have all dropped the idea.\n\nSo why on Earth are any states still considering it?\n\nIt\u2019s time for Congress to do what Congress before the last election promised it would do.\n\nAnti-ObamaCare Ads Dominate GOP Ad Buys in October\n\nWhich worked.\n\nObamaCare Opposition Drives 2014 Election Results\n\nCongress needs to head off this latest, looming ObamaCare disaster.\n\nAnd start rolling back all the others.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/05/yet-another-terrible-idea-states-consider-combining-their-failed-obamacare-exchanges/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/obamacare-website.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Yet Another Terrible Idea: States Consider Combining Their Failed ObamaCare Exchanges"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "States Quietly Consider ObamaCare Exchange MergersMany of the 13 state-run ObamaCare exchanges are worried about how they\u2019ll survive once federal dollars supporting them run dry next year\u2026.\nJennifer Tolbert, a state health expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, said \u201cone of the trickiest issues\u201d would be determining a governing structure for multi-state exchanges.\nTo these panicking states one can only say \u201cDuh.\u201dBut a shared marketplace\u2026has become an increasingly attractive option for states desperate to slash costs.\nObamaCare Opposition Drives 2014 Election ResultsCongress needs to head off this latest, looming ObamaCare disaster.\nOregon Gives Up On State ObamaCare Site, Switches to Federal ExchangeFailure and Corruption in the Massachusetts ObamaCare ExchangeAlmost Half of ObamaCare Exchanges Face Financial Struggles in the FutureMany of the online exchanges are wrestling with surging costs, especially for balky technology and expensive customer call centers \u2014 and tepid enrollment numbers."}
