A 26-year-old newlywed died earlier this month after succumbing to flu-related complications in her hometown of Kenosha, Wis. Even though the woman, Katherine McQuestion, had received the flu vaccine to comply with the health care protocol of her profession as a radiology technician, she began to feel ill Dec. 29. After a stint in the emergency room on New Year’s Day, McQuestion’s health began to decline, resulting in blood poisoning and an eventual heart attack. Multiple organ failure rapidly followed, and McQuestion gave out on Jan. 2.

Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn., cites the cause of McQuestion’s sepsis as the flu’s progression to pneumonia. "Usually pneumonia infection is confined to the lungs, but on occasion, it can be so bad that the bacteria leave the lungs and get into the blood stream," he said. In order to prevent this progression, Schaffner advises to seek medical attention if you are having shortness of breath or you are coughing up yellow, green, or blood-tinged mucus.

As for general flu prevention, Kenosha County Health Officer Cynthia Johnson still emphasizes the importance of the flu vaccine. “For a majority of people, they should get vaccinated because this is a very unusual case and typically does not happen,” she said.

McQuestion’s mother hopes her daughter’s story will raise awareness of the possible dangers to prolonging medical treatment. "If this can help just one family avoid this, then it's not in vain," she said.
