James Settelmeyer and Patricia Farley presented SB193 to the Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill raises the minimum wage to $9 for employees without employer-sponsored health insurance and keeps it at $7.25 for other workers.\n\nThe measure repeals a law requiring employers to pay overtime after eight hours of work in a 24-hour period. It would only require overtime once an employee works more than 40 hours in a week.\n\nFarley said most minimum wage workers rarely clock even 30 hours of work per week due to health insurance provisions in the Affordable Care Act. She said the bill would help low-wage employees take home more money.\n\nShe said that nearly 3.3 percent of Nevada workers make minimum wage, and the bill would affect nearly 6 percent of the state\u2019s businesses.\n\nBusiness groups testified in favor of the bill primarily for the overtime provisions, and asked lawmakers to modify or take out the minimum wage hike. Tim Wulf, who owns two sandwich shops in Reno, said the increase would force him to raise prices and cut back on employees.\n\n\u201cIncrease the minimum wage, and you\u2019ll have kiosks instead of cashiers,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral union lobbyists testified against the bill, and said they supported the wage hike but were concerned the measure would allow businesses to take advantage of part-time workers.\n\n\u201cIt takes a special measure for business groups to come out in favor of a minimum wage increase and for labor groups to oppose it,\u201d Las Vegas Culinary Union lobbyist Yvanna Cancela said.\n\nDemocrats on the committee said they\u2019re concerned that the overtime changes could lead to employers taking advantage of workers by requiring them to adhere to longer daily schedules without offering a full 40 hours a week.\n\nFormer waitress and Democratic Assemblywoman Maggie Carlton said she was concerned that raising the wage would put low-wage workers in the difficult spot of making slightly more than the threshold for medical benefits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how the pieces of this puzzle fit together, so that we don\u2019t pay people enough to lose the benefits they need,\u201d she said.\n\nSettelmeyer acknowledged that the measure could lead to some pay cuts but the majority of workers would see their pay go up.\n\nSenate Democrats spoke out strongly against the bill, which initially only changed overtime calculations then was amended to include a minimum wage provision in March. The measure passed on a party-line 11-9 vote in the Senate.\n\nThe Assembly committee took no action on the bill.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Capitol Hill Blue\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 The Associated Press.
