They point to Ferguson as an example of the excess of the spectacle that draws attention to the most extreme cases of brutality or violence, and simultaneously renders the daily, hourly, violence faced by black Americans as ordinary and therefore unworthy of the empathy engendered in extreme cases.\n\nAttention is drawn to the \u201cspectacular event\u201d rather than to the point of origin or the mundane. Circulated are the spectacles \u2014 dead black bodies lying in the streets or a black teenager ambushed by several police officers in military gear, automatic weapons drawn.\n\nTheir insights resonated as every major media outlet covered the repeated, more extreme, ever-growing confrontations between protestors and Ferguson law enforcement. The sympathy for the brutalized in Ferguson emerged as a response to the documented ill treatment of relatively privileged and protected whites (reporters, supporters, observers) who momentarily faced the same treatment that is de rigeur for vulnerable blacks \u2014 in Ferguson, St. Louis, Chicago, Paterson, Charlotte, Houston, New Orleans, Los Angeles and elsewhere.\n\nThe other aspect of the extreme spectacle is that it allows Michael Brown\u2019s death to be seen as contingent, accidental and not part of a pattern. Such extremes of violence garner attention to the murderous injustices faced by blacks, but emphasize that such injustices are somehow race-neutral, as in the sudden attention drawn to the militarization of the police \u2014 as a problem affecting not only blacks, but \u201ceveryone.\u201d As Nopper and Kaba state:\n\nWe can also consider this an example of \u201cthe precariousness of empathy,\u201d with blacks required to tether their suffering to non-blacks (and processes often erroneously treated as non-black, such as \u201cmilitarization\u201d and \u201cglobalization\u201d) in the hope of being seen and heard. This is also a marker of the compulsory solidarity that is demanded of black people without any expectation that this solidarity will be reciprocated.\n\nIn that light, it is striking that the New York Times, which has explained the racial history of Ferguson, chooses a race-neutral standard by which to explain police shootings. In an article entitled \u201cKey Factor in Police Shootings: \u2018Reasonable Fear,\u201d Michael Wines and Frances Robles describe the conditions under which police officers are trained to shoot. They explore the standard of \u201creasonable fear,\u201d as developed in Graham v. Connor, a 1989 decision in which the Supreme Court rejected a young man\u2019s claim of excessive and brutal treatment by police. As Wines and Robles explain,\n\n\u201ca police officer\u2019s use of excessive force must be seen in the context of what reasonable officers would do in the same situation, given the danger and stress of police work.\u201d\n\nThe original case is germane to the shootings of Mike Brown in Ferguson and the cold-blooded shooting of Kajieme Powell in St. Louis several days later. In the 1989 case, a diabetic young man, Dethorne Graham, living in Charlotte, North Carolina, asked a friend, William Berry, to drive him to a store to buy some orange juice to counteract an insulin reaction that he was having. A police officer (Connor) noticed the haste with which Graham entered and left the store. After following him for a short distance, Connor stopped Berry and Graham. Graham eventually passed out for a few moments (presumably from insulin shock). Despite his friend\u2019s explanatory pleas that Graham was having a diabetic reaction, Connor refused to release him and called for backup. Accusing Graham of being drunk instead, the officers restrained him on the sidewalk until they received a report from the store that nothing was amiss.\n\nThe Rehnquist Court circumscribed \u201creasonableness\u201d as an objective standard by insisting that intent and motivation (presumably of the police officers) are irrelevant to judging whether excessive force was used:\n\n[T]he question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation. The court views the issue of \u201creasonable fear\u201d from the perspective of the police officer. The standard is to be established based on the \u201cthreat analysis\u201d \u2014 to the police officer \u2014 who is presumably trained, armed, and focused to attack, defend, and even kill.\n\nEvery step, however, is overshadowed by a single imperative: If an officer believes he or someone else is in imminent danger of grievous injury or death, he is allowed to shoot first and ask questions later. The same is true, the courts have ruled, in cases where a suspect believed to have killed or gravely injured someone is fleeing and can only be halted with deadly force.\n\nWhat we know, then, is that police officers are allowed to shoot first and ask questions later, presumably in order to act in the interest of themselves and the public interest. This, apparently, is what is meant by the \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness,\u201d by what constitutes \u201creasonable fear.\u201d\n\nNotice several things about the summary of the Graham case and judgment:\n\n1. Neither the racial backgrounds of the police officers nor of Graham and his friend are ever mentioned. However, given the profanities that the police officer used to describe Graham, the refusal to listen to his friend\u2019s interventions and the town in which this event occurred, where 31.8% of the population was black and 65% was white, I would wager that Graham and Berry were black and at least one, most likely both, of the police officers were white.\n\n2. The \u201creasonable fear\u201d standard is based exclusively on the perceptions, danger, stress level and cognitive focus of the police officer. There are a number of assumptions predicated in this opinion: that police work is exclusively about danger, criminality and maintaining control (qua \u201cpeace and safety\u201d).\n\n3. Correlatively, there is no discussion of the level of familiarity or intimacy with the community where the officer is employed or patrols \u2014 presumably because that is not the operative framework of either the police department or the Supreme Court.\n\n4. The case is decided based on the 4th Amendment rights to search and seizure \u2014 in 1989. Two and a half decades later, in a world where the assumption of such a right has been starkly diminished through the operative framework of National Security, where the state has established increasing authority to encroach upon one\u2019s person, property and effects, how would such a lawsuit be entertained by the courts today?\n\nAll of this raises the obvious question: Is the notion of a \u201creasonable fear\u201d standard, well, reasonable?\n\nThe standard of the \u201creasonable person\u201d has a longstanding history, and can be found in various places, such as the 17th century writings on liberalism by philosopher John Locke. For Locke, reason was supposedly a capacity issued to everyone \u201cwho will but consult it.\u201d One\u2019s proof of possession of reason was the ability to accumulate property (and visibly demonstrate that ability in a form understood by 17th century Englishmen \u2014 colonialists, parliaments and royalty). Needless to say, this ability was not possessed by American Indians, or those who were poor, dumb or slaves. (White) women could demonstrate a limited form of reason, but in cases of controversy, the ultimate arbiter of reason would be her closest living male relative.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Courts say cops can shoot out of \"reasonable fear.\" In America that entails a myth of race and gender neutrality", "title": "Shoot first, ask later: Why the concept of \u201creasonable fear\u201d is anything but reasonable", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Courts say cops can shoot out of \"reasonable fear.\" In America that entails a myth of race and gender neutrality", "title": "Shoot first, ask later: Why the concept of \u201creasonable fear\u201d is anything but reasonable", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/06/shoot_first_ask_later_why_the_concept_of_reasonable_fear_is_anything_but_reasonable/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ferguson9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Courts say cops can shoot out of \"reasonable fear.\" In America that entails a myth of race and gender neutrality", "title": "Shoot first, ask later: Why the concept of \u201creasonable fear\u201d is anything but reasonable", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ferguson9.jpg", "creator": "@FalguniSheth", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Falguni A.
