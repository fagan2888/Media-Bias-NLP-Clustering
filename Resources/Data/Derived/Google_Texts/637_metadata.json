They\u2019re headhunting for Para Bellum Labs, the GOP\u2019s attempt to answer the computed power of President Obama\u2019s Organizing for America. The organization is meant to take advantage of a start-up spirit, nurturing small, agile political projects that can scale up to national races.\n\nThe new initiative takes its name from the Latin motto, Si vis pacem, para bellum\u2014If you seek peace, prepare for war. But it might have been more apropos to say, Si vis vitam, para bellum\u2014prepare for war, if you want to live. In 2012, the GOP\u2019s get out the vote project, Project Orca, blew up in the Romney campaigns face. On Election Day, the webpage went down and stayed down, unprepared to handle the load of field volunteers checking voter turnout and following up with tardy voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama team\u2019s outreach rolled along smoothly, messages tailored to individual voters through Project Narwhal, a massive data mining initiative similar to the algorithms and A/B testing that online advertisers use to maximize the chance that you\u2019ll click through on an ad. The Obama tech team didn\u2019t just work on what message to send, but what medium to send it through as well. At the peak of the campaign, the Obama team was carefully looking for undervalued, highly-targeted media buys. Their big data machine meant that the Democrats were spending, on average, $72 less per TV spot than the Romney campaign.\n\nThe Para Bellum team may be able to help the GOP staunch the bleeding, but they\u2019re unlikely to deliver the same kind of advantage as Project Narwhal did for the Democrats. The Obama campaign benefited from being the first mover in the political data movement. By using big data, they were able to segment voters and media markets into smaller demographic slices and to identify opportunities that had been systematically mispriced.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 playbook resembled the sabermetric approach of Billy Beane, the Oakland A\u2019s coach profiled in Moneyball. By taking a finer-grained approach to a market (of persuadable voters, in the Democrats case, of free agents and draftees, in Beane\u2019s), the quants were able to steal a march on their opponents.\n\nBut Billy Beane\u2019s Oakland A\u2019s only benefited from his Moneyball strategies for a few seasons before the rest of the league caught up, and his advantage didn\u2019t last long enough to reach the World Series. His data-intensive approach only helped as long as players were systematically mispriced. Once the other general managers wised up, the market for players settled into a new equilibrium and the richer teams were able to outbid their rivals for better players.\n\nThe Para Bellum initiative can blunt the advantage of the Organizing for America team, but it will be difficult to outstrip them. As both parties get better at leveraging big data, they\u2019ll find it easier and easier to spend their resources efficiently on the undecideds who are most likely to become supporters, and the supporters who are the most likely to become campaign contributors.\n\nBig data and algorithms mean that future political campaigns will be conducted in a world of better slicing and better pricing. But better pricing, in this case, means more efficient pricing, not cheaper pricing. If Para Bellum Labs succeeds in its mission, the Republicans won\u2019t be leaving money on the table for Democratic programmers anymore. But instead of reaping an advantage of their own, the GOP coders will just have shifted the electoral market into a new equilibrium.\n\nJust as the segmentation of the electoral college allows both parties to better target their outreach, to the only voters whose votes could make a difference, the data crunchers on both sides will let the parties fight fiercely over an ever smaller set of voters.\n\nFollow @leahlibresco\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "At hackathons and in the cubicle-less offices of Silicon Valley firms, Republican recruiters are sidling up to programmers and cautiously sounding them out to s", "title": "Republicans Try to Bridge the Big Data Gap", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/2014/02/17/republicans-try-to-bridge-the-big-data-gap/", "image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_114707911.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At hackathons and in the cubicle-less offices of Silicon Valley firms, Republican recruiters are sidling up to programmers and cautiously sounding them out to see how they feel about the NSA spying pr", "creator": "@amconmag", "image": {"src": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_114707911.jpg"}, "title": "Republicans Try to Bridge the Big Data Gap", "site": "@amconmag", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "maisie.allison"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2012, the GOP\u2019s get out the vote project, Project Orca, blew up in the Romney campaigns face.\nBig data and algorithms mean that future political campaigns will be conducted in a world of better slicing and better pricing.\nBut better pricing, in this case, means more efficient pricing, not cheaper pricing.\nAt the peak of the campaign, the Obama team was carefully looking for undervalued, highly-targeted media buys.\nTheir big data machine meant that the Democrats were spending, on average, $72 less per TV spot than the Romney campaign."}
