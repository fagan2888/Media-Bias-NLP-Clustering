They may also mean healthier behaviors among teens.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Pediatrics, compared students from highly rated charter high schools with those from regular public high schools\u2014all located in low-income Los Angeles neighborhoods.\n\nThe researchers found that students from the charter schools not only performed much better on math and English standard tests. These students also reported less very risky health behaviors, including unprotected sex, carrying a weapon, and gang membership, compared to district school students.\n\nRetention in the same school may be the most important factor, they found.\n\nHowever, the effects were much less dramatic when it came to more moderate health risks. In fact, when the researchers looked at recent use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs, there was virtually no difference between the two groups.\n\nTo select the two groups of students, the researchers took advantage of the lottery admissions system used by many charter schools. While a random lottery may be a parent\u2019s nightmare, it is a researcher\u2019s dream. Similar to a traditional \u201crandomized\u201d experiment, some teens are randomly chosen for the experimental group (the charter schools) and the others are assigned to the control group (the district schools). In theory, both groups of kids should look pretty similar, which means they can be compared.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the study was to determine whether successful schools influence health, and we chose to study charter schools because they have a random admissions lottery,\u201d Dr. Mitchell Wong of UCLA\u2019s School of Medicine, the lead author, explains. \u201cWe presume that the effects on health would also occur among successful traditional public schools, but that will have to be tested in a future study.\u201d\n\nThe study authors suggest a number of possible explanations for the apparent link between school quality and healthy behaviors. Students in high-performing schools may have less exposure to risky peers or less time to participate in risky activities.\n\nBut retention in the same school may be the most important factor, they found. In both school groups, students who changed schools or dropped out were more likely to engage in very risky behaviors.\n\nBased on their findings, the researchers conclude that high-performing charter schools in low-income neighborhoods could benefit the health and behaviors of teens early on. But since every child can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the charter school lottery, they suggest that all schools consider policies to support school retention. By reducing suspensions and expulsions, or providing tutoring to help struggling students, schools\u2014regardless of their academic ranking\u2014have the potential to reduce serious health risks among teens, they say.\n\nMeg Campbell, Executive Director of the Codman Academy Charter Public School, knows first-hand the influence of a school\u2019s quality on health. Codman Academy is the only school in the country that is actually inside a health center, the renowned Codman Square Health Center in Dorchester.\n\n\u201cNo parent wants his or her child to engage in high-risk behavior, and I would posit no student, deep in his or her heart, does either,\u201d she says. \u201cKids get trapped by trauma and poverty. They need a lever out and robust education can provide that lever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a school taps into students\u2019 dreams for a better future and gives them the tools and skills to realize them, then mental and physical health will improve too,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that successful high schools may lead to healthier behaviors among teens, in addition to greater academic achievement.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new study finds that successful high schools may lead to healthier behaviors among teens, in addition to greater academic achievement.", "title": "Winning The Lottery: Study Links School Quality To Teen Health", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/07/school-quality-teen-health", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/07/4228567707_24ccdab4e0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/07/school-quality-teen-health", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/07/4228567707_24ccdab4e0.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Winning The Lottery: Study Links School Quality To Teen Health"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-22", "date": "Tue, 22 Jul 2014 12:39:10 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5ab\"", "article_summary": "Winning The Lottery: Study Links School Quality To Teen HealthVeronica ThomasCommonHealth InternSuccessful high schools don\u2019t just mean higher academic achievement, a new study finds.\nBut since every child can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the charter school lottery, they suggest that all schools consider policies to support school retention.\nThese students also reported less very risky health behaviors, including unprotected sex, carrying a weapon, and gang membership, compared to district school students.\nMeg Campbell, Executive Director of the Codman Academy Charter Public School, knows first-hand the influence of a school\u2019s quality on health.\nThe researchers found that students from the charter schools not only performed much better on math and English standard tests."}
