Spotlight on… Dwyane Wade, shooting guard, Heat

When: Based on some vintage performances, The Denver Post’s NBA player of the week award goes to Miami’s Dwyane Wade for the evaluation period of March 14-20.

What’s up: In three games, Wade averaged 28.7 points, 4.0 assists and 2.3 steals. The Marquette product shot 56.5 percent from the floor, leading the Heat to three wins.

Background: Sure, Wade is getting old. It’s showing up in games missed because of injuries, a loss of the explosive athleticism that once defined his game, and the many times Miami will sit him out for rest. But the old Flash is still in there, and in three turn-back-the clock performances, Wade showed there’s still tread on his tires at age 33. His best game: 32 points and five steals in a win over the surging Cleveland Cavaliers and their superstar, LeBron James.

Dempsey’s take: What’s not to love? Wade looked like the Wade we all remember — and that player was a nightly tidal wave of greatness. The backdrop of all this, even after the loss of the team’s best player, Chris Bosh, is the Heat contending for a playoff berth and being re-energized by additions to the team such as point guard Goran Dragic, center Hassan Whiteside and forward Marcus Beasley. Wade is providing the steady leadership needed to get Miami back to the postseason.
