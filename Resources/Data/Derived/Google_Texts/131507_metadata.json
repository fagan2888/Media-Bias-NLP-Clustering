And that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna keep us strong.\u201d\n\nJumping Eagle says she\u2019s planning to redirect her medical practice from the corporate provider she works for in Bismarck and begin serving patients at Standing Rock.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about leaving the rez like it\u2019s escaping Alcatraz,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that. We have to reject that attitude because there\u2019s beautiful things about the places we\u2019re from.\u201d\n\nWhen life doesn\u2019t always go like we want, she advised to \u201cjust keep going,\u201d and look to the strong and good things in Native communities and the strengths in families that give hope.\n\nIron Eyes, an attorney and founder of the Last Real Indians website, echoed his wife\u2019s pride in the reservation, describing his upbringing at Fort Yates, North Dakota on Standing Rock.\n\nWe may come from some tough places, because the government deliberately imposed a poverty culture on our people, but \u201cto see people who have persevered, tells me we have hope,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need [the approval of] everybody to be a leader in your own community,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t limit yourself. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to lead. You just do it. And each of you here has the determination to do that.\u201d\n\nMeaningful Learning\n\nSix of the mid-year United Tribes graduates earned Bachelor of Science Degrees, 11 earned Associate of Applied Science Degrees and 16 earned Certificates of Completion. The grads earned their degrees in 12 different programs of study. Ten completed their work in the college\u2019s newly revived welding program.\n\n\u201cUnited Tribes has changed quite a bit over the years,\u201d said College President David M. Gipp. \u201cBut we still offer the fundamentals for Native people. Welding is a program we\u2019ve brought back because of what\u2019s happening in the economy. Now there\u2019s a job demand. We try to offer programs that are meaningful to graduates and helpful in their career.\u201d\n\nWhat you\u2019ve achieved here by graduating is something no one can take away from you, said Gipp. \u201cYou did the work. You earned it. And it\u2019s something you will have for life.\u201d He called this a \u201cstepping stone\u201d for more and greater success.\n\nAbout 175 family members, friends and members of the college faculty and staff braved sub-zero weather to gather in the college\u2019s wellness center to help honor the graduates.\n\nThe Wise Spirit Singers provided Flag and Honor songs. The UTTC Color Guard presented and retired the Staff and Flags. A traditional meal was hosted for grads, family members and friends in the college\u2019s cafeteria.\n\nThe Fall Honoring completed the semester and marked the beginning of a holiday break. Spring Semester 2014 begins with student orientation January 2, followed by the start of classes on January 6.", "article_metadata": {"description": "United Tribes Technical College honored its fall graduates at a ceremony December 20 where Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle and Chase Iron Eyes spoke.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/26/united-tribes-graduates-challenged-continue-success-152826", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/united-tribes-technical-college-welding-grad.jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "United Tribes Graduates Challenged to Continue Success"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "United Tribes Graduates Challenged to Continue Success"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/26/united-tribes-graduates-challenged-continue-success-152826", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2013-12-26T16:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "United Tribes Technical College, Native American students, Graduation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "United Tribes Graduates Challenged to Continue Success"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf728\"", "article_summary": "And each of you here has the determination to do that.\u201dMeaningful LearningSix of the mid-year United Tribes graduates earned Bachelor of Science Degrees, 11 earned Associate of Applied Science Degrees and 16 earned Certificates of Completion.\nDr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician, mother of three and role model, congratulated the newest corps of graduates at United Tribes Technical College on accomplishing a challenging educational goal.\n\u201cUnited Tribes has changed quite a bit over the years,\u201d said College President David M.
