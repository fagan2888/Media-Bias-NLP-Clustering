There are few words less romantic than splotchy. Rash? Cottage cheese? But as I sit here, my memory brushing aside a couple of decades, I\u2019m enamored by this childhood vision \u2014 a splotchy patch of dirt upon this otherwise evergreen backyard, a spot where grass just couldn\u2019t grow.\n\nThis was the pitcher\u2019s mound. Well, not a mound. The pitcher\u2019s splotch. We\u2019d play so much whiffle ball in my buddy\u2019s backyard that the grass just gave up, surrendering to scuffing from our Agassis or Bo Jacksons.\n\nThis splotch made the back yard a ball yard.\n\nWe loved whiffle ball, lived for whiffle ball. Maybe you did too? And on this Fourth of July holiday, I bet there will be yellow bats flung throughout Denver parks, CarGos in cargo shorts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a version of baseball, which is synonymous with summertime in America,\u201d said Colorado Springs resident Jaime Hixson, who was the commissioner of a whiffle ball league for two decades. \u201cYou can be 55 years old or you can be 10, and it\u2019s still a blast. Grab whatever you can for the bases, all you need is a yellow plastic bat and a ball.\u201d\n\nIt really was the perfect game \u2014 it was hardball \u201cchildproofed,\u201d so we could emulate the national pastime without breaking any windows. You could throw curveballs without throwing out your shoulder.\n\nI still play. You can find me in Denver\u2019s Riverfront Park, a 35-year-old man, grunting as I throw my oxy moron of a fastball, scuffing the evergreen grass with my shoes.\n\nTwo decades ago, back home in St. Louis, we\u2019d play in the backyard of Daniel and David Norber. Strike that \u2014 in the grand cathedral we called Norber Stadium, with its woods behind home plate and wooden fence in right field, which was the perfect, predestined distance for a whiffle ball game. The house itself loomed in left field, but as left-handed-hitting Daniel recently reminded me, \u201cOnce my parents added a porch to the back of the house, I always felt like I was (cheated), because the power alley for right-handed hitters was super close, because on the porch is a ground-rule double.\u201d\n\nI love how he said \u201cis\u201d a ground-rule double, as if it\u2019s a standing rule, everlasting, just in case we all reunite in his boyhood backyard and someone smacks one to the porch.\n\nEveryone seems to play whiffle ball with variations of the rules, kind of like accents from different parts of the country. We\u2019d play \u201cpitcher\u2019s hand,\u201d meaning we had to literally run to first base \u2014 safe if we arrived before the pitcher retrieved the ball.\n\nThese days, baserunning has given way to beer drinking, and hits are thus simply categorized \u2014 grounder past the pitcher is a single, deep drive is a double, and such. Defense is extremely more taxing than offense, be it pitching or chasing down flyballs. A few years back, my buddy Luke Price leapt for a liner, and when he arose from the grass, his lower leg was bloody. At first I was like, \u201cDude, what were you thinking?\u201d But then it dawned on me. I thought, \u201cYou know, man, there\u2019s only one way to play whiffle ball \u2014 like you\u2019re 11.\u201d\n\nThe games get intense. I\u2019m still bitter about the debacle of March 2011. My buddies Peter and George were visiting from Los Angeles. Now, the farthest east Peter had ever been was like Palm Springs. So, knowing he was headed to Colorado, and assuming I lived atop Pikes Peak, he purchased these ridiculously thick, waterproof mountain shoes. But it was 70 and sunny all weekend.\n\nWe decided to play some whiffle ball, one-on-one-on-one. There\u2019s always a batter, pitcher and fielder, and by the bottom of the last inning, the score was Benjamin 9, George 9, Peter 0.\n\nI was on the mound, George at the bat.\n\nI pieced together a pair of outs, but George soon loaded the bases. I felt like the world stopped \u2014 surely all the joggers and families paused in the park \u2014 as I unleashed the fateful pitch. George whisked the yellow bat and walloped the whiffle ball to the outfield, and the ball hovered in the air, as Peter scampered.\n\nPeter chased that thing, Luke Price-esque, leaping into the air, arm extended \u2026 and the ball misses his fingertips by a fingertip.\n\nGeorge won. I blew the save. But darn it \u2014 if Peter had just worn normal, human shoes, I swear he would\u2019ve caught that thing.\n\nWhiffle ball, man. It stays with you.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Whiffle ball brings out the kid in us", "title": "Hochman: Whiffle ball brings out the kid in us", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/03/hochman-whiffle-ball-brings-out-the-kid-in-us/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T19:18:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:58:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9af\"", "article_summary": "We loved whiffle ball, lived for whiffle ball.\nI thought, \u201cYou know, man, there\u2019s only one way to play whiffle ball \u2014 like you\u2019re 11.\u201dThe games get intense.\nEveryone seems to play whiffle ball with variations of the rules, kind of like accents from different parts of the country.\nWhiffle ball, man.\nGeorge whisked the yellow bat and walloped the whiffle ball to the outfield, and the ball hovered in the air, as Peter scampered."}
