The law leaves victims vulnerable, however, in the days or weeks that their abuser is under a temporary restraining order.\n\nDomestic violence experts have known for years that abusers are the most violent in the hours and days after a spouse has left the relationship, and they realize they have been issued a temporary restraining order. \"The moment of danger in a relationship is when one partner tells another she's leaving,\" Blumenthal said. \"That is the moment of maximum rage. That is the moment of greatest danger. That is the moment of uncontrollable wrath, and that is when the law is at its weakest.\"\n\nBlumenthal's bill would fix the loophole in current law by expanding the ban on firearms to include people under a temporary restraining order. The bill would also broaden the definition of \"intimate partner\" to include other people who may be threatening the victim, like someone who may be dating or stalking the victim.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal has introduced legislation aimed at protecting victims of domestic violence who obtain a temporary restraining order", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/blumenthal-proposal-aims-fix-loophole-restraining-order-law", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201406/Photo_2_Lori_Jackson_Bill_Press_Conference.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal has introduced legislation aimed at protecting victims of domestic violence who obtain a temporary restraining order", "title": "Blumenthal Proposal Aims to Fix Loophole in Restraining Order Law"}, "story_id": 323967875, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Ray Hardman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Blumenthal Proposal Aims to Fix Loophole in Restraining Order Law"}, "nid": 23983, "datePublished": "2014-06-20", "keywords": "violence, death, families, Congress, The Daily", "wordCount": 314, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa0e\"", "article_summary": "Blumenthal's bill would fix the loophole in current law by expanding the ban on firearms to include people under a temporary restraining order.\nThe law leaves victims vulnerable, however, in the days or weeks that their abuser is under a temporary restraining order.\n\"The temporary restraining order against Lori's husband was completely ineffective, powerless to prevent him from using that gun against her to kill her,\" he said.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal has introduced legislation aimed at protecting victims of domestic violence who obtain a temporary restraining order against their abuser.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal said in a speech on the Senate floor that the law failed Lori Jackson."}
