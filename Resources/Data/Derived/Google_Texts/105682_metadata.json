(AP) \u2014 When Jason Brown came to Nashville to start his career as the country artist Colt Ford, he couldn\u2019t find songwriters who would write for his singing style.\n\nNo surprise. Ford was bringing an unlikely mix to town: country rap, combining hip-hop beats and rhythms with country-themed rap or spoken-word lyrics.\n\n\u201cYou might have found a song that you could have altered or changed a little bit,\u201d Ford said, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t have been able to find a record in that style.\u201d\n\nBut after country star Jason Aldean tried his hand at rapping on one of Ford\u2019s songs and turned it into one of the biggest hits of Aldean\u2019s career, songwriters, producers and mainstream country artists are now eager to work with him to figure out the key to this hot new sound in country music.\n\nStill, Ford has never had his own Top 40 radio hit, even as his last album in 2012 debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s country album chart.\n\nThat may soon change. His new album, \u201cThanks For Listening,\u201d released on July 1, features a very radio-friendly duet with Keith Urban called \u201cShe\u2019s Like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I hear what\u2019s going on in mainstream radio, I go, \u2018Well, why can\u2019t you play me? You play the other stuff that is exactly what I do,'\u201d Ford said. \u201cThat\u2019s frustrating to me.\u201d\n\nThe country radio format now leans heavily toward 18-35 year olds who grew up in the hip-hop boom of the late \u201980s through early \u201990s, says Clay Hunnicutt, Clear Channel\u2019s executive vice president of national programming and country brand manager.\n\nIt may be one thing for a country song to be remixed or for a country artist to dabble in hip hop, but \u201crap\u201d still faces a bias.\n\n\u201cI think rap gets treated like a dirty word,\u201d Hunnicutt said. \u201cTo me, Jason Aldean doing \u2018Dirt Road Anthem\u2019 is not rap. It\u2019s a different way of doing the song and it\u2019s a different way of lyrically delivering it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite hits, no radio love yet for country rap", "title": "Despite hits, no radio love yet for country rap", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite hits, no radio love yet for country rap", "title": "Despite hits, no radio love yet for country rap", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/05/despite_hits_no_radio_love_yet_for_country_rap/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/music-country-rap.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite hits, no radio love yet for country rap", "title": "Despite hits, no radio love yet for country rap", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/music-country-rap.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kristin M.
