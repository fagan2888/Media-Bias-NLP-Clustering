In that case, for an unknown reason neither man deployed his chute, and emergency chutes deployed too close to the ground to save them. Video from Amarson\u2019s helmet cam showed he tried to open Pordarson\u2019s chute before they hit the ground.\n\nIn 2010, Paul C. Luter III, 68, died after jumping at Skydive City. In that instance, the chute apparently malfunctioned.\n\nStay with TBO.com for updates.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 19 Oct 2013 15:15:24 -0400", "Description": "A wingwalker died after his parachute failed to deploy after he fell from a plane in Pasco County, the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "A wingwalker died after his parachute failed to deploy after he fell from a plane in Pasco County, the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.", "title": "Pasco sheriff: Man dead after parachute fails", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/sheriff-skydiver-dead-after-parachute-failure-in-pasco-20131019/", "image": {"width": 497, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131019/ARTICLE/131019021/AR/0/AR-131019021.jpg", "height": 289}, "updated_time": "2013-10-20T08:27:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "A wingwalker died after his parachute failed to deploy after he fell from a plane in Pasco County, the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.", "title": "Pasco sheriff: Man dead after parachute fails", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131019/ARTICLE/131019021/AR/0/AR-131019021.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-19T15:15:24Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T08:27:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2675\"", "article_summary": "A wingwalker died after his parachute failed to deploy after he fell from a plane in Pasco County, the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nIn that case, for an unknown reason neither man deployed his chute, and emergency chutes deployed too close to the ground to save them.\nMark Curto, 62, of Tampa appears to have been a part of an air show, sheriff\u2019s spokesperson Melanie Snow said.\nThe pilot safely landed the biplane that Curto fell from at Topp of Tampa airport in Land O\u2019 Lakes, Snow said.\nIt is at least the third fatal skydiving accident in the Tampa Bay area in the past three years."}
