It stands to reason, then, that liberals whine more than their counterparts on the right. The litany of liberal complaints includes Republicans, Fox News, global warming \u201cdeniers,\u201d conservatives\u2019 silly fixation with religious freedom, and the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn the wake of the high court\u2019s rulings on gay marriage and, especially, Obamacare, this might be a good time to let your liberal friends know that they can take Chief Justice John Roberts and his merry majority of Obamacare enablers off their list.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court matters\u201d is a quadrennial rallying cry of political professionals trying to rally the troops. Progressives are particularly passionate about this. The latest version of this battle hymn was sung by MSNBC anchorwoman Rachel Maddow. Writing in The Washington Post, Maddow asserted last week that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201caggressive interventionism has established these nine men and women as the dynamic, creative and disruptive center of U.S. policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn everything from the states\u2019 systems for drawing legislative districts, to the Affordable Care Act, to voting rights, to the tear-down of campaign finance laws that has supercharged the leverage of the politically inclined super-rich, this court has shown a voracious appetite for finding cases with the potential to disrupt settled policies,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe Supreme Court always matters, but under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., with the court so enthusiastic about shifting the direction of the country, it really (really!) matters who is on that bench.\u201d\n\nAccusing the court of \u201caggressive interventionism\u201d in the cause of social disruption is a curious charge. The court decides cases brought before it, by parties that cannot agree. Increasingly in recent years that means the Congress and the White House need a referee. The only issue on which Maddow\u2019s description would be remotely fair is gay marriage, unmentioned by her, presumably because she correctly sensed the direction the court was heading. And even there the court was following, not leading, American public opinion and state law in some 37 states.\n\nHere\u2019s the background:\n\nOn a party-line vote in March 2010, Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law that sought to reduce the estimated 50 million Americans without medical insurance. It provided incentives\u2014sticks and carrots\u2014to states to expand Medicaid to the working poor, prevented insurers from targeting people with pre-existing medical conditions, required employers\u2019 health plans to keep young people on their parents\u2019 plans up to age 26, and mandated that every American enroll in health insurance plans, on penalty of a fine to be levied by the IRS.\n\nTwo main legal challenges emerged from the myriad litigation over this law. The first reached the high court in 2012. Opponents had argued that the Constitution\u2019s 10th Amendment \u201ccommerce clause\u201d prohibited Congress from mandating the commercial activity of Americans who have no desire to engage in the activity in question\u2014in this case, purchasing medical insurance. Justice Roberts, after signaling sympathy with this view during oral arguments, rejected it. He cast the deciding vote in a 5-4 decision, and wrote an opinion that struck his critics as tortured: the Obamacare \u201cpenalties\u201d prescribed in the law for those who didn\u2019t want to buy medical insurance were really taxes\u2014and Congress has the power to tax.\n\nThe second major challenge centered on ambiguous language in the original statute. The ACA created government-backed \u201cexchanges\u201d where the uninsured could purchase insurance. The rub here was that the law offered subsidies only to people buying insurance from \u201can exchange established by the state.\u201d Many states chose not to set up exchanges, so the federal government did it for them. But these exchanges exceeded the actual authority of the law, or so the plaintiffs claimed.\n\nAgain Roberts disagreed, siding with the court\u2019s liberal bloc, and this time bringing Justice Anthony Kennedy along with him in a 6-3 decision. The words at issue, he wrote, had to be understood as part of Obamacare\u2019s larger framework. Some conservative legal scholars went bonkers. \u201cThe Supreme Court today put its stamp of approval on President Obama rewriting the law as he chooses,\u201d proclaimed Peter Ferrara, senior fellow of The Heartland Institute. \u201cThe Separation of Powers has fallen, the rule of law has fallen, the Supreme Court has fallen. President Obama now has the power to rule by decree.\u201d\n\nConservatives knew where to point the finger: \u201cWe might as well call the law RobertsCare,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, a Cato Institute attorney. This echoed the puckish dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia, who ridiculed the majority\u2019s rationale as \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery.\u201d The majority, Scalia said suggested, had performed \u201cinterpretive somersaults\u201d to justify a political decision: keeping Obamacare on the books. Reading from the bench, Scalia added, \u201cWe really should start calling this law SCOTUS-care.\u201d\n\nSpeculation was rife, just as it was in the 2012 case, about Roberts\u2019 motives. The most charitable interpretation came from liberals. Neal Katyal, acting U.S. solicitor general during Obama\u2019s first term, noted that when Roberts had spoken previously of the court as a kind of national umpire, \u201ca lot of people on the left sneered.\u201d This decision, Katyal said, \u201cshows he really meant what he said. It\u2019s a profound statement about the difference between law and politics.\u201d\n\nLiberal legal scholar Brianne J. Gorod expanded on this view: \u201cRoberts has said he doesn\u2019t want the Court to be seen as just an \u2018extension of the political process.\u2019 By putting law over politics, the chief justice and Justice Kennedy helped demonstrate that it won\u2019t be seen as such today. And that\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d\n\nBut is it? The very next day, Kennedy authored a 5-4 decision upholding same-sex marriage as the law of the land, a decision which seemed imbued with politics. Roberts voted this time with the conservatives, underscoring an unsettling truth: the justices appointed by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama almost never deviate from their party\u2019s orthodoxy. This also underscores another way of looking at what happened when Obamacare came before the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015: It\u2019s that Roberts wasn\u2019t above politics\u2014he was bested by politics.\n\n\u201cWhy does he want to preserve Obamacare?\u201d asked conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer. \u201cI'm not sure it's because he believes in the policy. I think he's afraid that if the court overturns something so broad, so deep, so important that was debated for a year and a half, it will damage the court. And he sees his role as a protector of the reputation of the court.\u201d\n\nThe reason Roberts believes the court\u2019s reputation is at stake may be the key to understanding what\u2019s happened. Roberts doesn\u2019t feel protective of the institution because of parochial vanity or romantic nostalgia. He\u2019s protective of the court because it\u2019s been under relentless attack from the left as long as he\u2019s been there.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Clinton-appointed Stephen Breyer talking darkly at the Aspen Institute about conservative justices or Rachel Maddow\u2019s anti-Supreme Court screeds, or President Obama repeatedly assailing the justices in public, the threat from Democrats to the court is this stark: If you don\u2019t decide cases in our favor, we will delegitimize you in the eyes of the American people.\n\nThis is a dangerous game, but it may have worked. Conservatives feel betrayed by Roberts, as perhaps they should. But it\u2019s possible that when we look back on the first 15 years of the 21st century, it will be remembered as the time the Democrats vowed to blow up this country\u2019s democratic institutions unless they got their way. And that\u2019s not \u201ca very good thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s an established fact of social science, replicated in surveys dating to the Nixon administration, that conservatives are happier than liberals.
