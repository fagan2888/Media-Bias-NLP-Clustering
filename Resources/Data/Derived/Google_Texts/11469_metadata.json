Children are $25 and each additional child is $10. That includes 25 visits a year and anything that can be done in the office. No insurance companies are involved and that means, no co-pays. They also have a number of other services with big discounts.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to our independent mom and pop shops and said \u2018if our patients came to you and they agreed to pay you at the time of service if you didn\u2019t have to collect and fight insurance companies for six months to get paid\u2026 What could you sell your services for just give us your best prices\u2019. And the prices we got floored us,\u201d said co-founder of Epiphany Health, Dr. Lee Gross.\n\nThat\u2019s when they realized this could be the future of health care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we sort of had our epiphany. That\u2019s how we got the name of our company\u2026is you know\u2026 we thought, we can really do this,\u201d Said Dr. Gross.\n\nBut now that the Affordable Care Act requires everyone to have insurance they thought that might change their business; but in fact they\u2019re now there to catch those who fall through the cracks of the ACA.\n\n\u201cWe encourage our patients to get health insurance. Many of our patients will get the bronze coverage through the ACA. You don\u2019t use car insurance to fill up your gas tank. This is the same thing. You don\u2019t need to use your health insurance for primary care when these prices are so low. We are completely transparent with our prices,\u201d said Dr. William Crouch.\n\nThe doctors are pushing for legislation to be passed to make it clear that their program will not be labeled as health insurance. That way they will not be subject to the same regulations as insurance companies. They\u2019re expecting to see legislation drafts within the next few weeks.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Carolyn Brewster", "og": {"image": "http://cdn.winknews.com/wp-content/uploads/epiphanyhealththumb.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.winknews.com/wp-content/uploads/20160525160432/cropped-wink_512x512-270x270.png", "msvalidate.01": "9D96911C753B2042F5BC7FEF6303FB84", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "North Port doctors find health insurance alternativeNORTH PORT, Fla.- Doctors say they\u2019re finding a way for patients to get quality health care while avoiding health insurance but they say it\u2019s completely legal.\nThe doctors are pushing for legislation to be passed to make it clear that their program will not be labeled as health insurance.\nPatients pay $50 a month to be a part of the health care program through Epiphany Health with Dr. Lee Gross and Dr. William Crouch.\nYou don\u2019t need to use your health insurance for primary care when these prices are so low.\nAnd the prices we got floored us,\u201d said co-founder of Epiphany Health, Dr. Lee Gross."}
