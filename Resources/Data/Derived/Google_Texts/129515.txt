ATLANTA (AP) - Grammy-nominated rapper Jeezy will be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of one of his albums with a concert event in Atlanta.

Jeezy will be performing his entire album, “Let’s Get It: Thug Motivation 101,” for the first time at the Fox Theater on Saturday night. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in 2005 and sold nearly 2 million copies.

The album included multiple hit singles from “Go Crazy” featuring Jay Z, “Soul Survivor” with Akon, and the Mannie Fresh-assisted “And Then What.”

“Thug Motivation” was Jeezy’s third studio album and first major label debut with Def Jam Recordings. The Atlanta-based rapper has released seven albums in total, including his latest “Seen It All: The Autobiography.”

Jeezy has sold more than 5 million albums worldwide.

On Saturday morning, Jeezy partnered with councilmember Cleta Winslow to host a neighborhood cleanup for District 4 of Atlanta.

Music stars from Usher, Ludacris, Ne-Yo and Big Boi spoke in honor of Jeezy’s accomplishments at the rapper’s private dinner in Buckhead on Friday night. Jeezy was awarded the Phoenix Award from the city of Atlanta by Mayor Kasim Reed, who said the award was the highest honor anyone could receive “that is very much like having the key to the city.”
