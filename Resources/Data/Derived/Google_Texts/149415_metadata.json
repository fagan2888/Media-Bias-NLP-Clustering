Its extension and progress, without current obstacles, could however gradually lead to its dismantling and ultimate elimination. Its stagnation and ultimate neutralization by conservative forces within the Castro government would indeed be the worst thing that could happen to Cuban society today.\n\nUS policy does not determine but does have an impact on the correlation between the forces at play within the governing elite and, generally speaking, within the Party-government and Cuban society as a whole, as well as among those who support the deepening and broadening (to varying degrees) of the so-called \u201cupdating of Cuba\u2019s economic and social model\u201d and those who merely aspire to maintain only the semblance of this process to keep the old, hyper-centralized system in place.\n\nBetween the Two Castros\n\nIt is no secret that there exists a kind of \u201cfriendly\u201d arm-wrestle \u2013 a permanent conflict arising from disagreements between Cuba\u2019s historical leader, Fidel, and his brother, the army general Raul \u2013 as to the form and content Cuba\u2019s domestic and foreign policy and the structure of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIt is easy to demonstrate that the first speeches pronounced by Raul Castro after he took office and the spirit of renewal of the \u201creform process\u201d have not been adequately embodied by the application and the results of the policies implemented.\n\nThe most visible cause of this is Fidel Castro\u2019s gradual recovery and his attempts at taking back the limelight.\n\nThe evidence for this are his \u201creflections\u201d, his continuous public and media appearances, where he is seen receiving foreign personalities, and in the systematic praise for his thoughts and figure in the Party-controlled press \u2013 so frequent that they outnumber Raul\u2019s public appearances and speeches, even after Fidel \u201cretired and asked not to be called \u2018Commander in Chief\u2019 any longer.\u201d\n\nAre we expected to forget Raul Castro\u2019s \u201cglass of milk\u201d speech and the suppression of his remarks by Granma, as well as everything that entailed?\n\nRaul may have replaced the members of Fidel\u2019s administration, but the traditional Fidelistas still remain within the Party leadership, particularly in the Party Secretariat, headed by Machado Ventura, the man in charge of all the Party\u2019s concrete activities, the appointment and dismissal of cadres, propaganda and others.\n\nThis is the main Party structure responsible for keeping the positions of the \u201chistorical leader\u201d alive. The second-in-command within the government, Diaz Canel, is not the second-in-command within the Party, Machado is.\n\nToday, we bear witness to how Cuba\u2019s critical economic situation, caused by the limitations of the \u201creform process\u201d and its inability to overcome the stagnation produced by the near-absolutist model that was in place for nearly fifty years, is prompting a mass exodus of Cubans towards the United States through all imaginable routes.\n\nThe authority of these Party structures, at the top of the ladder, next to Fidel, but beneath Raul, was evident in the debates during the 6th Party Congress, which were manipulated by Party bureaucrats against calls for a free and democratic debate at the base level.\n\nThe general, Fidel\u2019s brother, who knows Fidel better than anyone and was appointed by him, has had to govern in his shadow, with that particular handicap, caught between advancing his \u201creforms\u201d and avoiding a confrontation with the leader \u2013 hence his increasing moderation and fewer and fewer public appearances.\n\nRaul has been clear in his intentions of a rapprochement with the United States, while his brother, now recovering, does not miss an opportunity to try and distance himself from them as much as possible.\n\nThis, which could also be interpreted as the \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d routine, could have served to achieve such a rapprochement if only it had been adequately encouraged, if Washington had been more consistent in its first appraisal of what Raul Castro\u2019s ascent to power meant.\n\nIt is therefore worthwhile to recall that, at the time, the United States demonstrated much interest and willingness to work with him and his military officers, and rumors were even leaked to the effect that Washington was convinced the tough hand of the military and their \u201creforms\u201d would prevent future migratory avalanches, the main concern weighing on US-Cuba relations.\n\nHowever, the United States did not take any significant steps to help the Raul Castro government in its reform plans, steps that could have strengthened the General\u2019s position in the Cuban government\u2019s internal correlation of forces.\n\nMore effective support and the lifting of other important sanctions stemming from the blockade-embargo could have tilted the internal balance of power in favor of Raul\u2019s reformers and allowed them to develop their \u201cupdating process\u201d better \u2013 and, eventually, other democratic \u201creforms\u201d that could have entailed deeper changes in the mid-term.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the United States considered that the transfer of power was merely nominal and that \u201conly the television had been handed over, without the remote control.\u201d\n\nSuch developments could serve to appease those who blame all of our misfortunes on imperialist aggression, which is one of the fundamental pretexts with which the economic disasters of the State-command economy, the repression of the opposition, the absence of democracy and the lack of civil and political liberties and rights are justified.\n\nToday, we bear witness to how Cuba\u2019s critical economic situation, caused by the limitations of the \u201creform process\u201d and its inability to overcome the stagnation produced by the near-absolutist model that was in place for nearly fifty years, is prompting a mass exodus of Cubans towards the United States through all imaginable routes.\n\nThe proposals now advanced by the New York Times may be coming a little too late, but, as they say, \u201cbetter late than never.\u201d\n\nShould they yield results, they would have the immediate effect of easing tensions between the two governments and, without a doubt, many of those desperate to leave for the United States might consider that it is more advisable to stay a little longer, to see the concrete results of this rapprochement.\n\nAt the same time, it would suggest that the Obama administration is not chiefly responsible for maintaining the blockade-embargo, but that Congress is. It could clear the way towards the elimination of the embargo, inasmuch as it would entail previously removing Cuba from the list of countries that sponsor terrorism and make other positive relations between the two countries possible.\n\nSuch developments could serve to appease those who blame all of our misfortunes on imperialist aggression, which is one of the fundamental pretexts with which the economic disasters of the State-command economy, the repression of the opposition, the absence of democracy and the lack of civil and political liberties and rights are justified.\n\nMost importantly, it would imply a measure of US support for Raul Castro\u2019s updating process. The \u201creformist\u201d current could be thus revitalized and the complicated balance of forces within the Cuban government could be tilted in its favor. Raul, in turn, would be unable to ignore such US gestures and would be forced to act accordingly. One development would prompt others.\n\nThe issue can be approached from many other perspectives. As far as Cuba\u2019s internal situation is concerned, these are the ones I consider most important.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\npedrocampos313@yahoo.es", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Havana Times.org", "description": "A New York Times editorial published urges President Obama to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba - something that is beyond the scope of the embargo provisions and which falls within his presidential prerogatives.", "title": "US-Cuba Relations and the Internal Blockade", "url": "http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=106782", "image": "http://www.havanatimes.org/sp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cuba-estados-unidos-2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "blogcatalog": "9BC9022908", "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"admins": "http://graph.facebook.com/havanatimes"}, "verify-sf": "cae8414e7abb651a1fb787149964b5d4"}, "article_summary": "Raul Castro\u2019s reform process does not suffice to eliminate the internal blockade we Cubans are subjected to.\nAs far as Cuba\u2019s internal situation is concerned, these are the ones I consider most important.\nThe fundamental question that those of us interested in the wellbeing of the Cuban people should ask ourselves is: how will such measures affect Cuba\u2019s internal blockade.\nIts extension and progress, without current obstacles, could however gradually lead to its dismantling and ultimate elimination.\nHowever, the United States did not take any significant steps to help the Raul Castro government in its reform plans, steps that could have strengthened the General\u2019s position in the Cuban government\u2019s internal correlation of forces."}
