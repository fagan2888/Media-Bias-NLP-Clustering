Steve Stockman, Sustainability News, Politics News\n\nIn the wake of their victory in the midterm elections, congressional Republicans have rededicated themselves to fighting the science of climate change and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s efforts to regulate greenhouse gases. But one GOPer who\u2019s on his way out, per an intriguing theory put forward by National Journal\u2019s Jason Plautz, may be trying to leaving behind his own, small climate denial legacy.\n\nRepresentative Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican who didn\u2019t seek reelection, last week introduced H.R. 5718, otherwise known as the \u201cStockman Effect Act,\u201d in order to \u201cstudy the effect of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field on the weather.\u201d Strangely, however, Plautz could find no Stockman Effect in the scientific literature \u2014 at least, none that pertained to Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Stockman\u2019s office refused to say where the name for this so-called theory came from, but it seems pretty obvious that the congressman himself (who is not a scientist) first invented it and then named it after himself.\n\nIt is true that Earth\u2019s magnetic field is weakening, as H.R. 5718 claims, but scientists say that any link to our recent spate rapid warming is \u201cvery tenuous\u201d at best. Stockman\u2019s bill would require the director of the National Science Foundation to investigate the phenomenon\u2019s potential to influence the weather anyway. But Plautz points out that it would also serve a much more immediate purpose: getting Congress on the record as conceding that a \u201cdecrease in magnetic fields could impact global temperatures,\u201d an admission akin to challenging the scientific consensus that global warming is being primarily caused by the human emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
