Media critics will complain when a storm kills hundreds of people in India, and the story gets less space in the newspaper than the deaths of a few dozen people in a city in the U.S. But the difference in coverage is warranted, since there is simply more reader interest in pretty much any domestic event than one overseas. The murder of a prostitute is going to get less attention from both police and the media than, say, a contract killing of a wealthy corporate mogul. That\u2019s not warranted on the criminal justice side \u2013 a killing is a killing, and all such crimes need to be fully investigated and prosecuted \u2013 but it\u2019s undeniable that the murder of the corporate exec is more unexpected and would get more news coverage.\n\nSometimes, the media vastly overcompensate: after the wall-to-wall coverage of Princess Diana\u2019s death, U.S. media outlets went a bit overboard in covering the death of Mother Teresa, just to prove that they weren\u2019t judging a former member of the royal family as more important than a woman who dedicated her life to serving the poor. But that wasn\u2019t the point. Princess Diana was not more important than Mother Teresa, but her death was a bigger story. Diana\u2019s death was premature and preventable. Mother Teresa was 87 when she died. Her death was sad and noteworthy, but it wasn\u2019t tragic.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on the Middle East]\n\nThe value of life has come up again in the terrible story of the violence in Gaza. It\u2019s easy to detest Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip and which has been declared a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and other Western nations. And it\u2019s easy, too, to fall back on the concept that Israel has a right to defend itself. It does \u2013 but at what cost?\n\nIn the three weeks of the (most recent) fighting), well over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, about 70 percent of them civilians and many of that group children. On the Israeli side, 42 soldiers and two civilians have been killed. Most shocking was the deaths of 16 civilians at a UN-run school being used as a shelter for Palestinians fleeing the violence in the Gaza Strip. Israel has denied having anything to do with the deaths, offering as proof a grainy video showing an \"errant\" mortar shell in the courtyard (suggesting it had been a Hamas weapon that caused the deaths). That claim has just a bit more credulity that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim that Russia didn\u2019t have a thing to do with the downing of the Malaysian plane last week. At any rate, it\u2019s not Israel\u2019s place to conduct the sole investigation of the episode, since it is a suspected party in the attack.\n\nIsraelis feel under siege (as do Palestinians), but that doesn\u2019t make it acceptable to take any action at all in the name of self-defense. Americans are coming to realize this, too, after watching U.S. surveillance agencies go hog wild in the name of preventing terrorist attacks after 9-11. Being a victim, or being afraid of becoming a victim again, does not justify uncontrolled violence. Israel says it wants to crush Hamas. But the civilian death toll gives the sense that Israel really wants to crush the Palestinians. This is a numbers disparity that cannot be ignored by the media or the international community.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Media Can't Ignore Disparity Between Israel and Palestinian Gaza Casualties", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The media can't ignore the disparity between Israeli and Palestinian casualties.", "title": "A Difference That's Fit to Print", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/07/28/media-cant-ignore-disparity-between-israel-and-palestinian-gaza-casualties", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/4e/6a1654dd7f09930c62b5f334399772/media:a18d0dca948546a1844fba076046f33fAPTOPIXMideastIsraelPalestinians.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Media Can't Ignore Disparity Between Israel and Palestinian Gaza Casualties", "description": "The media can't ignore the disparity between Israeli and Palestinian casualties.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,Israel,Palestine,Middle East,Mideast peace,media,media bias,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The media can't ignore the disparity between Israeli and Palestinian casualties."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd072a\"", "article_summary": "Princess Diana was not more important than Mother Teresa, but her death was a bigger story.\nMother Teresa was 87 when she died.\nThis is a numbers disparity that cannot be ignored by the media or the international community.\nBut the civilian death toll gives the sense that Israel really wants to crush the Palestinians.\nAnd it\u2019s easy, too, to fall back on the concept that Israel has a right to defend itself."}
