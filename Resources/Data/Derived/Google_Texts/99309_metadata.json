The hospital has seen an increase in veterans in recent years because patients are \"unable to secure timely appointments through the VA\" and because \"the Phoenix VA in particular has been plagued by well-publicized health care scandals alleging poor quality of care and long waits for appointments,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nGila River officials say they have tried for years to negotiate with the VA over these issues, and even sent a delegation to meet with department officials in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2013, a lawyer for the department \"confirmed that VA's position will not change unless it is required to change by the Department of Justice or unless the Community sued the federal government and prevailed in court,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"All Community efforts have been rejected, and from March 23, 2010, through the date of this complaint, VA has provided no reimbursements to GRHC,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nIn addition to an award of an order for reimbursement, the tribe wants the court to declare that the VA is violating the Affordable Care Act by \"conditioning reimbursements on a separate agreement by VA,\" and by limiting reimbursements to Native American veterans and direct care services only.\n\nIt's unclear from the lawsuit how much the VA allegedly owes the Gila River Indian Community. Attorneys with the tribe's Office of the General Counsel did not immediately respond to an email on Tuesday.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast week, the VA announced the proposed removal of three senior officials at the Phoenix VA Health Care System.\n\nAfter a whistleblower and media investigations revealed shocking problems at the Phoenix VA in 2014, an Office of Inspector General report confirmed that some 40 patients had died while on a wait list for care between April 2013 through April 2014.\n\nThe report also identified numerous cases of \"unacceptable and troubling lapses in follow-up, coordination, quality, and continuity of care\" at the Phoenix facility.\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nVA to Extend Coverage for Veterans at Non-VA Facilities (by Noel Brinkerhoff, AllGov)", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a complaint filed in federal court on Tuesday, the Gila River Indian Community claims the department owes them for health care provided to veterans going back to March 2010.
