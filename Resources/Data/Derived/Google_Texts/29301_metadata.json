(AP) - The new owners of Mister Bee Potato Chips want to bring the company back to the forefront of people\u2019s minds throughout the community.\n\nAs of Sept. 4, original owner James Richard Barton was joined by new investors Mary Anne Ketelsen, Doug Ketelsen, Gregory Barton and Greg Reed with Mary \u201cMickey\u201d Welch helping to get financing in place.\n\nThe group is operating under the company\u2019s old name, the West Virginia Potato Chip Co., and is continuing local operations.\n\n\u201cThey are 100 percent committed to keeping the business in Parkersburg and growing it,\u201d said Doug Klein, vice president of sales and marketing for Mister Bee. \u201cThey are putting money back into the business to see it prosper and succeed. They have already invested in the company as far as equipment additions to the process.\u201d\n\nMister Bee has been producing over 2 million pounds of potato chips a year with over $2.5 million in sales annually, Klein said. The plant has 18 full- and part-time employees.\n\nThe new owners are looking to increase sales so production can increase, Klein said. The Parkersburg plant is manufacturing an average of three days a week.\n\n\u201cThey want to expand to where we would be running two shifts, five days a week,\u201d Klein said. \u201cThey know what the potential is and what it has done in years past.\n\n\u201cThey are going to do everything in their power to grow the business again so it is a strong regional brand in West Virginia and southeastern Ohio.\u201d\n\nReed, who is the new company president, said he had previously done business with Gregory Barton, brother of original owner James Richard Barton. Reed has been involved in the oil and gas industry.\n\nDiscussions started about the business which led to the opportunity for the new owners to purchase the company. They are not releasing the details of the sale.\n\n\u201cNone of us are from the snack food business so it has been a breath of fresh air to think outside the box and try some new things that people are not used to seeing out of Mister Bee,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe new owners saw something in the company that could be nurtured and grown.\n\n\u201cWe saw this as an opportunity,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThis company is a staple that has such a good following in the community and has a lot of support.\u201d\n\nReed has been down at the plant for the last couple of months, getting to know the business and the people there.\n\n\u201cWe have already started making changes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already started ordering and installing some new equipment that needed updated.\u201d\n\nThat includes a new salter which is already in and running as well as a new filter system which is being put in.\n\n\u201cThese upgrades are what needed to be done,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThey are looking at doing other improvements around the site to modernize operations.\n\n\u201cRight now, we want to get the chips out to a lot of areas that don\u2019t have them,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe have room to expand from a capacity standpoint. We have so much capacity we could add.\u201d\n\nThey have already addressed some of the service problems in the Parkersburg area.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are about where we need to be to take care of the local customer,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe want to get the chips into some areas of the state that had not seen them before.\n\n\u201cThere are some opportunities, just from a distribution standpoint, to get our products out in front of other people. On the flip side, we are looking forward to introducing some new products like people used to see from Mister Bee,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe brand reaches from the Mid-Ohio Valley to around Beckley, to Huntington to Clarksburg and north as far as New Martinsville and Morgantown.\n\n\u201cIf we can service the entire state of West Virginia, that would be a tremendous increase from what we do now,\u201d Reed said. \u201cHowever, we want to take care of this area before we do any of that.\u201d\n\nThe new owners want the company to be engaged in the community like it had been years ago.\n\nReed said they are already doing sponsorships and working with local schools on some things. One day, the new owners would like to start up the plant tours again for area school children and others which is something many people around the area have fond memories of doing when they were young.\n\n\u201cThe company is a part of the community,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI ate Mister Bee\u2019s as a kid (growing up in Doddridge County).\n\n\u201cWe are local and that is what we want the company to feel like. We want it to have that hometown feel that is always had.\u201d\n\nThe new owners, who are from around Wood, Jackson and Doddridge counties, want the company to be able to introduce new product lines as well as improve the quality and consistency of the products being put out. They will be looking at possible partnerships in production and distribution with others.\n\n\u201cWe are looking to think outside the box,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe company\u2019s position in the community and in people\u2019s minds is what attracted the new owners to want to buy it.\n\n\u201cWe felt like it was a great deal - value-wise for us - and we could make a difference and get it to the place where it needed to be,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe felt there was a lot of low hanging fruit where we could make an immediate improvement.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of West Virginia and you think of food, what is more recognizable than Mister Bee? You can\u2019t beat it to be able to take a brand like that and then expand on top of that,\u201d Reed said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: News and Sentinel (Parkersburg, W.Va.), http://www.newsandsentinel.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new owners of Mister Bee Potato Chips want to bring the company back to the forefront of people's minds throughout the community.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/19/mister-bees-new-owners-see-strong-potential-in-com/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The new owners of Mister Bee Potato Chips want to bring the company back to the forefront of people\u2019s minds throughout the community.", "title": "Mister Bee\u2019s new owners see strong potential in company"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new owners of Mister Bee Potato Chips want to bring the company back to the forefront of people's minds throughout the community.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mister Bee\u2019s new owners see strong potential in company"}, "Author": "BRETT DUNLAP", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8668\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you think of West Virginia and you think of food, what is more recognizable than Mister Bee?\nPARKERSBURG, W.Va.
