Jeff Miller announced he would not seek a ninth term in the House, there are now five candidates for the seat: four Republicans and one Democrat.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Fort Walton Beach, represents the 4th District in the Florida House. While qualifying for the August 30 primary isn\u2019t until the week of June 20, Gaetz said last week that he would make a quick decision on entering that race, which he did this week.\n\n\u201cI look at Washington, and they\u2019ve pretty much screw everything up,\u201d said Gaetz. \u201cWe\u2019re $19 trillion in debt, we\u2019ve got an illegal immigration crisis. So I think the big fights that are going to most significantly impact our quality of life moving forward, are the fights in Washington.\u201d\n\nLike many Republicans, Gaetz wants to abolish Obamacare. But unlike many who make that call, he has some ideas about how to replace it, including an a la carte system for healthcare tailored to one\u2019s personal needs.\n\n\u201cThis is very doable; this exists in property insurance, it exists in auto insurance, it exists in life insurance,\u201d Gaetz says. \u201cBut back after World War II, we decided as a country to move everything for health insurance through the employer. I think that\u2019s largely created the problems we have in healthcare today.\u201d\n\nBrian Frazier, who\u2019s also seeking the GOP nomination, is a retired naval officer who spent the last four years of service in Washington, D.C. He says he would bring real-world experience to the area of homeland security.\n\n\u201cSome of that was working on the Guantanamo Bay terrorist issues, and I spent a lot of time at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, working again anti-terrorism programs,\u201d said Frazier. \u201cI have a good grasp of how they\u2019re operating.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to veterans issues, Frazier says he would take a different path than that of Miller, saying \u201cyou can\u2019t punish a problem by drowning it in money.\u201d His solution: moving vets to the private healthcare sector.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked out of the Navy the day I retired, I got an ID card and I go to whatever doctor I want,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cIt\u2019s very convenient for me, and I don\u2019t understand why our combat veterans have to be inconvenienced the way they are.\u201d\n\nFrazier also wants the federal government out of the healthcare business, scrapping Obamacare in favor of returning such responsibilities to the states.\n\nOther Republicans seeking Jeff Miller\u2019s House seat include Republicans Cris Dosev and Mark Wichern. The lone Democrat so far is Amanda Leigh Kondrat\u2019yev of Pensacola.\n\nAnd the field could get even larger. State Sen. Greg Evers tells the News Service of Florida that he\u2019ll make a decision next week. Pensacola Mayor Ashton Hayward and state Rep. Clay Ingram are also being mentioned.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "Two weeks after Cong.
