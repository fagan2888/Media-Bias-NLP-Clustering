For first timers, and old timers, scalloping is a favorite panhandle pastime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going in and out there for the last 30 years,\u201d said local John Cox.\u201dIt\u2019s just a good time is what it is.\u201d\n\nAdrienne Woodward works with the Tourist Development Council for Port. St Joe. She spent the day scalloping with family and friends and said it\u2019s an outdoor activity everyone can enjoy.\n\n\u201cThere was tons of kids out there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy for them just to walk and feel these with their toes and feet.\u201d\n\nWhile the first harvest of the scallop season was small, executive director of the council, Jennifer Jenkins, said tourist and locals are abundant.\n\n\u201cWe have a big influx of visitors right now,\u201d she said. \u201cTourism is growing very rapidly here in Gulf County.\u201d\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officials encourage everyone to take advantage of the bay\u2019s treasured treat. They do, however, want harvesters to keep in mind safety precautions and legal restrictions.\n\nThe daily limit for a single person is a two gallon bucket full of scallops or a single pint of shucked scallop meat.\n\nFWC Gulf County officer Hal Webb said the regulations are meant to preserve the valuable resource.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that generations to come get to enjoy and experience the harvest of natural resources, just as we are today,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you know when someone takes more than they\u2019re allowed by law to take then that\u2019s what we as law enforcement officers look for.\u201d\n\nPeople are also reminded to carry their saltwater fishing license and to display dive flags. They must also stay within 300 feet of a divers down flag or buoy when in the open water.\n\nBut as soon as harvesters have done their due diligence, it\u2019s time to enjoy.\n\n\"At the end of the day you take your scallops,\u201d Jenkins said, \u201cand you can go to any of out local restaurants and they'll cook them for you.\"\n\n\"My wife usually fries them or broils them in the oven,\" Cox said.\n\nWoodward said in her family, it\u2019s tradition to eat them raw. But according to Will, you should probably ask his parents.\n\nFor more information on scallop season, you can visit: http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/recreational/bay-scallops/\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saturday kicked off the official start to the harvesting season.
