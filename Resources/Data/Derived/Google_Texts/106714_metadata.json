As a short story writer, I was almost proud of this \u2013 in the way an English major friend was proud of graduating college without having read \u201cHamlet.\u201d I understood Cheever to be iconic, understood even that I\u2019d learn a lot from reading him, but I had no inkling that I\u2019d adore him as earnestly as I adored a show like \u201cMad Men,\u201d something I\u2019d absorb not for its cultural import but for its brilliance and fun. And then, last summer, I picked up the fat red volume that had been in my \u201cto read\u201d stack for nearly a decade. I was awed to encounter not just a literary masterpiece, but the direct ancestor of some of my favorite current storytelling: If \u201cMad Men\u201d was the river, these were the headwaters. If \u201cMad Men\u201d was chocolate milk, this was a bar of 90 percent Lindt. If \u201cMad Men\u201d was Honey Smacks, this was a swarm of bees.\n\nCheever was one of those writers I\u2019d formed an opinion of without ever reading. I imagined all his stories to involve a businessman who got off the evening train drunk, stood in his yard peering in through the windows of his own house, and had some sort of sad revelation. And perhaps, in subject matter, I wasn\u2019t far off. But that\u2019s like saying all of Jane Austen is about women dating in mansions. True, but not fair.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found: In each story, a small world of alienation and humor and despair, a meditation on family or work, the city or the suburbs, travel or stasis, success or failure. Stories that resist neat epiphany. Stories that capture the pivot points of the 20th century. This last one matters very much; 14 years into the new century, we\u2019re still processing the seismic cultural shifts of the last one. We live in the world the \u201960s made, and made possible. And, whether we know it or not, we\u2019re still seeing the mid-1900s through the lens Cheever created. We need his work for the same reason we need \u201cMad Men\u201d; we may be at a historical and stylistic remove, but not nearly as much as we\u2019d like to think.\n\nThat Cheever is an influence on \u201cMad Men\u201d is no secret. In his New York Times Book Review \u201cBy the Book\u201d interview on April 27, series creator Matthew Weiner said, \u201cThe fiction of John Cheever has a voice filled with irony and comedy and pain that, on some level, I\u2019m always seeking to emulate. His short stories present themselves as episodes of TV do \u2013 with plenty of story and flawed characters presented without judgment.\u201d Weiner \u2013 and his well-read viewers \u2013 have been saying as much for years. And it\u2019s not just a tonal influence: Don Draper starts the series living in Ossining, N.Y., the town Cheever himself wrote from until his 1982 death. I dare you to read Cheever\u2019s \u201cThe Enormous Radio\u201d and not think of the Season 5 episode \u201cSignal 30,\u201d in which Pete Campbell projects all his suburban insecurities onto his giant stereo (and Ken Cosgrove writes a short story about it). Cheever\u2019s \u201cThe Death of Justina\u201d should put you instantly in mind of the demise of secretary Ida Blankenship in Season 4. At the end of that story, Cheever\u2019s protagonist, an adman, commits a final act of defiance against his firm by turning in the 23rd Psalm as ad copy. I\u2019m waiting for Draper to do the same.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stop looking for Sharon Tate allusions.
