Sioux Falls, SD

Between taking care of our kids, our homes, and work, many of us don't have a lot of spare time.

That's why a Sioux Falls optician has decided to take her business on the road, straight to the customer.

It might not look like your typical optician's office, but Ana Jones isn't your typical optician.

"You need to look pleasant. You need to look up-to-date," Jones said.

Jones travels, with dozens of pairs of glasses, to her customers' houses. She doesn't do eye exams or check for conditions like glaucoma, but once you have a prescription she can fits you for glasses.

"The reason why I started this was because I'm a working mother of two children, and it's really hard to get out and about during the work day," Jones said.

Not only will Jones come to your home, but she'll also come to your business, so you don't even have to leave work.

"Business people who may own their own business --it's really hard for them to leave, so next thing you know I'll come to you," Jones said.

"It literally took 15, 20 minutes to get everything taken care of," Customer Jason Young said.

As a business man and father, customer Jason Young has plenty on his to-do list, and looking for a new pair of glasses.

"I hate shopping in general," Young said.

It isn't exactly his "vision" of a relaxing day.

"I have a really hard time finding sunglasses. I have a narrow face, and everything I pick up off the shelves is way wide," Young said.

Young was fitted for a pair of glasses and ended up ordering out of a catalog.

"Then I deliver them back to your place of choice, whether it's home or business," Jones said.

It's a convenience Jones hopes will help customers' vision and self esteem.

"It's really important because it's a fashion trend just like everything else," Jones said.

A trend that Jones is taking on the road.
