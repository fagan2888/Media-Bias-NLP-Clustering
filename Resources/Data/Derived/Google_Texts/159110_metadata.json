It\u2019s also National Rosacea Awareness Month and National Stress Awareness Month \u2013 an ironic duo since a red blotchy face and scaly body patches are total anxiety boosters. Aside from the extreme physical discomfort, there\u2019s the visible issue of irritated skin to deal with on top of all our other aging woes. Here\u2019s how to stay calm and carry on:\n\nGET A DERMATOLOGIST DIAGNOSIS. Don\u2019t play doctor and self-analyze by looking at online photos. Dr. Jeannette Graf, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in NYC says: \u201cItching can also be a result of overactive thyroid, pinched nerves, fungal infections or contact dermatitis from exposure to nickel, latex or dyes. If you have atopic dermatitis [a prevalent form of eczema that shows up as scaly red patches], you may also have asthma, hay fever or food allergies which need to be treated separately. In some cases, itching can be a sign of systemic issues such as liver or kidney problems.\u201d\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nCLEAN UP YOUR ACT! Know which potential irritants set you off. For some, it\u2019s preservatives or perfumes in skin products or makeup. For others, it\u2019s dust mites. Dr. Graf says: \u201cVacuum weekly with an anti-allergy filter appliance and damp-mop your floors. Add air-purifying plants like dracaena, pothos and peace lily to your home and office, and probiotics plus vitamin D3 to your diet to help regulate the skin\u2019s anti-microbial system. Try: Burt\u2019s Bees Fragrance Free Body Lotion with Shea Butter and Vitamin E ($7.99,cvs.com), Aveeno Active Naturals Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream ($14.99, cvs.com).\n\nSOOTHE WITH EMOLLIENT CLEANSERS AND CREAMS. Top ingredients to look for are glycerin, shea butter, cocoa butter and extra-virgin olive oil to boost the skin\u2019s protective moisture barrier. Dr. Graf says: \u201cWhen mature skin loses moisture, cells shrink \u2013 leaving cracks that are vulnerable to potential irritants. The skin\u2019s inflammatory response is activated and leads to itching.\u201d Switch to non-soap cleansers, and apply creams within three minutes of washing or showering, to lock in moisture.\u201d Try: Eucerin Sensitive Skin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15 ($11.62, cvs.com), Eau Thermale Avene XeraCalm A.D. Lipid- Replenishing Oil ($30,dermstore.com).\n\nCONTINUE DE-AGING! Over-the-counter retinols applied before bed can help even sensitive skins erase wrinkles and renew collagen production. Choose one of the new hydrating retinols with skin plumping hyaluronic acid. Paure during severe outbreaks, and resume twice a week to build up tolerance, then every other day to improve skin tone and texture. Try: StriVectin AR Advanced Retinol Night Treatment ($109,dermstore.com), RoC Correxion Sensitive Night Cream ($22.99, ulta.com).\n\n>> Get entertainment and dining discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nADD A SUNNY GLOW.
