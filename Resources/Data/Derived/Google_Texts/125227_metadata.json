After that agreement was announced, Prime founder and CEO Prem Reddy told the Gilroy Dispatch that Kaiser Permanente was supporting the acquisition of Daughters.\n\n[Also: Battle rages over Daughters of Charity sale to Prime]\n\nReddy told the paper that Kaiser Permanente leaders were withdrawing their signature from a letter of opposition sent to California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is in the midst of deciding whether to approve the acquisition of the distressed, six-hospital system.\n\nIt turns out Kaiser Permanente is not changing its stance on Prime\u2019s proposed takeover of Daughters of Charity, which has hospitals from the Bay Area to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cContrary to erroneous media reports and erroneous statements by Prime, Kaiser Permanente has not agreed to support Prime\u2019s acquisition of the Daughters of Charity hospitals and has not sent a letter of support to the Attorney General,\u201d the integrated health system said in a statement.\n\nThe Gilroy Dispatch later issued a correction.\n\nPrime later acknowledged the mistake. \"Prime wishes to now make clear that Kaiser Permanente agreed only to advise the Attorney General's Office it had entered into a hospital services agreement with Prime,\" the company said in a statement to the newspaper.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe original dispute between Kaiser Permanente and Prime goes back to 2008, when Kaiser\u2019s Foundation Health Plan and Prime sued each other, alleging contract breaches, unfair competition and other claims.\n\nThe two organizations last week came to a confidential agreement on Kaiser Health Plan reimbursement for Kaiser members treated at Prime Healthcare hospitals \u2014 but Kaiser Permanente is still among those opposing Prime\u2019s takeover of the Daughters of Charity system.\n\nPrime unveiled its plans to acquire Daughter of Charity last October, but the deal has to be approved by Harris, the attorney general, who previously blocked a Prime takeover and is under considerable pressure from the Service Employees International Union.\n\n\u201cDaughters\u2019 historic mission of providing care to the needy and vulnerable doesn\u2019t fit with Prime\u2019s business model of revenue maximization and service elimination,\u201d said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West.\n\nDaughters of Charity CEO Robert Issai still stands by the decision to accept Prime\u2019s bid, one of three made for the financially troubled system. \u201cPrime Healthcare is not just the best choice, it is the only choice to keep our hospitals functioning,\u201d Issai said. Along with a pledge for $150 million in capital improvements, \u009fPrime has agreed to continue paying pensions for some 17,000 union and non-union workers and retirees, honor union contracts, and has preserved the service missions at the four Catholic hospitals it already owns.\n\nAlthough the California Nurses Association and a local registered nurses branch of the SEIU have endorsed the sale, the SEIU believes that Prime will likely take the Daughters of Charity through bankruptcy and implement service reductions, employee wage cuts or layoffs.\n\nHarris\u2019s decision on approving, rejecting or adding stipulations to the acquisition is due Feb. 20.\n\nHer track record suggests she could go either way. In 2011, she blocked Prime\u2019s proposed acquisition of a community hospital in Victorville \u2014 the longtime home of Prime founder Reddy. The cardiologist-turned-entrepreneur opened the nearby Desert Valley Hospital in 1994, sold it and then repurchased it in 2001 to use as the launching pad for Prime. The company has since overseen the acquisition of more than 20 hospitals and has plans for an initial public offering.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/kaiser-permanente-no-we-dont-back-primes-bid-daughters-charity", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/OConnor-Hospital-Daughters-of-Charity-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "After Prime's CEO told  local paper the health giant backed its takeover plans for Daughter's, Kaiser steps in to set the record straight.", "title": "Kasier Permanente: No we don't back Prime's bid for Daughter's of Charity"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/OConnor-Hospital-Daughters-of-Charity-feature.gif"}, "title": "Kasier Permanente: No we don't back Prime's bid for Daughter's of Charity", "description": "After Prime's CEO told  local paper the health giant backed its takeover plans for Daughter's, Kaiser steps in to set the record straight.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite what you might have heard, Kaiser Permanente is not backing Prime Healthcare\u2019s bid to acquire California\u2019s Daughters of Charity.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1590\"", "article_summary": "O'Connor Hospital, Daughter's of Charity Health Care, photo from FacebookDespite what you might have heard, Kaiser Permanente is not backing Prime Healthcare\u2019s bid to acquire California\u2019s Daughters of Charity.\nThe two organizations last week came to a confidential agreement on Kaiser Health Plan reimbursement for Kaiser members treated at Prime Healthcare hospitals \u2014 but Kaiser Permanente is still among those opposing Prime\u2019s takeover of the Daughters of Charity system.\nIt turns out Kaiser Permanente is not changing its stance on Prime\u2019s proposed takeover of Daughters of Charity, which has hospitals from the Bay Area to Los Angeles.\nAfter that agreement was announced, Prime founder and CEO Prem Reddy told the Gilroy Dispatch that Kaiser Permanente was supporting the acquisition of Daughters.\nThe confusion actually came out of a recent settlement over reimbursements between Prime Healthcare and Kaiser Health Plan that ended a seven-year dispute."}
