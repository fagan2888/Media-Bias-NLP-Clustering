They noted that Texas A&M students organized a similar event when Westboro members announced they would picket a funeral there. The group never showed up for the funeral.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page. Screen Name or Email Password Forgot?

Capt. Brian Weimer of the MU Police Department said about 500 people turned out to show their support.\n\nCathy Scroggs, vice chancellor for student affairs, attended the event and said she was impressed that so many students came out in the cold to show their support for Sam. \"Their presence says it all,\" she said.\n\nScroggs said administrators attended the event because \"we wanted students to know we support them.\"\n\nDavid Tipton was among the community members in the crowd of students. He said he attended to support Sam and show people that the community's voice is louder than Westboro's.\n\nThis isn't the first time members of Westboro have visited Columbia. About half-a-dozen protestors came to Columbia in July 2012 to picket the funeral of a Columbia soldier who died in Afghanistan. Thousands of residents turned out to counter protest.\n\nMU student Craig Jaworski yesterday carried signs saying, \"You're perfect just the way you are,\" and \"free hugs (or kisses).\"\n\nMany of the students were wearing clothing or pins showing their support for Sam. The Missouri Students Association handed out 1,000 \"Stand with Sam\" buttons to administrators, athletes and students.\n\nSam acknowledged the support during halftime of the MU basketball game against Tennessee yesterday afternoon.\n\nHe was with former coaches and teammates as they accepted the Cotton Bowl trophy. Sam got a turn holding the trophy and then saluted fans, shook hands with students and did his signature sack dance.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5;
