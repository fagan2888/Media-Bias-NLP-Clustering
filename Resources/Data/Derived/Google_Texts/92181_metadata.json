Section 1035 which relates to \u201cFalse statements relating to health care matters\u201d, the law states:\n\n\u201c(a) Whoever, in any matter involving a health care benefit program, knowingly and willfully - (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; or (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy pointed out, \u201cWell, how would the Justice Department be dealing with it if it had been uttered by, say, the president of an insurance company rather than the president of the United States?\u201d\n\nThe cases of USB and Bank of America, which were sued by Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s office, have presented hypocrisy when it relates to the President false statements.\n\nIn those cases, McCarthy said, \u201cThe complaints filed in court by prosecutors allege that these financial institutions defrauded investors in the sale of mortgage-backed securities by failing to disclose important facts about the underlying mortgages.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also pointed out the case of the Justice Department indicting Martha Stewart for fraud over press statements that did not disclose damaging information about her company.\n\n\u201cMs. Stewart, naturally, was fearful that truthful statements would send the stock price plummeting. Obama, by comparison, was not lying merely to prevent a company from losing value,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cHis fraud was, first, to induce passage of a plan designed gradually to destroy the private health-insurance market \u2014 a plan that barely passed and never would have been enacted if he\u2019d been honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarack Obama is guilty of fraud, serial fraud, that is orders of magnitude more serious than frauds the Justice Department routinely prosecutes, and that courts punish harshly. The victims [of Obamacare] will be out billions of dollars, quite apart from other anxiety and disruption that will befall them,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cThe president will not be prosecuted, of course, but that is immaterial. As discussed here before, the remedy for profound presidential corruption is political, not legal. It is impeachment and removal. \u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 the Constitution\u2019s predicate for impeachment \u2014 need not be indictable offenses under the criminal code. \u201cThey relate chiefly,\u201d Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 65, \u201cto injuries done immediately to the society itself\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since 2009, President Obama has been saying numerous times, \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you will be able to keep your health-care plan\u201d, but as it turns", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/mccarthy-barack-obama-is-guilty-of-fraud-serial-fraud", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/ca/9a/ca9a38cc3766afb4d432eda85e778013.jpg?itok=TOilF6G_", "type": "article", "title": "McCarthy: \u2018Barack Obama is guilty of fraud, serial fraud'"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since 2009, President Obama has been saying numerous times, \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you will be able to keep your health-care plan\u201d, but as it turns out, those statements were false and ac", "creator": "@PCGOPExaminer", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/ca/9a/ca9a38cc3766afb4d432eda85e778013.jpg?itok=TOilF6G_", "title": "McCarthy: \u2018Barack Obama is guilty of fraud, serial fraud'", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-11-10T12:08:32-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government Topics, Barack Obama, Obamacare, Fraud, health insurance, Affordable Care Act", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-10T12:08"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd37f\"", "article_summary": "US Code on fraud and false statements covers the definition and charges associated with making false statements under false information and hoaxes and false statements relating to health care matters.\nObama, by comparison, was not lying merely to prevent a company from losing value,\u201d said McCarthy.\nMcCarthy explains that Justice Department guidelines, set forth in the U.S.\nThe victims [of Obamacare] will be out billions of dollars, quite apart from other anxiety and disruption that will befall them,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 the Constitution\u2019s predicate for impeachment \u2014 need not be indictable offenses under the criminal code."}
