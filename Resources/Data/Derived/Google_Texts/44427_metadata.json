Has he crossed the constitutional line?\n\nIn recent years, Republicans have answered resoundingly in the affirmative. \u201cCongress makes the laws; the president executes them,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner in July, explaining in USA Today the chamber\u2019s pending lawsuit against the President over a delay of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate.\n\n\u201cThat is the system the Founders gave us. This is not about executive orders. Every president issues executive orders. Most of them, though, do so within the law.\u201d\n\nSince the Speaker\u2019s op-ed was published, that lawsuit has sputtered to a standstill. What\u2019s more, Constitution Daily reported that President Obama has issued the fewest executive orders per year since President Grover Cleveland\u2019s first time in office.\n\nStill, accusations of an \u201cimperial presidency\u201d have continued, and the recent flurry of White House activity is rejuvenating the debate. Can the President really change policy in many different areas all at once?\n\nAs it turns out, while the relevant questions of politics and policy may be complicated, the constitutional consequences are less so. Let\u2019s look at each issue in turn.\n\nNet neutrality. Last Monday, the President came out in favor of regulating internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast as public utilities akin to telephone service rather than private information companies.\n\n\u201cFor almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access into and out of your home or business,\u201d Obama said in a video statement. \u201cIt is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information\u2014whether a phone call or a packet of data.\u201d\n\nMuch as he might like to act, however, the President\u2019s role here is essentially a political one. The Federal Communications Commission\u2014an independent federal agency whose budget and appointments are overseen by Congress\u2014retains full control of the rules governing the telecommunications industry.\n\nSo it falls to the five-member commission, chaired by longtime Obama supporter and former telecom lobbyist Tom Wheeler, to determine whether to take up the President\u2019s call to reclassify ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. While the President\u2019s ability to exert political pressure is not trivial, it does not violate the Constitution.\n\nClimate change. On Wednesday, while attending a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Beijing, the President and Chinese Prime Minister Xi Jinping announced a joint agreement to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the United States has promised to double its current pace of carbon reduction with a 26-28 percent reduction from 2005 levels. For its part, China has agreed to keep its emission levels from growing after 2030, with an added promise of making renewable energy sources 20 percent of the nation\u2019s energy production by that time.\n\nObama has already drawn enormous fire from Republicans for making the agreement. But most criticism has sprung out of economic concerns, not for an overstepping of constitutional authority.\n\nIndeed, the understanding is that the President will turn to the Environmental Protection Agency and preexisting statutory authority to reach the new carbon goals. The Supreme Court ruled on the limits on the EPA\u2019s authority in June, but it mostly deferred to the agency, suggesting the President will be on solid constitutional ground moving forward.\n\nImmigration. On Friday, the New York Times reported that the President intends to announce a plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system by the end of the year, reengaging a fight that has inspired the most opposition to his presidency.\n\nThe administration is expected to defer or erase the deportation of up to five million unauthorized immigrants, including the parents of American citizens or legal residents and residents who were brought to the country as children. Other changes may include dialing back use of the controversial \u201cSecure Communities\u201d program and establishing new guidelines for border law enforcement.\n\nSince Election Day, Republicans have made clear that they will not tolerate executive action from the President on immigration. Boehner said his party would \u201cfight the President tooth and nail,\u201d including a possible lawsuit, and Senator Mike Lee said that \u201cit\u2019s very important for us to do what we can to prevent\u201d unilateral reform.\n\nBut as Constitution Daily reported in July, when rumors of impending action on immigration were fluttering through the media, Republicans will have little to no legal recourse if any action does occur. Plus, the President retains \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d to decide when and how certain laws are enforced.\n\nNicandro Iannacci is a web strategist at the National Constitution Center.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nNew Jersey reconsiders law banning cursing in front of children\n\nJudge Sutton\u2019s Loving problem\n\nPodcast: The Supreme Court considers racial gerrymandering\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "For the President and his supporters, it was an \u201cunexpectedly good week.\u201d On three high-profile issues\u2014net neutrality, climate change and immigration\u2014Barack Obama came out swinging.
