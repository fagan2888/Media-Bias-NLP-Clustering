The revamped “Weekend Update” is off to a great start. The signature “SNL” segment was also the season opener’s most highly anticipated segment after having undergone major changes: “Daily Show” correspondent Michael Che replaced Cecily Strong as co-host with Colin Jost, making Che the first black co-anchor and leaving two men at the Update Desk for the first time in the show’s history.

Che had a few flubs, but he recovered quickly and delivered punchy, sharp jokes that tackled politics, race and culture. Pete Davidson, the lone new player this season, certainly made a splash with a bold, controversial segment about prostitution.
