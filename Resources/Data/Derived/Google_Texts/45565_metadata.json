Lindsey Graham (SC).\n\nRelated: Cruz\u2019s Unreported $1 Million in Bank Loans Won\u2019t Help His Bid for President\n\nReserving the theater in Iowa is also no coincidence, as polls show Clinton neck and neck with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and with the state\u2019s important caucuses a little over two weeks away.\n\nEarly reviews of film note that it is mostly apolitical. It focuses on a group of security contractors who were working for the clandestine intelligence agency. The film doesn\u2019t mention Clinton, or President Obama by name but it apparently does make federal bureaucracy a bit of a villain, with officials preaching caution and protocol while the contractors want to rush in.\n\nBut the movie is mostly an action flick, as could be expected from Bay, the man behind the \u201cTransformers\u201d franchise and the recent reboot of \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Nikki Haley Hitching Her Wagon to Lone Star Ted Cruz?\n\nWhether the film will have an impact on the ongoing investigation by the House Select Committee on Benghazi into the deadly siege remains to be seen. The panel is not expected to release its final report about the attacks until sometime later this year.\n\nAs for the administration, it\u2019s staying mum about the film.\n\nThe movie \u201clooks like an entertaining film\u201d with \u201chigh-productions values,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One.\n\n\u201cObviously, Michael Bay is an action movie director who has made some pretty entertaining movies. So I wouldn\u2019t rule out that the president would see it,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Iowans wanting to see the new Michael Bay blockbuster about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks will have a chance to catch it for free, courtesy of Donald Trump.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Latest Campaign Ploy: Free Tickets to the Benghazi Movie", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/15/Trump-s-Latest-Campaign-Ploy-Free-Tickets-Iowa-Voters-See-Benghazi-Movie", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01152016_13_Hours_Benghazi_Movie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/15/Trump-s-Latest-Campaign-Ploy-Free-Tickets-Iowa-Voters-See-Benghazi-Movie", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01152016_13_Hours_Benghazi_Movie.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Iowans wanting to see the new Michael Bay blockbuster about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks will have a chance to catch it for free, courtesy of Donald Trump.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Republican presidential frontrunner has rented a movie theater in the Hawkeye State and will give away free tickets to \u201c13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,\u201d according to the Des Moines Register.\n\u201cObviously, Michael Bay is an action movie director who has made some pretty entertaining movies.\nIowans wanting to see the new Michael Bay blockbuster about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks will have a chance to catch it for free, courtesy of Donald Trump.\nThe movie \u201clooks like an entertaining film\u201d with \u201chigh-productions values,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One.\nWhether the film will have an impact on the ongoing investigation by the House Select Committee on Benghazi into the deadly siege remains to be seen."}
