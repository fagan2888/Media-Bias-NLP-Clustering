Gary Herbert (R) signed into law on March 25 House Bill 437, a Republican-sponsored alternative to a Democratic plan to expand Medicaid more broadly under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nHB 437 is the only Medicaid expansion plan in three years to pass through the GOP-controlled House and Senate.\n\nThe legislation extends coverage to approximately 16,000 childless adults who are homeless, in parole or substance abuse programs, or undergoing treatment for mental health problems, Brigham Young University\u2019s Daily Universe reports. Because Utah\u2019s limited plan would not expand Medicaid up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, the state would receive less federal money than other states that have expanded Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid expansion will cost Utah $50 million, or $4 million more than projected revenues, in the state\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, according to the bill\u2019s fiscal note. In fiscal year 2018, the program will cost $104 million, or $12 million more than projected revenues.\n\nUnique Utah\n\nDerek Monson, director of public policy at the Sutherland Institute, says the legislation extends Medicaid coverage only to truly needy individuals.\n\n\u201cThe bill defines [those in] \u2018greatest need\u2019 as those falling below an income threshold who also meet other criteria,\u201d said Monson. \u201cThe income threshold [for qualified recipients] will be set each year in state budget legislation and is designed to be adjusted from year to year to cover as many people as state funding appropriated to the program allows.\u201d\n\nMonson says regardless of whether HB 437 works for Utah, no state Medicaid program is one-size-fits-all.\n\n\u201cStates\u2019 low-income health coverage needs are unique enough that I would hesitate to say that any particular Medicaid program provides a model for the entire country,\u201d Monson said.\n\nBreaking the Mold\n\nJosh Daniels, a policy analyst at the Libertas Institute, says Utah\u2019s Medicaid expansion benefits Utahans by breaking the ACA mold.\n\n\u201cThis is a much more riveting program because it doesn\u2019t sign for ACA-style Medicaid expansion,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cWe can just use state money and literally expand our state\u2019s Medicaid under our own terms to the populations we think are needy, using the traditional [Medicaid] match rate and not signing up for the uncapped liabilities that come with full Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nBecause HB 437 does expand Medicaid, although on limited terms, the bill may offer Republicans a defense against criticism from Democrats in an election year, Daniels said.\n\nMichael McGrady (mmcgrady@uccs.edu) writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nImage via Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23d6\"", "article_summary": "HB 437 is the only Medicaid expansion plan in three years to pass through the GOP-controlled House and Senate.\nBreaking the MoldJosh Daniels, a policy analyst at the Libertas Institute, says Utah\u2019s Medicaid expansion benefits Utahans by breaking the ACA mold.\n\u201cThis is a much more riveting program because it doesn\u2019t sign for ACA-style Medicaid expansion,\u201d Daniels said.\nMedicaid expansion will cost Utah $50 million, or $4 million more than projected revenues, in the state\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, according to the bill\u2019s fiscal note.\n\u201cStates\u2019 low-income health coverage needs are unique enough that I would hesitate to say that any particular Medicaid program provides a model for the entire country,\u201d Monson said."}
