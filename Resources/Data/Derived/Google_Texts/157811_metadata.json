Caseworkers look at an applicant's income from all sources when determining whether they qualify for welfare benefits and how much money they will receive.\n\nGillis cited one example of the problems: If three people live in one residence and each receives five payments from various sources, the system can't process the information and locks up.\n\nBut \u201cthat doesn't mean clients will not receive benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nJoanne Sessa of the Service Employees International Union, representing caseworkers using the updated system, said she is concerned about a systemwide meltdown.\n\n\u201cIf those glitches aren't corrected, I envision the darn computer just blowing up,\u201d Sessa said. \u201cA lot of citizens of this state won't receive the benefits they are entitled to. I see a total disaster.\u201d\n\nThe Commonwealth is one of at least 11 states experiencing difficulties with the upgrades:\n\n\u2022 Colorado's network issued $26 million in food stamps to ineligible applicants and withheld $11 million from qualified families. The system mistakenly cut off benefits to nearly 69 percent of the state's eligible households.\n\n\u2022 In October, people in 17 states could not use food stamp debit cards when a routine test of backup systems during a computer upgrade resulted in system failure.\n\n\u2022 Oregon's computer network failed to process applications correctly, delaying welfare payments and food stamps to thousands of families.\n\n\u2022 Glitches in North Carolina's network in March delayed welfare benefits and food stamps for weeks.\n\nDespite a rocky start, Colorado's technical problems \u201cwere resolved in short order,\u201d said Tauna Lockhart, spokeswoman for the Governor's Office of Information Technology. The state's network, which includes more than 961,000 clients, is \u201cmuch improved, more efficient, effective,\u201d Lockhart said.\n\nIn New Jersey, paper applications overwhelmed caseworkers when a computer system upgrade promised for several years was unable to process a high volume of applications for health insurance.\n\nHuman Services Department spokeswoman Nicole Brossoie said those problems are being addressed.\n\nAn analysis of 16 states \u2014 Pennsylvania included \u2014 by the Council on Economic Advisers estimates the upgrades will save states a combined $3 billion to $4 billion annually.\n\nPennsylvania's welfare department administers programs for more than 2.8 million citizens, ranging from cash, food and medical assistance to programs for children and adults with special needs.\n\nThe system upgrades include linking the department to other agencies from which applicants might receive payments, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and the state lottery.\n\nCaseworkers worry that beginning this week when welfare applications will be accepted online, the public will experience the same frustration and delays they have seen.\n\nThey say there is no replacement for face-to-face interaction with applicants, during which many caseworkers sniff out possible fraud.\n\nRichard Gazarik is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
