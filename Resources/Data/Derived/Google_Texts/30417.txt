Remember Obama for America's Life of Julia campaign? The campaign showing a young woman in the government's care and under President Obama's policies from cradle to grave? The campaign that ensured Obamacare would be great for Julia and would provide her with the essential healthcare she needs?

Now that Obamacare is a reality for millions of American women, the Life of Julia looks different. Millions of women have lost their health insurance coverage, have lost their doctors and have seen their healthcare costs increase. On average, the healthcare premium for young women is expected to increase by 193 percent.

Healthy young women will see their premiums rise by an average of almost 200 percent under Obamacare, with increases occurring in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to a new study.



Overall, states averaged a 193 percent increase in premiums for 30-year-old female nonsmokers.

More than one year after the Life of Julia and with Obamcare in full-swing, The Independent Women's Forum presents, The Real Life of Julia.

As a result, the very women these groups claimed to be helping will suffer.

Tell me again, who's really waging the war on women?
