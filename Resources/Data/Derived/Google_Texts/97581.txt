Police are stepping up street patrols after gunfire on the streets of Fort Myers killed a 17-year-old boy.

Family members are mourning the loss of Malique Brown.

Police tell us more officers were in the Dunbar neighbor Sunday. Detectives are still questioning people in the community.

Investigators and family want to see whoever gunned down Malique Brown in a driveway arrested.

“I hated it. I hated it. It was so sad,” said Penney Malloy, the victim’s grandmother.

Penney Malloy still can’t believe her grandson is gone.

“Marlique was a good kid. You know, when he was coming up. I used to keep him,” said Malloy.

Brown died from a single gunshot would early Saturday morning.

It happened while he was visiting a friend on Franklin Street in Dunbar. Someone fired shots and took off.

“His mother, she took it hard,” said Malloy.

Fort Myers police have stepped up patrols in the area. They tell us they want to make neighbors feel safe. Brown’s aunt says it’s not helping.

“I don’t think anything is going to be done about it anyway,” said Karon Brown, the victim’s aunt.

Karon Brown wants to see someone arrested for killing her nephew. She wants witnesses and neighbors to speak up. Her biggest fear is the case going cold.

“There are too many killings going on and they haven’t caught anybody for everybody who’s getting killed,” said Karon Brown.

Relatives say Marlique Brown attended Dunbar High School. His group of friends refer to themselves as Bucktown.

Brown leaves behind a child who is not even a year old. He also has another baby on the way – two kids who will be forced to grow up without a father.

“They didn’t have to do that. They didn’t,” said Malloy.

Investigators say too many people are being tight-lipped. They tell us you can remain anonymous; just let them who is responsible for this homicide.
