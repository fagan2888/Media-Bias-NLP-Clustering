It\u2019s that Republicans scrambled to spin the story, insisting to reporters that Pryor couldn\u2019t possibly be running on Obamacare if he won\u2019t refer to the law by name. ....Instead, Pryor says, \"I helped pass a law that prevents insurance companies from canceling your policy if you get sick or deny [sic] coverage based on pre-existing conditions.\u201d Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said anything about \u201ca law\u201d at all, but that\u2019s a niggling, semantic critique. That Republicans working to defeat Pryor are asking reporters to squeeze the word \u201cObamacare\u201d into this sentence is an admission that they\u2019ve lost the policy fight. They criticize Pryor for eschewing the label, because the label\u2019s just about the only thing they\u2019re comfortable assailing.\n\nI suppose this isn't the biggest thing in the world, and as Beutler says, Republicans did manage to talk several reporters into mentioning this. So from their point of view, it's just savvy media strategy. Besides, the truth is that Republicans have always focused on only a few things in their critique of Obamacare. That's because polls have shown for years that most of the provisions of the law are popular even though support for the law itself is pretty shaky. This causes Republicans endless grief, since Democrats get to harass them relentlessly about whether they oppose closing the donut hole; whether they oppose subsidy assistance; whether they oppose guaranteed issue; and so on. Republicans can hem and haw about how they'd keep all this stuff and only get rid of the nasty taxes and mandates, but even the dimmer bulbs in the GOP caucus know perfectly well that this is untrue.\n\nIn any case, other Democratic politicians have touted their support for specific provisions of Obamacare, so Pryor isn't really doing anything new. He's just being smart. He knows that denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions is extremely unpopular, even among conservative voters, and he'd love to draw his opponent into a debate about exactly that. Tom Cotton has so far refused to take the bait, pretending that he'd somehow keep that provision while repealing everything else. This is a bald-faced lie, of course, but if he sticks to that story like glue he can probably avoid any serious damage from Pryor's attacks.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Mark Pryor hopes that will be the key to victory in the Arkansas Senate race.", "title": "Obamacare may not be popular, but its provisions sure are", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/08/obamacare-may-not-be-popular-its-provisions-sure-are", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obamacare may not be popular, but its provisions sure are", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/08/obamacare-may-not-be-popular-its-provisions-sure-are", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Elections,Health+Care", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "In any case, other Democratic politicians have touted their support for specific provisions of Obamacare, so Pryor isn't really doing anything new.\nThat's because polls have shown for years that most of the provisions of the law are popular even though support for the law itself is pretty shaky.\nBesides, the truth is that Republicans have always focused on only a few things in their critique of Obamacare.\nIt\u2019s that Republicans scrambled to spin the story, insisting to reporters that Pryor couldn\u2019t possibly be running on Obamacare if he won\u2019t refer to the law by name.\nThat Republicans working to defeat Pryor are asking reporters to squeeze the word \u201cObamacare\u201d into this sentence is an admission that they\u2019ve lost the policy fight."}
