Gov. Mary Fallin said Tuesday that she would not delay the execution of Richard Glossip, who is to die on Wednesday for arranging a murder in 1997. Mr. Glossip’s defense lawyers, the anti-death penalty campaigner Sister Helen Prejean, the Innocence Project and others had publicized what they call significant new evidence casting doubt on his guilt. His conviction rested largely on the testimony of the admitted killer, who was spared the death penalty in return for testifying that Mr. Glossip was the mastermind. But Ms. Fallin said she had seen “no credible evidence of Richard Glossip’s innocence.” Late Tuesday, his lawyers filed a new request for a stay of execution with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that in view of the new evidence, he “would be acquitted at trial today.”
