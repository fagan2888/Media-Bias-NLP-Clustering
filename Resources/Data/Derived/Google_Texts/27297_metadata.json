Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Harrell said.\n\nThe Dothan Eagle randomly asked 50 people attending Older Americans Day in Dothan on Wednesday who they support for president - Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or other/none of the above?\n\nTwenty-eight respondents said they support Trump. Eleven said they support Hillary Clinton and eleven others said they would vote for neither or someone else.\n\nHarrell said the Affordable Care Act has affected her adversely since its inception.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been good for my family. We need to get rid of it,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cWe need a change. It\u2019s about time. Trump is fighting.\u201d\n\nBelow are a few responses from Wiregrass seniors when asked their presidential preference.\n\n\u00bb \u201cTrump. No question. He talks the truth. Hillary lies too much, and I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Mary Cleem, Cowarts.\n\n\u00bb \u201cI\u2019m voting for anyone who runs against Hillary Clinton.\u201d Charlotte Sherrill, Enterprise.\n\n\u00bb \u201cNeither. You could take a farmer and put him in there and he would do better than either one.\u201d Joe Ann Chason, Dothan.\n\n\u00bb \u201cHillary. She is not as arrogant as Trump is.\u201d Edgar DuBose, Dothan.\n\n\u00bb \u201cTrump. He tells it like it is. He\u2019ll make America great again.\u201d Judy Sevec, Dothan.\n\n\u00bb \u201cTrump. The way it is now, Republicans and Democrats, they all want the same thing. We need a change.\u201d Tony Sevec, Dothan.\n\n\u00bb \u201cHillary. I hope she\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d Valerie Wheeler, Dothan.\n\n\u00bb \u201cTrump. Hillary was underneath the tutelage of a socialist. I don\u2019t support her or her husband, either one. I don\u2019t think she speaks for women. She doesn\u2019t speak for me.\u201d Teri McPhail, Graceville, Florida.\n\n\u00bb \u201cI suppose it is the lesser of two evils with Trump, but I do not like at all how he relates to foreign leaders. I think it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Debbie DuBose, Enterprise.\n\n\u00bb \u201cVoting against Hillary. I like the way Trump talks, even though I don\u2019t think he can get half of the stuff done that he talks about.\u201d Bobby Hadden, Wicksburg.\n\n\u00bb \u201cTrump. I live by myself. I can vote for who I want to.\u201d Ann Croley, Enterprise.\n\n\u00bb \u201cHillary. I don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s attitude. He talks too much. He just talks all the time.\u201d Velma Henderson, Ashford.\n\n\u00bb \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton for dog catcher. I think Trump is brash, but I think he will get good people around him.\u201d Donna Sabel, Cottonwood.\n\nWell more than 1,000 seniors from throughout the Wiregrass attended the annual older Americans event, which featured live music from The Classics, skit contests, door prizes and other events.
