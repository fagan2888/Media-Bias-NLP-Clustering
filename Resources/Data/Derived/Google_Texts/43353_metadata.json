The agency said the bank avoided placing branches and loan officers in those communities and excluded them from marketing strategies and credit assessments.\n\nHudson City, a federally chartered savings association, has 135 branches and $35.4 billion in assets. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants in credit transactions on the basis of characteristics such as race, color and national origin.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Hudson City Savings Bank is accused of discriminating against black and Hispanic residents.", "description": "Hudson City Savings Bank is accused of discriminating against black and Hispanic residents.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Hudson City Savings Bank is accused of discriminating against black and Hispanic residents.", "title": "Feds crack down on bank for alleged redlining practices", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/254802-administration-cracks-down-on-bank-for-alleged-redlining-practices", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cordrayrichardobamabarack_051814getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/254802-administration-cracks-down-on-bank-for-alleged-redlining-practices", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-24T12:31-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Mortgage industry of the United States, Politics of the United States, Racial segregation, Redlining, Business, Bank, United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, United States, Richard Cordray,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-24T12:31:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/254802-administration-cracks-down-on-bank-for-alleged-redlining-practices", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Hudson City Savings Bank is accused of discriminating against black and Hispanic residents.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds crack down on bank for alleged redlining practices"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds crack down on bank for alleged redlining practices"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb48a\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTCFPB Director Richard Cordray said the practice, which is known as redlining, cut off opportunities for consumers in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods to get a mortgage.\n\u201cWithout access to affordable credit, neighborhoods deteriorate in the long shadow cast by unfair lending,\u201d he said in a news release.\nThe CFPB alleges that from 2009 to 2013 Hudson City structured its business to avoid and discourage residents in majority black and Hispanic neighborhoods from accessing mortgages.\nHudson City, a federally chartered savings association, has 135 branches and $35.4 billion in assets.\nA Northeast bank has been ordered to pay $27 million to increase fair access to credit in neighborhoods where it allegedly discriminated against black and Hispanic residents."}
