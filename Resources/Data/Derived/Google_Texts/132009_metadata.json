The study was funded by the German government though the drug-maker Gilead Sciences provided the pharmaceuticals.The usual regimen for chronic HCV infection lasts twice that long, he said\u201cIn my country that costs 60,000 euros, so this would cost half that,\u201d he added.Cost is important, but by treating these infections at the acute stage and not waiting for them to become chronic, the odds the virus will spread go down, and of course patients experience less illness.\u201cSpending less is better, but it prevents spreading to others and these patients are ill for months,\u201d he said, \u201cIf have hepatitis C I don\u2019t want to wait around being yellow for six weeks,\u201d he said, referring to the jaundice that accompanies infection.In the trial there were 20 patients from 10 centers, average age 46 and 60% of patients were men.They acquired the virus in different ways. Most (55%) were infected through sexual transmission, about half men having sex with men; another 25% had needle-stick injuries, one through drug use, one was said to be infected during a nail treatment, and the rest did not know how they got it.All were HCV GT 1, since the drug combo in Germany is approved only for treatment of GT1 and GT 4, he said.Within six weeks, all patients had undetectable levels of HCV.\u201cThis was really spectacular,\u201d Wedemeyer said.These patients can be successfully treated with interferon, but that takes six months and often has severe side effects.Next up, researchers will look to see if a subset of patients might need the drug longer, and will also look at whether other HCV genotypes might respond similarly.The study is not the first time researchers have reported success with shorter HCV treatment regimens.
