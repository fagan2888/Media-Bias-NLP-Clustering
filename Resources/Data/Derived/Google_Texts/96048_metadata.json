But enough do that their participation can change the outcome of close races.\u201d And, the researchers note, 80% of non-citizen votes go to Democrats.\n\nThe estimated percentage of non-citizens voting is small, especially in midterms: \u201cOur best guess, based upon extrapolations from the portion of the sample with a verified vote, is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010,\u201d Richman and Earnest wrote in the Washington Post. Yet that small percentage \u201cwas large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThey single out the close election for U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2008, in which a victory for incumbent Republican Norm Coleman was reversed in a controversial recount that gave the win to comedian Al Franken. Non-citizen votes, they say, could quite easily have been the reason for Franken\u2019s win\u2013and therefore were the reason Democrats could count on a \u201c60th vote\u201d for Obamacare, which passed the Senate in late 2009:\n\nNon-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) won election in 2008 with a victory margin of 312 votes.\n\nRichman and Earnest add that voter ID is \u201cstrikingly ineffective\u201d in deterring non-citizens from voting: many non-citizens vote anyway. They recommend instead improving public education about the simple fact that non-citizens are barred from voting. Alternatively, they suggest, non-citizens could be allowed to vote in U.S. elections, as long-term residents are in some other nations (and as they once were in the U.S., as well).\n\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
