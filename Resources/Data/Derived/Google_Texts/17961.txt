The Heritage Foundation’s Matthew Streit wrote more about this in a column last month for The Daily Signal:

The last major update to the U.S. tax system was in 1986—over 29 years ago.

Think about how much has changed since then. In 1985, Microsoft Windows was released. Since then, Microsoft has released more than 20 updates to the operating system.

Updating the tax system is one of the perennial policy issues politicians enjoy talking about, and has the potential to be a key policy debate in 2015 and 2016.

But whether all the talk, hand-wringing and head-nodding will actually result in change is yet to be seen.

While Washington has consensus that tax reform needs to happen, there’s significant disagreement on how to reform it.

A recent study on American attitudes and support for tax reform conducted by the American Perceptions Initiative, a project of The Heritage Foundation, found that only a slight majority of Americans support tax reform (52 percent), in part, due to limited familiarity with what “tax reform” actually means.

However, once respondents gained more familiarity with the current tax system and the possibility of alternate approaches, the level of support for tax reform among Americans jumped significantly to 71 percent. Only 5 percent believe the system is work­ing just fine.
