After paying his dues for five seasons on the World Cup, he knew he was one of them.\n\nThree weeks later he captured his first World Cup podium. This past December he captured his first World Cup win. And on America\u2019s downhill course Saturday, with a massive crowd cheering him into the finish, Ganong became the first American man to win a world championships medal in downhill since Bode Miller and Daron Rahlves went 1-2 in 2005.\n\nGanong took silver, 0.24 of a second behind gold medal winner Patrick Kueng of Switzerland. The bronze medal went to another Swiss, Beat Feuz. American Steven Nyman missed a medal by 0.03 of a second, finishing fourth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just unreal to be able to come here and perform like this in a world championships setting,\u201d said Ganong, who is from Squaw Valley, Calif. \u201cI\u2019m so stoked. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nGanong agreed that the downhill in Sochi was a major turning point. It was his first-ever Olympic race, and he was the top American .\n\n\u201cSochi was a great race for me,\u201d said Ganong, 26. \u201cAfter that I just kind of took off. This is a building process. You have to learn how to ski downhill. It\u2019s such a dangerous sport and on the limit, you have to know how to ride that fine line between risk and reward and know how to get to that reward at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cI knew I could ski fast, I knew I had it in me to be competitive at the highest level. It was just a matter of figuring out how to conquer the nerves and conquer the over-excitement of being at these big events.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, he did.\n\n\u201cI woke up and I just told myself, \u2018Hey, be relaxed. You\u2019ve been skiing your whole life, you know how to ski. Don\u2019t think about it, just go have fun and enjoy the day. Make some good turns and keep it simple.\u2019 I love skiing. I have passion for it.\u201d\n\nBecause they\u2019re both from the Lake Tahoe area, Rahlves was a hero for Ganong and later became a mentor. Rahlves is here, and Thursday night they went over video of Rahlves\u2019 run in a 2003 World Cup downhill here when he set the course record.\n\n\u201cHe was kind of showing me how he cut off line here and there, where to look for extra time, how to always look for your tuck,\u201d Ganong said. \u201cEspecially today, it was super windy so you had to stay really low and aerodynamic. He\u2019s been a great mentor and helped me out throughout the years. He\u2019s a cool guy.\u201d\n\nGanong and Rahlves, who left the tour in 2006, shared a lift ride Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cHe looks up to Daron for sure,\u201d said U.S. men\u2019s coach Sasha Rearick. \u201cDaron is a guy that brings fire, who has tremendous energy and passion and desire. I think Travis has learned that from him over the years and inspires that side of him.\u201d\n\nNow they both have silver medals in downhill. The championships have another week to run, but Ganong leaves Sunday for a few days of skiing back home with friends before returning to the World Cup. He\u2019s fired up because the Tahoe area just got two feet of snow.\n\n\u201cLife is hopefully like a never-ending powder run,\u201d Ganong said. \u201cOr the perfect downhill like today.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Travis Ganong captures silver in Worlds men\u2019s downhill", "title": "Travis Ganong captures silver in Worlds men\u2019s downhill", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/07/travis-ganong-captures-silver-in-worlds-mens-downhill/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150207_124659_travis-ganong.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150207_124659_travis-ganong.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-07T12:54:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:34:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "World Ski Championships 2015"}, "article_summary": "After paying his dues for five seasons on the World Cup, he knew he was one of them.\nThis past December he captured his first World Cup win.\nThe bronze medal went to another Swiss, Beat Feuz.\nThree weeks later he captured his first World Cup podium.\nYou have to learn how to ski downhill."}
