The book lays out the yoga process he developed that includes 26 poses and two breathing exercises that are meant to be done in a hot room.\n\nIn 2011, Choudhury charged two former students with copyright infringement after they opened their own studio, Evolation Yoga, which practiced a form of \"hot yoga\" that was nearly identical to the style Choudhury developed.\n\nThe court on Thursday pointed back to previous case law that found that while the descriptions of art in a book could be granted copyright protection, that does not automatically give protection to the art itself.\n\n\"The [yoga] Sequence is not copyrightable as a choreographic work for the same reason that it is not copyrightable as a compilation: it is an idea, process, or system to which copyright protection may '[i]n no case' extend,\" the court ruled.\n\nThe court found that if the \"healing methodology\" is entitled to any intellectual property rights in U.S. law, it would be in the form of a patent. But the court declined to opine on whether yoga sequences would actually be eligible for a patent, because that was not at issue in the case.\n\nThis is the second appeals court case on copyright in the past few months that has caught attention because of its unusual subject matter.
