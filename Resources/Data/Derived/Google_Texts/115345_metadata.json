That would be the form 1095-B and 1095-C,\" Brunson said. Most people will not need to take any information off that form. They will check a box that shows they had health insurance in 2015.\n\n\"If you did take benefit of the premium tax credit [from ACA], you should have received a form 1095-A. You would need to take information off that and report it on your return.\"\n\nBrian Watson, a spokesman for the IRS' criminal investigation arm, said because tax season is over does not mean tax fraud is done.\n\nThis year's most common scam:\n\n\"The biggest scam we've seen the last few years is something we call the IRS impersonation scam,\" Watson said. That involves unsolicited telephone calls from individuals claiming to represent the IRS. They ask for money to be sent to them to avoid legal repercussions, loss of a driver's license or deportation.\n\n\"Now they're also claiming to be from the IRS and asking to verify your tax information so that your refund can be processed.\" It is actually a ploy to get information that may help them steal your identity.\n\nThe bottom line: the IRS will not make first contact on the phone and demand money or information. \"If we need to get in touch with you, we're going to send you a letter to let you know what's going on,\" he said.\n\nTax return fraud:\n\nSome may prepare their taxes, only to have the agency tell them they have already filed. \"If you get an indication that a return has already been filed, most likely what has happened is you're the victim of identity theft,\" he said. Steps to report tax return fraud are available at IRS.gov.\n\n\"You will get your refund if you were owed one by the IRS,\" Watson said. \"But it will take 3-6 months to get it cleared up.\"\n\nWhere to mail:\n\nMost post offices are not altering their schedules, according to US Postal Service spokesman Peter Hass. Hass said walk-up counters at Tucson's main postal facility on Cherrybell Stravenue will be open until 7 p.m., and final pick up at the facility's mailboxes will be at 10 p.m.\n\nLast-minute help:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.azpm.org/p/featured-news/2016/4/18/86141-all-you-need-to-know-about-todays-tax-deadline/", "image": "https://media.azpm.org/master/img/spot/tax_prep_450_252.jpg", "description": "Plus, reports on this year's most common scams, where to find last-minute help.", "title": "All You Need to Know About Monday's Tax Deadline"}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "publish_date": "2016-04-18T05:00:00", "Copyright": "Arizona Public Media, 2007-2012"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3194\"", "article_summary": "\"This will give you an additional six months to submit your 2015 tax return.\"\nTax return fraud:Some may prepare their taxes, only to have the agency tell them they have already filed.\nSteps to report tax return fraud are available at IRS.gov.\nBrian Watson, a spokesman for the IRS' criminal investigation arm, said because tax season is over does not mean tax fraud is done.\n\"Now they're also claiming to be from the IRS and asking to verify your tax information so that your refund can be processed.\""}
