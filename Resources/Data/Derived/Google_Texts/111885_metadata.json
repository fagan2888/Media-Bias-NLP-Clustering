It's intended to assist in locating an available bed for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis who are under an emergency custody order, ECO, and need to receive treatment under a temporary detention order, TDO.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Features, Health", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-dailypress", "description": "U.S. Rep.
