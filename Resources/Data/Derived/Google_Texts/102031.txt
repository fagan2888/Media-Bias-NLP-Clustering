Saturday April 16th was the second day of the 15th Annual Ham Jam event in Philadelphia.

Downtown was packed and people from all walks of life flooded the street. Several people came to enjoy the food, rides, and entertainment.

Gwen Moore and husband attended the event for the first time. Moore says there were a number of activities to choose from and they worked up an appetite.

"We are going to try the food for sure. We haven't eaten and we are curious to see what is all here," said Moore.

There were more than 100 arts and crafts vendors setup.
