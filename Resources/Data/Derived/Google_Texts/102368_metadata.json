Jeremy Stewart will be the third running back for the Broncos.\n\nFor the first time since C.J. Anderson\u2019s breakout performance in Game 9 at Oakland, the Broncos will have their full complement of running backs for their divisional playoff Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAnderson, Ronnie Hillman and Juwan Thompson will all dress to give the Broncos a one-two-three running punch against the Colts. Expect the No. 1 back, Anderson, to get the bulk of the carries.\n\nHillman suffered a Lisfranc foot sprain during that Nov. 9 game against Oakland and didn\u2019t return until the season finale against the Raiders, on Dec. 28 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Thompson played every game this season until the final against the Raiders, when he rested his sore hip and knee.\n\nAll three are ready for the game against the Colts.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "C.J.
