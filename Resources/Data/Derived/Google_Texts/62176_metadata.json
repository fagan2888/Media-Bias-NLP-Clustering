The problem would be dramatically worse for our local hospital if we didn\u2019t act rationally on an ongoing basis to ensure our cost structure reflects the cuts we are expected to absorb.\u201d\n\nThe combined salary and benefit cuts make up 25 percent of MSHA\u2019s goal for reductions.\n\nThe company statement underscores the system\u2019s need to continue to find savings in its operational costs.\n\nWellmont Health System, Mountain States\u2019 competitor in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, announced last week that it intends to seek another company with which to affiliate to help share some of the expected losses.\n\nEarlier this year, Wellmont closed one of its community hospitals, pointing to difficulty finding doctors to agree to on-call coverage, and the funding and patient losses experienced by most health care providers in the country.\n\nHicks said Wednesday that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d if Mountain States may be an interested partner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>One of the Tri-Cities\u2019 largest employers announced plans to eliminate 161 occupied and vacant positions Wednesday, pointing to decreasing revenues attributed to recent health care reform", "og": {"url": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/frontpage/2014/01/15/MSHA-to-eliminate-161-positions-in-90-days", "site_name": "Johnson City Press", "image": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/image/2014/01/15/x720_q60/d1324e4d23255e8d1670e904b286c82a-jpg.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "MSHA to eliminate 161 positions in 90 days"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com", "creator": "JCPress", "image": {"src": "http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/image/2014/01/15/x720_q60/d1324e4d23255e8d1670e904b286c82a-jpg.jpg"}, "title": "MSHA to eliminate 161 positions in 90 days", "site": "@JCPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 848454308559958}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201401150008}}, "keywords": "Johnson City Press,All Updates", "google-site-verification": "UTYidLMnIyXFs261jI5BgFnyem2HTUSm6Q0pwAiJnAk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce754\"", "article_summary": "One of the Tri-Cities\u2019 largest employers announced plans to eliminate 161 occupied and vacant positions Wednesday, pointing to decreasing revenues attributed to recent health care reform efforts.\nHicks said Wednesday that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d if Mountain States may be an interested partner.\n\u201cMountain States Health Alliance is a strong organization that is positioned well to manage through these challenges,\u201d Levine said in an issued statement.\nThe employees will remain on the company\u2019s payroll for 90 days, and will have the option to use its Career Resource Center to retrain for other positions in the system or to search for an outside job.\nWellmont Health System, Mountain States\u2019 competitor in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, announced last week that it intends to seek another company with which to affiliate to help share some of the expected losses."}
