The number of dengue fever cases in the Colombo district was up 30 percent in Jan. 2014 as compared to January of last year, according to a Sunday Times report today.

The report states that in January 2014 there were 1,091 dengue cases in the district, while in 2013 there were 757 cases.

In the capital city of Colombo, health officials reported 376 cases and four deaths, three in children under 5.

In the city, a large volume of construction sites lends to an increase in mosquito breeding grounds, lending itself to the increase in cases.

Other factors being looked at is an increase in tourists coming into the country and city residents not adhering to requests by the authorities to keep their premises clean.

Dengue fever is an infectious disease carried by mosquitoes and caused by any of four related dengue viruses. This disease used to be called “break-bone fever” because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there may be 50–100 million dengue infections worldwide every year. However, new research from the University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust, using cartographic approaches, estimate there to be 390 million dengue infections per year worldwide.

There are three types of dengue fever in order of less severe to most: the typical uncomplicated dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHS) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).

There is not a vaccine for dengue fever. There is no treatment for dengue, just treat the symptoms.
