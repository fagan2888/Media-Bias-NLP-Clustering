Police say customers inside heard gunshots and glass breaking. Some got down on the ground and others took cover in a restroom.\n\n\"A young man and his kids were in there and they hit the floor under some tables,\" Sgt. Jeff Davis said. \"It was a pretty scary situation in there for about 10 to 15 minutes.\"\n\nThere were 21 people in and around the business when shots rang out, but none were hurt.\n\nPolice say the Braum's is a very unusual location for a drive-by shooting.\n\n\"Generally our drive-bys, in my experience, are usually at homes and are usually in retaliation for something,\" Davis said.\n\nWitnesses told officers a black party bus was nearby at the time of the incident, but police said they are still investigating whether it was involved.\n\nEmployees of Braum's and other local businesses declined our request for an interview. They directed us to corporate offices that are closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\nPolice, so far, no arrests have been made in the case. Anyone with information is asked to call police or Crime Stoppers at 316-267-2111.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "It happened around 10 p.m. Friday at the Braum's at 3641 North Rock Road.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "It happened around 10 p.m. Friday at the Braum's at 3641 North Rock Road.", "title": "Police investigate drive-by shooting at NE Wichita Braum's", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Police-investigate-drive-by-shooting-at-NE-Wichita-Braums-249134541.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/663/BF1/663BF1EF3ED248958B1D0509C82E6FC3", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/68F/BD1/68FBD1534BB54BEB9C0F61F5A761E5F7.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "It happened around 10 p.m. Friday at the Braum's at 3641 North Rock Road.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Police-investigate-drive-by-shooting-at-NE-Wichita-Braums-249134541.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/BraumsRock.jpg", "title": "Police investigate drive-by shooting at NE Wichita Braum's", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Police investigate drive-by shooting at NE Wichita Braum's", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Police investigate driveby shooting at"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde823\"", "article_summary": "Police are investigating a drive-by shooting that happened Friday night a a Braums in northeast Wichita.\nPolice say the Braum's is a very unusual location for a drive-by shooting.\nIt happened around 10 p.m. at the Braum's at 3641 North Rock Road.\n\"Generally our drive-bys, in my experience, are usually at homes and are usually in retaliation for something,\" Davis said.\n\"A young man and his kids were in there and they hit the floor under some tables,\" Sgt."}
