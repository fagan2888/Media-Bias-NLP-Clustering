Rick Snyder, whose re-election race is a tossup, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll shows.\n\nThe poll of 500 likely voters, released Thursday, shows Democrat Mark Schauer leading Snyder 45% to 43%, a statistical tie.\n\nIn the state's race for an open U.S. Senate seat, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters has a 9-point lead over former secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, a Republican, 46% to 37%.\n\nDemocrats would really like to oust Snyder, a governor who won blue-leaning Michigan in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Calling himself \"one tough nerd,'' he promised to improve Michigan's economy and passed a right-to-work law and a tax on some pensions. Schauer, a former state legislator and U.S. congressman, argues that Snyder's reforms have not benefited middle-class residents. He says he will deliver a middle-class tax cut and increase spending on education.\n\nJust over half of poll respondents, or 51%, think Michigan's economy is improving \u2014 which should be good news for Snyder. The fact that the governor's race is still so tight \"tells me he hasn't connected effectively with likely voters,'' says David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center.\n\nNew USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll on Michigan's Senate and governor races. (Photo: Frank Pompa)\n\nRepublicans would like to take the Senate seat left open by the retirement of Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. The GOP needs to add six Senate seats to take the majority \u2014 and Michigan voters seem well aware of it: 63% of the respondents in the poll said control of Congress is a factor in their choice.\n\nMary Kiser, 71, of Dearborn Heights, says she is voting for Land because the Affordable Care Act, championed by Democrats, is causing changes to Medicare that affect her. Co-pays are higher, she said in a telephone interview after the poll was conducted. \"They're cutting back on old people. You don't realize it, but if you 're watching it you can see what 's happening. We're paying for drugs now that were covered before,'' she says.\n\nPeters leads Land 52%-32% among women in the poll, not unusual for a Democratic candidate. Land leads among men 42%-39%. \"Peters is holding his own among men,'' Paleologos says.\n\nWayne Wilbert, 52, a union worker at the Canada border crossing who lives in St. Clair Shores, says he voted Republican from President Reagan to President George W. Bush but will vote for Peters this November. \"I just began to realize, wait a minute, these (Republicans) do not have my interests at heart. They're screwing me while they're just giving everything to big business and the rich.''\n\nThe poll was conducted Sept. 6-10 and has a margin of error of 4.4%.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1rYgBVH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A tight race for Michigan governor and good news for Democrats trying to hang on to control of the Senate.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "A tight race for Michigan governor and good news for Democrats trying to hang on to control of the Senate.", "title": "Poll: Michigan governor race a tossup", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/2014/09/11/michigan-senate-governor-poll/15443215/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A tight race for Michigan governor and good news for Democrats trying to hang on to control of the Senate.", "title": "Poll: Michigan governor race a tossup", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f9999b64772f93b820def75ca4173922df8d898/c=1008-124-2000-1116&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/09/11/1410450550000-schauersnyder.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Elections", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Elections", "title": "Poll: Michigan governor race a tossup", "author": "Martha T.
