Doctors whirl around you, but you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening because everyone is speaking a foreign language.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to farmworker Angelina Diaz-Ramirez, 50, after she had a heart attack in a Monterey County green bean field in 2012.\n\nThe foreman of her work crew took her to the main road and put her in an ambulance, alone. Diaz-Ramirez is an immigrant from Mexico, and while there were Spanish-speaking staff, she was still isolated by a language barrier.\n\nThat\u2019s because Diaz-Ramirez, like a third of California farmworkers, speaks a language indigenous to southern Mexico. She doesn\u2019t understand Spanish. Her language, Triqui, is as different from Spanish as Navajo is from English.\n\nAt the hospital, without a Triqui interpreter, \u201cno one explained anything to me,\u201d said Diaz-Ramirez.\n\n\u201cI was scared, but I didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she said.\n\nAs anesthesia blotted out the operating room, Diaz-Ramirez had no idea a surgeon was about to cut open her chest to implant a pacemaker.\n\nMedical Interpreters Are Key\n\nDiaz-Ramirez\u2019s case highlights the importance of trained medical interpreters, researchers say.\n\n\u2018No one explained anything to me. I was scared but I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u2019 Angelina Diaz-Ramirez, Triqui farmworker who had heart surgery without an interpreter\n\nInterpreters are \u201cabsolutely necessary,\u201d said Alicia Fernandez, a medical interpretation expert at UC San Francisco, because quality health care and basic informed consent are nearly impossible without one.\n\nInterpreters \u201cenormously increase patient understanding and satisfaction,\u201d said Fernandez. She adds that interpreters also \u201cincrease physician satisfaction with the care they deliver.\u201d\n\nMedicine, she said, is not an antiseptic, scientific process. Doctors can\u2019t just scan, medicate and operate. Clear communication is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.\n\nThat\u2019s why using improvised sign language, or asking a child to interpret \u2014 just \u201cgetting by\u201d \u2014 is simply not good enough, said Fernandez.\n\n\u201cGetting by leads to mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd mistakes can be tragic, for both the patient and the physician.\u201d\n\nIndigenous Farmworkers Without Interpreters\n\nErica Gastelum, a pediatrician in Fresno, regrets that she rarely has access to an interpreter for her Mixteco-speaking patients. She says without one, \u201cYou\u2019re not able to provide equal care to all comers.\u201d\n\nShe remembers a 1-year-old boy with fatal congenital heart disease. Doctors had exhausted every option, and the family was gathered in the intensive care unit.\n\n\u201cThis is it, this is the moment where we\u2019re going to disconnect the tubes,\u201d said Gastelum. \u201cIt seemed like they understood. But in such a crucial moment like that, it would have been so much better to have a culturally sensitive, in-person interpreter.\u201d\n\nMost hospitals, including Gastelum\u2019s, have telephone services that should let doctors call up an interpreter for any language. In practice, though, the system doesn\u2019t always work for more unusual languages.\n\n\u201cWhen you try to use the phone interpreter line to get the indigenous speaker, you\u2019ll be on hold for like two hours,\u201d said Jasmine Walker, also a pediatrician in Fresno. \u201cThen when you get them, they don\u2019t actually speak the language that you need.\u201d\n\nSeth Holmes is a physician who lived and worked alongside Triqui migrant farmworkers for 10 years and wrote about his experiences in the book \u201cFresh Fruit, Broken Bodies.\u201d As the migrants followed crops up and down the West Coast, they often asked Holmes to accompany them to health clinics.\n\nIn dozens of clinics throughout California, Washington and Oregon, he said, \u201cI have never seen any Triqui person get a medical interpreter.\u201d\n\nHospitals may underestimate how many indigenous patients they have \u2014 and how many interpreters they need \u2014 because many providers assume all Mexicans speak Spanish. Some indigenous people may be afraid to call attention to themselves by asking for an interpreter because they are undocumented.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that they\u2019re entitled to someone who speaks their language,\u201d said Leoncio Vasquez, who has been training interpreters for 15 years.\n\nAny health care facility receiving public money has a legal obligation under both state and federal law to provide an interpreter to every patient who needs one. But only a few health care providers have made California\u2019s 120,000 indigenous farmworkers an explicit priority.\n\nInterpreting a Big Opportunity for Some Farmworkers\n\nBrigida Gonzalez, wearing a big \u201cQualified Interpreter\u201d badge, hustles around Natividad Medical Center in Salinas. It\u2019s a big building and she\u2019s needed all over.\n\nToday she\u2019s a professional employee at a big hospital. A year ago, she was picking strawberries nearby.\n\nIn the fields one day, another picker noticed Gonzalez spoke English \u2014 a rarity in agriculture \u2014 and suggested she look into Natividad\u2019s training program.\n\nStaff at Natividad were thrilled to hear from Gonzalez, \u201cbecause it was so hard to find someone who spoke English, Spanish and an indigenous language like Mixteco and Triqui,\u201d she said.\n\nGonzalez completed Natividad\u2019s six-month training program for indigenous interpreters, the first of its kind, and now works there part time.\n\nNot Just Hospitals\n\nThe need for trilingual interpreters like Gonzalez is growing, and it\u2019s not just hospitals.\n\nFour hours down the coast in Oxnard, all three school districts have hired Mixteco interpreters, and the police have one on contract.\n\nAltogether, there are about 20 Mixteco speakers making a good living with their language skills in Ventura County.\n\nThese opportunities are one reason why Argelia Zarate, the Oxnard school district\u2019s first full-time Mixteco interpreter, encourages students to practice their Mixteco so they don\u2019t lose it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to college, yet I have this job,\u201d said Zarate, \u201cbecause the community is growing so big that they don\u2019t need bilinguals\u2013 they need trilinguals.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment of interpreters and translators to grow by 46 percent between 2012 and 2022. Driving that demand is the 158 percent increase since 1980 in the number of people who speak a language other than English at home.\n\nNationally, the median hourly wage for interpreters is $25, compared with $9.09 for farm work.\n\nZarate says the better pay, stable hours and a chance to serve her community all make interpreting a big step up from field work.\n\n\u201cHere everybody is nice to you: they talk to you, appreciate what you do,\u201d Zarate said at the elementary school where she works. \u201cIn the fields, they treat you like you\u2019re nothing, a slave working for a little bit of money.\u201d\n\nThe Mixteco/Indigena Community Organizing Project has trained dozens of interpreters in Ventura County and has pressured public agencies to make use of them.\n\nToday, \u201cVentura County has invested in having better language access than most parts of California, and honestly most parts of Oaxaca,\u201d said Margaret Sawyer, the group\u2019s development director, referring to the Mexican state that many Mixteco migrants are from.\n\nBarriers Remain\n\nNot everyone trilingual can make the switch from farm work, though, because there are only a few full-time jobs.\n\nInstead, most hospitals rely on freelance part-time interpreters, who have a hard time making a living.\n\n\u201cThey will have you for two or three hours, then you\u2019re done for the whole day,\u201d said Israel Vasquez, a trilingual interpreter. \u201cYou can\u2019t really live off that.\u201d He eventually quit because he couldn\u2019t get enough hours.\n\n\u201cMaking a living specifically in health care interpreting right now is not really going to happen,\u201d said Don Schinske, executive director of the California Healthcare Interpreting Association.\n\nPart of the problem, Schinske said, is that even though federal law requires hospitals to provide interpreters, there is not a direct federal funding stream to pay for those services.\n\n\u201cYou get a lot of this sentiment from hospitals: \u2018Look, we\u2019re trying to get people services in their language, but it is a nicety, not a necessity,\u2019 \u201d said Schinske.\n\nThe indigenous interpretation programs at Natividad Medical Center are funded by private donations from agricultural businesses in the area, who have contributed $1.7 million since 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, a bill that would make it easier for hospitals to get federal money for medical interpreters has stalled in the California Legislature.\n\nWasted Resource\n\nFarmworker Angelina Diaz-Ramirez returned home after her surgery with a new pacemaker ticking in her chest \u2014 and a stack of printed instructions that she couldn\u2019t read.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, through an interpreter. \u201cI had strong pain. Should I call them back?\u201d\n\nDiaz-Ramirez didn\u2019t know who her cardiologist was, how to get an appointment or which medications to take. It\u2019s just the kind of confusion that a trained medical interpreter can prevent.\n\n\u201cI just felt very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nEvery week, indigenous people with these same questions visit Leoncio Vasquez, the interpreter trainer in Fresno.\n\nHe looks through their paperwork, pieces together a backstory, and helps them figure out what to do next \u2014 something that should have happened at the hospital or clinic, with one of the dozens of interpreters Vasquez has already trained.\n\nBut those interpreters \u201ccan\u2019t find jobs related to interpreting,\u201d said Vasquez. What do they do instead? \u201cSome go back to the fields to do farm work.\u201d\n\nTo Vasquez, it\u2019s a waste. He says that until more hospitals recognize these immigrants\u2019 valuable language skills, trained interpreters will stay in the fields, picking strawberries.\n\nThis piece was produced with support from the Institute for Justice and Journalism.\n\nCalifornia has the seventh-largest economy in the world, and immigrants have a long history in building that prosperity.
