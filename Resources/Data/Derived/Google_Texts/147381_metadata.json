These chemicals, known as \u201chormone disruptors,\u201d can interfere with estrogen and testosterone in the human body. The four chemicals were:\n\nphthalates \u2014 found in nail polish and fragrance\n\n\u2014 found in nail polish and fragrance parabens \u2014 a preservative used in cosmetics\n\n\u2014 a preservative used in cosmetics triclosan \u2014 an antibacterial agent\n\n\u2014 an antibacterial agent oxybenzone \u2014 a sunscreen agent\n\nIn the study, 100 Latina girls in the Salinas area swapped their cosmetics and other personal care products for new ones that did not include the four chemicals on their labels. Researchers took urine samples before and after the three-day test.\n\nOverall, the girls showed a 25-45 percent drop in the levels of the four chemicals.\n\nReducing Exposure\n\nLead author Kim Harley, associate director of UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Environmental Research and Children\u2019s Health, said this type of approach had never been studied before.\n\n\u201cWe hoped that if we changed to lower-chemical products, we would see significant reductions,\u201d Harley said. \u201cSo that was positive for us, that we found that you really could reduce your exposure to these chemicals through these changes.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.\n\nHarley said there\u2019s \u201ca lot we don\u2019t know yet\u201d about the effects of these chemicals in the human body, but some human research shows \u201cthey are associated with neurodevelopment problems in children, respiratory problems like asthma in children and obesity problems.\u201d\n\nThe reason the study was done on teenage girls is because they tend to use more personal care products than adult women and because adolescence may be a time of particular risk.\n\n\u201cAdolescence is a time of rapid growth and development,\u201d Harley said. \u201cIt\u2019s physical growth, reproductive development, brain development, all happening in adolescence.\u201d\n\nThere is no identified safe level of the four chemicals, Harley said.\n\nLimited FDA Authority\n\nWhile the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for regulating cosmetic products, their authority over these products is different than it is with drugs. Specifically, there is no \u201cpre-market\u201d approval. Instead, the FDA says on its website, \u201cCompanies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics have a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of their products.\u201d\n\nTeens Helped Design Study\n\nTo find products that were free of the four chemicals, the researchers referred to consumer resources, including the Environmental Working Group\u2019s SkinDeep Cosmetics Database.\n\nThe UC Berkeley and Clinica de Salud researchers worked in tandem with a team of teen members of the CHAMACOS Youth Community Council, a leadership training program for Salinas high school students. The student leaders helped design the study.\n\nMaritza Cardenas, a former council member, is an author of the study.\n\n\u201cLooking back, in such a short period of time\u201d using products that did not have the four chemicals in them, Cardenas said, \u201cand to realize that made such a big difference to hormone-disrupting levels in my body, was really amazing.\u201d\n\nCardenas worked on the study between her junior and senior year of high school. Now she is a junior majoring in molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley. She said she remains conscious of what she\u2019s buying, although \u201csome of the products that might be more natural or organic might be a little more expensive.\u201d\n\nUniversity researchers designing a study in coordination with teenagers is unusual. But the hope was to engage the students in public health education. The youth council included many teens from immigrant families.\n\n\u201cIt was a great way for us to cross cultural barriers and language barriers by first educating the teenagers and then having them go home and educate their families,\u201d Cardenas said.\n\nWhile research is thin and cannot show the health benefits of switching to low-chemical products, Harley said the natural levels of hormones in the human body act at very low level, \u201cat a parts per billion level.\u201d\n\nAny additional chemicals \u2014 in this case, from personal care products \u2014 \u201ccan act on very low levels also,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it seems like things we can do to reduce the levels of the hormone-disrupting chemicals \u2026 can potentially help our health in the long term.\u201d\n\nA recent poll showed that 70 percent of likely voters believe the government should be responsible for making sure chemicals in personal care products are safe. Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have introduced bipartisan legislation to give the FDA more authority over regulating personal care products.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UC Berkeley study finds that girls who switched for just three days to cosmetics labelled free of certain chemicals saw a significant drop.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Big Drop in Chemical Levels in Girls Who Switched Cosmetics\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/07\\/big-drop-in-chemical-levels-in-girls-who-switched-cosmetics\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-07 00:01:25\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-18 12:03:10\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":156734,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Cosmetics\",\"environmental health\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/iStock_000076751633_Large-e1457333828268.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "UC Berkeley study finds that girls who switched for just three days to cosmetics labelled free of certain chemicals saw a significant drop.", "title": "Big Drop in Chemical Levels in Girls Who Switched Cosmetics", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/07/big-drop-in-chemical-levels-in-girls-who-switched-cosmetics/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/iStock_000076751633_Large-1440x961.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "cosmetics,environmental health,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have introduced bipartisan legislation to give the FDA more authority over regulating personal care products.\n\u201cIt\u2019s physical growth, reproductive development, brain development, all happening in adolescence.\u201dThere is no identified safe level of the four chemicals, Harley said.\nOverall, the girls showed a 25-45 percent drop in the levels of the four chemicals.\nTeenage girls who switched cosmetics for just three days had a big drop in certain chemicals in their bodies, according to a new study from researchers at UC Berkeley and Clinica de Salud del Valle de Salinas.\nThe team looked at four chemicals used in cosmetics, shampoos and lotions."}
