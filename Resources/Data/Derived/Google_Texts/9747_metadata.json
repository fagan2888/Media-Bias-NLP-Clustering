The nation\u2019s first black president gets slammed by critics who accuse him of \u201cplaying the race card\u201d every time he acknowledges that race and racism still play a role in determining opportunities and outcomes.\n\nEugene Robinson writes a twice-a-week column on politics and culture, contributes to the PostPartisan blog, and hosts a weekly online chat with readers. In a three-decade career at The Post, Robinson has been city hall reporter, city editor, foreign correspondent in Buenos Aires and London, foreign editor, and assistant managing editor in charge of the paper\u2019s Style section.

My Brother\u2019s Keeper, which Obama announced Thursday, is the kind of targeted public-private initiative that might actually do some good, even without tons of new federal money thrown in.\n\nI suppose other critics might ask what took Obama so long. The president bristles at this line of questioning, pointing to the fact that his most ambitious achievements \u2014 including the Affordable Care Act \u2014 have their greatest impact among disadvantaged minorities.\n\nObama also understands that even if he had a Congress that would give him carte blanche, solving the problems that face young men of color would take many years of sustained effort.\n\n1 of 12 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Will 2014 be the year of progressives?

For progressives, a positive year ahead \u201cThe reemergence of a Democratic left will be one of the major stories of 2014,\u201d says Post columnist E.J. Dionne . \u201cThe widespread predictions that 2014 will witness only more of the same,\u201d adds fellow columnist Katrina vanden Heuvel , \u201cignore the growing reality that, outside the Beltway, people are beginning to stir and change is in the air.\u201d Jose Luis Magana/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nYou\u2019d have to fix broken schools and broken families. You\u2019d have to eliminate the racial bias in policing and the justice system that makes African American and Hispanic men far more likely to be stopped, arrested and sent to prison than whites who engage in similar illegal behavior. You\u2019d have to somehow bring enough commerce and industry back into hollowed-out neighborhoods to provide decent jobs. You\u2019d have to convince millions of young men that the odds are not stacked against them, despite copious evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhere do you even start? Down in the trenches.\n\n\u201cWe have credibility on these issues because we\u2019ve been working on the ground,\u201d La June Montgomery Tabron, president and chief executive of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, told me over lunch this week.\n\nKellogg is one of 10 major foundations that have agreed to join business leaders and the federal government in the Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative. Collectively, the foundations are already spending more than $150 million on programs aimed at young men of color. They are now pledging to invest at least an additional $200 million, coordinating their efforts to channel the funds toward approaches that deliver measurable results.\n\nThe other participating foundations deserve a shout-out: the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies, the California Endowment, the Ford Foundation, the John R. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Kapor Center for Social Impact, the Open Society Foundations, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Bloomberg Philanthropies. Thanks and kudos to all.\n\nAs the foundations identify factors that either create or destroy opportunity for young men of color, Obama has pledged to adjust federal policy accordingly. One example is the disparity in school suspensions. The Education Department recently issued new guidelines for enforcing \u201czero tolerance\u201d school disciplinary policies after studies found that minorities were more likely than whites to be suspended for infractions. Students who miss class time due to suspensions are less likely to graduate. And in the case of far too many young men of color, during the suspensions \u2014 when they\u2019re not in the relative sanctuary of school \u2014 they are more likely to find themselves in potentially dangerous situations.\n\nAs Montgomery Tabron reminded me, Trayvon Martin\u2019s home was in Miami, far from the central Florida town where he died. At the time of his fatal encounter with George Zimmerman, Martin was staying with his father for a few days because he had been suspended from school. Authorities had found what they said was marijuana residue in his backpack.\n\nNo one is arguing that young men of color are all angels. Obama has consistently preached the need for at-risk youths to take personal responsibility for their lives. Some commentators have criticized the president \u2014 unfairly, he feels \u2014 for \u201cblaming the victims\u201d rather than the societal forces that work against them.\n\nBut the reality is that if you\u2019re male and African American or Hispanic, you can\u2019t afford to make the same youthful mistakes that your white counterparts get to make. For example, blacks and whites are equally likely to smoke weed, according to surveys. But blacks are four times more likely to be arrested and jailed on marijuana charges.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the many reasons why this race-specific initiative is so badly needed. My Brother\u2019s Keeper isn\u2019t a solution. But it\u2019s a start.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
