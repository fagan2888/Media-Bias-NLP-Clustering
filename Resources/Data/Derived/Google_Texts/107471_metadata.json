Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) found herself in an awkward spot yesterday when a report surfaced quoting the congresswoman making some very controversial comments about women. At a forum on Republican \u201cmessaging,\u201d Ellmers reportedly said that men \u201ctalk about things on a much higher level,\u201d so GOP officials should \u201cbring it down to a woman\u2019s level.\u201d\n\nS oon after, the North Carolinian\u2019s office complained that Ellmers\u2019 comments had been \u201ctaken completely out of context\u201d by \u201ca liberal woman reporter.\u201d\n\nThe latter point was plainly untrue. The original report was published by the Washington Examiner, a conservative outlet, and written by Ashe Schow, a Republican and former Heritage Foundation staffer. Ellmers\u2019 office may not have liked Schow\u2019s report, but to dismiss her as \u201ca liberal woman reporter\u201d was wrong.\n\nBut what about the former? It seems like a knowable thing \u2013 either Ellmers was \u201ctaken completely out of context\u201d or she wasn\u2019t. With this in mind, Schow published a second report late yesterday with an audio clip and a lengthy transcript.\n\n\u201cEspecially moms, you know we balance so many different things, you know. Or school. Think about what many of you are doing, you know, you\u2019re trying to maintain that job, you know, you\u2019ve got to be moving up in your career. All these different things are coming in at the same time. \u201cMen do tend to talk about things on a much higher level. You know, one of the things that has always been one of my frustrations and I speak about this all the time \u2013 many of my male colleagues, when they go to the House floor, you know, they\u2019ve got some pie chart or graph behind them and they\u2019re talking about trillions of dollars and, you know, how the debt is awful and, you know, we all agree with that. \u201cBut by starting off that discussion that way, we\u2019ve already turned people away. Because it\u2019s like \u2018that doesn\u2019t affect my life, I don\u2019t understand how that affects my life.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom there, Ellmers said Republicans need to be \u201cengaging individuals on their level,\u201d adding that GOP men should \u201cbring it down to a woman\u2019s level.\u201d\n\nDoes this context make the quote less offensive? Well, it depends.\n\nEllmers\u2019 point seemed to be about accessibility. Men, she argued, speak on a \u201chigher\u201d level, meaning they\u2019re using rhetoric and charts that don\u2019t resonate with women. Republicans, the argument goes, should \u201cbring it down to a woman\u2019s level,\u201d which for Ellmers, apparently means a level in which policy ideas are presented in practical, less abstract terms.\n\nIdeally, she seemed to be arguing, Republicans should talk to women about issues in a way that helps make clear how they affect their daily lives.\n\nWhether or not one finds this persuasive is obviously a subjective question. Even taking the most charitable approach possible, it\u2019s hardly unreasonable to think plenty of women are persuaded by charts, and plenty of men might also want to hear about issues in less abstract terms.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Were Rep.
