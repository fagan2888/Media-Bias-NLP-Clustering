But when Ride passed away of pancreatic cancer in 2012, a seemingly tossed-off line at the end of her obituary said she\u2019d spent her last 27 years in a committed relationship with a woman named Tam O\u2019Shaughnessy.\n\nAlmost immediately Sherr felt dozens of questions percolating \u2013 and wanted to write Ride\u2019s life story to answer them. \u201cSally died on July 23, 2012, and just a day and a half later I had a book contract [to tell her story],\u201d said Sherr in an interview, adding she benefited from extensive interviews with Ride\u2019s family and friends as well as access to her private journals and other affects.\n\nSherr says that Ride\u2019s personal lifestyle was hardly the most notable thing about her, however. She shared the details, and the struggles, in a phone interview:\n\n\n\nSally Ride did not want to be a poster child for anything other than scientific excellence.\n\n\u201cClearly her sexual orientation was a big part of her life. But her legacy is about the things she chose to be upfront about \u2013 the things she chose to lead on. Those were: space exploration, women\u2019s issues, and sharing the joy of science and math with students.\n\nRelated: NASA Tops IT Grads\u2019 Wish Lists for Government Job Offers\n\n\u201cIf the details of her private life had come out when she was alive, she probably would have lost the little bit of privacy she had left. She did not want to be labeled. Until Sally Ride passed away, I think the words \u2018lesbian\u2019 and \u2018astronaut\u2019 had never been in the same sentence.\u201d\n\nRide was the right person at the right time to become the first American woman in space.\n\n\u201cAs a baby boomer, she was born with all the stuff that went along with that. Her father was a purple heart in World War II and a committed Republican; her mother was a savvy, smart, witty woman who proudly canceled out her husband\u2019s vote. They believed in education, in letting their daughters do what they wanted to do. Sally also benefited from two very important things in our society. One was the push for science after the Soviet Sputnik satellite flew in 1957 \u2013 suddenly there\u2019s a big emphasis on science. Then she benefited from all the doors that were opened by the women\u2019s movement. She never could have gotten to NASA had both these things not happened.\u201d\n\nShe played a critical role in drumming up students\u2019 interest in STEM fields.\n\n\u201cNeither of her parents had studied science, but when Sally announced she was interested in it, they said, \u2018Terrific, wonderful, go for it.\u2019 Once she got out into the world and became a leader in the space field, she began to see that girls were facing subtle discrimination or more overt discrimination \u2013 and wanted to address that.\n\nRelated: 20 Female Firsts: Janet Yellen and Other Groundbreaking American Women\n\n\u201cForming her own company was the answer, and today Sally Ride Science is still going strong, with science festivals, teaching training academies and more. She wanted girls not to be in a situation \u2013 which many were \u2013 where a teacher or somebody else says, \u2018Why are you studying that? That\u2019s not for girls\u2019 \u2013 the kind of subtle discrimination when someone says, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you like English or French better?\u201d\u2019\n\nShe wanted America to break free of the \u2018Einstein scientist\u2019 stereotype.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want little kids to have this image of the scientist as a lone male in a white lab coat like Einstein, working in a basement. She wanted kids to feel the joy of solving a science or math problem and apply that joy to solving the problems of this planet.\n\n\u201cThat is her biggest legacy. Certainly the fact that she was the first American woman in space \u2013 that her very bold role became a kind of ticket to success for women in many other fields \u2013 that will always be part of her story. But she went on to pay it forward.\u201d\n\nShe brought excitement and vibrancy to science \u2013 and knew her responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThere are girls involved in science firmly because of Sally Ride. NASA didn\u2019t just open its doors to women because they thought it was a good idea \u2013 there was political pressure for government agencies. She benefited from that, she knew, and her genius was seizing opportunity. She was set on being an academic, and suddenly there came an opportunity to be an astronaut \u2013 she turns on a dime and says, \u2018Hmm. I could do that.\u2019 Off she goes and makes space history.\n\nRelated: Want More Science Graduates? Here\u2019s How\n\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t get straight As in school. She had to work hard for her degrees, including her master\u2019s and her Ph.D. in physics from Stanford. She was so focused \u2013 her Stanford roommate said she could study through a whistling tea kettle.\u201d\n\nShe had plenty of money in the bank at the end of her life \u2013 which she\u2019d earned through sheer hard work.\n\n\u201cMost of her money came from the speeches she gave after she had flown. She saved this money in a bank account \u2013 didn\u2019t live high on the hog. She and Tam had a wonderful house but not over the top. They lived a modest life. She did make some money from being on boards. But this was in addition to her salary as a professor [at the University of California, San Diego], which was not very much, and her work on many government agencies, most of which were not paid. She did an awful lot of giveback. She never cashed in to pitch products \u2013 never endorsed cereals or anything like that.\n\n\u201cHer speeches were a source of pride for her, but for an introvert, making speeches did not come easy to her, even after years in the public eye. I saw her extensive notes, how she reworked them over and over again. Still, she became the most famous woman on the planet thanks to a government agency, she flew at taxpayer expense \u2013 and she absolutely fulfilled her role of giving back as a result of that. It took a lot from her \u2013 but she did it because she knew it was her job. That was Sally.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sally Ride died young, at age 61 \u2013 but we\u2019re still reaping the benefits of her dedicat", "title": "How Sally Ride\u2019s Flying Lessons Help Women Reach for the Stars", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/21/How-Sally-Ride-s-Flying-Lessons-Help-Women-Reach-Stars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12182013_Sally_Ride%20%28NASA%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/21/How-Sally-Ride-s-Flying-Lessons-Help-Women-Reach-Stars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12182013_Sally_Ride%20%28NASA%29.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sally Ride died young, at age 61 \u2013 but we\u2019re still reaping the benefits of her dedicat", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb87\"", "article_summary": "Related: 20 Female Firsts: Janet Yellen and Other Groundbreaking American Women\u201cForming her own company was the answer, and today Sally Ride Science is still going strong, with science festivals, teaching training academies and more.\n\u201cThere are girls involved in science firmly because of Sally Ride.\nAlmost immediately Sherr felt dozens of questions percolating \u2013 and wanted to write Ride\u2019s life story to answer them.\nBut her legacy is about the things she chose to be upfront about \u2013 the things she chose to lead on.\nAn engaging new book, Sally Ride: America\u2019s First Woman in Space, now shows that Ride fought and won other important battles that were being waged so quietly, we barely knew they existed."}
