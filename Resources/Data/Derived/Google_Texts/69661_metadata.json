Both stars are hoping for that breakthrough score this weekend at Amalie Arena, where the Lightning or the Blackhawks will end the 2-2 series tie and move within one win of the NHL title.\n\nThe Lightning and the Blackhawks realize the enormous stakes for Game 5 in a series that still hasn\u2019t featured a two-goal lead for either team. They\u2019re also attempting to direct that excitement into motivation instead of intimidation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get caught up in the moment,\u201d Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. \u201cYou have to embrace where we are.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s Duncan Keith and Tampa Bay\u2019s Victor Hedman have embraced this moment better than anyone. Stamkos, Kane and the Final\u2019s quiet forwards have been upstaged by these two star defensemen, who are turning in dominant playoff performances.\n\nIn a postseason missing a breakout offensive performance or a dominant goaltending run, Keith and Hedman are the co-favorites to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs\u2019 MVP. Barring a spectacular pile of goals from a forward, the series winner seems likely to feature the first defenseman to claim the Conn Smythe since the Anaheim Ducks\u2019 Scott Niedermayer in 2007.\n\nKeith and Hedman are No. 1 and No. 2 in the NHL in postseason plus-minus ratings and total minutes. Keith is tied for the lead in playoff assists with 18 during his extended ice time, while Hedman has set franchise playoff records for assists and points by a defenseman.\n\nAlthough they play the game differently, they\u2019re filling a similar do-everything role for their respective teams.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, yeah, (Hedman) is a guy like Duncan,\u201d Chicago captain Jonathan Toews said. \u201cHe makes, more times than not, the players he\u2019s out there with better. He\u2019s a catalyst when he\u2019s in his own zone or in the offensive zone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Duncan Keith, Victor Hedman stealing the show in Stanley Cup Final", "title": "Duncan Keith, Victor Hedman stealing the show in Stanley Cup Final", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/12/duncan-keith-victor-hedman-stealing-the-show-in-stanley-cup-final/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150612__20150613_B8_SP13HKNSTANLEYp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150612__20150613_B8_SP13HKNSTANLEYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-12T19:14:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T09:09:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chicago\u2019s Patrick Kane feels much the same way, both about his own no-goal Final and the Blackhawks\u2019 game in general.\n\u201cYou have to embrace where we are.\u201dChicago\u2019s Duncan Keith and Tampa Bay\u2019s Victor Hedman have embraced this moment better than anyone.\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, yeah, (Hedman) is a guy like Duncan,\u201d Chicago captain Jonathan Toews said.\nKeith and Hedman are No.\n\u201cKeep playing the game the right way, and eventually you\u2019re going to get rewarded,\u201d Stamkos said Friday."}
