Maybe three, if you count the one he pressured a girlfriend\u2014who happened to be his patient\u2014to get. Pulling out a gun during an argument with his first wife. Prescribing pills to another patient while they dated. Getting reprimanded by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners for dallying with patients, an ethics violation.\n\nVoters in Tennessee\u2019s 4th Congressional District had plenty of reasons not to vote for incumbent Scott DesJarlais last week. The Tea Party Republican might have snuck under the radar to win a first term in 2010 and held back an onslaught of negative publicity long enough to capture a second one in 2012, but a third time? When conservative voters in this district, which stretches from the edges of Chattanooga to Nashville, went to the polls, they were widely expected to run off a pro-life, family-values conservative who had shown in divorce court that he could bend those beliefs in his own life. If this was supposed to be a throw-the-bums-out kind of year in Congress, then DesJarlais was the ultimate bum, and he ought to have joined Ralph Hall, Kerry Bentivolio and Eric Cantor as the only incumbent members of Congress to lose thus far.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut clearly, the voters thought otherwise. If current results hold\u2014and so far, there\u2019s no reason to believe they won\u2019t\u2014DesJarlais appears to have captured the Republican nomination again by a mere 37 votes. All that would stand in his way to a third term is accountant Lenda Sherrell, the Democratic nominee in the heavily Republican district.\n\nAs a reporter who has followed DesJarlais these past 21 months, I have watched with a mixture of amazement and respect as he\u2014running for re-election for the first time since it surfaced that his personal life could have been a storyline from \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and written off by political handicappers in both Tennessee and Washington\u2014has managed to mount a comeback with little money or political support. In a year in which incumbents have beaten back challengers nationwide, a DesJarlais win could very well be the most extraordinary feat of them all, putting him alongside the likes of Ohio\u2019s notorious James Traficant, who served nearly 20 years despite charges of tax-evasion, taking bribes from mobsters and forcing his aides to clean horse stalls on his farm, in the ranks of some the most improbable congressional hangers-on of all time.\n\nSo how did DesJarlais do it?\n\nCharisma certainly wasn\u2019t a factor. With a personality that could be described, generously, as taciturn, DesJarlais lights up few rooms. He has a knack for the bad photograph, frequently scowling in a way that I\u2019ve been told is \u201cterrifying.\u201d But DesJarlais, a physician, is nothing if not smart, with an eager student\u2019s approach to lawmaking and a tea partier\u2019s zeal for punching holes in the Obama administration\u2019s agenda. DesJarlais was one of the first congressmen to argue that the Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t authorize the Internal Revenue Service to extend tax credits or impose penalties in states that hadn\u2019t set up their own health insurance exchanges. The seemingly arcane point has since been upheld by a D.C. court, a ruling that some believe ( and others hope) could be used to gut the law.\n\nTo his supporters, DesJarlais embodies the ideal of the citizen-legislator. He had never run for office before 2009, when in the conservative backlash that followed Obama\u2019s election he first decided to try for Congress. He emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican nomination, and it was only in the fall of 2010 that voters first got a hint that he had a salacious past. Allegations surfaced that DesJarlais had shown a pattern of erratic and potentially abusive behavior, including dry-firing an unloaded gun at a bedroom door while his ex-wife huddled inside and holding a pistol in his mouth for as long as three hours, all detailed in the 2001 record of his divorce. Most voters wrote off the claims, viewing them as a desperate attempt by Democratic Rep. Lincoln Davis to turn back the tea party tide.\n\nDesJarlais was better prepared the next time around. In the fall of 2012, rumors began to circulate that he had engaged in a series of liaisons\u2014with co-workers and patients\u2014that had also been documented in his divorce file. (These eventually would form the core of the ethics complaint filed against him.) The file showed DesJarlais had supported two abortions by his ex-wife, one for \u201ctherapeutic reasons\u201d and another because \u201cthings were not going well,\u201d and had pressured a patient he\u2019d been seeing to travel to Georgia for one. (DesJarlais claims he was trying to get her to admit she wasn\u2019t really pregnant.) DesJarlais\u2019 lawyers fought the file\u2019s release, even though it was a public record. The day before the election, they and Democratic attorneys still were arguing in a Chattanooga courtroom over how fast the documents could be transcribed. DesJarlais lost the case, but the ruling came too late for the voters. Tennesseans didn\u2019t learn the full extent of his behavior until after their ballots had been cast.\n\nThat was supposed to be it for DesJarlais. That winter, Republican leaders in Tennessee began to hint or call outright for DesJarlais\u2019 resignation. \u201cI think the congressman\u2019s decision is: Can I effectively represent the people who elected me?\u201d Gov. Bill Haslam said. Many threw their support behind state Sen. Jim Tracy, an affable former high school coach and four-term state lawmaker who officially declared his candidacy for Congress just two months after DesJarlais\u2019 divorce file was released. \u201cI was hoping he would do the right thing and resign,\u201d said Tracy, who had lost a winnable bid for Congress by a close margin back in 2010. But this was a different category altogether.
