He invited them to his office in Seminole where they shared stories of their experiences within the VA health care system. The veterans were offered immediate assistance from Jolly\u2019s staff, VA representatives and volunteers from veteran service organizations.\n\nAnd Jolly, who serves on the House Veteran's Affairs Committee, promised to take their stories back to Washington with the aim of improving the VA system.\n\nYet, a survey of those who stopped by Jolly\u2019s office showed that 68 percent rated their VA care from excellent to adequate.\n\nBut there were plenty of veterans who were not so pleased. Among them, two veterans looking for help \u2013 not for themselves \u2013 but for other their fellow veterans.\n\nNavy veteran Robert Barrie wore his blue polo-shirt inscribed with Tin Can Sailor \u2013 USS NOA. He\u2019s president of the Navy Destroyer USS NOA reunion group that has more than 300 members.\n\n\u201cWe served in Vietnam in 1969,\u201d Barrie told Jolly. \u201cWe were in a place called Qui Nhon Harbor. We are trying to get the ship qualified for Agent Orange.\u201d\n\nThe congressman watched as Barrie opened a notebook filled with letters, photos and the ship\u2019s deck log to prove his point. They are documents, Barrie said, that will qualify his crewmates for VA coverage of 15 diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure.\n\nBarrie complained the VA has repeatedly misplaced the documents and have yet to qualify the USS NOA as a \u201cbrown water\u201d ship that cruised along the Vietnam coast and up the rivers exposing crews to Agent Orange spraying.\n\n\u201cHave you ever used a congressional inquiry?\u201d Jolly asked.\n\n\u201cNo. We\u2019ve been submitting these things into the VA,\u201d Barrie responded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the inquiry done in the next three to four weeks,\u201d Jolly said.\n\nHe promised to write a letter about the USS NOA directly to Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson in the next two week and ask that he pay specific attention to the problem.\n\nAlso armed with documents, Vietnam veteran Al Kelly handed Jolly two well-worn pieces of paper \u2013 a discharge form and a citation for the Silver Star.\n\nIt was not Kelly but his brother-in-law recommended for a Silver Star while in the infantry in Vietnam. He provided ground fire during an attack, while severely wounded, so his entire company could move from an open rice paddy to the cover of the woods.\n\n\u201cForty-five years of untreated PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). He ended up in prison. He did 23 calendar years locked up,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd when he got out, he applied for his assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when he attempted to receive care after he got out what was the experience?\u201d Jolly asked.\n\nThere was no response, no letter, no treatment, his brother-in-law never made it into the system.\n\nSix months lapsed and Kelly\u2019s brother-in-law had an incident with a girlfriend, was charged with a parole violation and put back in prison.\n\nAll Kelly wants is to make certain his brother-in-law gets treatment for his PTSD as soon as he is released from prison. And again, Jolly promised to follow up.\n\nKelly and Barrie are no different than tens of thousands of veterans across the country \u2013 veterans watching after their fellow veterans \u2013 determined to get them the best of care.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/jolly-takes-veterans-va-stories-dc", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201406/323987845.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Jolly Takes Veterans' VA Stories to DC"}, "org_id": 671, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "wordCount": 621, "dc": {"title": "Jolly Takes Veterans&#039; VA Stories to DC"}, "nid": 6873, "datePublished": "2014-06-20", "story_id": 323935638, "keywords": "PTSD, VA Healthcare", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Yet, a survey of those who stopped by Jolly\u2019s office showed that 68 percent rated their VA care from excellent to adequate.\nAnd Jolly, who serves on the House Veteran's Affairs Committee, promised to take their stories back to Washington with the aim of improving the VA system.\nKelly and Barrie are no different than tens of thousands of veterans across the country \u2013 veterans watching after their fellow veterans \u2013 determined to get them the best of care.\nHe\u2019s president of the Navy Destroyer USS NOA reunion group that has more than 300 members.\nWe\u2019ve been submitting these things into the VA,\u201d Barrie responded."}
