Each day, we\u2019re looking at where the leading candidates for governor stand on a specific issue.\n\nToday, it\u2019s Medicaid and whether the state can draw down $100 billion from Washington, even though it has chosen not to expand the federal program.\n\nWendy Davis, a Democrat, and Greg Abbott, a Republican, have very different stances on how to handle Medicaid.\n\nThe KERA Radio story.\n\nHere\u2019s the background on that $100 billion. While the majority of governors chose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Texas Gov. Rick Perry has joined a group of 24 who have repeatedly refused.\n\nUnder the terms of the expansion, 1.5 million Texans who don\u2019t have insurance would become eligible for Medicaid. For the first three years, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the program\u2019s health care costs. After that, the state would have to contribute 10 percent.\n\nPerry says that 10 percent would break the bank in Texas.\n\nAnd Abbott agrees.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is bankrupt Texas by imposing on Texas the overwhelming Obamacare disaster,\u2019 Abbott said.\n\nDuring KERA\u2019s televised gubernatorial debate on Sept. 30, Abbott said accepting $100 billion in federal funds would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cIf Texas participates, we are making a deal with a federal government that is $18 trillion in debt,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThat is a bargain I\u2019m not willing to make.\u201d\n\nAbbott proposed Texas get its fair share by seeking a block grant to reform Medicaid, but even Republicans in the state have said Washington won\u2019t agree.\n\nDavis has repeatedly laid out her argument to accept the billions to expand Medicaid for the poor.\n\n\u201cWhat I will do is work with my legislature, Republicans and Democrats alike, who know this is the right thing to do for their communities, who aren\u2019t afraid of being labeled as partisans,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019ll work with them to bring their tax dollars, our community tax dollars back to Texas and to keep property taxes from increasing.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, chambers of commerce and hospitals have been making the business case to expand Medicaid and accept the money.\n\n\u201cBy not having that coverage, you have an unhealthy workforce,\u201d said Steve Love, president of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council. He says hospitals in the state provide more than $5 billion each year in uncompensated health care. In addition, people who don\u2019t have insurance aren\u2019t as productive.\n\n\u201cThose are dollars that also impact the business and the industry and would be much better for the overall economy, obviously, if we had a healthier workforce,\u201d Love said.\n\nStill, Love admits the Medicaid system isn\u2019t perfect.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and correct what\u2019s wrong in the Medicaid system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can overhaul it and enhance it and change it at the same time. And there\u2019s no reason the state working collaboratively together can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nA bipartisan group of state lawmakers in Texas say they\u2019re going to give Medicaid reform another try in January.\n\nLearn more about the Five Days in October series here -- there are stories, and radio and TV pieces, too.", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "This week, KERA, The Dallas Morning News and KXAS-TV (NBC 5) are producing a series of coordinated reports we\u2019re calling Five Days in October.
