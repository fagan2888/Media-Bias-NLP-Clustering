John Barrow has decided to sell his Augusta home. Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo confirmed Monday that\n\nBarrow planned to move back to Athens, where Barrow\u2019s children live and he still has a family home. Barrow moved to Augusta two years ago to stay within the shifting boundaries of his district.\n\nThe Democratic congressman was defeated by Republican challenger Rick Allen in the midterm elections last Tuesday after serving five terms in eastern Georgia\u2019s 12th District. By the weekend, a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign had been posted outside Barrow\u2019s house in Augusta.\n\n\u201cHe always made a commitment, after the lines kept being redrawn, to always live in the district,\u201d Carbo said. \u201cIt kept him away from his family for an extended period of time. He\u2019s decided to relocate to his hometown to be closer to his kids and his family.\u201d\n\nAthens was part of the 12th District in 2004 when Barrow, a longtime Athens-Clarke County commissioner, was first elected to Congress. During his decade in Washington, Barrow ended up moving twice after Republican state lawmakers redrew his district to carve out his home address. Barrow bought a house in Savannah in 2006, then sold it to move to Augusta in early 2012. By then the district had been retooled to favor Republicans.\n\nThis year, Barrow tried to beat the odds as he did two years ago by running as an independent who openly disagreed with fellow Democrats on issues such as health care, the environment and gun control. Allen, an Augusta construction company owner, won a decisive 55 percent of the vote with a campaign that portrayed Barrow was two-faced rather than independent.\n\nBarrow was among 10 Democratic incumbents who lost their House seats in the election. He was also the last white Democratic congressman from the Deep South states of Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, RUSS BYNUM", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "SAVANNAH | John Barrow is coming home to Athens. \nDays after losing his seat in the U.S. House, Rep.
