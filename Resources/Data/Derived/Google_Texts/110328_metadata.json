One GOP Senate challenger, vying against veteran Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), has gone as far as claiming that the IRS is training an army of \"Brown Shirts\" to enforce Obamacare\u2014with assault weapons no less.\n\nSouth Carolina state Sen. Lee Bright argued in a speech last August that we should \"get rid of that IRS.\" (See the video above). He also discussed comments from US Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, who toured a federal law enforcement facility last spring and reported seeing IRS agents training with the semi-automatic AR-15 rifles. Bright added:\n\nIf that\u2019s true\u2026and they're doing assault-weapon training, the Brown Shirts are next because that's the enforcement for Obamacare, is the IRS. If you don't have an IRS, you don't have Obamacare. That's the mechanism that's controlling our lives for far too long.\n\nIn fact, the armed agents Duncan saw probably belonged to a special criminal investigation division, which sometimes goes after drug traffickers and money launderers. At the time, according to Politico, Duncan questioned whether \"that level of firepower is appropriate when they could coordinate operations with other agencies, like the FBI, especially in a time of austerity.\" That's a far cry from likening IRS agents to Nazi storm troopers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "This GOP Sentate candidate thinks so.", "title": "Is the IRS building an army of \"Brown Shirts\" to enforce Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/01/irs-training-army-brown-shirts-assualt-weapons-enforce-obamacare", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/bright_425_320.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/01/irs-training-army-brown-shirts-assualt-weapons-enforce-obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/bright_425_320.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/bright_425_320.jpg"}, "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is the IRS building an army of \"Brown Shirts\" to enforce Obamacare?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "The+Right", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28e6\"", "article_summary": "Bright added:If that\u2019s true\u2026and they're doing assault-weapon training, the Brown Shirts are next because that's the enforcement for Obamacare, is the IRS.\nIn fact, the armed agents Duncan saw probably belonged to a special criminal investigation division, which sometimes goes after drug traffickers and money launderers.\nOne GOP Senate challenger, vying against veteran Sen.
