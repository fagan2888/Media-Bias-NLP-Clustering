With the New Year upon us, Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead. Today, we caught up with Wol Kolade, managing partner of Living Bridge (formerly ISIS Equity Partners).

What surprised you the most about 2014?

Ending 2014 with a new name! Given events in Syria and Iraq, we took the decision to rebrand. Living Bridge is derived from the craftsmanship practiced by villagers in India to train the roots of trees over rivers, creating quite remarkable structures that last for centuries. We felt that it offered a perfect analogy for what we aspire to achieve with the businesses we back.

What do you think will be the biggest challenge for your part of the industry in 2015?

The appetite to provide leverage in the lower midmarket recovered dramatically from the back end of 2013 onwards. With the increased competitive pressure arising from the proliferation of debt funds (and their like), the temptation to stretch structures, particularly in minority deals, will, I suspect, lead to more sponsorless deals.

In 10 words or less: What will be the big theme of 2015?

Chances of a hung U.K. parliament; navigating ill-thought-through initiatives.
