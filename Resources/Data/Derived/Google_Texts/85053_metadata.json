Skipping only the \u201cbegats,\u201d he naturally recited Scripture: the I\u2019m-not-worthy litany of the eminences who\u2019d preceded him, from Steve Allen (Noah?) to that gooey tower of babble, Jay Leno. He got misty-eyed; he saluted his parents. He looked like he\u2019d never worn a grown-up suit before in his life.\n\nHe had both a rabbi (Will Smith) and a cantor (Bono). He even had a stable of high-powered, um, family friends\u2014Sarah Jessica Parker, Mike Tyson, Robert de Niro, Rudolph Giuliani and so on\u2014who queued up to shower him with gifts and congrats. About all that was missing was Fallon declaring, \u201cTonight I am a host\u201d as Mom and Dad wept.\n\nOrnately sentimental exits are nothing new on late-night TV. But this was Fallon\u2019s hello, not his goodbye\u2014and kind of a peculiar one, considering that he\u2019s got to win over a new audience without any prior investment in The Jimmy Fallon Story. For most of the hour, Jimmy\u2019s translation to a higher plane of television being was the show\u2019s only topic, leaving me grateful for the fleeting moments when he was actually doing his job\u2014that is, treating his guests as guests, not trophies\u2014instead of basking in having won it.\n\nOverall, Fallon\u2019s first Tonight Show may have been the most bungled roll-out since Obamacare. Among other things, a dude who gets this blubbery about his own promotion doesn\u2019t exactly radiate authority\u2014and authority is a pretty vital thing to establish when you take over this slot, right? Instead, Fallon\u2019s worst tics when he\u2019s in his effusive mode\u2014the eager chortles, the vague sense of conversational continuity, the this-little-piggie-went-to-market blinks that make him look as if he\u2019s trying to read an eye chart from a speedboat\u2014were all in overdrive.\n\nEven the scripted bits\u2014you know, the stuff he\u2019s normally clever at\u2014kept hitting clunkers. Given the antigay pall that hangs over the Sochi Games, jokes like naming snowboarder Chas Guldemond the athlete \u201cmost likely to host an interior design show on HGTV\u201d were bafflingly tin-eared, if not worse. Even Fallon and Smith\u2019s showpiece \u201cThe Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing\u201d routine was a dud compared to the charm of Michelle Obama shaking some booty in \u201cThe Evolution of Mom Dancing\u201d back in Late Night days, not least because she\u2019d been memorably sunny about playing along and Smith looked like he\u2019d rather be unclogging a drainpipe.\n\nThe big \u201cget,\u201d though, was U2. And did they ever stink, at least in the rooftop performance blatantly meant to recall the Beatles\u2019 valedictory live show in Let It Be. Just how that mythic moment was relevant to Fallon\u2019s debut was a mystery\u2014\u201cThey said goodbye, and I say hello\u201d?\u2014but he clearly borrows glory where he can, and Bono is hardly immune to flattery. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t tell whether \u201cInvisible\u201d just isn\u2019t much of a song or if it was being rendered badly. Realizing I didn\u2019t care either way cleared things right up, however.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Fallon\u2019s second night was a considerable improvement. He did have to get down to business sooner or later, after all. Even if he was still jittery enough to blurt out an apology for asking Jerry Seinfeld a \u201cboring\u201d question, that was disarming instead of grating. Besides, Seinfeld himself is such an old pro these days\u2014his indolence or affected indolence long gone, he\u2019s turned into boomers\u2019 answer to Henny Youngman\u2014that he cut right through the fuzziness by assuming that he and Fallon were two guys with a job to do, one he\u2019s far more expert by now at than his host may ever be.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a goy\u2019s bar mitzvah would be like, Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Tonight Show debut on Monday probably cured you.
