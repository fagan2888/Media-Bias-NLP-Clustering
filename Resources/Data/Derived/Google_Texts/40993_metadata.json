While shopping will remain imperfect, \u201cit\u2019s night and day from last year,\u201d he said.\n\nEnrollment for 2015 health plans sold under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act begins Nov. 15. Obama administration officials are trying to avoid a repeat of last October, when the enrollment website collapsed on its first day and signing up was all but impossible until the completion of a two-month repair effort. The faulty start damaged President Barack Obama\u2019s credibility, forced a \u201ctech surge\u201d of private experts to fix the website, sparked congressional probes and led to the shake-up of the program\u2019s management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real priority for us to create raving fans,\u201d Counihan said. \u201cWe want our service experience to be highly satisfying. We think the best way we can attract new enrollment is by satisfying the customers we already have.\u201d\n\nAs an example of upgrades this year, people will be able to \u201cwindow shop\u201d for plans beginning about a week before enrollment opens, Counihan said. Customers new to the system will enjoy a shorter and simpler registration process.\n\nNo Comparison Shopping\n\nOn the other hand, customers still won\u2019t be able to easily compare doctors, hospitals and drugs covered by different plans using the federal website, he said. They\u2019ll have to continue to call insurers or visit their corporate sites to check coverage, steps that slow enrollment.\n\nRepublicans say Americans are likely to remain frustrated with healthcare.gov. Were it a private company, \u201cshareholders would be suing,\u201d said Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has investigated the site\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cBut in this administration, there\u2019s no high-level accountability and the focus remains fixated on signing up as many Americans as possible regardless of the cost, the security risks, or the impact on the quality of health care for all Americans,\u201d he said in an e-mail from a spokeswoman last week.\n\nCounihan, who formerly led Connecticut\u2019s state-run health insurance marketplace, Access Health CT, is part of a management makeover for the $2.1 billion federal system directed by President Barack Obama\u2019s new health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n\nNew Managers\n\nAlong with Counihan, Burwell hired Andy Slavitt, the former UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive who led last year\u2019s repair effort, as principal deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees healthcare.gov. Burwell brought on Leslie Dach, a former spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and a close friend, to handle media and other public communications.\n\nAn executive with Accenture Plc, Tim Hughey, serves as \u201cchief technology officer\u201d for healthcare.gov, reporting to Counihan. Accenture was hired in January to replace CGI Group Inc. as the main contractor for the enrollment site.\n\nBurwell declined to offer assurances that development of the site is on schedule in a briefing with reporters last week. Counihan, though, was more optimistic. About 25 major insurers have been testing the site\u2019s performance since last week and have been pleased, he said. Full testing with all insurers will begin Oct. 7, he said.\n\nTesting Flaws\n\nHealthcare.gov underwent only limited testing last year before it opened on Oct. 1, which contributed to its failure, U.S. officials have said. Spokesmen for UnitedHealth, WellPoint Inc. and Aetna Inc., the three largest for-profit insurers, weren\u2019t able to immediately comment on healthcare.gov\u2019s testing.\n\n\u201cThings are tracking as we would want them to track,\u201d Counihan said. \u201cRight now I would say we are doing well. I think consumers are going to be pleased, and we will be off and running.\u201d\n\nCounihan said he reviews the site\u2019s performance with staff members and contractors twice a day on weekdays and once on weekends, and meets with Burwell multiple times a week.\n\n\u201cClearly people want to kick the tires, test and verify,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 7.3 million people had paid and were enrolled in health plans sold through the Obamacare insurance exchanges as of Aug. 15, the administration said. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 13 million will have coverage after the second year of the program.\n\nCounihan said he had no in-house enrollment target.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what success is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus is very much on keeping who we have and keeping them happy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-02/raving-fans-for-obamacare-is-goal-of-program-s-new-ceo", "title": "Raving Fans for Obamacare Is Goal of Program\u2019s New CEO", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "description": "Kevin Counihan, the new chief executive officer of healthcare.gov, expects Obamacare will become so user-friendly that \u201craving fans\u201d will emerge for the U.S. health insurance enrollment program."}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Barack H Obama,Health", "news_keywords": "Barack H Obama,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-02/raving-fans-for-obamacare-is-goal-of-program-s-new-ceo", "parsely-title": "Raving Fans for Obamacare Is Goal of Program\u2019s New CEO", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-02T18:17:08.636Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Kevin Counihan, the new chief executive officer of healthcare.gov, expects Obamacare will become so user-friendly that \u201craving fans\u201d will emerge for the U.S. health insurance enrollment program.", "parsely-tags": "Barack H Obama,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-10-02T18:17:08.636Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-02/raving-fans-for-obamacare-is-goal-of-program-s-new-ceo", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Kevin Counihan, the new chief executive officer of healthcare.gov, expects Obamacare will become so user-friendly that \u201craving fans\u201d will emerge for the U.S. health insurance enrollment program.", "title": "Raving Fans for Obamacare Is Goal of Program\u2019s New CEO"}, "fb": {"status": "Kevin Counihan, the new chief executive officer of healthcare.gov, expects Obamacare will become so user-friendly that \u201craving fans\u201d will emerge for the U.S. health insurance enrollment program."}, "parsely-post-id": "NCTRUC6K50Y401", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0fb\"", "article_summary": "About 7.3 million people had paid and were enrolled in health plans sold through the Obamacare insurance exchanges as of Aug. 15, the administration said.\nEnrollment for 2015 health plans sold under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act begins Nov. 15.\nKevin Counihan, the new chief executive officer of healthcare.gov, expects Obamacare will become so user-friendly that \u201craving fans\u201d will emerge for the U.S. health insurance enrollment program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real priority for us to create raving fans,\u201d Counihan said.\nAbout 25 major insurers have been testing the site\u2019s performance since last week and have been pleased, he said."}
