Here are the bonuses into these troubled facilities (2011-2013): 1. Edward Hines, JR Hospital, Cook County, IL ($4.1356 million)\n\n2. Malcolm Randall VA Medical Center, Gainesville, FL ($575,400)\n\n3. New Mexico VA Health Care System Albuquerque, NM ($2.646 million)\n\n4. Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Home, Biloxi, MS ($247,103)\n\n5. Miami VA Healthcare System Miami, FL ($334,987)\n\n6. Fort Collins Outpatient Clinic, Fort Collins, CO ($4,150)\n\n7. Phoenix VA Health Care System Home, Phoenix, AZ ($843,000) TOTAL: 12,549 bonuses for $8.787 million (2011-2013)\n\nHere\u2019s the report itself. The list of facilities now under investigation has ballooned to 26 and counting, so these estimates likely do little more than scratch the surface. And they only span two years. Remember, bonuses aren\u2019t a mere sideshow in this scandal, as several media outlets have reported that some of the VA administrators who cooked the books on wait times were motivated by avarice. Their maneuvers were, in part, a job- and bonus-protection scheme \u2014 which is why Senate Democrats\u2019 endorsement of inaction, as Ed put it earlier, is so galling. Marco Rubio\u2019s bill would have empowered the \u201cmad as hell\u201d VA secretary with greater leeway to fire bureaucrats who intentionally skirt rules and game the system to conceal their failures. The legislation sailed through the House earlier this week in a lopsided, bipartisan 390-33 vote. Harry Reid and company can\u2019t be bothered to even take it up. Here\u2019s Rubio tangling with Senate Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Bernie Sanders over the issue, via Noah Rothman (click image to watch):\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 think that any of us want to go home for the Memorial Day recess and when we\u2019re asked \u2018What are you doing on this issue,\u2019 our answer is, \u2018Well, in about 15 days we\u2019re going to have a hearing,\u201d Rubio concluded.\n\nABC News\u2019 Michael Calderone wonders if Democrats\u2019 tenuous support for Sec. Shinseki is on the brink of expiring:\n\nDEMOCRATS DRIP, DRIP, DRIP: Yesterday Kentucky U.S. Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes called for Shinseki\u2019s resignation, saying in a statement: \u201cWe owe a solemn obligation to our veterans, and our government defaulted on that contract. I don\u2019t see how that breach of trust with our veterans can be repaired if the current leadership stays in place.\u201d So did Republican-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, a candidate for governor of Florida: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know precisely what happened here, we do know that there must be accountability and confidence in leadership in order to get to the truth and provide veterans the medical care they\u2019ve earned and deserve. That confidence is gone. I think it would be best if the Secretary stepped down and allowed others to get the VA fixed once and for all.\u201d\n\nCalderone also notes that Grimes won\u2019t give a straightforward answer to a basic question on Obamacare, prompting Rick Klein to marvel at how Democratic candidates continue to flub their answers. I\u2019ll leave you with this CNN clip, which was flagged by my Townhall colleague Greg Hengler. Over to you, VA whistleblower:\n\nSix to ten months, \u201cor longer.\u201d A disgrace. Oh, and one more thing: Guess who touted the VA as a triumph of government-run healthcare during the Obamacare debate of 2009 and 2010?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Disgrace.", "title": "Report: $8.8 million in taxpayer-funded bonuses at seven accused VA facilities since 2011", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/23/report-8-8-million-in-taxpayer-funded-bonuses-at-seven-accused-va-facilities-since-2011/", "image": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5509/14065087077_8899bce254.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "ObamaCare, VA scandal, veterans affairs,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-23T16:41:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T15:44:07+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Phoenix VA Health Care System Home, Phoenix, AZ ($843,000) TOTAL: 12,549 bonuses for $8.787 million (2011-2013)Here\u2019s the report itself.\nNew Mexico VA Health Care System Albuquerque, NM ($2.646 million)4.\nGulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Home, Biloxi, MS ($247,103)5.\nReport: $8.8 million in taxpayer-funded bonuses at seven accused VA facilities since 2011posted at 12:41 pm on May 23, 2014 by Guy BensonOpen the Books \u2014 a good government and transparency-minded watchdog organization \u2014 does exactly what their name implies, and discovers that taxpayers showered officials at seven embattled VA locations with nearly $9 million in bonus pay between 2011 and 2013:Now, at least seven VA centers are being investigated for \u201csecret\u201d waiting lists.\nHere are the bonuses into these troubled facilities (2011-2013): 1."}
