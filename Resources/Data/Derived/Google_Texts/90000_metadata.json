Do you have all your holiday shopping done?\n\nIf not, never fear. We have a few Missouri goodies up our sleeves that make perfect presents:\n\nFor friends preparing for a zombie apocalypse: Tactical Bacon\n\nvia\n\nStep one: Open can. Step two: eat bacon.\n\nWhen the walking dead arrive, there'll be no time to heat up the skillet. A guns retailer in Fayette, Missouri, sells 54 slices of bacon ready to eat straight out of a nine ounce can. Tactical Bacon, or tac bac for short, has a picture of an automatic rifle on the can, so you know it's serious.\n\nFor your crazy conservative OR crazy liberal friends: Cruz to the Future coloring book\n\nReally Big Coloring Books, Inc.\n\nColor Ted holding a shotgun or giving a speech against Obamacare.\n\nReally Big Coloring Books, Inc., based in Clayton put out a coloring book based on the life of Tea Party darling and Texas senator Ted Cruz. The book calls him a \"real life superhero\" and offers a page where you can color Cruz as he delivers his 21-hour speech against Obama care, which the book calls \"worse than any war.\"\n\nSee also: Tea Party Senator Ted Cruz Poses with Shotgun, Blasts Obamacare in St. Louis Coloring Book\n\nFor the hostess who needs the mostest: The Jellinator\n\nWe've personally taken this miracle invention for a spin, and we're thrilled to say it's a game-changer for the drunk on the go. The Jellinator, invented by a boozy genius in Creve Coeur, makes filling plastic containers with boozy Jell-O a breeze. Our favorite recipe combines pineapple Jell-O with malibu rum for a Pina Colada -- but if you really need a stiff one, try orange Jell-O and orange vodka for a Screwdriver. Whatever you do, don't try to salt the rims of your Jello-O shots. It just doesn't work.\n\nSee also: The Jellinator: A Test of the Ultimate Jell-O Shot Maker\n\nFind out how to keep your nuts from getting shot off after the jump.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Blog Post", "description": "Christmas is a week away!
