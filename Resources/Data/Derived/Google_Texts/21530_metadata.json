As a result, folks with low incomes - but substantive assets - are suddenly finding themselves trapped in a situation where they have no choice but to sign up for Medicaid.\n\nIn the past it didn\u2019t affect too many people, because \u201casset tests\u201d were included in the Medicaid enrollment requirements. The bar varied significantly from state to state, but the gist of it was that if your assets rose above a certain level you were disqualified, regardless of your income.\n\nIt\u2019s called \u201c estate recovery \u201d and although it\u2019s been around for 20 years, most Americans have never heard of it. Sadly, this arcane bit of Medicaid fine print is about to become much more familiar. Basically, what it says is this: If you\u2019re over 55 and are on Medicaid, when you die the state can seize your assets in an effort to repay the cost of your care.\n\nJust so you know, I opted to skip the whole \u201cOf course it\u2019s not free. Nothing is\u201d part, so I could get right to the point\u2026\n\nIn the 26 states that have opted to implement the Medicaid expansion, asset tests have been eliminated and eligibility is based on income alone. If you earn less than 138% of the federal poverty level, you\u2019ll probably qualify. If you do, you\u2019re no longer able to receive subsidies that help pay for the other plans on the exchange.\n\nThe only alternative is to purchase a full price, un-subsidized, plan. Since ObamaCare is driving premiums and deductibles up, more people are being thrust into Medicaid and they\u2019re shocked to find out that - after they die - their states can come after the assets they\u2019d been planning to leave to their children.\n\nThis week, the Seattle Times told the story of Sofia Prins and Gary Balhorn, a Washington couple who had to dodge a bullet they found in ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid fine print.\n\nAs fine print is wont to do, it had buried itself in a long form \u2014 Balhorn\u2019s application for free health insurance through the expanded state Medicaid program. As the paperwork lay on the dining-room table in Port Townsend, Prins began reading. She was shocked: If you\u2019re 55 or over, Medicaid can come back after you\u2019re dead and bill your estate for ordinary health-care expenses. The way Prins saw it, that meant health insurance via Medicaid is hardly \u201cfree\u201d for Washington residents 55 or older. It\u2019s a loan, one whose payback requirements aren\u2019t well advertised. And it penalizes people who, despite having a low income, have managed to keep a home or some savings they hope to pass to heirs, Prins said.\n\nWhat this means is that, if you earn enough to qualify for a government-subsidized plan, the feds will help you pay for your coverage. However, if you\u2019re income doesn\u2019t qualify, but you own a house and have some money in the bank, you\u2019re on your own. You\u2019ll have to leverage those assets against a sneaky loan for the full amount of your care from age 55 on.\n\nAs for Sofia Prins and Gary Balhorn, they were actually forced to marry in order to bump their combined income up to the level that qualifies for a subsidy.\n\nPrins, an artist, and Balhorn, a retired fisherman-turned-tango instructor, separately qualified for health insurance through Medicaid based on their sole incomes. But if they were married, they calculated, they could \u201cjust squeak by\u201d with enough income to qualify for a subsidized health plan \u2014 and avoid any encumbrance on the home they hope to leave to Prins\u2019 two sons. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to be getting married,\u201d Prins said last week. \u201cUnfortunately not everyone has such an elegant solution to the problem.\u201d\n\nConsidering that liberals spent the last decade screaming about \u201cevil banks\u201d offering \u201cpredatory loans,\u201d it\u2019s amazing that their favorite President has just implemented a healthcare scheme that buries an expansion of estate recovery in its fine print.\n\nOK, fine. It\u2019s not amazing. It\u2019s par for the course.\n\nWhat is amazing is that even the far left loons at the Daily Kos recognize that this is a huge problem:\n\nThose who enroll in Medicaid through the ACA Medicaid Expansion will find that there is no limit on the assets they can have, as long as their income is low enough to qualify. Unfortunately, there is also no limit to the amount that can be billed against the Medicaid recipient\u2019s assets by the state. And Estate Recovery seeks a100% paybackof whatever each state determines are expenses they want to recover for. In other words, if you are 55-64, and depending on what state you are in and what services you use,Medicaid may not be an insurance program: it is a loan.\n\n\n\nWhile it seems a lot of people are under the impression that Estate Recovery is only for long term care, this is not the case in many states.\n\nLeave it to Democrats to force people into a rejiggered, broader, definition of \u201clow income\u201d only to prey upon the newly-enrolled people they claim they\u2019re trying to \u201chelp.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Surprise!
