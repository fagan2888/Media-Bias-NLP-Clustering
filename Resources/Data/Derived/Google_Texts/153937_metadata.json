While Germany handily won concessions in its negotiations with Greece over a bailout, there\u2019s an international chorus proclaiming that the country took too harsh a tack with economically crushed Greece. \u201cThis week has been fantastic for German public diplomacy. All that was missing was Merkel making refugee children cry,\u201d the writer Evgeny Morozov told the BBC .\n\nLooking stunned by the statement, Merkel paused before uttering, \u201cPolitics is hard sometimes.\u201d As she attempted a difficult explanation of how Germany\u2019s asylum policy cannot accommodate all of the thousands of people seeking refuge, the teenager broke out in tears. In an uncomfortable exchange, Merkel approached her and tried to comfort her, stroking her head.\n\nOn a program called \u201cGood Life in Germany,\u201d Sahwil told the chancellor about how she and her family had at one point been threatened with deportation back to Lebanon. \"I have goals like everyone else,\" she said in fluent German. \u201cI want to go to university, that\u2019s a goal I want to achieve.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare that footage featuring Angela Merkel, the preternaturally subdued German chancellor, goes viral. But on Thursday, Merkel\u2019s encounter with Reem Sahwil, a 14-year-old Palestinian refugee in Germany, managed to captivate and enrage people across the Internet.\n\nGermany wasn\u2019t the only party involved in the negotiations with Greece; however, as Europe\u2019s biggest economy as well as Greece\u2019s primary creditor, the country has been Greece\u2019s most prominent adversary in months of contentious talks. Merkel has specifically been accused of humiliating Greek leader Alexis Tsipras.\n\nFor the past few years, Germany has been in a period of unprecedented popularity. Last year, the country beat the United States to the title of the world\u2019s \u201cbest nation\u201d in The Nation Brands IndexSM, a worldwide survey of national perceptions of different countries. In 2013, the BBC\u2019s Country Rating Poll ranked Germany the world\u2019s most popular country.\n\nBut as The Washington Post noted, Germany\u2019s recent actions have been maligned in several places across the euro zone, not just Greece:\n\nFrance\u2019s daily Le Figaro declared that \u201cconditions were imposed on a small member state that would have previously required arms.\u201d In a commentary that sneered at Merkel\u2019s \u201chalf smile\u201d after the deal was reached, Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper argued that rather than being cruel to be kind, the terms of the bailout were simply \u201ccruel to be cruel.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the hashtag #ThisIsACoup spread across Europe, and was endorsed by The New York Times\u2019s resident op-ed-page economist Paul Krugman as a description of what he called the \u201ccomplete destruction of national sovereignty\u201d imposed on Greece in exchange for rescuing it from bankruptcy.\n\nThe perceived harshness of the deal has also seen a backlash in Germany. \u201cThe German government destroyed seven decades of postwar diplomacy on a single weekend,\u201dGermany\u2019s Spiegel wrote of last week\u2019s negotiations. The country\u2019s Green Party representatives also had some sharp words, with its budget spokesman saying that \u201cGermany has made a historic mistake.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Merkel remains extremely popular in her country, and her approval ratings are still high after nearly a decade in office. Part of her appeal to Germans is the dry and deliberate way in which she handles highly emotional issues. That includes fraught bailout negotiations as well as the issue of asylum. Criticism of that approach seems to strike a nerve within the country.\n\n\u201cThis country is having a hard time getting used to this leadership role, to being in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Joerg Forbrig, an expert at the German Marshall Fund, told Time. \u201cFor Germans the role of a leader, or a benevolent hegemon, is acceptable. But our skin is super thin when it comes to the reactions you elicit in that role.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The country\u2019s tough tack with Greece seems to be hurting its strong reputation.", "author": "Adam Chandler", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The country\u2019s tough tack with Greece seems to be hurting its strong reputation.", "title": "Germany Wins a Negotiation Battle, But May Lose a PR War", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/07/RTX1KNEB/facebook.jpg?1437152107", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/germany-greece-debt-euro-zone/398870/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "On a program called \u201cGood Life in Germany,\u201d Sahwil told the chancellor about how she and her family had at one point been threatened with deportation back to Lebanon.\nThat includes fraught bailout negotiations as well as the issue of asylum.\nWhile Germany handily won concessions in its negotiations with Greece over a bailout, there\u2019s an international chorus proclaiming that the country took too harsh a tack with economically crushed Greece.\nBut on Thursday, Merkel\u2019s encounter with Reem Sahwil, a 14-year-old Palestinian refugee in Germany, managed to captivate and enrage people across the Internet.\nAll that was missing was Merkel making refugee children cry,\u201d the writer Evgeny Morozov told the BBC ."}
