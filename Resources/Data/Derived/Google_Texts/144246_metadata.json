(AP) - The Buffalo Bills\u2019 already banged-up group of receivers has lost another player.\n\nCoach Rex Ryan said Marquise Goodwin is out indefinitely after breaking his ribs late in the first half of a 43-19 preseason win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday.\n\nGoodwin had made a 19-yard catch and cut into the middle of the field and was tackled by linebacker Ryan Shazier and defensive lineman Ethan Hemer.\n\nGoodwin lay on the turf for several minutes while being treated by trainers. And he eventually needed to be helped up by running back Fred Jackson before Goodwin was slowly taken to the Bills locker room.\n\nThe Bills played the Steelers without their three starting receivers: Sammy Watkins (gluteal muscle/hamstring), Percy Harvin (hip) and Robert Woods (tightness).\n\nAll three are expected to be ready for the start of the season. Another receiver, Chris Hogan, is sidelined for two to four weeks with a sprained ankle.\n\nThe Steelers could be searching for another kicker after Garrett Hartley hurt his right hamstring during a kickoff in the first quarter.\n\nCoach Mike Tomlin would only say Hartley\u2019s injury \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers signed the seventh-year player on Aug. 11 after Shawn Suisham sustained a season-ending injury to his left knee in the Hall of Fame game against Minnesota.\n\nTomlin said rookie linebacker Bud Dupree, the team\u2019s first-round pick, did not return because of a sore foot.\n\nBills starting cornerback Stephon Gilmore did not return after hurting his right shoulder while tackling receiver Markus Wheaton. Tests however revealed that Gilmore did not sustain a concussion.\n\nBills rookie linebacker Tony Steward, a sixth-round pick, could miss a few weeks after hurting his knee in the first half.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Buffalo Bills' already banged-up group of receivers has lost another player.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Buffalo Bills\u2019 already banged-up group of receivers has lost another player.", "title": "Bills receiver Goodwin out indefinitely with broken ribs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/bills-cornerback-gilmore-being-examined-for-concus/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/56993759cd4c8426800f6a7067001690.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/56993759cd4c8426800f6a7067001690.jpg", "description": "The Buffalo Bills' already banged-up group of receivers has lost another player.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bills receiver Goodwin out indefinitely with broken ribs"}, "Author": "JOHN WAWROW", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Bills rookie linebacker Tony Steward, a sixth-round pick, could miss a few weeks after hurting his knee in the first half.\nGoodwin had made a 19-yard catch and cut into the middle of the field and was tackled by linebacker Ryan Shazier and defensive lineman Ethan Hemer.\nBills starting cornerback Stephon Gilmore did not return after hurting his right shoulder while tackling receiver Markus Wheaton.\nThe Bills played the Steelers without their three starting receivers: Sammy Watkins (gluteal muscle/hamstring), Percy Harvin (hip) and Robert Woods (tightness).\nTomlin said rookie linebacker Bud Dupree, the team\u2019s first-round pick, did not return because of a sore foot."}
