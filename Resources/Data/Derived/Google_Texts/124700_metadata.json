But his hometown speaks to Colorado fans as much as his hard-hitting r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and respect from Avs players.\n\nHe\u2019s from Rocky Mountain House, a small city in Alberta, and he\u2019s been beating up on the Avs throughout his NHL career.\n\nLike Avs players, Avs fans will soon appreciate having Stuart on their side. If nothing else, pay attention to Stuart\u2019s skating \u2014 his smooth, seemingly effortless stride gets him in position to make plays as well as anyone in the NHL.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really steady influence,\u201d said Erik Johnson, who is playing with Stuart as the Avs\u2019 top pairing. \u201cHe won a Stanley Cup in Detroit and has been on a lot of winning teams. He\u2019s approaching mid-30s, but he really skates well out there. If you can skate in the league you\u2019re going to be around for a long time, and he can definitely move.\u201d\n\nStuart came to Colorado from San Jose at a large cost: The Avs sent the Sharks a second-round draft pick in 2016 and a sixth-rounder in 2017. Stuart waived his limited no-trade clause to come to Colorado after the Sharks self-imploded again in the 2014 playoffs after taking a 3-0 series lead over the Los Angeles Kings, the eventual Stanley Cup champions.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think it was a good time,\u201d Stuart said of getting out of San Jose, the team that chose him third overall in the 1998 draft. \u201cThey wanted to make, probably, more changes than they did. First thing I noticed here is, everything is positive; everybody is excited about the season. Reading some of the things going on (in San Jose), it\u2019s a little different atmosphere. I\u2019m excited to be a part of this. It really feels good.\u201d\n\nStuart is beginning his 15th season, and all but one began with a Western Conference team. He has been a thorn in the Avs\u2019 side while playing for the Sharks (twice), Calgary Flames, Kings and Red Wings. He also played in the East for the Boston Bruins.\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, Stuart has the innate ability to make big hits without warning. Just ask Avs captain Gabe Landeskog, who suffered a concussion early in the 2012-13 lockout-shortened season from a huge neutral-zone check by Stuart in San Jose.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a threat,\u201d Landes- kog said. \u201cAs an opposing forward you know that he\u2019s on the ice, and you have to be aware. He\u2019s like (Niklas) Kronwall of Detroit. You know when he\u2019s on the ice and where he is.\u201d\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy is happy to have Stuart on his side.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be able to share his past experience, and I\u2019m sure our players will benefit from it,\u201d Roy said.\n\nStuart is married with two young children and is entering the final year of a salary paying him $3.6 million annually. The family has settled in the Denver area, and Stuart would rather not move his family again.\n\n\u201cThis is a really skilled team. The future is bright, and I want to contribute and help out with the younger guys. And moving is far tougher on the family than the player,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cWhen you know what it feels like to win, you want it back. It\u2019s the best, the ultimate. When you experience that you don\u2019t want to go back to just playing, waiting for hope. You want to be playing when it counts, and I think this team has the ability to play deep into the playoffs, and I want to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Steady veteran Brad Stuart helps fortify Avs\u2019 defense", "title": "Steady veteran Brad Stuart helps fortify Avs\u2019 defense", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/steady-veteran-brad-stuart-helps-fortify-avs-defense/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_CC10_SP28HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 489}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_CC10_SP28HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T18:26:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:21:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd414a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s a really steady influence,\u201d said Erik Johnson, who is playing with Stuart as the Avs\u2019 top pairing.\nLike Avs players, Avs fans will soon appreciate having Stuart on their side.\nHe has been a thorn in the Avs\u2019 side while playing for the Sharks (twice), Calgary Flames, Kings and Red Wings.\nHe\u2019s from Rocky Mountain House, a small city in Alberta, and he\u2019s been beating up on the Avs throughout his NHL career.\nYou know when he\u2019s on the ice and where he is.\u201dAvs coach Patrick Roy is happy to have Stuart on his side."}
