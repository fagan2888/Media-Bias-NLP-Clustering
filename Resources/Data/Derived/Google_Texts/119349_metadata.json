Reviews of emails sent and received by Clinton have caused federal officials to request an assessment from the FBI as to whether classified information was improperly transmitted via email and, to make the issue even more problematic, done so using a private emails server that Clinton maintained in lieu of using the secure, backed-up State Department system.\n\nRelated: State Department Can\u2019t Find Clinton Aides\u2019 Blackberries\n\nFor months, Clinton has insisted that she never knowingly sent or received classified material on her private email account. But an assessment by the intelligence community\u2019s Inspector General cast doubt on that when, in an initial review, it identified classified information in a small sample of the former secretary of state\u2019s emails.\n\nA more thorough examination resulted in more than 300 emails being sent to the FBI for further review.\n\nThe thing is, Clinton has a credible defense. Talk to anybody familiar with the classification of federal documents and, if they are being honest, they\u2019ll admit that the system is largely arbitrary and capricious. A document passed into the public record by one agency might be redacted to the point of incomprehensibility by another. Material considered public today might next week suddenly be labeled classified, meaning that anybody who shared it is in theory retroactively guilty of exposing national secrets.\n\nIt\u2019s a point Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tried to make in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: As Trump Surges, New Clinton Ad Takes Aim at the Rich\n\nClinton, he said, \u201cwas at worst a passive recipient of unwitting information that subsequently became deemed as classified.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhen it comes to classified information, the standards are not at all black and white, and in the absence of markings that officially designate something classified, reasonable people, each taking their responsibilities extremely seriously, can nonetheless disagree on the character of the information they are dealing with \u2014 and both could be completely justified in that perspective.\u201d\n\nTortured syntax aside, every word Fallon said was true. But the problem is that in the eyes of many Americans, Clinton long ago surrendered any claim she might once have had to the benefit of the doubt.\n\nPoll after poll indicates that the biggest challenge she faces with the U.S. electorate is that many Americans \u2013 and not just her hard-core Republican opponents \u2013 don\u2019t trust her.\n\nRelated: Clinton Tries to Brush Off Email Affair as She Wades Deeper into the Morass\n\nHer decision to use a personal email server for her communications as Secretary of State, a position making her privy to some of the nation\u2019s most sensitive data, didn\u2019t help. Her insistence that the server, which contained materials that were federal records by any definition, was her personal property and would not be handed over to federal officials made the impression worse.\n\nTopping things off, of course, was her blithe admission earlier this year that she had asked her personal attorneys to look at all the emails on the server and to delete those that they determined were not part of the public record. The practical effect was to tell the American people that when it comes to questions about her emails they simply needed to trust her -- something they are manifestly uncomfortable doing.\n\nShe eventually turned the server over to the FBI, and agency sources this week said that they were optimistic that they could recover much of the deleted data.\n\nAt a time when Democrats would most likely prefer to watch the Republican candidates for the 2016 nomination tear the GOP apart from the inside over illegal immigration, the issue of Clinton\u2019s email troubles seems unlikely to go away.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Scandal Watch \u2013 Get Used to Hearing Huma Abedin\u2019s Name\n\nClinton fought through a difficult press conference on Tuesday night and Fallon\u2019s appearance Wednesday drew a large amount of (largely undeserved) social media mockery.\n\nIt may or may not be a sign of desperation that the Clinton camp summoned longtime surrogate James Carville back from vacation to defend the former secretary of state on television. But the Louisianan\u2019s defense of Clinton Wednesday was long on Cajun color and short on specifics.\n\n\u201cThis is foolishness,\u201d Carville said in an interview with NBC. \u201cI\u2019m having to come out of my vacation to deal with this kind of stupidity that these people are putting out. Hillary is going to be just fine, it\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt's just a bunch of people talking to each other, spinning themselves up over a pile of garbage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sometimes the dog really does eat your homework, but if you\u2019ve got a reputation for skirting the edges of the truth and bending rules, good luck selling that story when you\u2019re standing in front of the teacher\u2019s desk.", "title": "Clinton\u2019s Email Fail May Be Innocent, but Americans Still Don\u2019t Trust Her", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/Clinton-s-Email-Fail-May-Be-Innocent-Americans-Still-Don-t-Trust-Her", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08192015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/Clinton-s-Email-Fail-May-Be-Innocent-Americans-Still-Don-t-Trust-Her", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08192015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sometimes the dog really does eat your homework, but if you\u2019ve got a reputation for skirting the edges of the truth and bending rules, good luck selling that story when you\u2019re standing in front of the teacher\u2019s desk.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab20\"", "article_summary": "Related: State Department Can\u2019t Find Clinton Aides\u2019 BlackberriesFor months, Clinton has insisted that she never knowingly sent or received classified material on her private email account.\nA more thorough examination resulted in more than 300 emails being sent to the FBI for further review.\nPoll after poll indicates that the biggest challenge she faces with the U.S. electorate is that many Americans \u2013 and not just her hard-core Republican opponents \u2013 don\u2019t trust her.\n\u201cI\u2019m having to come out of my vacation to deal with this kind of stupidity that these people are putting out.\nBut an assessment by the intelligence community\u2019s Inspector General cast doubt on that when, in an initial review, it identified classified information in a small sample of the former secretary of state\u2019s emails."}
