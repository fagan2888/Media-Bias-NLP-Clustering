One company, Humana, is expanding its workforce ahead of enrollment re-opening this fall.\n\nHumana insurance is expanding their newly opened Madison call center that handles questions from many newly insured people.\n\nMichael Stann With Xerox, who operates the call center, says they are ramping up their efforts ahead of the insurance exchange re-opening this fall\n\n\"The site has ramped up 370 associates to support Humana already. We have got an additional commitment for another 130 on top of that. So our full commitment in Madison is 500 staff,\" Stann said.\n\n\n\nThe center is fielding calls nationwide and currently answering roughly 4-thousand questions a month\u2026a number that is expected to grow.\n\n\n\nCall center operator Natausha Jefferson says she is surprised how well informed most people are about their private insurance option.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of these member are pretty knowledgeable about what plan they have. And they want to know what is specifically this doctor. Or specifically this prescription and like that,\u201d Jefferson said.\n\n\n\nIn the first year of enrollment, Humana signed up roughly three quarters of the 66-thousand Mississippians who sought insurance on the exchange.\n\n\n\nStacey Carter with Humana says that has lead them to add 8 more counties where they offer exchange subsidized plans up to 48.\n\n\"We are planning to be here for the long haul. We have been here since 2005 offering the Medicare products and we plan to be here for the long haul,\" Carter said.\n\nMagnolia insurance, the second company on Mississppi\u2019s exchange, is also expanding their footprint adding two more counties.\n\nThat means Mississippians in as many as 14 counties will now have competing options. The increase by both companies is likely a positive sign for the state, which had the second highest average insurance premium in the country.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "NFI_SuVwnaUrGSe0Q6ZHmhiLPx4WP6kBGFKGLja4SsA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded75\"", "article_summary": "Humana insurance is expanding their newly opened Madison call center that handles questions from many newly insured people.\nStacey Carter with Humana says that has lead them to add 8 more counties where they offer exchange subsidized plans up to 48.\nThe two companies selling subsidized private health insurance on Mississippi\u2019s exchange are deepening their commitment to the state.\nOne company, Humana, is expanding its workforce ahead of enrollment re-opening this fall.\nIn the first year of enrollment, Humana signed up roughly three quarters of the 66-thousand Mississippians who sought insurance on the exchange."}
