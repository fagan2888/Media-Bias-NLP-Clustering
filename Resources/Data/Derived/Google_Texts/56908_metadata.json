In this article, Elliot Hyun, a medical device analyst at GE Capital Healthcare Financial Services, discusses the current status of the industry \u2013 and what lies ahead for investors.\n\nQ. What is the state of the medical device industry?\n\nA. Broadly speaking, we have seen growth slow in recent years, as the industry has grappled with both persistent utilization softness following the end of the most recent economic downturn as well as the increasingly real headwind of pricing pressure from customers. As such, we believe industry growth has slowed from the mid-high single-digit range prior to the recession to the low single-digit area today.\n\nA more modest organic growth environment, coupled with a rapidly changing healthcare landscape, has impacted the industry\u2019s approach to innovation as well. On one hand, we have seen greater emphasis on product development initiatives aimed at delivering cost savings for both customers as well as the overall healthcare system, while also driving evidence-based improvement in patient outcomes. In addition, we have seen an increasing propensity of device companies to look into adjacent spaces via partnerships/acquisitions to help achieve growth objectives.\n\nQ. What is the latest with regard to industry regulation and oversight by the FDA?\n\nA. On the pre-market side, there has been a perception of a lack of transparency and resulting unpredictability as it relates to the 510(k) and PMA regulatory approval pathways that has led many companies to contemplate commercializing products abroad before attempting to do so in the U.S. While we have seen some improvement in industry sentiment, we continue to sense an ongoing level of heightened frustration among both smaller and larger device companies with regard to pre-market regulatory consistency as it relates to the FDA. One common sentiment we hear is that earlier and more frequent interaction with the agency during the regulatory review process typically leads to a smoother experience.\n\nOn the post-market side, heightened enforcement activity (inspection findings, recalls, warning letters, etc.) and greater public scrutiny around post-market safety issues (e.g. metal-on-metal hips, defibrillator leads, infusion pumps, AEDs, etc.) has given incremental pause to investors and operators alike, elevating the prominence of regulatory diligence when evaluating potential deal opportunities.\n\nOn balance, we believe the combination of pre- and post-market concerns with respect to the FDA in recent years has certainly increased investor awareness of the risks of pursuing an investment in the device sector and influenced expectations around the potential time frame to realizing a successful exit, but have not significantly dampened investor interest in pursuing opportunities in the space.\n\nQ. What about healthcare reform? Any visible trends investors should know about?\n\nA. With regard to ongoing implementation of the ACA, the most tangible impact on the device industry to date has been the imposition of a 2.3 percent excise tax since the beginning of the year, which is expected to generate roughly $30 billion over 10 years. This burden may be offset to an extent by incremental sales volume resulting from an expected increase in the number of insured people; however, there is a significant amount of industry skepticism around the potential magnitude of such a pickup. Earlier stage companies \u2013 which have historically been key drivers of innovation in the device industry \u2013 may be particularly vulnerable to the new sales-based (as opposed to profit-based) tax.\n\nBeyond the device tax, an increasingly challenging provider reimbursement landscape and the potential emergence of new payment models represent incremental uncertainties that investors must grapple with as they evaluate opportunities in the device space.\n\nQ. What\u2019s the outlook for investors?\n\nA. By and large, we feel very good about the prospects for the medical device industry going forward.
