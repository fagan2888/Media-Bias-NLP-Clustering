Staying on track, Johnny obtained an audit winter internship with McGladrey & Pullen in Chicago during his junior year, which turned into a full-time position following graduation. Before facing the real world, Johnny backpacked through Europe for a month, and upon coming home, was was ready for a new chapter in his lifeand came out to his family and friends.

Shortly after coming out, Johnny realized a career in accounting was not the best route for him. He left the accounting industry to figure things out, and started working at the family meat market in Lake View. Feeling more comfortable with his current job and himself, Johnny was on the lookout for a career he could be passionate about. Almost a year ago, he had the urge to "pay it forward" and started a non-profit called Equality America. His goal in creating this group was to help people visually show their support for marriage equality and the LGBTQ community as a whole.

Since creation of the group, Johnny, alongside his family and friends, has sold hundreds of wristbands and key chains bearing the name "Equality America" in the hopes of offering visual support to those struggling with their sexual orientation. Equality America continues to evolve and through transparency and vulnerability is an organization which hopes to motivate members of the LGBTQ community who struggle with their sexuality to become confident in who they are and be true to themselves.

DID YOU KNOW? During Johnny's Eurotrip in 2009, his group of friends decided to bypass hostels and hotels for a night in Nice, France, and instead sleep on the beach. Just their luckthe beach was full of stones and not sand, but it was nothing grapefruit and wine for dinner couldn't cure.

Monica Beverly Hillz, 29 has been through many transformations in her life. The latest one has turned her into an advocate for transwomen everywhere. She came out as a transgendered woman as a cast member in the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Monica has been telling her story and spinning across dance floors since.

Monica's glory is a tribute to the two women who gave her life. Elsie De Jesus, Monica's biological mother, gave birth to Monica when she was impossibly young and tormented by life on the streets. At the age of 4, Monicaor "Meño," as she was known as a childwas adopted by her mother's sister, Gladys. Raised on the rough streets of Chicago's Latino Northwest Side, Monicawho sashayed and stole her sisters' clothes and high heelswas like no other boy. When Gladys died tragically, leaving behind five children, Monica, then 15, moved to Kentucky to join her biological mother.

In small-town Kentucky, Monica was the only openly gay person at her high school. Monica soon moved back north to Chicago, where she began performing in drag. By 18, she became the main diva at various Latino gay clubs like Rancho Luna, Mambo Cafe and Club Dulces. When street life in Chicago proved too brutal, Monica followed in her mother's footsteps and moved to Kentucky. There Monica became a cast mate at her town's only gay bar. Soon after Monica was called to Hollywood to compete in RuPaul's Drag Race. The rest, my beautiful humans is history in the making!

DID YOU KNOW? Monica is horrifically scared to get behind the wheel of a car? She would rather ride a bike or get a piggy back ride to her gigs.
