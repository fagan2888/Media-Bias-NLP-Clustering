The land-use designation would change to multi-residential zoning from its current public service district designation.\n\nThe main building of the former church would be converted to 29 units and the neighbouring former Keith Hall would be turned into 12 apartments.\n\nMillard is applying for financial incentives for affordable housing under the city\u2019s Community Improvement Plan.\n\nIn exchange for a commitment to keep rents at average or below average levels for the Peterborough market, the city could give breaks on property taxes and waive development charges.\n\nDepending on rent levels, the municipality could give rebates for a percentage of the property tax increase that stems from the improvements.\n\nKnox United Church closed in June 2011 after struggling with declining attendance.\n\nThe church\u2019s trustees had accepted a $400,000 offer for the property from Our Space drop-in centre group, but the deal fell through when the buyer decided renovations would be too expensive.\n\nThe high-density residential use is appropriate in the city\u2019s central area, Kimble states.\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendment contemplates re-use of the existing buildings, no longer viable as a place of worship,\u201d she states.\n\nThe city\u2019s community services department wants council to designate the property under the Ontario Heritage Act.\n\nCity staff met with the applicant to discuss heritage preservation and they are working toward reaching a conservation agreement to address specific features and conservation provisions, staff state.\n\nOther items council will consider Monday include:\n\n- Changing the zoning for 191 Bethune St. to allow the property owner to convert the existing duplex with five-bedroom units into a four-unit building with each unit having two or three bedrooms.\n\n- Completing the approval of the subdivision plan for 52 lots by R.D. Land Corp at 420 Simons Ave. and 748 Hemlock St., which are at the east end of Raymond St.\n\nThe planning committee meeting starts at 6:30 p.m. in the council chambers at City Hall, 500 George St. N.\n\nNOTE: Council will hold a closed-door meeting of committee of the whole starting at 6 p.m. in the general committee room to discuss an item about personal matters about an identifiable individual and three items about proposed or pending purchases or sales of land.\n\nbrendan.wedley@sunmedia.ca", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, Local, Provincial, Canada, World, Sports, High School Sports, Local Hockey, Hockey, Basketball, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Lacrosse, Curling, Other Sports, Entertainment, Local, Movies, Music, Television,  Celebrities, Life, Health, Food, Travel, Money, Opinion, Editorial, Letters, Column, Your Newspaper, Social medias, Events, UR, News, Sports, Life, Entertainment, Money, Opinion, Marketplace, Photos, Videos, Contests, Polls, Weather, Sitemap, Event Submission", "author": "nurun.com", "og": {"image": "http://storage.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297455649809_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=320x&stmp=1382773212915", "site_name": "Peterborough Examiner", "description": "A plan to convert the former Knox United Church on Rubidge St. into 41 affordable-housing apartments with 17 parking spaces on the property goes to city council\u2019s planning committee meeting Monday.", "title": "41 apartments at former church"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93be\"", "article_summary": "A plan to convert the former Knox United Church on Rubidge St. into 41 affordable-housing apartments with 17 parking spaces on the property goes to city council\u2019s planning committee meeting Monday.\nThe main building of the former church would be converted to 29 units and the neighbouring former Keith Hall would be turned into 12 apartments.\nKnox United Church closed in June 2011 after struggling with declining attendance.\n\u201cThe application proposes to retain the existing buildings and repurpose them by converting the use from church and associated hall, to residential units,\u201d land use planner Caroline Kimble states in a report to council.\nLand Corp at 420 Simons Ave. and 748 Hemlock St., which are at the east end of Raymond St."}
