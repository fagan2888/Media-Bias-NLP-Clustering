Rand Paul is now the second major Republican candidate to officially declare he will run for president. Paul made the announcement April 7 on his campaign website.\n\nWe present here a sampling of some past claims from Paul that we have reviewed on our site:\n\nEarlier this year, Paul overstated the amount of fraud in a tax credit program for low-income workers. He said the earned income tax credit has a \u201cfraud rate\u201d of 25 percent and costs taxpayers \u201c$20 billion to $30 billion.\u201d Actually, Paul was referring to the \u201cimproper payment error rate\u201d \u2014 which includes fraud, but also represents mistakes made by taxpayers when filing tax forms and the IRS when processing payments. The errors, according to the Government Accountability Office, cost taxpayers $14.5 billion \u2014 which is less than half of the high-end estimate provided by Paul.\n\nLast year, Paul claimed 20 million jobs were created after President Reagan cut taxes in the 1980s, saying it was the \u201clast time\u201d such job growth took place. Reagan added a net total of 16.1 million new jobs during his eight years in office. Even ignoring the jobs lost during the early part of Reagan\u2019s time in office, the economy gained 18.4 million jobs from the low point in December 1982 to the end of his presidency \u2013 still well short of Paul\u2019s \u201c20 million\u201d claim. More importantly, the economy added far more jobs \u2014 22.9 million of them \u2014 under President Clinton, who raised taxes during his eight years in office from 1993 to 2001.\n\nIn 2013, Paul claimed that \u201cblack unemployment in America is double white unemployment\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t budged\u201d under President Obama. He was right about black unemployment being double white unemployment, but the ratio of black-to-white unemployment rates was actually below the historical average at the time and remains so. As for black unemployment not budging under Obama, that was wrong in 2013 and remains wrong today. It reached a high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 and dropped to a low of 12.5 percent in November 2013, which was the most current month for which data was available when Paul made his remark. The black unemployment rate since then has fallen even further, dropping to 10.1 percent in March.\n\nIn 2013, Paul incorrectly claimed that under the Affordable Care Act \u201cyou will go to jail\u201d if you don\u2019t buy health insurance and refuse to pay the tax penalty. The law specifically states that those who do not pay the penalty \u201cshall not be subject to any criminal prosecution\u201d and the IRS commissioner at the time said the law precludes jail.\n\nIn February, Paul repeated the false assertion that \u201cmany\u201d children have developed \u201cprofound mental disorders\u201d after vaccinations. Though severe reactions have occurred in extremely rare cases, there is no evidence that any currently recommended vaccine causes brain damage or other mental disorders in otherwise healthy children. Paul later walked back his comments, saying in a New York Times story that he believes vaccines are safe and effective.\n\nAlso in February, Paul falsely claimed that the budget for the National Institute of Health has been increasing \u201cfor years and years,\u201d when the NIH\u2019s budget had in fact decreased over the last decade when adjusted for inflation. Even when using figures unadjusted for inflation, the NIH budget was lower in 2014 and 2015 ($30.1 and $30.3 billion, respectively) than it was in 2010, when it reached a high of $31.2 billion.\n\nWe will continue to monitor statements made by Paul and all potential 2016 presidential candidates.
