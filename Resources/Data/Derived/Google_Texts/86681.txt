Federal spending bill includes $50 million for security for 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland

A federal appropriations bill released early Wednesday, as expected, includes $50 million for Cleveland to offset the city's cost of providing security for the 2016 Republican National Convention.

Philadelphia also will receive $50 million to pay for security for next year's Democratic National Convention, according to the text of the federal "omnibus" appropriations bill.

The amount for Cleveland and Philadelphia is the same that has been provided to other host cities for recent political conventions, including the 2012 RNC in Tampa, Florida and the 2012 DNC in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The other convention host cities used much of the money to pay, feed and transport thousands of outside police officers to work the conventions, but also spent millions on equipment, including surveillance cameras, radios, uniforms and vehicles. | Read Andrew J. Tobias' story
