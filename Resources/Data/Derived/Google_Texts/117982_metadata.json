The nurse practitioner who saw her noticed that Doyle had a heart murmur and ran an EKG.\n\nDoyle, who\u2019d experienced moments of lightheadedness and heart arrhythmia, later underwent open heart surgery and ended up having a pacemaker placed in her chest, something she\u2019d been forewarned might be necessary.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those gambles, like, \u2018You may die in the next month or you may not.\u2019 I was a dancer, in theater, and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to wake up with a defibrillator. This is crazy.\u2019 I woke up (and learned one was embedded), and I just sobbed,\u201d she said.\n\nDoyle\u2019s condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a thickening of the heart muscle. The thickening can make it difficult for blood to leave the heart, forcing the muscle to work harder to pump it out. The condition can cause sudden death in athletes. It is hereditary. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, roughly half a million people in the U.S. have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Doyle\u2019s father, John, was one.\n\nHe had no symptoms until one day when he was cycling in Red Rock Canyon with a friend and slumped over, dead. He was 55.\n\n\u201cI was heartbroken \u2026 I was in shock,\u201d said Doyle, now 27 and a northwest Las Vegas resident. \u201cI had talked to him the day before, and he was completely fine.\u201d\n\nKatie Houghton met Doyle when both were in the theater program at Las Vegas Academy, 315 S. Seventh St.\n\n\u201cI remember a few long days of rehearsal and having her pass out twice in one day, which was terrifying and made her limitations tangible in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before,\u201d Houghton said.\n\nA year after her father\u2019s death was when Doyle got pink eye and learned she had the same heart condition. Her two older brothers do not have it.\n\nRecovery from the surgery was difficult. At one point, she was taking 15 pills a day, and her blood pressure dropped to 75 over 50.\n\n\u201cI was so weak, I couldn\u2019t even lift the TV remote \u2026 I kept passing out,\u201d she said.\n\nBack then, pacemaker batteries lasted about five years. She was warned that when it was time for a new one, she\u2019d know it. Sure enough, in 2010, Doyle was out having breakfast with Houghton when that time came.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a horse kicking me in the chest,\u201d she said. \u201cI got shocked with 1,200 volts of electricity in three minutes. It left my whole left side sore.\u201d\n\nDoyle\u2019s new battery is good for about another five years.\n\nNow, she\u2019s a poster person for heart walks and other events. Doyle said she lives by the creed, \u201cbe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\u201d She\u2019s adjusted to life with a defibrillator that has pace-making abilities: no holding her cellphone with her left hand; staying clear of magnets; only being patted down at airport security.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular diseases and stroke are the nation\u2019s No. 1 and No. 4 killers and Nevada\u2019s No. 1 and No. 5 killers. My Heart. My Life. is a national movement designed to get everyone to embrace a healthier lifestyle in order to improve cardiovascular health.
