But they were disappointed. Protesters managed to shut down the rally, causing enough chaos for Trump to cancel his appearance. Before that happened, we spoke to a few Trump fans about why they support Trump.\n\nTom Piper\n\nPiper said he supports Trump because Trump says he believes in America and will increase the prestige of the United States. Piper said he supported George W. Bush, but he thinks Bush compromised his principles, something he doesn\u2019t think Trump will do.\n\nWhat\u2019s most attractive about Trump to Piper is that Trump isn\u2019t perfect and doesn\u2019t try to be. Piper said he thinks too many politicians try to cater to the voters, but not Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that fear of political correctness,\u201d Piper said. \u201cThat\u2019s the world we live in.\u201d\n\nPiper said he doesn\u2019t believe that Trump won\u2019t let Muslims or Mexicans into the United States, and he doesn\u2019t think anyone believes that.\n\n\n\nStudents from St. Ignatius High in Chicago\n\nJohn Quaas is a student at St. Ignatius High School who came to see Trump at his Rally in Chicago. (Jack Adams/Medill)\n\nJohn Quaas\n\nQuaas said he likes Trump because he isn\u2019t a professional politician and that he thinks the founding fathers never intended for the people to make a living off of their political careers.\n\nQuaas admitted Trump might not have specific details about how he would administrate as president, but he thinks that Trump will listen and fix America\u2019s problems.\n\n\n\nJimmy Suska\n\nSuska said he likes Trump because the candidate says what\u2019s on his mind, unlike other candidates, whom he said are coached to say what people want to hear.\n\nMatt Brown\n\nBrown said he supported Chris Christie until he dropped out and endorsed Trump. Brown said he is attracted to Trump\u2019s candidness, which he admitted has made some groups feel bullied.\n\n\u201cBeing a white male, he hasn\u2019t offended me yet,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWorking Americans\n\nKat Perez is a Mexican American who supports Donald Trump. (Jack Adams/Medill)\n\nKat Perez\n\nPerez said he is a Mexican-American and a Trump supporter. He said that unlike most Mexicans, he understands Trump. Trump resonates with Perez because both are Christian, family men.\n\nHe thinks Trump\u2019s proposed wall between the United States and Mexico is a metaphor. But even it were a tangible wall, Perez said he thinks the wall would be permeable and provide avenues for undocumented Mexicans in the United States to return to Mexico and become documented. He said Mexicans don\u2019t want to leave Mexico; it\u2019s a paradise. But the lack of jobs leaves them little choice.\n\n\u201cFix Mexico is what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Perez said.\n\n\n\nTravis Massenburg\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Trump] is racist,\u201d said Travis Massenburg, 27, and African-American owner of a movie company.\n\nMassenburg was at the rally with his mother, whom he says is a Democrat. Massenburg supports Trump because he thinks Trump is the best choice for the economy. He said America\u2019s presence on the word\u2019s stage has become weak. Massenburg said people like Trump because America needs a leader to stand up for what people truly believe in.\n\n\n\nLinda Slabaugh came to the Trump rally to show her support. (Jack Adams/Medill)\n\nLinda Slabaugh\n\nLinda Slabaugh, 52, is a nurse and an attorney. She said she supports Trump primarily based on his health care reform policy.\n\nSlabaugh said she does not like the Affordable Care Act because she thinks it is \u201ccorporate welfare for the insurance company,\u201d in which people pay for a product they aren\u2019t covered for because the deductibles are often too high.\n\nSlabaugh said healthcare is a business and for any business the price should be transparent.\n\n\u201cOne thing I like about [Trump\u2019s policy] is the pricing transparency he is pushing,\u201d Slabaugh said. \u201cFor example, in the United States, we don\u2019t list health care prices.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohn Christiansen\n\n\u201cI mean everyone else just isn\u2019t a good fit for the job,\u201d said computer programmer John Christiansen, 25. \u201cIt is not that Trump is good\u2013it is that everyone else is bad.\u201d\n\nChristiansen said Trump\u2019s message is a simple one. \u201cJust making America great again,\u201d Christiansen said. \u201cThere is nothing really specific about it, but it is a nice, positive message.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary wants the money from the big people, Bernie wants the money from the small people, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t give a f***! He just wants your vote because that is really all that matters,\u201d Christiansen said.\n\nPhoto at top: Tensions between Trump supporters and protesters rise after Trump announces that he won\u2019t make an appearance at the rally in Chicago.
