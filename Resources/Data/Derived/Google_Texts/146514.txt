Former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) took to his Facebook page Wednesday and referred to President Obama as a tyrant, expressing his disapproval of the bipartisan agreement that re-opened the government.

“Obamacare is not the law of the land,” West said in his post. “It is an edict handed down by a tyrant, not a President.”

Earlier this week in the midst of the government shutdown, West criticized the president’s handling of the shutdown, calling him a “spoiled brat child.”

West is critical of the Senate for raising the debt ceiling without repealing Obamacare, calling it “reprehensible” and saying “we can expect even more bad behavior from a President that continues to spit on our Constitution and in our eyes…and smile.”

The new legislation permits the Treasury to borrow normally through February 7 and will fund the government through January 15.
