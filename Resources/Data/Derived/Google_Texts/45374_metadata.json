The South Korean electronics giant has taken a hit to both its profitability and smartphone market share in 2014, but there\u2019s at least one metric the company is faring well in: the effectiveness of its advertising.\n\nAds promoting Samsung\u2019s phones, televisions and computer hardware represent seven of the 15 most effective ads in the tech hardware business this year, according to research firm Ace Metrix. The tech hardware sector, as defined by Ace, includes manufacturers of cameras, computer hardware, electronics, mobile devices and televisions.\n\nSamsung\u2019s ads for its mobile phones have resonated well with consumers for providing appropriate and relevant information, Ace\u2019s data shows. The brand\u2019s \u201cWater Resistance\u201d spot, which highlights an important feature of the Galaxy S5 phone, had the highest creative effectiveness score in the tech hardware category, according to Ace. Samsung\u2019s \u201cMakes Everyday Better\u201d ad, another spot to promote the Galaxy S5, claimed the second-highest effectiveness score among tech hardware companies while the brand\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Wall Hugger\u201d ad, a commercial that pokes fun at the battery life of rival Apple\u2019s iPhones, landed in the top 10. Aside from phones, Samsung\u2019s \u201cCurved\u201d ad \u2014 which uses a compilation of scenes from movies like \u201cClueless\u201d and \u201cZoolander\u201d to drum up excitement for the brand\u2019s new curved-screen television\u2013 and its \u201cCan Do\u201d ad that touts all the things a Galaxy Pro tablet can do also scored well for effectiveness.\n\n\u201cConsumers thirst for information content when it comes to tech advertising,\u201d said Ace Metrix Chief Executive Peter Daboll. \u201cNot surprisingly, some of the best technology ads according to viewers deliver the ability to convey this meaningful information.\u201d\n\nAds for Nest, Sonos, Intel, Amazon, Beats and Microsoft also landed among Ace\u2019s top 15 most effective ads in the tech hardware space.\n\nInformative and creative advertising, however, doesn\u2019t always translate to big boosts in financial results. Samsung, for example, posted a 60% drop in third-quarter earnings in October amid rising competition, especially from low-cost Chinese smartphone makers. Camera maker Canon came in third on Ace\u2019s list of the most effective tech hardware ads for its high-energy \u201cBring It\u201d spot, but the company reported imaging system sales, which include digital cameras, slipped 9% in the most recent quarter as consumers continue to gravitate towards using the cameras on their smartphones instead.\n\nIn contrast, Apple, which has benefited from strong demand for its new larger-screen smartphones, is far from the top of Ace\u2019s ranking of most effective tech hardware ads. Apple\u2019s most effective ad, according to Ace, is its \u201cPowerful\u201d spot for the iPhone 5S, which came in at No. 33 of the 210 tech hardware ads on Ace\u2019s list.\n\nAce measures an ad\u2019s creative effectiveness based on viewer reaction to national TV ads. A sample of more than 500 people that is representative of the U.S. TV viewing audience scores each ad for traits such as persuasion, likeability and information. The list below represents the top five tech hardware ads that outperformed their product category\u2019s year-to-date norm as of Dec. 4:\n\n1. Samsung\u2019s \u201cWater Resistance\u201d\n\n2. Samsung\u2019s \u201cMakes Everyday Better\u201d\n\n3. Canon\u2019s \u201cBring It\u201d\n\n4. Samsung\u2019s \u201cCurved\u201d\n\n5.
