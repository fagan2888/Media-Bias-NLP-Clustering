To be sure, other factors are influencing medical buildings, but Obamacare is an especially important force these days.\n\nThat\u2019s because solo docs and other smaller medical practices are consolidating, said Stacy Scheer, a senior associate with Colliers\u2019 Healthcare Properties Group. To better handle the effects of reform, including more patients and new insurance regulations, doctors are banding together in larger practices. That lets them cut duplicate spaces such as waiting rooms and restrooms. They\u2019re also making spaces more efficient: Exam rooms are still separate, of course, but doctors are likelier to share offices in single, large \u201cbullpen\u201d these days, rather than keep a private suite, Scheer said. Technological innovations such as electronic medical records and telemedicine also mean less need for space.\n\nOther doctors are closing their offices to join hospital-based practices, or retiring from the field, Scheer said.\n\nAnd then there are the medical groups looking for nontraditional spaces. Clinics are abandoning hospital campuses and moving into shopping centers near residential neighborhoods to be closer to patients.\n\nPut it all together, and you have an oversupply of space: Colliers\u2019 third-quarter market report showed a medical-office vacancy rate of 22.6 percent, the highest since 2004. That\u2019s contributing in a big way to overall office vacancy of 22.3 percent.\n\nScheer said the market will eventually absorb the space, but the city has four years of inventory on the market, and that\u2019s not factoring in new users who build custom space rather than taking up existing suites.\n\nHealth care isn\u2019t completely dragging down the market, though. Summit panelists also said trade-group initiatives to boost medical and wellness tourism could inject new life into the market. That\u2019s because efforts to attract patients to Las Vegas from across the globe will encourage new schools, training facilities and centers of excellence in medical research, training and preventive care, Scheer said.\n\nThose centers, in turn, will absorb larger industrial or flex spaces. Consider the agreement between Roseman University of Health Sciences and the Nevada Cancer Institute to reopen the institute\u2019s shuttered, 184,000-square-foot building in Summerlin as a medical school by 2017.\n\n\u201cI would say the submarket is not quite stable, though I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting any worse as far as vacancy and rental rates,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s on its way to stabilizing.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 The medical-space market may be struggling, but that didn\u2019t stop Gatski Commercial brokers from closing a big deal.\n\nRob Lujan and Jason Simon represented landlord Comm 2006-C8 Office 7455 LLC in a $7 million lease on 32,508 square feet inside Longford Medical Center at 7455 W.
