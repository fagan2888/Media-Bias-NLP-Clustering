Simpson was arrested in 1994 on charges of killing his ex-wife and her friend, until he was acquitted almost 15 months later, it captivated the nation. Here are 10 key events to remember.\n\nTHE KILLINGS\n\nPassers-by, led by the mournful howls of Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s dog, find her body and that of Ron Goldman in front of her condominium in the wealthy Brentwood section of Los Angeles on the night of June 12, 1994. The coroner determines they were attacked by surprise and stabbed multiple times.\n\nTHE BRONCO CHASE\n\nInstead of surrendering as promised five days later, O.J. Simpson flees in a white Ford Bronco driven by his former football teammate Al Cowlings. As authorities pursue the car over 60 miles of Southern California freeways, officers plead by phone with Simpson to surrender as he at times holds a gun to his head. The chase, broadcast live on TV, ends when Cowlings drives him home.\n\nTHE SUICIDE NOTE (OR WAS IT?)\n\nDuring the pursuit, Simpson\u2019s lawyer reads reporters a long, rambling letter many conclude is a suicide note. Although he never explicitly says he plans to kill himself, Simpson does say goodbye to his first wife and numerous friends. He declares he didn\u2019t kill his ex-wife or Goldman and says: \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me. I\u2019ve had a great life.\u201d\n\nTHE DREAM TEAM\n\nAs his case heads to trial, Simpson assembles a high-paid team of the nation\u2019s best defense lawyers. It\u2019s led by flamboyant attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., who coins the term: \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit.\u201d It\u2019s a reference Cochran makes in his closing argument, telling jurors the bloody gloves found at the murder scene and at Simpson\u2019s home were too small for him.\n\nDID THE GLOVES FIT?\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t look like it when Simpson tried them on. Some legal experts say the prosecution lost the case that day. \u201cDon\u2019t do a courtroom demonstration in front of the jury unless you know how it will turn out,\u201d says former federal prosecutor Laurie Levinson.\n\nTHE RACE CARD\n\nDefense attorneys denounced police Officer Mark Fuhrman, who found the bloody glove at Simpson\u2019s house, as a white racist out to frame the black sports hero. After Fuhrman testified in court he hadn\u2019t used racial epithets to describe black people in years, lawyers produced a recording of him repeatedly using the N-word. Time Magazine got caught up in the fray when one of its artists doctored a cover photo of Simpson to make him look darker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "10 Things to Know About the O.J.
