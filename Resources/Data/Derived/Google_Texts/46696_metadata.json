While the newly-evolved Carneyvore\u2122 hasn\u2019t endeared himself to people who already didn\u2019t like him, his more confrontational style is drawing attention to how mainstream media theatricality affects journalism\u2019s mission to inform the public, in the public\u2019s interest.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Carney has never bared his teeth before, but over the past several months, those occurrences have become less exceptions, and more a regular feature of his briefings. Media criticism from behind the podium isn\u2019t new, but while Carney\u2019s predecessor could be cutting, Carney\u2019s status as a former White House correspondent adds extra weight and insight to his jabs. It\u2019s tempting to view Carney\u2019s critiques as merely partisan, but an overarching theme in them is the set of deleterious incentives that televised briefings, and televised news, bring to the Brady Briefing Room. That\u2019s a theme that other White House reporters have long complained about, and copped to.\n\nPrior to becoming an Obama administration spokesman, first for Vice President Joe Biden and then for the President, Jay Carney put in 23 years as a journalist, and whatever you think of the merits of his work, neither political side was ever able to make anything like a \u201cbias\u201dcharge stick. Carney was the consummate down-the-middle reporter, and so it\u2019s silly to think that those years spent on the other side of the podium don\u2019t inform his current actions. Despite the recent fireworks, Carney operates from a sincere desire not to become the story, so when he goes after a reporter, it\u2019s because that\u2019s really all he can stands. The carefully crafted patter contained in most of his responses fulfill the need to protect his boss, but the other stuff? That\u2019s pure Carney.\n\nThe extent to which this helps or hurts the President is a matter of personal taste, but it says something that the only people complaining are ones who already hate this president. However you look at it, the Carneyvore\u2122 is good for business, generating consistently great traffic. His intended audience, however, is much smaller, and will either result in reporters doing a better job, or more moments like these.\n\nHere, in chronological order, are some of the Carneyvore\u2122\u2019s greatest hits:", "article_metadata": {"description": "It seems like only yesterday that Politico was celebrating the bland passive-aggression of White House Press Secretary Jay Carney by cataloging 131 instances in", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/carney1.jpg", "title": "When The Carneyvore\u2122 Attacks: Jay Carney\u2019s Greatest Hits"}, "twitter": {"description": "It seems like only yesterday that Politico was celebrating the bland passive-aggression of White House Press Secretary Jay Carney by cataloging 131 instances in which he prefaced a response with \"I appreciate the question.\"\r\n\r\nThe past several months, however, have seen the rise of a smashmouth spokesman who is perfectly happy to let reporters know that he does not, in fact, appreciate the question.", "title": "When The Carneyvore\u2122 Attacks: Jay Carney's Greatest Hits", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/carney1.jpg", "creator": "@TommyXtopher", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-11-06T15:35:24+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0ae\"", "article_summary": "Media criticism from behind the podium isn\u2019t new, but while Carney\u2019s predecessor could be cutting, Carney\u2019s status as a former White House correspondent adds extra weight and insight to his jabs.\nThat\u2019s a theme that other White House reporters have long complained about, and copped to.\nHere, in chronological order, are some of the Carneyvore\u2122\u2019s greatest hits:\nHis intended audience, however, is much smaller, and will either result in reporters doing a better job, or more moments like these.\nThat\u2019s pure Carney."}
