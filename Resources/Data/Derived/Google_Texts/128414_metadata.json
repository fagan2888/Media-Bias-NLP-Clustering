Any working person who makes under $24,000 qualifies. With the plan, people would receive free insurance from one of the major carriers that covers all essential health benefits.\n\nAccording to a release by ACR Health, the 10 categories the coverage must include in accordance with the Affordable Care Act Legislation are:\n\nAmbulatory patient services, such as doctor\u2019s visits and outpatient services\n\nEmergency services\n\nHospitalization\n\nMaternity and newborn care\n\nMental health and substance use disorder services, including behavior health treatment\n\nPrescription drugs\n\nRehabilitative and habilitative services and devices\n\nLaboratory services\n\nPreventive wellness services and chronic disease management\n\nPediatric services, including oral and vision care\n\nCopays will be low, and there is no deductible, according to Assistant Directory of Support at ACR Health Services Steve Wood.\n\nThose who qualify will either pay about $20 a month or nothing at all depending on income, though the cost does increase for those who have multi-member households. The demographics that could benefit the most are low-wage workers and older adults, according to Wood.\n\n\u201cPeople over the age of 19 who are working in retail, who are maybe working in a restaurant or places like that, that just aren\u2019t earning a lot, so I think this is a great plan for younger people,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut also we have a lot of people who might be 62, who are retiring and collecting a pension that\u2019s not a lot of money; they\u2019re not qualified for Medicare yet.\u201d\n\nWood said the plan might also be an affordable option for people who are self-employed.\n\n\u201cSelf-employed individuals \u2013 we\u2019ll look what your business losses are and what your income losses are, and we\u2019ll count that. That brings a lot of self-employed [rates] down\u201d Wood said.\n\nSince the implementation of Obamacare, Wood said he has seen people helped immensely by these low-cost insurance plans.\n\n\u201cFor the two and a half years we\u2019ve been doing this, we\u2019ve had people come in with significant, with really profound chronic illness \u2013 people with cancer who have not been able to get treated, people with diabetes who can\u2019t get their insulin, people with HIV, all kinds of stuff,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd [we have been] able to get them insurance and get them primary care but also to get them specialists and get their medication.\u201d\n\nHowever, positive benefits are not only limited to those who major have chronic illness, Wood said.\n\n\u201cQuite of people have come in who have had a profound change in their health because of this,\u201d Wood said. You know, you can finally go to the doctor, you can finally go to the dentist, or get glasses.\u201d\n\nFor more information, you can call ACR Health navigators at 1-800-475-2430 to make an appointment, or e-mail navigator@ACRhealth.org.\n\nImportant dates for 2016 Health Insurance enrollment:\n\n(source: ACR Health release)\n\nNovember 1, 2015: Open Enrollment starts \u2013 first day you can enroll in a 2016 insurance plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace.
