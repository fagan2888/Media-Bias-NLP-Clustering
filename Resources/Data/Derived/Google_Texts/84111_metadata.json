The prominent philosopher of science is an advocate for hard-nosed empiricism, and as a leading New Atheist he calls for naturalistic explanations of religion. Dennett is also the co-author (along with Linda LaScola) of the recently expanded and updated Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Faith Behind, which documents the stories of preachers and rabbis who themselves came to see\u2026the facts.\n\nCaught in the Pulpit is a close cousin to The Clergy Project, an outreach effort to \u201ccurrent and former religious professionals who no longer hold supernatural beliefs\u201d\u2014many of whom must closet their newfound skepticism to preserve their careers and communities.\n\nFor Dennett, closeted atheist clergy are not simply tragic figures, they are harbingers of great things to come. Peppered amongst Caught in the Pulpit\u2019s character vignettes are mini-essays in which Dennett predicts a sea change in religious doctrine and practice. Our digital information age, he argues, is ushering in a \u201cnew world of universal transparency\u201d where religious institutions can no longer hide the truth. To survive in an age of transparency, religions will need to come to terms with the facts.\n\nDennett spoke recently with The Cubit about institutional transparency, the parallels between religious and atheistic fundamentalism, and the future of religion.\n\nYou describe non-believing clergy as \u201ccanaries in a coal mine.\u201d Why does this group hold such significance for understanding the future of religion?\n\nI think that we are now entering a really disruptive age in the history of human civilization, thanks to the new transparency brought about by social media and the internet. It used to be a lot easier to keep secrets than it is now.\n\nIn the March issue of Scientific American, Deb Roy and I compare this to the Cambrian Explosion. The Cambrian Explosion happened 540 million years ago, when there was a sudden, very dramatic explosion of different life forms in response to some new change in the world. Oxford zoologist Andrew Parker argues that the increased transparency of the ocean made eyesight possible, and this changed everything: now predators could see prey, and prey could see predators, and this set off an arms race of interactions. Well, we think something similar is happening in human culture. Institutions\u2014not just religions but also universities, armies, corporations\u2014are now faced with how to change their fundamental structure and methods to deal with the fact that everybody\u2019s living in a glass house now.\n\nProtecting your inner workings is becoming very difficult; it\u2019s very hard to keep secrets. Religions have thrived in part because they were able to keep secrets. They were able to keep secrets about other religions from their parishioners, who were largely ignorant of what other people in the world believed, and also keep secrets about their own inner workings and their own histories, so that it was easy to have a sort of controlled message that went out to people. Those days are over. You can go on the Internet and access to all kinds of information. This is going to change everything.\n\nWhich do you think will be more likely: a shift from religiosity to atheism, or a change within religious groups towards more liberal interpretation of scripture?\n\nI don\u2019t see how the traditional credal models of religion are going to be able to withstand this sort of epistemological pressure. I think that we see trends even in traditional evangelical churches that are moving away from doctrine and more into allegiance and ceremony and letting people be more relaxed about what they actually believe.\n\nNow, how well this is going to work, I don\u2019t know. I think there\u2019s a place in the world for organizations that are bound together by tradition, by music and ceremony and texts that they treat as sort of mythic texts, and I think the religions that survive this period are going to deserve to survive. They will be a far cry from what we see today.\n\nBut propositional beliefs about the world are just a small part of religious life. There is much more to religion: family, community, rituals and practices, modes of being. Is the Clergy Project itself perhaps a way for atheists to do more than just talk about belief and non-belief?\n\nMy own view is that we ought to pay attention very closely, gather as much evidence as we can, take advantage of the new transparency: learn, learn, learn, and in turn inform, inform, inform. Get the information out there. And then I\u2019m very laissez-faire about what should happen next. Let people figure out what they\u2019re comfortable with and what they want to do. I don\u2019t want to disturb traditions, unless they are toxic in some way. There are some traditions that are clearly toxic.\n\nThe recent Pew survey shows that Islam is the fastest growing religion, not because people are converting to Islam, but because they\u2019re having more babies. The fertility rate is much higher than that of any other religious group. That means we\u2019re going to have more and more children growing up with the default presumption that they\u2019re Muslims.\n\nI think, however, that it\u2019s not going to be as standard, obvious, or routine for them to stay Muslims when they grow up. Islam has a long, unfortunate tradition of treating apostates very severely, and I think that we\u2019re going to see more of that. And I think that it\u2019s going to backfire.\n\nHow former Muslims or children of Muslims engage in the world in the next 20 years is a very, very important question. And I don\u2019t have any clue as to how it\u2019s going to work out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Caught in the Pulpit\" author Daniel Dennett on closeted atheist clergy and our new age of radical transparency", "title": "The end of religion as we know it: Why churches can no longer hide the truth", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Caught in the Pulpit\" author Daniel Dennett on closeted atheist clergy and our new age of radical transparency", "title": "The end of religion as we know it: Why churches can no longer hide the truth", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/the_end_of_religion_as_we_know_it_why_churches_can_no_longer_hide_the_truth_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/shutterstock_38432584.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Caught in the Pulpit\" author Daniel Dennett on closeted atheist clergy and our new age of radical transparency", "title": "The end of religion as we know it: Why churches can no longer hide the truth", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/shutterstock_38432584.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "ANDREW AGHAPOUR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Daniel Dennett, priests, Religion, Religion Dispatches", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Daniel Dennett, priests, Religion, Religion Dispatches, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on Religion DispatchesIf Daniel Dennett is anything, he is a champion of the facts.\nTo survive in an age of transparency, religions will need to come to terms with the facts.\nOur digital information age, he argues, is ushering in a \u201cnew world of universal transparency\u201d where religious institutions can no longer hide the truth.\nDennett spoke recently with The Cubit about institutional transparency, the parallels between religious and atheistic fundamentalism, and the future of religion.\nI don\u2019t see how the traditional credal models of religion are going to be able to withstand this sort of epistemological pressure."}
