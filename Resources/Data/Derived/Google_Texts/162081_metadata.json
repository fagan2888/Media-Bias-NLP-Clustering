This is significantly higher than in the nation as a whole (32 percent) but comes as no surprise as the Latino population has suffered disproportionately under Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s tenure. Now, a critical part of the Koch infrastructure called the LIBRE Initiative is poised to bring Latinos back into the GOP fold just in time for the 2016 election cycle. The $5 million-a-year organization spreading the gospel of \u201cfree enterprise and personal responsibility\u201d is set to increase its staff by 30 percent, and expand to Wisconsin.\n\nThe organization will have its work cut out for it.\n\nWalker\u2019s first budget proposal after assuming office in 2011 revoked in-state tuition for undocumented students, which lead to widespread protests from students and grassroots organizations. And last year, the governor joined the GOP lawsuit to block President Obama\u2019s executive action to keep families together by giving temporary legal status to five million undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe lawsuit came in the wake of two of Walker\u2019s top officials being fired for racist slurs: the assistant deputy secretary at the Department of Transportation referred to undocumented immigrants as \u201cSatan\u201d on Facebook while Walker\u2019s deputy finance director took to Twitter threatening to choke \u201cthat illegal mex cleaning in the library.\u201d\n\nThe LIBRE Initiative is part of a hidden agenda of \u201cmisinform[ing] the Latino community about the true record of politicians like Governor Scott Walker on issues such as immigration, and to try to convince Latinos to vote against their economic interests\", Christine Neumann-Ortiz, Executive Director of Voces de la Frontera, a grassroots organization defending immigrant and low-wage worker rights, told CMD.\n\nRamping up the Propaganda Machinery\n\nDescribed as a \u201cgrassroots organization,\u201d the LIBRE Initiative is, in fact, a textbook example of astroturfing almost entirely funded by the Koch brothers\u2019 secret bank Freedom Partners. The increased funding is part of a wider strategy to boost the network\u2019s front groups, which was unveiled at the biannual donors summit at the Ritz Carlton in the Palm Springs desert on January 25. It was an apt choice of venue; the same hotel \u201chigh in the graham cracker-colored hills above Rancho Mirage\u201d forms the backdrop for shady financial dealings far from the public\u2019s view in Douglas Coupland\u2019s bestseller Generation X. A character is spotted hobnobbing with \u201ca mafioso type while counting a wad of bills \u2026 Afterward she denied she was there.\u201d\n\nThe Koch conference also featured money changing hands behind closed doors. Tons of it. In fact, the mega donors are slated to contribute to an $889 million war chest for 2016. A significant part of the money raised will go toward boosting the network of nonprofits funded and coordinated by the Koch brothers, a source told Politico. The plan is to hire hundreds of new staff for these front groups, which include Americans for Prosperity, Concerned Veterans of America, Generation Opportunity, and the LIBRE Initiative. These are all part and parcel of the propaganda infrastructure, but they cater to different demographics.\n\nMisleading the Public on Immigration Reform\n\nLIBRE was founded in 2011 by Daniel Garza, a former aide to George W. Bush, who went straight to \u201crepresentatives of the Koch family\u201d to launch the group. Almost all of the LIBRE funding has come through conduits for Koch money, such as Freedom Partners, which contributed $6.4 million from 2012 to 2013, and the now defunct TC4 Trust.\n\nWhile the organization\u2019s no-taxes-no-welfare stance is aligned with Koch brothers\u2019 agenda, two things set it apart from other groups in the network. First, the LIBRE Initiative pushes its network not only through organizing, but also by providing direct social services, such as health checkups, in Latino communities. And second, it campaigns for immigration reform.\n\nBut make no mistake about the immigration agenda. This has nothing to do with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants; instead, the organization promotes \u201cwhat it calls a \u2018market-based\u2019 solution that emphasizes border security and work visas \u2026 which can lead to a class of workers with limited options for becoming citizens as they age,\u201d as Ed Morales warned in a recent piece in The Progressive.\n\nTrue to its astroturf nature, LIBRE tries to \u201crope less-informed activists\u201d into its fold to create the appearance of a grassroots movement. It does so by being intentionally vague as to what its immigration agenda really is. The organization\u2019s splash page, for example, is set in stars-and-stripes colors while calling for volunteers for immigration reform. \u201cWe\u2019re all in it together!\u201d (\u201c\u00a1Estamos Contigo Por Una Reforma Migratoria!\u201d) But there are no specifics, no policy document, no FAQ \u2013 no mention of the fact that citizenship is not on the table.\n\n\u201cThe billionaire Koch brothers and their friend Governor Walker should know that to be truly free or \u2018Libre\u2019 in the United States, means to live free from fear of deportations, free from the fear of police because you lack a driver license, and free from poverty and discrimination,\u201d said Christine Neumann-Ortiz.\n\n\"Freedom\" from Affordable Health Care\n\nAs CMD has reported, it has become clear in the years since the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act that the grassroots clamor over the bill from the right was almost entirely manufactured by Koch front groups, with massive expenditures via Freedom Partners, the Center for Protect Patient Rights, Americans for Prosperity and 60 Plus Association.\n\nLibre is now joining the clamor. During the Midterms, the organization spent money on phony issue ads attacking Latino Democrat candidates, especially those championing the Affordable Care Act, such as Representatives Pete Gallego of Texas and Joe Garc\u00eda of Florida. \"The Libre Initiative has no interest in actually solving problems,\" said Anthony Guti\u00e9rrez, Gallego campaign spokesman. \"It exists to play dirty politics and lie to the Latino community.\"\n\nThe hypocrisy is clear. As Matt A. Barreto, a political scientist at UCLA, pointed out in an interview with El Paso Times: \u201cGarza claims to be speaking in the interest of Hispanics, but in opposing Obamacare, he\u2019s flying in the face of Hispanic opinion \u2026 There\u2019s overwhelming support for a government role in healthcare among Hispanics \u2026 It\u2019s also the group with the greatest percentage of uninsured. They have the most to benefit from health care reform.\u201d\n\nIt is yet to be seen what issues the Koch's Libre thinks will resonate with Wisconsin voters, but the organization recently put out a press release touting the benefits of anti-union \"right to work\" policies. As CMD recently reported, ALEC \"right to work\" zones have been proposed for inner-city Milwaukee where many Latinos live.\n\nLearn more about the Libre Initiative at Sourcewatch.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin is home to nearly 335,000 Latinos, and 40 percent of these self-identify as Democrats.
