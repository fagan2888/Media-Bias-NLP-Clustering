Bush.\n\nIt was in that week each year for the eight years I covered him as a reporter that he gave me a spectacular gift \u2014 and he knew it.\n\nI started covering the newly elected president in 2000, when I was in my 30s. Back then, as a reporter for The Washington Times, we went everywhere the president went. If he went to Charlotte, North Carolina, to give a 30-minute speech on an airport tarmac, we went. Up at 4 a.m., an hourlong commute to Andrews Air Force Base, in place on the ground hours before POTUS landed, and there for hours and hours after he left \u2014 sometimes right through the evening news so network reporters could file live from the site.\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nWe also went with the president to Texas every summer \u2014 often for a month \u2014 and every winter, too, over the holidays.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: In December, we never left Washington, D.C., until the day after Christmas. Never. Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, would always depart the White House a few days before the holiday and hunker down at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. After a few years, I asked a low-level White House staffer why.\n\nI still remember what she said: \u201cSo all of us can be with our families on Christmas.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Naughty or Nice: NFL cheerleaders in holiday costumes\n\nWho was \u201cus\u201d? Hundreds and hundreds of people, that\u2019s who. Sure, the reporters who covered the president, but also dozens and dozens on his staff, 100 Secret Service agents, maybe more, and all of those city cops required whenever the president\u2019s on the move in D.C.\n\nFor me, that one-day delay was huge. My kids were 6 and 8 years old when Mr. Bush took office. When he went home to Prairie Chapel that last time in 2009, my girl was driving, the boy was 6 foot 1. But in the meantime, I was home for eight Christmas mornings, playing Santa, stoking the fire, mixing up hot chocolates.\n\nThat was President Bush. And every year for the past five, I\u2019ve thought about what that meant to me. (By the way, some years, I got holiday duty, which meant I was off to Waco, Texas, the day after Christmas. But once again, the Bush White House had us covered: A press plane flew out with the president, and back then, reporters could pay $100 per family member for the plane ride. So sometimes, the family went along. For the kids, it was an adventure; for me, well, we were all together.)\n\nAll that has changed with President Obama. No more press plane, for one. Reporters are on their own \u2014 so taking family is, say, $1,000 a pop. Not likely. And this president would never delay his trip to his island getaway. He\u2019s off every year well before Christmas. Hundreds and hundreds head off with him, leaving family behind.\n\nNo Christmas at home. Instead, the Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Nice, but not exactly home.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s why I think of George W. Bush every year in the week between Christmas and New Year\u2018s. Probably will till I die.
