Getting young Americans to sign up for health insurance has been a big challenge for Obamacare officials. A new report from payroll processor ADP finds that the nation's largest companies also have had trouble persuading the majority of young employees to enroll for coverage.

"With a lot of organizations that we talk to, it's still a question of the younger generation needing to become more aware," said David Marini, a vice president and managing director with ADP. "As the penalties for not having insurance start to kick, there's an expectation that they will take up more."
