Small business organizations say they're seeing a huge influx of local farmers who can no longer afford their workers' health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

The Obama administration offered an extension to let small business owners keep their policies last fall. But the year is almost up. Farmers are now being quoted much higher insurance premiums because of the mandates.

That's the case for Hope Valley Farms in Quarryville, Lancaster County. Six full-time workers milk hundreds of cows there three times a day.

"We're unlike corporations where we can pass costs onto the consumer, we take a 100 pounds of milk to market, we take what we get," says owner Gerry DeLong.

Premiums went up 47% for their health insurance coverage.

The farm's owner is now paying for Health Savings Accounts for his employees so they will still be covered.

On Thursday, the House will take up a bill to allow small businesses to keep their plans through 2018. But the Obama administration says they will veto it. They say it would allow insurers to continue to discriminate on issues like pre-existing conditions.
