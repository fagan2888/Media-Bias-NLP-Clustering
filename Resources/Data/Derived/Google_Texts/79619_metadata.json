They are, or course, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nCruz and Rubio are both children of Cuban immigrants, who can tell a story about realizing the American Dream. Bush has a more complicated narrative. Having been born into one of the first families of American politics, he married a Mexican woman, speaks fluent Spanish, and has proven himself willing to buck anti-immigration hardliners within his party.\n\nRelated: With Credibility Slipping, Clinton Pushes Back on Benghazi Probe\n\nThe GOP has had trouble capturing anything beyond a small slice of the growing Latino vote. The last Republican to win the Presidency, George W. Bush, did so by capturing 44 percent in the 2004 election. In the years since, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote has dwindled. John McCain won 31 percent in 2008, and Mitt Romney took only 27 percent in 2012.\n\nRecapturing the same level of Hispanic support that George W. Bush enjoyed is central to any successful Republican presidential bid, said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster and author of a new book, 2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America.\n\nAyres, who is working for Marco Rubio, said it\u2019s obvious that Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the country and will hold increasing influence with every passing presidential election, especially in a number of swing states like Florida, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and ultimately Texas. \u201cSo gaining a significantly larger share of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney was able to do in 2012 will be absolutely critical for any Republican nominee in 2016,\u201d he said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nAyres said that Republicans would need close to a majority \u2013 at least 45 percent of the Hispanic vote -- to win. So being able to identify closely with the Hispanic community is a major asset to a Republican contender.\n\nThat won\u2019t be easy, says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. \u201cHispanics lean heavily to the Democratic party in a polarized age when party identification matters greatly. Turnout may be the key for the GOP. Are Hispanics energized (2012) or not energized (2014) to show up at the polls?\u201d\n\nCan Any GOP Candidate Carry the Day?\n\nOf the three candidates who can tell Hispanic voters a story that might just resonate, how do they stack up?\n\nIt\u2019s probably best, up front, to dispense with Ted Cruz. The only one of the three who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, Cruz is a hardliner on immigration and, according to most analysts, isn\u2019t likely to inspire much loyalty among Latino voters.\n\nRelated: U.S. Hispanic Voters Likely to Double by 2030\n\n\u201cAt least right now, Ted Cruz is one of those candidates who has no idea what it means to appeal to Latino voters,\u201d said Cesar Vargas, co-director of the Dream Action Coalition, which advocates for undocumented immigrants. \u201cHe\u2019s just offering very transparent sound bites about how Latino voters value the family. We obviously love our families, but Latino voters are asking \u2018What are you doing to help our families?\u2019\u201d\n\nAmy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report, was more succinct. \u201cTed Cruz?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not even trying.\u201d\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has made his life story a cornerstone of his campaign. His father, a hotel bartender, and his mother, a hotel maid, raised him mainly in South Florida. He became a lawyer, rose quickly through the Florida legislature, and jumped to the United States Senate before his 40th birthday.\n\nRubio made a name for himself on immigration issues by joining the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators who proposed a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. The bill died in the Senate, and Rubio had to walk back his support for it in the face of withering attacks from the anti-immigration right.\n\nHowever, according to Vargas, the mere fact that he tried carries a lot of meaning. \u201cHe showed he was willing to take on a fight,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Will an Overcrowded Field Ruin the GOP\u2019s Chances in 2016?\n\nBush has also demonstrated that he is willing to push back against the most anti-immigration elements of the GOP. He memorably described illegal immigration as an \u201cact of love\u201d by individuals trying to better their families\u2019 lives. Of course, politicians looking to secure the Latino vote need to address other issues as well said Clarissa Martinez-De-Castro, the deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza.\n\n\u201cImmigration is not the only issue that Hispanics care about,\u201d she said on MSNBC, but it is one that Hispanic voters are watching very carefully in assessing the candidates. As for the relative appeal of Jeb Bush, Rubio and Cruz, she said, \u201cLatinos have shown in many elections in the past that they are willing to look at candidates based on their positions, regardless of what party they belong to.\u201d\n\nAyres agreed that while Hispanics are more concerned about bread and butter economic issues than immigration, \u201cImmigration is a threshold issue \u2013 it\u2019s a symbolic issue that sends a signal to Hispanics that we do or do not want you as part of the center-right coalition.\u201d\n\nRelated: Carson and Fiorina \u2013 Two Ankle Biters Join the GOP Pack\n\nAny Republican who gets the nomination has to confront the fact that the GOP faces a terrible map in presidential elections. Democrats start out with a sizeable advantage in terms of reliably Democratic states. The big question is whether a Republican candidate able to move a significant fraction of the Hispanic vote into the GOP\u2019s column would, by doing so, be able to flip important swing states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely achievable,\u201d says Walter of the Cook Political Report. \u201cLook at Colorado, Virginia, Nevada \u2013 three states where the population growth and the shift in terms of its movement from Republican-leaning to Democrat leaning states has really been among Latino voters. Even North Carolina could be another place.\u201d She said, \u201cYou win enough of the Hispanic vote, that\u2019s going to pick you up Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, and North Carolina. You win those, you\u2019re probably president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAyres agree that it\u2019s doable, adding that Florida \u2013 where Rubio and Bush both have the advantage of being de facto native sons \u2013 is also necessary. \u201cFlorida is absolutely critical for building a Republican majority in the Electoral College,\u201d he said. \u201cTexas is as well but it\u2019s more likely to fall into the Republican Party by the natural course of human events.\u201d\n\nRelated: GOP\u2019s Iffy Future as Hispanic Population Grows\n\nAyres said George W. Bush set the model in 2004 when he won 26 percent of the non-white vote overall and 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. He reached out very aggressively to Hispanic voters and also supported reforming a broken immigration system. \u201cThat is not sufficient to win Hispanic votes, but it\u2019s pretty hard to gain a significant share of the Hispanic vote if your position is that you want to deport 11 million Hispanics,\u201d he said, referring to Mitt Romney\u2019s position in the 2012 election.\n\nSylvia Manzano, an official with Latino Decisions, a polling and advocacy group, agrees that the Republican Party and conservative groups have been aggressive this year in reaching out to Hispanic voters in an effort to reverse the recent trends, and that a \u201cgood chunk\u201d of the Latino vote may be up for grabs in the 2016 general election campaign.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty for the [Republican] party is that the party has invested resources in this go-round, but they also are kind of stuck with people who have been really hostile and have said some pretty inflammatory things in the immigration discourse and supported really punitive policies,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a difficult thing for the candidates to do \u2013 to distance themselves from the [controversial Sheriff] Joe Arpaio of Arizona or Rep. [Steve] King of Iowa. . . . That\u2019s a difficult dance for them to do.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the increasingly crowded GOP primary field, there are three candidates who have som", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Path to Victory with the Hispanic Voter", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/06/GOP-s-Path-Victory-Hispanic-Voter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04242012_Marco_Rubio_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/06/GOP-s-Path-Victory-Hispanic-Voter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04242012_Marco_Rubio_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In the increasingly crowded GOP primary field, there are three candidates who have som", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Ayres said that Republicans would need close to a majority \u2013 at least 45 percent of the Hispanic vote -- to win.\nOf the three candidates who can tell Hispanic voters a story that might just resonate, how do they stack up?\nHe reached out very aggressively to Hispanic voters and also supported reforming a broken immigration system.\nIn the years since, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote has dwindled.\nEven North Carolina could be another place.\u201d She said, \u201cYou win enough of the Hispanic vote, that\u2019s going to pick you up Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, and North Carolina."}
