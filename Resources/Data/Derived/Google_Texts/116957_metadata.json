Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\u201d the president said.\n\nThe plans are already considered dead on Capitol Hill, however, where Republicans who hold majorities in both houses after November\u2019s elections questioned why a president whose party got pasted in the November elections chose to pick a futile fight on taxes rather than offer overtures that could be the basis for common ground.\n\nHouse Committee on Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, Texas Republican, called the president\u2019s plan \u201ctrickle-down taxes,\u201d and said the increased taxes on the wealthy will end up costing the poor anyway by raising prices for borrowing.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t want two sets of rules \u2014 one for the wealthy, who\u2019ll never need a loan from a bank to buy a car, a new refrigerator or a home, and one for everyone else. But Obama\u2019s plan to put a tax on consumer loans will do exactly that,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.\n\nThe fight comes as Mr. Obama\u2019s record on taxes is hotly debated.\n\nHe signed the biggest tax increase in history, measured in raw dollars, when he approved the Affordable Care Act, which included taxes on everything from high-value health plans to an increase on the capital gains tax that primarily hits the wealthy.\n\nHe also signed one of the largest tax cuts in history when he agreed to the 2013 deal to avert the so-called \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d which made many of the Bush-era tax cuts permanent for all but the richest Americans. By one budget calculation, that amounted to a $4 trillion tax cut over the course of a decade.\n\nAnd throughout, his efforts to tax the wealthy have met with resistance from congressional Republicans.\n\n\u201cUp to this point he has to be viewed as somebody who\u2019s tried to make the tax code a bit more progressive again, but who hasn\u2019t tried very hard in the face of obvious opposition from the other side of the aisle,\u201d said Robert C. Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School who teaches monetary law and economics. \u201cReasonable minds can disagree as to whether he capitulated too easily or whether he recognized futility when he saw it.\u201d\n\nMr. Hockett said he was happy to see Mr. Obama take a stronger approach in Tuesday\u2019s address, facing the final two years of his tenure with little to lose, and also a chance to set the agenda for the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nThough he\u2019s proposed tax increases before, such as the \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d which would impose a new minimum tax on millionaires, Tuesday\u2019s address saw Mr. Obama link those tax increases on the wealthy explicitly to tax breaks for the poor and middle class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to attack the top 1 percent. They are a very easy target. Numberswise, they\u2019re small yet very powerful,\u201d said Thomas B. Cooke, a professor who studies tax law at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business.\n\nBut he said Americans \u201cneed to remind ourselves that many of the people in the top 1 percent have helped the economy become as strong as it is.\u201d\n\nThe top 1 percent have an annual household income of slightly more than $500,000 and, as of the latest statistics, paid slightly more than one-third of the total tax burden. By contrast, the bottom 90 percent of taxpayers paid slightly less than a third. The remaining 19 percent paid the rest, according to Tax Foundation statistics.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s new proposals include raising the top capital gains tax rate to 28 percent, saying it should go back to the level it was at under President Reagan.\n\nBut Mr. Cooke said that\u2019s misleading, because the top tax rate overall was 28 percent under Reagan, and the 1993 Clinton tax increase raised the income rate while cutting the capital gains rate.\n\nThe tax increases on the wealthy would go to pay for Mr. Obama\u2019s new plans: two years of free community college education for all Americans, a new tax credit for couples where both parents work, raising the Earned Income Tax Credit and tripling the maximum child care tax credit to $3,000 per child.\n\nMr. Cooke, though, said instead of specific tax policies that play Americans against each other, the country would have been better served if Mr. Obama had proposed a broad tax simplification plan that could stimulate the economy.\n\nHe also said the repeated fights between the president and Congress over taxes have left taxpayers in the lurch.\n\nTaxpayers went all of 2014 not knowing whether a large set of tax breaks that expired at the beginning of the year would be extended. Congress and the president finally agreed on a one-year extension in December, 11 months after the breaks expired and just before the new tax year began.\n\n\u201cHere we are, Jan. 2015, and I can\u2019t even tell you what the law is for 2015,\u201d Mr. Cooke said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has been in office exactly six years, and the wealthiest have never had it so good \u2014 and even the 2013 tax increase hasn't been able to dampen their climb.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama has been in office exactly six years, and the wealthiest have never had it so good \u2014 and even the 2013 tax increase hasn\u2019t been able to dampen their climb.", "title": "Obama, in State of the Union, celebrates improving economy with call for tax hikes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/20/obama-in-state-of-the-union-celebrates-improving-e/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/20/tax.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/20/tax.jpg", "description": "President Obama has been in office exactly six years, and the wealthiest have never had it so good \u2014 and even the 2013 tax increase hasn't been able to dampen their climb.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama, in State of the Union, celebrates improving economy with call f"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Social Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e05\"", "article_summary": "Numberswise, they\u2019re small yet very powerful,\u201d said Thomas B.
