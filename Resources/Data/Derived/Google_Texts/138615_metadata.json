Grand jury indicts Silver in N.Y.\n\nA federal grand jury has indicted former New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver on corruption charges, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York announced Thursday.\n\nSilver, an immensely powerful figure in New York politics for decades, was arrested by FBI agents last month on multiple counts of corruption charges. Federal prosecutors alleged that Silver, who served as Assembly speaker since 1994 before stepping down shortly after his arrest, received about $700,000 in bribes and kickbacks from a real estate law firm. Federal authorities also said that Silver made about $5.3 million from Weitz & Luxenberg, a private law firm where he worked for more than a decade, despite the fact that he \u201cnever performed any legal work whatsoever,\u201d according to U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe indictment, released Thursday afternoon, alleges that Silver \u201cengaged in a secret and corrupt scheme to deprive the citizens of the state of his honest services as an elected legislator\u201d by masking the millions of dollars he made illegally as \u201clegitimate income.\u201d\n\nIt also argues that Silver made efforts \u201cto conceal his corrupt sources of outside income from the Moreland Commission,\u201d the anti-corruption probe whose cases Bharara has taken over following Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s decision to shut it down last year.\n\nSilver\u2019s attorneys, Joel Cohen and Steven Molo, said they would keep \u201cfighting\u201d to exonerate Silver.\n\n\u201cWe can now begin to fight for his total vindication. We will do our fighting where it should be done: in court,\u201d the two said in a joint statement obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe attorney\u2019s office first announced the indictment on Twitter on Thursday afternoon.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that the case has been assigned to District Court Judge Valerie Caproni, former FBI general counsel and enforcement officer at the SEC.\n\nSilver, a Manhattan Democrat, remains a member of the Assembly but ceded his power in the Democratic conference days after he was arrested. He has maintained his innocence since his arrest.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He was arrested by FBI agents last month on multiple counts of corruption charges.", "title": "Grand jury indicts Silver in N.Y.", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/sheldon-silver-indicted-grand-jury-115322.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/19/20150219_sheldonsilver_getty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Sheldon Silver,New York,Corruption,Democrats,Grand Jury", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He was arrested by FBI agents last month on multiple counts of corruption charges.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Grand jury indicts Silver in N.Y.A federal grand jury has indicted former New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver on corruption charges, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York announced Thursday.\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Silver received around $700,000 in bribes and kickbacks from a real estate law firm.\nSilver, a Manhattan Democrat, remains a member of the Assembly but ceded his power in the Democratic conference days after he was arrested.\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Silver, who served as Assembly speaker since 1994 before stepping down shortly after his arrest, received about $700,000 in bribes and kickbacks from a real estate law firm.\nSilver, an immensely powerful figure in New York politics for decades, was arrested by FBI agents last month on multiple counts of corruption charges."}
