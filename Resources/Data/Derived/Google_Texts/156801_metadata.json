His sculptures are exhibited all over the world alongside those of other modernists -- yet both of his parents were still considered Chiricahua Apache prisoners of war until shortly before Allan\u2019s birth.\n\nThe inspiration for Houser\u2019s art can be found in many sources. He drew not only upon his own Apache roots, but also from other Oklahoma and Southwestern Tribes. Houser studied the contemporary art movements of his lifetime as well, finding ways to incorporate their forms into his own work.\n\nAlthough he is known primarily for his sculpture and paintings, he was also highly interested in drawing, and illustrated children\u2019s books for at least a decade, from 1952-1962. In his last years, much of his art focused solely on drawing. However, Houser died before he could have an exhibit that featured his drawings.\n\nThroughout 2014, many Oklahoma museums are collaborating to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Houser\u2019s birth. The University of Oklahoma's Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art has chosen to pay homage to Houser by exhibiting 100 of his drawings, on loan from the Allan Houser Estate, from March 8 to May 18.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jackson Rushing of the OU School of Art and Art History, showing Houser\u2019s art is \u201ca realization of a dream deferred.\u201d Indian Country Today Media Network had the chance to ask Rushing, the guest curator of the exhibit, a few questions about Houser\u2019s work.\n\nWhat can people learn about Houser\u2019s art by his drawings?\n\nDrawings have such an immediacy to them. They give us remarkable access to the inner workings of an artist\u2019s mind. In many cases, we can see [Houser] visually thinking out loud and follow the creative process. They\u2019re pretty remarkable in terms of the intimate access they give us.\n\nWhat makes Houser unique among other artists\u2014not just Native artists, but artists as a whole?\n\nOne of the things that I find interesting and exciting about him was his artistic independence. He\u2019s one of the few Native American artists\u2014certainly of his generation\u2014who had wide-ranging interests beyond the world of Indian art. He was interested in modern British sculpture. He was interested in Charlie Russell and Frederic Remington and so-called cowboy artists of the Old West. In a single sketching moment, he could be thinking about modern British art that was about Pre-Columbian sculpture or he could be thinking about Navajo shepherds on horseback out in the countryside. He could really mix things up.\n\nWhy is Houser significant in the history of Native art, specifically?\n\nIn the world of Native art, he was a part of a small group of artists\u2014maybe no more than five or six artists of his generation\u2014who were determined to be, on the one hand, nurtured by tradition, but not be constricted by tradition. Apache stories and ceremonies were important for him, but so was the larger world of art\u2014European or Native. He was interested in a wide variety of things.\n\nWere any other of these drawings from the exhibit used in other media\u2014a study to create sculpture or other paintings?\n\nI think one reason Alan made lots of drawings that are related to sculpture is that you can only part so much marble and cast so much bronze. He had so many ideas about three-dimensional art that, to satisfy his interest in sculptural form, he made lots of drawings for and about sculpture. It\u2019s a way of being sculptural without actually having to carve marble and cast bronze, which is a very time-consuming process.\n\nWhat can the public learn about humanity, as a whole, by looking at Houser\u2019s works?\n\nThey speak directly to indigenous experience in Oklahoma and the Southwest. At the same time, I think many people would agree they transcend that. They are about a larger sense of humanity\u2014the strength and the character, the survival they seem to make manifest in the universal human quality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A gallery of drawings by the late modernist sculptor Allan Houser, Apache, plus an interview with a curator from the Fred Jones Museum.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/11-little-seen-drawings-modernist-apache-sculptor-allan-houser-153525", "type": "article", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "11 Little-Seen Drawings by Modernist Apache Sculptor Allan Houser"}, "abstract": "A gallery of drawings by the late modernist sculptor Allan Houser, Apache, plus an interview with a curator from the Fred Jones Museum.", "dc": {"title": "11 Little-Seen Drawings by Modernist Apache Sculptor Allan Houser"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/11-little-seen-drawings-modernist-apache-sculptor-allan-houser-153525", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Allan Houser, Sculpture, Drawing, Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, Apache, Modernism, Native American Sculpture, American Indian Sculpture", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-12T15:00-05:00", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "11 Little-Seen Drawings by Modernist Apache Sculptor Allan Houser"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02ea\"", "article_summary": "What makes Houser unique among other artists\u2014not just Native artists, but artists as a whole?\nThe inspiration for Houser\u2019s art can be found in many sources.\nWhat can people learn about Houser\u2019s art by his drawings?\nWhy is Houser significant in the history of Native art, specifically?\nHouser studied the contemporary art movements of his lifetime as well, finding ways to incorporate their forms into his own work."}
