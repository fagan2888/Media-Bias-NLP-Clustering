The official said this figure includes all of the company\u2019s contracts for a Health and Human Services Department program over the last seven years, covering 114 transactions. The cost of building healthcare.gov was issued under this contract.\n\nTurns out healthcare.gov didn\u2019t cost $634 million to build. Share:\n\nThe official noted CGI was awarded the contract to build the website through a competitive procurement process.\n\nEven though the site didn\u2019t cost upwards of $600 million to build, many are still questioning why \u2014 with the $93.7 million tag \u2014 it still wasn\u2019t up to snuff.\n\nAn AP-GfK poll released Tuesday found that 7 percent of Americans had somebody in their household try to sign up, which could represent about 20 million people. Just one in 10 people who tried to sign up succeeded in purchasing health insurance. Of those who signed up, about 75 percent said they experienced problems with the process, and 40 percent of Americans felt the launch hasn\u2019t gone well.\n\nOverall, the the AP-GfK poll, conducted Oct. 3 through Oct. 7, found 28 percent of Americans support the overall framework of the Affordable Care Act, 38 percent are opposed and 32 percent don\u2019t have an opinion either way. Asked specifically whether the government should be able to require all Americans to buy insurance or face a fine, only about three in 10 Americans agreed, with 68 percent opposed.\n\nOthers blasted the federal site\u2019s design, which requires people to sign up with an account before they go \u201cwindow shopping\u201d for healthcare options, as opposed to anonymous shopping.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to give information so it can be tracked when I\u2019m simply looking for information,\u201d Maureen Bardusk of Galena, Ill., said, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of a marketing scheme,\u201d she added. \u201cI assume they set it up that way so they could see who\u2019s coming in, how many times they come in and what they buy after they get there\u2026but that isn\u2019t really customer-oriented.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Office of Budget and Management immediately returned requests for comment from TheBlaze about the cost of the website and fixing the system\u2019s glitches.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "While the federal website to signup for Obamacare was riddled with errors and had a rocky rollout, it didn't cost $634 million to build.
