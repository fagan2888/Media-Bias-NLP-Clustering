D.C. mayoral candidate Muriel Bowser has a new high-profile supporter — President Obama.

On Monday, the Democratic nominee for mayor received an endorsement from the Democratic president in the three-way mayor’s race.

“As we continue our efforts to move our country’s economy forward, I know I’ll be able to count on Muriel to expand opportunity for all,” Mr. Obama said in a statement released by Ms. Bowser’s campaign. “That’s why I’m asking for you to vote for her in the general election this November.”

Two former Republicans turned independent candidates — Council member David A. Catania and former Council member Carol Schwartz — are trying to sway the District’s majority Democratic voters to turn away from Ms. Bowser.

The heavily Democratic city has never elected a mayor who was not a Democrat.

Mr. Obama hasn’t always made his support known in local races.

Former Mayor Adrian Fenty asked Mr. Obama for his endorsement before he was unseated by Vincent C. Gray in the 2010 Democratic mayoral primary, but the president stayed mum on the issue.

The Bowser campaign capitalized on the endorsement by sending out email blasts Monday announcing the news and asking for $44 campaign donations.

“I am extremely honored to receive President Obama’s endorsement,” Ms. Bowser said in a statement. “We share a progressive vision, believing that we only succeed when opportunity is available to everyone.”
