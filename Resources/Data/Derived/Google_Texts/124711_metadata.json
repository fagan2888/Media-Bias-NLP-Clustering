Forrest High School in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nFirst Coast News reports that Duval Superintendent Nikolai Vitti wants the student body to come up with a new name for their school, which could go up to a vote during the January meeting.\n\nThe school has a majority of African American students, about 61 percent, so having a namesake like Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan isn\u2019t really fitting.\n\nRELATED: 5 More Monuments Guaranteed to Drive Natives Nuts\n\n\u201cHe should be relinquished to history,\u201d said a community member at Monday night\u2019s special meting, according to First Coast News. \u201cTo fade away out of the memory of man forever.\u201d\n\nOthers feel the cost of changing the name is too high at up to $400,000 factoring in signage and uniform costs. Vitti plans on asking the community for help.\n\nBut the board says they were supporting what the students want, 64 percent voted in favor of the name change.\n\n\u201cMy vote tonight does not reflect judgment of a man,\u201d said School Board Member Ashley Smith Juarez, according to First Coast News. \u201cI am not called to judge. My vote tonight honors the voice of students.\u201d\n\nOmotayo Richmond collected more than 162,000 signatures through a Change.org petition to get the school\u2019s name changed. Now, the online petition has the word \u201cVictory\u201d emblazoned on the top of it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Jacksonville is home to Nathan Bedford Forrest High School, named in honor of a Confederate general who infamously slaughtered Black Union soldiers who\u2019d already surrendered and who was a founding member of the original Ku Klux Klan,\u201d Richmond says in the petition. \u201cThe school got its name in 1959, when white civic leaders wanted to protest a court decision that called for integrating public schools. I don\u2019t want my daughter, or any student, going to a school named under those circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe feels like the board\u2019s decision to change the name is a win for everyone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad that we had the opportunity to smash some old paradigm of hate and racism here in Jacksonville,\u201d Richmond told First Coast News. \u201cThis city is too beautiful for that blemish to be on it.\u201d\n\nFollowing a court order, the school was integrated in 1971. It now has a student body of more than 1,300 students, of which 61.6 percent are black, 22.9 percent are white, 8.7 percent are Hispanic, 2.6 percent are Asian, 3.9 percent re multi-racial and 0.3 percent are American Indian, reports News 4 JAX.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday, December 16, the Duval County School Board voted unanimously to change the name of Nathan B.
