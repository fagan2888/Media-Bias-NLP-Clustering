On the other, you had the curtain pulled back on medical tech startups like Theranos, revealing that the bar is pretty high for venture-funded projects to succeed in that space.\n\nSandi Peterson is the Group Worldwide Chairman at Johnson & Johnson, the consumer and health goods company that has been around for more than a century. In a conversation with Re/code earlier this week at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Peterson gave the incumbent\u2019s take on how Silicon Valley is changing medical practices and technology worldwide.\n\nPeterson has quite the portfolio; she\u2019s responsible for two-thirds of the employees across J&J companies, and she oversees all consumer business; the consumer medical device business; health and wellness; tech business and partnerships; supply chain management; global design; and operating infrastructure. In a wide-ranging conversation, she discussed the ways that Obamacare weaves technology into the health care system, how to work with regulators and more.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nRe/code: Johnson & Johnson is over 100 years old, and most people don\u2019t think of it as a major tech player. What kind of investments in tech is the company making?\n\nSandi Peterson: Because of the breadth of what we do as a company, we think about using tech to enable better access to patient information. We go from baby powder to biologics. We have a large health and wellness business, we\u2019ve started the Human Performance Institute to research individual health choices, and one of the historical challenges is, \u201cHow do you serve this information to a person?\u201d You couldn\u2019t do it well until five or six years ago, with the advent of mobile tech, machine learning, data and sensors.\n\nCan you talk about your partnership with Google to launch a company focused on robot-assisted surgery?\n\nIt\u2019s one example of many things we\u2019re doing. A simple way to think about the partnership is that if you go to the best hospital in the world with the best-trained surgeon, they\u2019ve had lots of surgical training that the average surgeon hasn\u2019t. Johnson & Johnson was the first company to create minimally invasive surgery, this is the next evolution. How can you do robotic-assisted surgeries to help people have the same standard of expertise?\n\nWhat are other technology-oriented partnerships you\u2019ve entered into, aside from Google?\n\nWell, we made an announcement last spring with IBM and Apple on what we call planned surgical [procedures like knee and hip replacements). We\u2019re creating an end-to-end process to bring tech knowledge and expertise to that whole experience, connecting it to patients\u2019 records. There are a ton of different things we\u2019re doing with insurance companies, as well.\n\nLast year, there was a lot of controversy centered around Theranos and its technology struggles, which has prompted a larger conversation about Silicon Valley\u2019s push to get into medical technology and dealing with regulation. As an incumbent, how do you view these tech industry efforts?\n\nThere was another set of tech companies in the dot-com era that said they were gonna revolutionize health and wellness, like Healtheon. You probably don\u2019t remember it. The reality is that unless you understand the regulatory environment and payment structure, you can\u2019t revolutionize it. I think most tech companies and startups have come to this realization, that you have to partner with people in the ecosystem. You have got to do it together, and we have lots of partnerships with tech companies and startups to make this work.\n\nWhat do you think are the health technology plays from established companies like J&J that don\u2019t get talked about enough?\n\nLast week we announced that we created the first ever health and wellness accelerator, in partnership with [tech investor] Plug and Play. In typical accelerator fashion, we\u2019re gonna have a bunch of early-stage companies, and the ones that make sense, we will fund. We\u2019ll provide coaching and counseling to support independent companies. It\u2019s a huge opportunity to use tech solutions that are more people-specific, like actually providing patients with data information to treat things like diabetes and mental health.\n\nCompanies like Apple and Fitbit are moving more and more into personal health with devices like fitness trackers and software that monitors user information. How do wearables and similar tools fit into your approach?\n\nWe work with wearables \u2014 Apple, Fitbit, etc. \u2014 we work with all of them. We integrate them into our scientific and clinical knowledge, and make things like our seven-minute workout app. We work with those guys, and there\u2019s a level of directional improvement these devices can enable people to have, but you\u2019d never be able to use them to diagnose or treat them. But based on clinical work we\u2019ve done, if you can get people to change their lives \u2014 more sleep and mobility \u2014 that does have a causative impact. It\u2019s not going to diagnose or cure a disease, but it is going to help people get better.\n\nWe\u2019re using this technology and more devices to treat what happens when you get a knee replacement. You have go to therapy and move. But how many people actually do that? People who don\u2019t understand health care will declare I\u2019m gonna solve Problem X, and they won\u2019t solve Problem X, but you\u2019ll create an enablement that can help. The average person under 35 does not tolerate the way health care is delivered in this country.\n\nThey want to make it like calling an Uber.\n\nYes. They want to know \u201cWhy can\u2019t I make it seamless and frictionless, to make it like the other parts of my life.\u201d\n\nHow are you using technology to improve the outcomes of people in poverty who aren\u2019t in hubs of technology, like say, Biloxi, Mississippi?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this work really effectively, except in certain pockets of blackout in the U.S. The access to mobile technology allows us to deliver information and care, whether they\u2019re in a northern village in India or in the Amazon in Brazil or in Biloxi. It provides better access and info than they would have had. The concierge kind of service is for upper stratosphere, but given what we can do with this tech, we can provide better access to people who don\u2019t have that level of income or infrastructure.\n\nWith all of the tech industry investment coming into health care, is J&J at risk of falling behind the health technology curve?\n\nAs an incumbent, we\u2019re leading this change, it\u2019s not a negative. Given how we reach people and what we do, we have relationships with all the tech companies. We\u2019ve got access to technology that\u2019s much broader. And because of changes from the Affordable Care Act, it has had an impact how care gets delivered, how it gets cared for. Changes in some of the sciences is changing these things as well. But at the end of the day, the consumers are going to demand a different kind of experience. We\u2019ve seen significant changes in insurance, we\u2019re seeing the same in hospitals \u2014 my view is that within the next five years there will be a substantive transformation in the U.S. health care ecosystem. It\u2019s in process.\n\nHow has the Affordable Care Act affected the way technology is implemented throughout the health care ecosystem?\n\nOne of the big things is connected to reimbursement. Take knee replacements. In the old days, if you had a knee replacement surgery, you\u2019d get a bill of labor and materials, a line item of various people and surgeries and rates and so on. And your insurance company would have contracted with them, and you wouldn\u2019t have to pay out of pocket. Now the way the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (the regulatory authority) work, if you\u2019re gonna have a knee replacement, we\u2019re gonna pay the hospital a flat rate for that. And the hospitals and providers have to think about \u201cHow do I optimize that surgery so that we get the positive outcome, so that the patient won\u2019t have to be readmitted because something went wrong?\u201d\n\nThere are already significant changes where technology can make a difference. Six months before you have a surgery, we start interacting with you to prepare for the surgery. And post-surgery, we are monitoring what\u2019s going with you. All of our knowledge and expertise is being deployed through technology to do that, in and out of the health care system.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "\"At the end of the day, consumers are going to demand a different kind of experience.\"", "author": "Noah Kulwin", "og": {"site_name": "Recode", "description": "\"At the end of the day, consumers are going to demand a different kind of experience.\"", "title": "Theranos, Obamacare and Robots Doing Surgery: Talking With Johnson & Johnson Executive Sandi Peterson", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2016/1/14/11588812/theranos-obamacare-and-robots-doing-surgery-talking-with-johnson", "image": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pLATxo3ui6Wxm_LpjJoaRgsGrnU=/0x202:3888x2389/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49519479/shutterstock_180974216.0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"At the end of the day, consumers are going to demand a different kind of experience.\"", "title": "Theranos, Obamacare and Robots Doing Surgery: Talking With Johnson & Johnson Executive Sandi Peterson", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2016/1/14/11588812/theranos-obamacare-and-robots-doing-surgery-talking-with-johnson", "image": {"src": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pLATxo3ui6Wxm_LpjJoaRgsGrnU=/0x202:3888x2389/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49519479/shutterstock_180974216.0.jpg"}, "site": "Recode", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-14", "sailthru.title": "Theranos, Obamacare and Robots Doing Surgery: Talking With Johnson & Johnson Executive Sandi Peterson", "fb": {"app_id": 186672874861631}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6397045/recode_favicon-144.0.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-14T20:01:28Z"}, "sailthru.tags": "general,recode", "google-site-verification": "hjxK0n4cwDZzIl6phvogE8im4UEcc5HKC14Tl5HI-Jk", "style-tools": "/style/d75fd5fb90a12660fd6c67badbca975d/tools.css", "sailthru.description": "\"At the end of the day, consumers are going to demand a different kind of experience.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "Johnson & Johnson was the first company to create minimally invasive surgery, this is the next evolution.\nSandi Peterson is the Group Worldwide Chairman at Johnson & Johnson, the consumer and health goods company that has been around for more than a century.\nRe/code: Johnson & Johnson is over 100 years old, and most people don\u2019t think of it as a major tech player.\n2015 was a coming out party for health tech in Silicon Valley in many ways.\nThe average person under 35 does not tolerate the way health care is delivered in this country."}
