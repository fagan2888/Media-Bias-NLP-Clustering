And he can prove it.\n\nCerrone, a Denver native and mixed martial artist ranked No. 3 in the Ultimate Fighting Championship\u2019s lightweight division, will fight for a seventh time in 14 months Sunday night in Boston.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll do it just 15 days after his last fight \u2014 a rare, dangerous quick turnaround for a professional fighter. Cerrone will go against Colorado Springs native and fifth-ranked Benson Henderson on short notice on the UFC\u2019s Fight Night card in Boston, airing nationally on Fox Sports 1.\n\n\u201cI could sit back like every other fighter and sit and wait, but I\u2019m not every other fighter,\u201d Cerrone said. \u201cI\u2019m my own guy, and I don\u2019t (care). Bring the fights on.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be the champ, I\u2019ve got to beat everyone anyway. So what is sitting and waiting and holding my position do?\u201d\n\nCerrone (26-6) is riding a six-fight winning streak, tearing through the 155-pound division and climbing back into title contention. He last fought for a title in 2010 \u2014 a loss to Henderson for the World Extreme Cagefighting title.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best out there,\u201d Cerrone said of Henderson (21-4), a jiu-jitsu specialist born in Colorado Springs before moving to Washington.\n\nHenderson held the lightweight title in 2012-13 and defended it three times, including a split-decision win over Frankie Edgar at UFC 150 in Denver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m taking a filler fight against some bottom-25 guy,\u201d said Cerrone, a former kickboxing champ. \u201cIf you want to be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best. The only problem is when I get that belt, who\u2019s going to be left to fight? That\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d\n\nCerrone, who trains in Albuquerque with coach Greg Jackson, agreed to fight Henderson just two days after his unanimous decision win over Myles Jury this month at UFC 182.\n\nA victory may propel Cerrone to a title shot against Anthony Pettis later this year. Henderson, too, wants back in the mix after a knockout loss to Rafael dos Anjos in August.\n\nWhen Cerrone boasted he wanted to fight six times in 2014, Jackson advised against it.\n\n\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jackson said last April. \u201cBut once Cowboy makes his mind up on something, he\u2019s one of those amazing guys \u2013 whatever he decides to do, he does it all the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take this fight on short notice unless, one, I wasn\u2019t completely bat loony,\u201d Cerrone said. \u201cAnd, two, if I didn\u2019t think I couldn\u2019t beat Ben.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Donald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone is crazy enough to keep fighting all comers", "title": "Donald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone is crazy enough to keep fighting all comers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/17/donald-cowboy-cerrone-is-crazy-enough-to-keep-fighting-all-comers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__donald-cowboy-cerrone-ufcp1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__donald-cowboy-cerrone-ufcp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T19:55:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T11:10:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI could sit back like every other fighter and sit and wait, but I\u2019m not every other fighter,\u201d Cerrone said.\nDonald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone \u2014 a \u201cmental crazy loon,\u201d his words \u2014 claims he has never turned down a fight.\n3 in the Ultimate Fighting Championship\u2019s lightweight division, will fight for a seventh time in 14 months Sunday night in Boston.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m taking a filler fight against some bottom-25 guy,\u201d said Cerrone, a former kickboxing champ.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best out there,\u201d Cerrone said of Henderson (21-4), a jiu-jitsu specialist born in Colorado Springs before moving to Washington."}
