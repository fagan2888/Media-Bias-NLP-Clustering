Show them this case.\n\nA Brooklyn employer was recently ordered to pay $4.7 million to an employee who was ultimately assaulted by a co-worker \u2013 a culminating act after repeated bullying behavior. That\u2019s the largest award to date in a workplace bullying incident.\n\nAccording to court papers filed by Osama Saleh, 22, his employer looked the other way when he complained of being harassed by James Robinson, a black security guard at the Pretty Girl women\u2019s clothing store in Brooklyn. Saleh claimed Robinson verbally abused him, telling him to \u201cgo back to Yemen\u201d and calling him a \u201cdirty Arab\u201d and \u201cbin Laden.\u201d\n\nMatters came to a head, Saleh claimed, when Robinson attacked him in the store basement, according to a story in the New York Daily News. The incident left Saleh with a fractured cheekbone.\n\nDespite the employer\u2019s claims that the bully\u2019s actions were no more than \u201cbanter\u201d between co-workers, a court didn\u2019t see it that way. And because supervisors did nothing to stop to the harassment, the company will have to pay the (steep) price.\n\nHaving an anti-bullying policy is more than a smart move \u2013 your state may soon require it. Currently 15 states, including New York, Massachusetts and Florida are considering legislation to protect employees from workplace bullying.\n\nThe trouble is, not all bullying behavior is as overt as in Saleh\u2019s case.\n\nSpotting subtle bullying\n\nTurns out, bullying is one of the more subtle and misunderstood problems facing employers \u2014 which is why it often festers for so long. And the real concern is that oftentimes, managers are the ones doing the bullying \u2014 so it often goes undetected until it reaches the point where the employee files a complaint.\n\nSome subtle signs of bully behavior:\n\nConstantly criticizes \u2013 nothing is ever \u201cright.\u201d Some criticism can be constructive, but if there\u2019s someone who is always nitpicking with a certain co-worker, it could be a red flag. Undervalues contributions. When a person constantly glosses over the value a co-worker provides, there could be something deeper afoot, and odds are good that other person is feeling devalued. Heaps on the work. If one employee is piling on another, he or she may be setting that other person up to fail. A sure sign of a bully. Withholds vital details. Similar to the work heaping, if a person fails to offer up mission-critical information to a colleague, it will be tough for that other individual to be successful. Blocking opportunities for advancement. Any attempts to hold someone else down can be considered bullying. So if a supervisor continually passes over someone for conference or other educational opportunities, it\u2019s probably time to ask some questions.\n\nSuspect you have a bully on your team?\n\nWhether overt or a bit more subtle, if you suspect you have a bully in your midst, you\u2019ll want to act fast.\n\nThe first step: Call the bullying behavior to the person\u2019s attention. Resist the urge to editorialize or label it.\n\nInstead, simply identify the offending behaviors \u2014 excessive criticism, insulting remarks, refusing to allot credit for good work, etc.\n\nThen make it clear that continued behavior of this type will have consequences \u2014 up to and including termination.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Does your company management think bullying\u2019s just an HR concern?
