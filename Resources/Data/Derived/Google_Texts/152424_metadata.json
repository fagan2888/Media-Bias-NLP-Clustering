And police do not know who fired the gun.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s at 9825 West 58th Ave., contains a play area for children. The bullet and glass entered the main lobby area, manager Solomon Lauro said.\n\n\u201cThere was a conflict outside the building,\u201d Lauro said. \u201cA bullet went through the window but nobody was hurt.\u201d\n\nThat conflict apparently had nothing to do with McDonald\u2019s. Arvada police received a call about 2:45 p.m. alerting them to a single shot fired, McGranahan said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking at surrounding businesses, trying to acquire their surveillance video,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the shot was fired from one vehicle at another.
