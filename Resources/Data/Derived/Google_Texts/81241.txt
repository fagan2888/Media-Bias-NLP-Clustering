A lawnmower joyride ended with thousands of dollars in damage and the rider in a ditch.

According to our partners at The Gazette, who spoke with a Colorado Springs city forester, the suspect hotwired a lawnmower early Thursday morning and took it for a spin at Broadmoor Valley Park. The rider knocked over four trees and destroyed a park bench. The resulting damage: $3,000.

After leaving his or her mark on the southwest side park, the joyrider lost control and landed in a ditch.

At this time, no one has been caught. If you have any information on the incident, contact CSPD at 444-7000.
