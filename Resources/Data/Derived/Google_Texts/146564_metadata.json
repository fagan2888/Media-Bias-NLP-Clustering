That question hung in the air much of the day on Friday, as the major cable news networks laboriously steered around any direct reference to the political bombshell that had set social media aflame since the small hours. Once again the mainstream media had been Trumped, made to look floundering and foolish by the Republican clown-prince even as it wrestled with one of the biggest news days of the year. Belgian authorities had apparently captured a leading suspect in the Brussels attacks, and the United States military had apparently killed an ISIS leader in Syria. But for at least half the day, those headlines felt like footnotes to the hot topic TV news wouldn\u2019t even touch.\n\nWith no apparent sense of irony, Fox News sought to recast itself as a sober, responsible news organization, whose guests and commentators are deeply concerned about the toxic nature of American political discourse. During the 11 a.m. hour of Fox\u2019s \u201cHappening Now,\u201d an entire group of panelists earnestly embraced Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent complaint that moderate, centrist, reasonable voices had been excluded from public debate and political media, and that this was harming democracy. The old saw about putting lipstick on a pig doesn\u2019t begin to capture it. Friday\u2019s display of cable-news hypocrisy and paralysis, as the talking heads danced along the edges of the unmentionable story everyone in the real world was talking about, was more bizarre and more far-reaching than that.\n\nIt was like Vlad the Impaler taking a break from roasting infants on skewers to lament the decline of table manners. It was as if all the pathology and bad karma of American politics in 2016 had been compressed into a few unhappy hours of avoidance and denial and enforced foolishness. Republican leaders and their media enablers have devoted many years\u2019 worth of cynicism and manipulation and fear-mongering into seeding the ground for Donald Trump. Now he\u2019s here, and those people act shocked every single day to wake up and discover that Trump is pulling their strings instead of the other way around.\n\nOf course the sober, responsible can\u2019t-we-get-along shtick didn\u2019t last long on Fox. An hour or so later, during the female-centric midday program \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d which is a nightmarish parody of \u201cThe View\u201d featuring a phalanx of women in high heels and short skirts surrounding Tucker Carlson, the tone shifted back to the Fox default setting of \u201cHillary Clinton: Destroyer of Worlds.\u201d Casting about for potential girl-talk topics that would somehow avoid the obvious, the panel conceded that Trump might have a problem with female voters. This, Carlson observed, was patently unfair. After all, who had actually abused and mistreated more women: Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? His companions nodded and furrowed their brows: Intriguing question, Tucker!\n\nA few minutes before that, Carlson had waggishly noted that the central question of the Republican contest had now become \u201cwhose wife is hotter.\u201d Oh, he got scolded for that: You dog, you! Then the strain of not mentioning the name of a certain tabloid publication, or gossiping about who might be depicted in its tantalizingly blurry photographs, drove the \u201cOutnumbered\u201d couch-cluster into bitterness and madness. One of Carlson\u2019s fembot co-hosts, possibly Andrea Tantaros \u2014 it wasn\u2019t Meghan McCain or the token liberal or the one with the Southern accent \u2014 acridly suggested that \u201cfeminists\u201d were eager to judge Melania Trump for taking her clothes off, \u201cbut when Lena Dunham does it, they think it\u2019s great.\u201d McCain lamented that bad sexual mojo in the Republican race was interfering with important issues, such as the fact that Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband was a \u201csexual predator.\u201d\n\nWhen Republicans try to distract their base with Lena Dunham, they\u2019re desperate; when they drag out Monica Lewinsky, they\u2019re lost and lonely and afraid. Worst of all, the \u201cOutnumbered\u201d panel concluded, the Trump-Cruz catfight and its ugly but unmentionable new twist had ruined the prospect of a Republican \u201cunity ticket.\u201d (For which the rest of us should send both candidates fruit baskets.) But Friday\u2019s disorder was not limited to Fox News. On their mid-morning news shows, both CNN and MSNBC hosted cagey, half-hearted segments about whether the name-calling, spouse-mocking playground feud between Trump and Ted Cruz had gone too far \u2014 but without explaining exactly how far it had gone.\n\nGratefully seizing on breaking news from Brussels and the Middle East, both networks kept those segments brief and cryptic. We heard (several more times) about the nude photo of Melania Trump tweeted by a pro-Cruz PAC, and about Trump threatening to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on Heidi Cruz. We repeatedly got to see Cruz\u2019s unconvincing tough-guy act, where he wore a bomber jacket and stared down the TV cameras and called Trump a \u201csniveling coward,\u201d looking somewhat like a sixth-grader trying to deliver Marlon Brando\u2019s lines from \u201cThe Wild One.\u201d By the standards of the 2016 news cycle, that was all moldy cheese from the back of the fridge, used as a coy placeholder for something else. All these purported adult news professionals had to pretend, for reasons they couldn\u2019t quite define, that they had just rolled out of bed and hadn\u2019t noticed the day\u2019s biggest political plot twist.\n\nWhat I\u2019m talking about, of course, are the latest revelations about Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department emails, which will surely land her in prison one of these days! (That was actually floated as one of Friday\u2019s big stories, however briefly, during the fevered last few minutes of \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Carlson played buzzkill, ruefully admitting that he didn\u2019t think Attorney General Loretta Lynch would indict Clinton.)\n\nOK, no I\u2019m not. As virtually everyone in the viewing audience for Friday\u2019s news shows already knew, the National Enquirer had published an overnight cover story claiming that Ted Cruz has had at least five extramarital relationships, accompanied by fuzzy but easily decoded photos of his alleged lovers. (Several of the women in those pictures appear to be prominent Republican operatives who have worked for Cruz and other candidates, including Trump.)\n\nBy mid-morning on Friday, Cruz and Trump supporters on Twitter were engaged in open warfare, while left-leaning observers offered Schadenfreude-tinged commentary and media types debated the credibility of the Enquirer and told us they\u2019d heard all this before. As indeed they had: I don\u2019t know whether the allegations about Cruz\u2019s private life are true and I don\u2019t care, but the rumors are nothing new. There is plausible social-media evidence to suggest that Marco Rubio supporters tried to plant similar stories weeks ago, in hopes of rescuing Rubio\u2019s dying campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did Trump plant the Enquirer's sleazy Cruz story?
