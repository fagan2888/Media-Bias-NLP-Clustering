This would, in effect, corrode the risk pool needed for ACA to succeed, as younger, healthier patients can opt to keep their cheaper existing policies. \u201cThis fix won\u2019t solve every problem for every person, but it\u2019s going to help a lot of people,\u201d the president said.\n\nIn reality, this churning, or systematic cancellation, of individual insurance policies did not start with the ACA. Commonwealth Fund reported that as early as 1998, 22 percent of Americans were uninsured at least once due to cancellations of policies. Health insurance has always been a single-year policy, and health insurance companies, through their policies, seek the best way to push more of the health care to the consumer. Recent revelations about the nature of cheap individual policies may bear light on why they were not grandfather-able under ACA, and why they may represent a scam of the poor and uninformed by insurance providers.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nTurningPointsMemo recently profiled USHealth Group, which has been persuading consumers to turn away from the ACA while touting minimum-coverage, ACA non-compliant plans. These plans, which include fixed-benefit coverage, a limited policy that pays up to a certain amount for specific medical situations, represent a business opportunity for USHealth and other insurers, despite the healthcare industry deriding them as \u201cjunk insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were not intended to be health insurance,\u201d Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University, told TPM. \u201cThey were intended to be what are called income-replacement policies. \u2026 But over the years, these things have kind of morphed. And for many people, unfortunately, mainly because they come with a cheaper sticker price, they are marketed as and treated as health insurance, even though the coverage is really crappy.\u201d\n\nProducts, such as \u201cmini-meds,\u201d which impose a capped annual dollar amount on benefits offered in exchange for a small premium, such as McDonald\u2019s \u201cMcCrew Care\u201d plan, which offers $2,000 in benefits for $56 a month; medical discount cards and fixed-benefit indemnity plans, which offers a set reimbursement limit on medical services \u2014 are being sold to customers who have been frightened by the ACA, or who are unsuspecting.\n\nIn a pamphlet sent out by USHealth entitled \u201cPPACA & You,\u201d the company states that \u201c[the] IRS estimates that by 2016 the lowest level [PPACA] Qualified Health Plans for a family of five will cost at least $20,000 per year,\u201d and \u201c[although] subject to a tax penalty, the lower premiums associated with the purchase of PPACA exempt products may actually result in significant savings vs. the cost of an Essential Benefits Plan.\u201d\n\nIn a press release last November, USHealth promoted its fixed-rate products to small businesses and the self-employed as a flexible alternative to \u201cthe predicted rise in health care premiums\u201d associated with the ACA.\n\nUSHealth isn\u2019t the only company that sells fixed-benefit plans. A key strength of the ACA is the requirement that policies that do not offer full, unlimited indemnity coverage can no longer be sold as proper health care insurance packages. In allowing consumers to hold on to these in-name-only insurance policies, it creates a situation in which medical costs will continue to spike as holders of these policies will not have adequate coverage for catastrophic care, and where the ACA will collapse due to not having enough healthy individuals joining the insurance risk pool.\n\nAs insurance companies continue to play the role of bad guy in this ongoing drama \u2014 by not informing customers of the possibility of better deals on the exchanges, by rolling customers automatically to more expensive plans after cancelling their existing plans \u201cdue to the ACA,\u201d and by intentionally deceiving customers and playing off the political confusion surrounding the ACA \u2014 the call for the government to take the lead and push back against such corporate malpractice has never been louder. It\u2019s a shame that the call is being lost in partisan bickering.\n\n\u201cThis is a great example of the kind of consumer abuses that are typical of the insurance industry, and they\u2019re supposed to stop under the ACA,\u201d Ethan Rome, executive director of Health Care For America Now, a pro-Obamacare advocacy group, told TPM. \u201cIn this case, they\u2019re trying to get in just one more abuse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health insurance companies are undermining the strengths of the ACA and taking advantage of the poor and uninformed by marketing substandard products.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Frederick Reese", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Health insurance companies are undermining the strengths of the ACA and taking advantage of the poor and uninformed by marketing substandard products.", "title": "Health Insurance Companies Persist In Selling \u201cCrappy\u201d Policies Amid ACA Chaos", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/health-insurance-companies-persist-in-selling-crappy-policies-amid-aca-chaos/173046/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/102513_ACA_16x9-690x516.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-21T10:22:41-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurance companies are undermining the strengths of the ACA and taking advantage of the poor and uninformed by marketing substandard products.", "creator": "@FrederickReese", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/102513_ACA_4x3.jpg", "title": "Health Insurance Companies Persist In Selling \u201cCrappy\u201d Policies Amid ACA Chaos", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "uninsured", "published_time": "2013-11-21T05:00:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T10:22:41-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Health Insurance Companies Persist In Selling \u201cCrappy\u201d Policies Amid ACA ChaosHealth insurance companies are undermining the strengths of the ACA and taking advantage of the poor and uninformed by marketing substandard products.\nHealth insurance has always been a single-year policy, and health insurance companies, through their policies, seek the best way to push more of the health care to the consumer.\nLast week, the president announced administrative changes that would allow insurance companies to continue to sell non-ACA-compliant policies.\nIn reality, this churning, or systematic cancellation, of individual insurance policies did not start with the ACA.\nA key strength of the ACA is the requirement that policies that do not offer full, unlimited indemnity coverage can no longer be sold as proper health care insurance packages."}
