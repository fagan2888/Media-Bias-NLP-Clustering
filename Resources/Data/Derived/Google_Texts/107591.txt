Pueblo police are searching for a man they say stabbed another man outside a Pueblo bar.

The stabbing happened Dec. 28, 2013 outside of Iron Horse Bar on Main Street. The victim is a 25-year-old man who was taken to the hospital. He was treated for multiple stab wounds and spent days in the Intensive Care Unit for his injuries.

The suspect is described as a white man, 50-60 years old, about 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 180 to 200 pounds and with long blonde hair. He was wearing a denim jacket and blue jeans.

Witnesses tell police there was a large fight outside the bar and the victim was trying to break it up. He apparently was pushed to the ground and punched several times. It wasn't until after the fight that he realized he was stabbed.

If you have any information about the stabbing or the suspect call police or Crime Stoppers at 719-542-STOP (7867).
