Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) called on the White House and GOP leaders to end months of gridlock over the nearly $2 billion funding request, which has been flatly rejected by the vast majority of Republicans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuchanan's support for the White House request comes after a Florida Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio , has already sounded the warning about the need for a robust Zika response.\n\nAnother Florida Republican, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, also introduced a bill last week to immediately move all leftover funding from the U.S. Ebola virus response into the Zika response, though he didn't say he would support the full $1.9 billion.

Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told a crowd at the American Hospital Association conference that Democrats have been working single-handedly to make more money available in the legislation slated to reach the House floor this month.\n\n\"Republicans have been unwilling to come to the negotiating table,\" Hoyer said at the American Hospital Association's annual member conference at the Washington Hilton. \"Obviously policy without the ability to implement them are somewhat empty words.\" More here: http://bit.ly/1SVmDAJ\n\nOnly 4 House Dems join GOP drug-pricing letter A group of 242 lawmakers is calling on the Obama administration to scrap a proposal aimed at fighting high drug prices.\n\nThe proposal to change how Medicare pays for certain drugs has been controversial, drawing concern from both sides of the aisle in Congress.\n\nHowever, only four House Democrats joined the letter on Monday calling for a complete end to the program. Democratic leadership had been working to get Democrats to sign a different letter, which expressed concerns but called for changes to the program rather than simply ending it.\n\nThe four Democrats signing the Republican-led letter are Reps. Brad Ashford (Neb.), Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), and Collin Peterson (Minn.).
