But, being in a generous mood, he fed a parking meter enough for whoever pulled into his soon-to-be-empty parking spot.\n\nSo, instead of costing him a penny, it cost him two.\n\nIn a time of strained city budgets, this community of 18,000 residents an hour west of Chicago is one of a handful still holding onto meters that accept pennies, nickels and dimes around its town square. A penny gets you 12 minutes, a nickel buys an hour and a dime is worth two hours.\n\nDon\u2019t fret if bills or a credit card is all you have \u2014 sometimes people leave a few extra pennies stacked on the meters. And the guy whose job it is to write tickets when he spots expired meters? He has been known to feed them.\n\nThe City Council quadrupled the fine for parking tickets a few years ago.\n\n\u201cThe fines went from a quarter to a dollar,\u201d Mayor Ken Mundy said, adding that out-of-towners often ask for a copy of the ticket as a keepsake.\n\nWhile it seems like a scene out of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d there\u2019s purpose in the parking strategy.\n\nMundy and others are well aware that meters translate into big money \u2014 and sometimes scandal \u2014 in places such as Chicago, where parking costs as much as $6.50 an hour and a ticket is $65.\n\nBut unlike many other communities, where downtowns are littered with boarded-up storefronts, theirs is thriving. And they think the penny parking meters\u2019 message \u2014 Sycamore isn\u2019t trying to gouge visitors \u2014 is one of the reasons why.\n\n\u201cThe meters encourage people to come downtown,\u201d said city manager Brian Gregory, which to him is more valuable than the \u201cfew thousand dollars\u201d in revenue Sycamore would realize if it raised parking rates. Right now, he said, the city basically breaks even.\n\nSo, why charge at all? Mundy and Gregory say the meters do exactly what the city and business owners want: Encourage motorists to park and shop without lingering too long so someone else can do the same.\n\nMerchants love the meters. \u201cWe use it as a marketing tool on Facebook,\u201d said Sycamore Antiques co-owner Ann Tucker.\n\nShoppers do, too. \u201cIt keeps the quaintness of the town,\u201d said Kathy Tornberg. \u201cDon\u2019t tell them, but I\u2019d be willing to pay a quarter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Penny parking thrives in small Illinois town", "title": "Penny parking thrives in small Illinois town", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/27/penny-parking-thrives-in-small-illinois-town/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141227__20141228_A4_ND28PENNYPARKINGp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141227__20141228_A4_ND28PENNYPARKINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-27T17:42:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:23:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda659\"", "article_summary": "And they think the penny parking meters\u2019 message \u2014 Sycamore isn\u2019t trying to gouge visitors \u2014 is one of the reasons why.\nThe City Council quadrupled the fine for parking tickets a few years ago.\nBut, being in a generous mood, he fed a parking meter enough for whoever pulled into his soon-to-be-empty parking spot.\nA penny gets you 12 minutes, a nickel buys an hour and a dime is worth two hours.\nWhile it seems like a scene out of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d there\u2019s purpose in the parking strategy."}
