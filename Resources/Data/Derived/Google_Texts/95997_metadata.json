But a group of state and county officials who gathered at the office last week for a meeting said a state monitor of the facility should lead to improvements.\n\n\u201cIts not just the boost in the number of clients (the office has experienced over the last several years), it\u2019s how (the system) reacted to it,\u201d said David Weiner, president of CWA Local 1081, the union representing non-supervisory employees of the Essex County Division of Welfare. Over the past several months, Weiner has filed nearly a dozen grievances with the department, many alleging poor or inadequate work conditions and an increased workload.\n\nAccording to Weiner, the economic downturn combined with the increased eligibility for Medicaid and food stamps after the passage of the Affordable Care Act has led to a steady increase in the number of clients serviced at the center every year since about 2007.\n\n\u201cMany workers have had the number of caseloads they handle double,\u201d since then, he said. But, employees maintain that staffing levels remain the same.\n\nWorkers are also dealing with a statewide computer failure that has left welfare office employees across New Jersey processing the state-expanded Medicaid access under Obamacare using an antiquated computer mainframe, or partly by hand. The Essex County office is filled with boxes of files that employees say they often must rifle through to work on each case.\n\n\u201cYou literally walk through a maze of boxes and boxes. Try finding a case,\u201d Tatiana Horton, on the staff of the Essex County Board of Social Services, told NJ Advance Media last month.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services\u2019 Division of Family Development\u2019s Director Jeanette Page-Hawkins met with county officials at the Essex office Thursday morning, a spokesperson for the Division confirmed. Page-Hawkins \u201cregularly visits the county welfare offices to talk with the administration and staff about programming and operations,\u201d the spokesperson, Nicole Brossoie, said.\n\nEssex County is one of 10 N.J. counties that is being monitored by the state \u201cfor compliance with the timely processing of SNAP applications,\u201d Brossoie said. SNAP was formerly known as the state\u2019s food stamps program.\n\nAs part of the monitor, the DFD developed a corrective action plan for the county to follow, she said. The state did not comment on specific details of the plan, but Brossoie said \u201cEssex is following its corrective action plan and improvements are underway.\u201d\n\nAtlantic, Bergen, Camden, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset, Passaic, and Union Counties are also under a state monitor, officials said.\n\nA spokesperson for Essex County declined to comment on the meeting, saying it was a \u201cregular working session,\u201d that considered a \u201cvariety of issues.\u201d Anibal Ramos, the Director of Essex County Department of Citizen Services, called the gathering \u201ca routine meeting with the state,\u201d through a statement from his spokesperson. \u201cNothing out of the ordinary,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, current and former employees of the welfare office on Rector Street say the issues are more severe than officials have let on. Though Weiner was not a part of the meeting Thursday, he said he was glad state officials visited the site.\n\n\u201cThey got to see the crowds (of people waiting), and they got to see the frailty of their system.\u201d\n\nEssex has historically had the highest number of welfare recipients in the state.\n\nIn October of 2014 \u2013 the most recent statistics available from the state \u2013 Essex County reported 66,955 households in the county received SNAP benefits, which represents just under 15 percent of the total number of households receiving SNAP across the state.\n\nAcross New Jersey, the number of households receiving SNAP benefits jumped 4.9 percent, with Essex having the highest concentration of recipients of any county in the state, the data shows.\n\nHowever, Essex County did not report the highest percentage increase in SNAP recipients over that time period, and the statewide rates of many other types of assistance, including general and emergency assistance, decreased from Oct. 2013 to Oct. 2014, the state report says.\n\nStatistics for the number of Medicaid recipients \u2013 which Weiner says represents one of the largest increases in the county \u2013 are not tracked in the state\u2019s monthly reports.\n\nLast year, the union hired Bruce Nigro, a consultant and former director of the department in Essex County, to conduct a study of its employees and caseload increases from 2007 to 2013, a period that Weiner identified as one of \u201cextreme growth\u201d in terms of the number of cases and eligible applicants at the welfare office.\n\n\u201cWhen the recession first hit, that\u2019s when we started to see the number of cases increase tremendously,\u201d Nigro, who said he retired nearly five years ago, said in a phone interview. He also cited the Affordable Care Act as helping increase the number of cases.\n\nNigro\u2019s report, he said, also showed increases in the number of pending, or unprocessed, cases, and in the average length of time cases stay pending. Staffing levels at the facility have remained stagnant, he said.\n\n\u201cWithout a good computer system, I don\u2019t see any hope,\u201d Nigro said. \u201cBut even with a better system, staffing would still be an issue. Plus, with (a potential new computer system), there is an (employee) learning curve\u2026which will just lead to more backlogs.\u201d\n\nNigro said an increase in staffing could help compensate for the higher number of cases.\n\n\u201cI spent my career trying to help people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I see happening now is very disappointing.\u201d\n\nJessica Mazzola may be reached at jmazzola@njadvancemedia.com.
