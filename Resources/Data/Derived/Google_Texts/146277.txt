DENVER -- It may have been 10 a.m. at Zocalo’s Bar & Restaurant, but Mexican soccer fans already had their game faces on Friday.

The bar was packed, wall-to-wall, with fans wearing Red, White & Green to watch Mexico’s first game in the 2014 World Cup.

Among those in attendance: Danyela Ocampo. She’s a hairstylist, who says she took the day off so she could watch Mexico open up “Group A” play v. Cameroon.

She was among the more vocal fans when Mexico scored the only goal they would need to win, 1-0.

Other bars, like Fado’s, in LoDo, are offering fans the chance to enter a bracket. Much like “March Madness” for college basketball, in this bracket, if anyone picks 63 of the 64 winners, you can win $1 million!

Downtown Denver’s Skyline Park, near the 16th St. Mall, offers a free, four-day World Cup viewing party through Monday's match featuring the United States against Ghana.
