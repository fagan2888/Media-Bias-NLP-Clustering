This was particularly true for the children of women who maintained good blood sugar control during their third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nBut the reverse was also true. When mothers had poor control of their diabetes before and during their pregnancy, their children had lower grades. The poorer the control, the worse children did in school, when they were compared to the offspring of women without diabetes.\n\nThe study team also found that there was a strong relationship between the mother\u2019s level of education and her blood sugar control. The more educated women were, the better they seemed to be at controlling their diabetes.\n\nThere was also a strong association between parental education and their children\u2019s school grades, but even after the authors took that into account, the relationship between blood sugar control in pregnancy and kids\u2019 school grades persisted.\n\nBrown pointed out that a mother\u2019s social, psychological and cognitive function beyond her educational attainment would be expected both to improve her diabetes control and enrich the learning environment of her child.\n\n\u201cThis is supported by the fact that women with the best diabetes control . . . in pregnancy had offspring that performed better academically than offspring of . . . women without diabetes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe authors of this study do endorse this as a possible explanation for their findings.\u201d\n\nThese results only pertain to type 1 diabetes, the less common form of the disease that typically begins in childhood and must be controlled with administered insulin, researchers caution. Type 2 diabetes, most frequently diagnosed in middle adulthood, is much more common, and has different underlying causes. In addition, gestational diabetes is a separate condition that occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears after the baby is born.\n\n\u201cI don't know of any study of this type that was done with women who had gestational or type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Jorge H Mestman, director of the University of Southern California Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Disease in Los Angeles. \u201cSo we can\u2019t apply these results to other types of diabetes.\u201d\n\nOverall, the study is very provocative and the results are exciting, Mestman noted, \u201cbut it needs to be repeated.\u201d\n\nMothers with very poor blood sugar control may have had other complications, and that would need to be accounted for, he added.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1BHN5sv Diabetes Care, online June 12, 2015.\n\n(By Roxanne Nelson)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "moms, diabetes, control, pregnancy, may, affect, kids, brains", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "For pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, good control of blood sugar might make a difference in how well their child does in school years later.", "title": "Mom's Diabetes Control In Pregnancy May Affect Kids' Brains", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/moms-diabetes-control-pregnancy-may-affect-kids-brains-340314", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/28/diabetes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, good control of blood sugar might make a difference in how well their child does in school years later.", "title": "Mom's Diabetes Control In Pregnancy May Affect Kids' Brains", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/moms-diabetes-control-pregnancy-may-affect-kids-brains-340314", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/28/diabetes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/28/diabetes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-28T16:16:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T16:17:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "For pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, good control of blood sugar might make a difference in how well their child does in school years later."}, "article_summary": "This was particularly true for the children of women who maintained good blood sugar control during their third trimester of pregnancy.\nThe study team also found that there was a strong relationship between the mother\u2019s level of education and her blood sugar control.\nWhen mothers had poor control of their diabetes before and during their pregnancy, their children had lower grades.\n\u201cThis is supported by the fact that women with the best diabetes control .\nThey also compared those children to more than 60,000 similar school children whose mothers did not have diabetes."}
