According to Variety, the episodes appeared \u201con piracy networks\u201d on Saturday, and they had already been downloaded more than a million times this morning. In a statement released by HBO, the network suggests that the leak \u201coriginated from within a group approved by HBO to receive\u201d early copies of the episodes, which means it could\u2019ve been an unscrupulous press outlet or some TV reviewer who just wanted to watch the world burn.\n\nGame Of Thrones is no stranger to piracy, of course, as it features several characters who are (or were) pirates, like Salladhor Saan and Davos Seaworth. Also, we write articles about how many people are illegally downloading it all the time, so we\u2019re just getting started a little earlier this year.
