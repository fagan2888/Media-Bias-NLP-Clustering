With the House having already approved its companion legislation and the White House on board, the Senate\u2019s is the final OK needed for Congress to enact its first major cybersecurity bill in years.\n\n\u201cWe have been at this for six years,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein Dianne FeinsteinClinton\u2019s email troubles deepen Top Dem: CIA officials thought spying on Senate \u2018was flat out wrong\u2019 Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (D-Calif.), a CISA co-sponsor, on the floor last week. \u201cThis is the third bill. We have been bipartisan.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCISA backers, which include many industry groups and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, believe the bill is the necessary first step to better understand and stymie the mammoth hacks that have plagued U.S. retailers including Target and Home Depot, as well as government agencies including the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nBut a vocal alliance of digital rights groups, tech companies and privacy-\u00adminded senators have led a late-surging campaign to block the bill, which they believe will shuttle more private data to the government without actually boosting cybersecurity.\n\nBut after months of delays on the bill, it appears the anti-CISA cohort has finally run out of options to further stall the upper chamber.\n\nLeading critic Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and his colleagues opposing the bill will get their last shot at strengthening CISA\u2019s privacy provisions on Tuesday. Wyden remains hopeful he can cobble together a coalition to push through his preferred amendments \u2014 or halt the bill yet again.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see additional people coming out against this,\u201d he told reporters late last week. \u201cWhen you have a reactive Congress \u2014 we\u2019ve all seen these cyberattacks \u2014 and somebody says here\u2019s a cybersecurity bill, you always have a big educational challenge.\u201d\n\nBut Wyden\u2019s proposal and other privacy-focused amendments aren\u2019t expected to pass, and CISA will likely be approved by a significant margin.\n\nFor supporters, Tuesday is the culmination of years of work, a process that began long before the high-profile hack at Sony Pictures Entertainment made cybersecurity a gossip item.\n\nCISA\u2019s origins trace back to a years-long fight over a 2012 bill from then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), who chaired the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n\nSince then, pressure has gradually mounted on Congress to do something to stem the tide of cyberattacks that have battered American businesses. According to recent research that IBM commissioned from the Ponemon Institute, the average fallout cost from a data breach now runs to nearly $6.5 million for a U.S. firm, up 11 percent over the previous year.\n\nThe financial losses have helped bring industry groups around on a cyber information-sharing bill. After joining privacy advocates in opposing the Lieberman-Collins effort, groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are now some of the biggest supporters of passing CISA.\n\n\u201cCISA goes far in addressing the legal and policy cybersecurity priorities that the Chamber has been advocating for several years,\u201d the Chamber said in a letter sent to senators last week.\n\nLawmakers have worked to tighten the legal liability protection language that CISA would grant companies sharing cyber threat data with the government. Such immunity was critical to gaining the support of industry groups worried about excessive shareholder lawsuits under the measure.\n\nFeinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also worked with two consecutive chairmen \u2014 former Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and current Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) \u2014 to boost the privacy provisions in the final bill. That language was essential to convincing some prominent on-the-fence Democrats and the White House to support the bill.\n\nAfter Burr\u2019s committee approved the bill in March, he joked that Feinstein \u201chas stretched me so far\u201d on privacy concessions, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had cosmetic surgery.\u201d\n\nStill, Burr and Feinstein have since had to fight off other privacy concerns from both sides of the aisle. In a bid to allay these fears, the duo will use a manager\u2019s package \u2014 essentially a bundle of edits from various senators \u2014 to further limit what data the government can collect and how it can be used. The package is widely expected to be adopted in a Tuesday vote.\n\nThe work helped win over party leaders, like Sen. Tom Carper, the ranking member of the Homeland Security panel.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat had backed a competing cyber bill earlier this year, and initially expressed reservations about CISA. But on the Senate floor last week, Carper gave a full-throated endorsement of the measure, saying Feinstein\u2019s edits had made it a \u201csignificantly smarter and stronger bill.\u201d\n\nThe White House also cited the pair\u2019s efforts in its official CISA endorsement, issued late last week.\n\nBut their efforts haven\u2019t won over Wyden and his coalition of privacy-minded senators, including Al Franken (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), as well as Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to real privacy protection for millions of Americans with this [manager\u2019s package], there is simply no \u2018there\u2019 there,\u201d Wyden said on the floor Thursday.\n\nThe Burr-Feinstein edits have also failed to attract goodwill from the digital rights and civil liberties community, which has tarred CISA as a surveillance bill.\n\nBecause of provisions requiring data shared under CISA to be spread government-wide, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, \u201cthe bill will channel more Internet user communications information to the [National Security Agency] and other elements of intelligence community and law enforcement needlessly.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportant amendments would lessen that likelihood, but at the end of the day, the world that we\u2019ll face is one in which instead of minimizing the flow of user information to the NSA, the bill will mandate it,\u201d he added.\n\nIf CISA is approved on Tuesday, the bill will head to a conference with the House. The lower chamber easily passed its two companion bills in April, and staffers will work to combine the three bills into a final measure for President Obama.\n\nBoth backers and opponents of the legislative efforts have raised doubts about whether the two sides can smoothly merge the three bills. There are some significant discrepancies between them regarding how businesses pass information to the government that will require \u201csome serious negotiations,\u201d as one former House staffer put it.\n\nDigital rights groups say they will keep up the pressure throughout this process, urging lawmakers to include the most stringent privacy mechanisms from each bill in the final law. One advocate, Fight for the Future, will also work to obtain pledges from companies to not share data under CISA.\n\nBut for CISA proponents, Tuesday will likely serve as a deep sigh of relief, the final period on the prolonged negotiations that shepherded this cybersecurity legislation through Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is a good bill,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cIt is a first step. It is not going to prevent all cyberattacks or penetrations, but it will allow companies and the government to share information about the cyber threats they see.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Senate is on the cusp of passing its biggest cybersecurity bill to date.", "description": "The Senate is on the cusp of passing its biggest cybersecurity bill to date.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Senate is on the cusp of passing its biggest cybersecurity bill to date.", "title": "Cyber bill to sail in Senate", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/258170-cyber-bill-to-sail-in-senate", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/wydenron_100815gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-27T06:12:50-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-27T06:12-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/258170-cyber-bill-to-sail-in-senate", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-27T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Nikki Dobrin", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Computer security, Cybercrime, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act,Dianne Feinstein,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-27T06:00:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-27T06:12:50-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/258170-cyber-bill-to-sail-in-senate", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Senate is on the cusp of passing its biggest cybersecurity bill to date.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cyber bill to sail in Senate"}, "dcterms.title": "Cyber bill to sail in Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac6e\"", "article_summary": "The Senate is on the cusp of passing its biggest cybersecurity bill to date, following years of debate and countless revisions to the contentious legislation.\nThe Delaware Democrat had backed a competing cyber bill earlier this year, and initially expressed reservations about CISA.\nThe financial losses have helped bring industry groups around on a cyber information-sharing bill.\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) would encourage companies to share their data on hackers with the government.\nWith the House having already approved its companion legislation and the White House on board, the Senate\u2019s is the final OK needed for Congress to enact its first major cybersecurity bill in years."}
