With a number of changes to health benefits driven by rising health costs and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, employees need to pay extra attention when choosing their health benefits during enrollment this year, consulting firm Aon Hewitt warns.

A higher probability of being in a consumer-driven health plan. Consumer-driven health plans continue to rise in popularity and have surpassed HMOs as the second most offered plans by employers. In fact, a growing number of employers are offering CDHPs as the only plan option. While just 10 percent of companies do so today, another 44 percent are considering it in the next three to five years.

Programs that promote health awareness and education. With employers facing the impacts of rising health care costs and declining health of the population, employees can expect to see more employers offering programs that encourage them to take a more active role in managing their health. For example, 75 percent of employers offer health risk questionnaires and 71 percent offer biometric screenings such as blood pressure and cholesterol.
