The law\u2019s complex rules and conditions mean that people accustomed to doing their own taxes will face a lot of new questions on their 1040 forms.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Megan McArdle sees a cottage industry emerging from Obamacare\u2019s new, labyrinthine rules:\n\nIf you [had] no income outside a modest salary, and not much in the way of potential deductions such as huge mortgage interest or state tax bills, then there was really no reason to use a tax preparer. Even the mathematically challenged should, with the aid of a calculator, be able to fill out their 1040EZ forms just fine. But Obamacare has introduced a significant level of complexity into the taxes of lower-middle-class wage earners. More of them are going to need an accountant to negotiate the process \u2014 or risk owing the government hundreds of dollars because they didn\u2019t fill out the forms correctly. The money doesn\u2019t go to the government, of course, but in many ways this looks like a tax: Suddenly, people with simple incomes are going to need to pay a significant sum to keep themselves out of trouble with the IRS.\n\nBut for many, tax-preparing services may become harbingers of bad news: informing a lot of people who received Obamacare subsidies last year that they\u2019ll have to pay some of that money back to the government.\n\n\u201c[T]he big Obamacare event of this year will not be the exchange enrollments, but tax season, when people who got too much in subsidies find out how much money they owe the government,\u201d McArdle speculates. \u201cTax preparers, to judge from my Twitter feed, have been panicking for months. But now they face the Herculean job of communicating that panic to the public.\u201d\n\nThis is the first tax year in which Obamacare\u2019s penalties will be assessed; it\u2019s also the first year for the IRS to step in as the enforcer of the healthcare law. The relative ease or difficulty of the tax season \u2014 especially for the many Americans who have been accustomed to taking the path of least resistance in filing their taxes and receiving refunds \u2014 may play a significant role in shaping the reform politics of GOP leaders in the new Republican-controlled Congress, who have vowed to overhaul and/or repeal the law.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "Obamacare relies on the tax code to enforce its mandatory-insurance requirement.", "title": "Obamacare: Turning tax season into a feeding frenzy for 'specialists'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/01/taxes1011215.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-13T14:17:43+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/obamacare-turning-tax-season-feeding-frenzy-specialists/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/01/taxes1011215.jpg", "description": "Obamacare relies on the tax code to enforce its mandatory-insurance requirement.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare: Turning tax season into a feeding frenzy for 'specialists'"}, "description": "Obamacare relies on the tax code to enforce its mandatory-insurance requirement.", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Taxpayer Dimes", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-01-12T14:41:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-13T14:17:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Personal Liberty, Ben Bullard, Tax Code, Megan McArdle, Obamacare, Taxes"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because of Obamacare\u2019s reliance on the tax code to enforce its mandatory-insurance requirement (and on the IRS to assess penalties).\nBut Obamacare has introduced a significant level of complexity into the taxes of lower-middle-class wage earners.\nEven the mathematically challenged should, with the aid of a calculator, be able to fill out their 1040EZ forms just fine.\n\u201cTax preparers, to judge from my Twitter feed, have been panicking for months.\n\u201c[T]he big Obamacare event of this year will not be the exchange enrollments, but tax season, when people who got too much in subsidies find out how much money they owe the government,\u201d McArdle speculates."}
