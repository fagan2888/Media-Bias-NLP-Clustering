But as the long-standing nonprofit faces a perfect storm of trials with needing to relocate a key facility while strapped for funding, supporters are concerned downsizing and delays are looming. Since 1983, Project 90\u2019s largest residential and intake facility has been at the O\u2019Toole Center, a property just south of San Mateo\u2019s Central Park that\u2019s slated to be redeveloped in the coming year. Between the O\u2019Toole Center and another residential facility at 15 and 31 Ninth Ave., Project 90 stands to lose 34 beds and offices for nearly 15 employees as the sites\u2019 owner will be constructing a new office building and large apartment complex. While finding another building that provides both housing and office space will undoubtedly be a challenge in a county with rising rents, Project 90\u2019s Executive Director Jim Stansberry said he\u2019s also struggling to secure funding as many believed the Affordable Care Act would provide support. In addition, demand is being exacerbated due to new laws like California\u2019s Proposition 47 that reduced some drug-related crimes to misdemeanors \u2014 landing many with addiction problems back on the street or in environments where they\u2019re exposed to triggers that could lead them back into using. With numerous challenges ahead, some are fearful the organization that provides life-saving resources to the county will soon be overlooked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done or what would have happened if I didn\u2019t go to Project 90. I just can\u2019t say enough about the program. It saved my life,\u201d said Mike Devlin, a San Mateo resident who graduated from the program in 1994. \u201cWhere are these people going to go that need treatment in San Mateo County? You\u2019re going to see them at the hospital, you\u2019re going to see them in jail. \u2026 To lose a critical resource like this would be crazy.\u201d Location, location, location Stansberry said he\u2019s long had a positive relationship with the O\u2019Toole Center\u2019s landlord, Trans World Assurance Company but, due to its redevelopment plans, Project 90 needs an alternate building. The property, which used to be a convalescent home, has unique amenities and finding a substitute will be challenging. \u201cEverybody knows the cost of residences in San Mateo County is skyrocketing. So then it becomes a question of can you find a facility that fits, and then what would you need economically to be able to sustain it?\u201d Stansberry said. While many may find it undesirable to have a substance abuse treatment center move into their neighborhood, Stansberry said Project 90 has had a positive reputation and it\u2019s inherently safer to keep those who are struggling off the street. About four years ago, Project 90 was able to provide nearly 100 beds spread between several properties for those coming out of detox or in need of transitional housing. With its budget cut to around $1.5 million, less than half of what it was a few years ago, Project 90 can only afford about 38 beds and consistently has a long waitlist. Timing is critical The loss of resources is an extreme detriment to those seeking services and who need a place to break their cycle. Just this year, a man who finished detox was waiting for a bed to open up at Project 90. The few weeks delay eventually ended as the man died after not being able to get into a program, Stansberry said. \u201cIf it was any other disease and people were not getting treated, people would be questioning it,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cI know the county is looking at [funding options], but they don\u2019t realize the clock is ticking.\u201d Devlin agreed timing is critical, particularly for those who may be looking at homelessness or are susceptible to relapsing after going through detox. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust myself after I left [detox]. Timing is everything,\u201d said Devlin, who has held a steady job in pest control and continues to attend weekly Project 90 alumni meetings. Ensuring those who need help receive it contributes to society and Project 90\u2019s unfortunate downsizing over the years is concerning, said Suzanne Flecker, a resident of the nearby Hayward Park neighborhood and the wife of San Mateo Councilman Rick Bonilla. \u201cI feel strongly that the services that [Project 90] provides to San Mateo citizens enable individuals to heal and become productive members in our community. These services are desperately needed and fewer and fewer services of this kind are available. It would be a huge loss to San Mateo and the Peninsula at large if [Project 90] were to cease to exist,\u201d Flecker wrote in an email. Downsizing while awaiting the ACA Officials from Project 90 and Our Common Ground, another rehabilitation center with several sites throughout the county, are worried the ACA is having unintended consequences. Health professionals are hopeful those who need assistance will obtain Medicaid or Medi-Cal insurance that for the first time, would cover substance abuse treatment costs. Instead, the state is still awaiting a waiver that would allow providers like Project 90 to receive reimbursements based on a region\u2019s cost of doing business and provide more than 16 beds. Stansberry said it\u2019s difficult to proceed when the nonprofit\u2019s finances are in jeopardy. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is still kind of in limbo as to what they\u2019re going to do for residential programs. So it\u2019s like trying to make a commitment when you don\u2019t know what the rules are or what the compensation is going to be,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cIt\u2019s left us to a point where we\u2019re going to have to downsize.\u201d Project 90 supporters are hopeful the county, cities and residents will recognize the value of providing resources to those in need and accept that while they may not share the plight of an addict, they\u2019re still important members of the community. \u201cI go to alumni meetings every [week] and I\u2019ve never seen [attendance] this low in 20 years. It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s not because there\u2019s less alcoholics and addicts out there; it\u2019s that less people can get in to the program,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cIt would be such a loss to the community if it went away. Where do these people go? Shouldn\u2019t we be responsible for each other? There\u2019s new buildings constructed everywhere and rents are going up. I would just love to be able to see Project 90 survive.\u201d Visit projectninety.org for more information about rehabilitation services and Project 90. samantha@smdailyjournal.com (650) 344-5200 ext. 106", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Project 90 fighting to find home: Rehab must relocate key facility, faces funding cuts while waiting on ACA -", "title": "Project 90 fighting to find home: Rehab must relocate key facility, faces funding cuts while waiting on ACA - San Mateo Daily Journal", "url": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2015-06-12/project-90-fighting-to-find-home-rehab-must-relocate-key-facility-faces-funding-cuts-while-waiting-on-aca/1776425144953.html", "image": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/adv_image/smdj-large.jpg", "ttl": 2592000, "type": "website"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000103315106, "app_id": 484828421538257}, "GENERATOR": "San Mateo Daily Journal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca39f\"", "article_summary": "I would just love to be able to see Project 90 survive.\u201d Visit projectninety.org for more information about rehabilitation services and Project 90. samantha@smdailyjournal.com (650) 344-5200 ext.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done or what would have happened if I didn\u2019t go to Project 90.\nJust this year, a man who finished detox was waiting for a bed to open up at Project 90.\nTiming is everything,\u201d said Devlin, who has held a steady job in pest control and continues to attend weekly Project 90 alumni meetings.\nFor Project 90 clients seeking residential treatment to cope with substance abuse, timing is of the essence."}
