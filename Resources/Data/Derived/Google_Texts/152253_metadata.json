The government is advocating a rejection of the proposals.\n\nThe radical left-wing leader accused the creditors of using blackmail and ultimatums against his proud but struggling people. European officials and all Greek opposition parties except the extremist far-right Golden Dawn party called his move for a vote a foolish and rash gambit that effectively ended negotiations to keep Greece financially afloat.\n\nThe sudden move comes after five months of stalemated negotiations, with Tsipras accusing creditors of trying to strong-arm his country into taking harsh austerity measures he says would hammer an economy already on its knees after months of creditor-demanded spending cuts and tax hikes.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask us to agree, they asked us to surrender our political dignity,\u201d Tsipras said during a tumultuous and nearly 13-hour parliamentary session that cumulated in a vote just before 3 a.m. Sunday. Out of parliament\u2019s 300 lawmakers, 178 voted in favor and 120 against, with two people absent.\n\nHe insisted the Greek side had \u201cexhausted every limit\u201d of concessions so there could be an agreement, adding that \u201cperhaps some saw that as a weakness.\u201d\n\nThe referendum move further crumbled already strained relations between Greece and its European partners.\n\nTsipras said the Greek people would vote against a deal next Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis no will also be a big yes, a big yes to the decision of the Greek government to reject an ultimatum that insults the Greek people.\u201d\n\nTsipras dismissed harsh criticism from other European countries on his decision.\n\n\u201cThe referendum will take place as scheduled, next Sunday, whether our partners want it or not,\u201d he said.\n\nEurozone finance ministers earlier rejected Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 request for a one-month extension to the bailout program, with Varoufakis then leaving the meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for Europe, but we will overcome it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other 18 finance ministers then huddled without him to assess how to minimize the damage from the Greek crisis on their currency.\n\n\u201cOur institutions are and will be prepared to take any action if needed,\u201d said top eurozone official Jeroen Dijsselbloem of fears that financial turbulence might extend to the rest of the currency bloc. Fellow ministers spoke candidly about the risks of a Greek exit from the euro in a way that would have been inconceivable only weeks ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parliament approves referendum; Greece\u2019s future in balance", "title": "Parliament approves referendum; Greece\u2019s future in balance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Parliament approves referendum; Greece\u2019s future in balance", "title": "Parliament approves referendum; Greece\u2019s future in balance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/parliament_approves_referendum_greeces_future_in_balance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/greece-bailout.jpeg58-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parliament approves referendum; Greece\u2019s future in balance", "title": "Parliament approves referendum; Greece\u2019s future in balance", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/greece-bailout.jpeg58-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Raf Casert and Elena Becatoros", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Eurozone finance ministers earlier rejected Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 request for a one-month extension to the bailout program, with Varoufakis then leaving the meeting.\nThe other 18 finance ministers then huddled without him to assess how to minimize the damage from the Greek crisis on their currency.\n\u201cThe referendum will take place as scheduled, next Sunday, whether our partners want it or not,\u201d he said.\nThe referendum is set for next Sunday with the question on whether to accept proposed reforms needed to get bailout loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF.\nTsipras said the Greek people would vote against a deal next Sunday."}
