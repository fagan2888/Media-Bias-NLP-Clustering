A month ago, his wife, Kristin, gave birth to their first child, Vale Esme, and McDowell tied for 36th in his only tournament since \u2014 the BMW Championship in Colorado.\n\nHe is counting on a \u201cdelayed nappy (diaper) effect\u201d kicking in for his fourth straight Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.\n\n\u201cBy the time I got to Denver, I actually experienced a little bit of a flat, a little bit of a downer,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to terms with that, I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that sleeping is done, is gone forever. And I arrive here this week feeling fresh and ready to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Europe's come-from-behind victory, from 10-5 down at one stage on Saturday evening, has gone down in lore but it was tinged with disappointment for the Northern Irishman.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Europe\u2019s come-from-behind victory, from 10-5 down at one stage on Saturday evening, has gone down in lore but it was tinged with disappointment for the Northern Irishman.", "title": "Ryder Cup: Graeme McDowell seeks redemption after quiet Medinah showing", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/23/ryder-cup-graeme-mcdowell-seeks-redemption-after-q/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/23/britain-ryder-cup-gol_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/23/britain-ryder-cup-gol_lanc.jpg", "title": "Ryder Cup: Graeme McDowell seeks redemption after quiet Medinah showin", "description": "Europe's come-from-behind victory, from 10-5 down at one stage on Saturday evening, has gone down in lore but it was tinged with disappointment for the Northern Irishman.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Graeme Mcdowell, Gleneagles"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c07\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBy the time I got to Denver, I actually experienced a little bit of a flat, a little bit of a downer,\u201d McDowell said.\nGLENEAGLES, Scotland \u2014 Two years after the \u201cMiracle of Medinah,\u201d it\u2019s not just the Americans seeking redemption at the Ryder Cup.\nMcDowell has experienced it all at the Ryder Cup \u2014 the first shot (2012), the last shot (\u201810) and everything in between.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve come to terms with that, I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that sleeping is done, is gone forever.\n\u201cPerhaps I needed that little bit of intensity of the last groups,\u201d he said."}
