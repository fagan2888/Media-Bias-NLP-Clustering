AMZN, +0.93% continues to outpace the industry in sales and market share at the start of the holiday season, according to Pacific Crest analyst Chad Bartley. Amazon's same-store sales rose 26%, 24%, and 46% on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Saturday, respectively, Bartley said, citing ChannelAdvisor data. That rate of growth outpaced the industrywide average of 20%, 22% and 27% on each of those three days. While the three-day period didn't \"accelerate\" from its prior-year level, Bartley said the growth is still strong and indicates the company gained market share. Amazon's sales growth during the first three weeks of November outpaced its growth rate from a year earlier, signaling its total November sales will likely outpace the 12% growth rate in November 2013, he said. In comparison, Amazon rival eBay Inc. sales rose 3%, 27% and 15% on Thursday, Friday and Saturday respectively, down from the rate of 26%, 39% and 28% seen last year, Bartley said. \"Relative to Amazon and the industry, eBay EBAY, +0.35% continues to show weakness and lose share despite aggressive promotions,\" Bartley said. Both companies' shares were little changed in premarket trading.", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Andria Cheng", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-a-black-friday-weekend-winner-while-ebay-loses-ground-pacific-crest-2014-12-01", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Amazon a Black Friday weekend winner while eBay loses ground: Pacific Crest"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "creator": "@AndriaCheng", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Amazon a Black Friday weekend winner while eBay loses ground: Pacific Crest", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-01T08:49:00-05:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Andria Cheng", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-a-black-friday-weekend-winner-while-ebay-loses-ground-pacific-crest-2014-12-01", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "CA386A7E-70C2-4343-99FE-BAE11B66EC36"}, "article_summary": "\"Relative to Amazon and the industry, eBay EBAY, +0.35% continues to show weakness and lose share despite aggressive promotions,\" Bartley said.\nAmazon's same-store sales rose 26%, 24%, and 46% on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Saturday, respectively, Bartley said, citing ChannelAdvisor data.\nThat rate of growth outpaced the industrywide average of 20%, 22% and 27% on each of those three days.\nAmazon's sales growth during the first three weeks of November outpaced its growth rate from a year earlier, signaling its total November sales will likely outpace the 12% growth rate in November 2013, he said.\nIn comparison, Amazon rival eBay Inc. sales rose 3%, 27% and 15% on Thursday, Friday and Saturday respectively, down from the rate of 26%, 39% and 28% seen last year, Bartley said."}
