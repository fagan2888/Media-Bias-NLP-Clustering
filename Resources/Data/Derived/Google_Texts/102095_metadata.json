By relying on states to implement major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, like the Medicaid expansion and the creation of health insurance exchanges, the White House opened the door to state resistance and a debate over federalism.\n\nBefore Obamacare, federalism wasn\u2019t something we talked about much, in part because so much power and policymaking have consolidated in Washington, D.C., over the years. But that\u2019s not how our Republic was originally designed. As James Madison explained in Federalist 45, the powers of the federal government were to be \u201cfew and defined\u2026 most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State governments, in times of peace and security.\u201d\n\nThe idea, animated by our Founders\u2019 wariness of centralized power, was that the states and the federal government were to have separate, sovereign spheres, and that federal powers were to be enumerated, thus placing structural limits on what it could do.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius revived the question of federalism in an unexpected way. Before the ruling, most observers speculated about how the court would rule on the individual mandate. Could commerce clause jurisprudence be extended to compel individuals to engage in commerce by buying health insurance? In the end, the Court dodged that question by ruling the mandate\u2019s penalty a \u201ctax.\u201d The real shock was how the Court interpreted Obamacare\u2019s mandatory Medicaid expansion.\n\nAs written, the ACA compelled states to expand their Medicaid programs to include non-disabled adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. If not, they would lose all their federal Medicaid funding. But Chief Justice John Roberts found the Medicaid expansion was \u201ca gun to the head\u201d\u2013an unconstitutional coercion of the states by the federal government, and a violation of the principle of federalism.\n\nAnd yet compelling states to administer federal programs is precisely what Obamacare attempted to do through its expansion of Medicaid. Although technically run by state agencies, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promulgates copious rules for Medicaid, all of which the state must adhere to or risk losing federal funds. Forcing states to expand would have made their already weak position worse.\n\nStates, after all, rely on those federal Medicaid funds, which can run into the tens of billions for larger states like California and Texas. For every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, the feds reimburse it about 60 cents, depending on the state (some get more, some less). Because Medicaid now comprises nearly a quarter of state budgets on average, they have no choice but to comply with federal rules, which means the feds effectively control the program.\n\nBut Medicaid isn\u2019t the only program the federal government uses to deputize states into implementing its policies. Common Core, the Clean Air Act, and the federal highway system all operate under the guise of \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d\u2013the feds give money to the states with conditions attached, effectively controlling policy at the state level while retaining the fiction of state sovereignty. According to some estimates, the federal government has transferred about 15 percent of its budget to the states since the 1980s\u2013almost as much as the average annual federal deficit.\n\nStates have to operate on balanced budgets but the federal government doesn\u2019t. By inflating state budgets with deficit spending, the feds appropriate bloated state agencies with a deluge of rules and requirements.\n\nIs there a limit? The Court didn\u2019t say, and past precedent affirms that at least some conditions are allowed. In South Dakota v. Dole, the Court upheld a federal statute that withheld highway funds to states that didn\u2019t establish a legal drinking age of 21.\n\nBut if some conditions are allowed and others are not, what constitutes \u201ca gun to the head\u201d? We don\u2019t know yet, but the overreach of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion has established that there is indeed a limit. Federalism, if it means anything, means that Congress cannot simply dictate policy to the states, hiding its heavy hand through convoluted, \u201ccooperative\u201d funding schemes.\n\nJohn Davidson is the director of the Center for Health Care Policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Gun to the Head: Obamacare Medicaid Expansion and the Federal Takeover of State Governments", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A Gun to the Head: Obamacare Medicaid Expansion and the Federal Takeover of State Governments", "title": "A Gun to the Head: Obamacare Medicaid Expansion and the Federal Takeover of State Governments - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/11/15/federalism-poster.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/11/22/obamacare-medicaid-expansion-and-the-federal-takeover-of-state-governments/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Gun to the Head: Obamacare Medicaid Expansion and the Federal Takeover of State Governments", "title": "A Gun to the Head: Obamacare Medicaid Expansion and the Federal Takeover of State Governments - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/11/15/federalism-poster.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Supreme Court, White House,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-11-22T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a71\"", "article_summary": "We don\u2019t know yet, but the overreach of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion has established that there is indeed a limit.\nAnd yet compelling states to administer federal programs is precisely what Obamacare attempted to do through its expansion of Medicaid.\nIf not, they would lose all their federal Medicaid funding.\nStates, after all, rely on those federal Medicaid funds, which can run into the tens of billions for larger states like California and Texas.\nFor every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, the feds reimburse it about 60 cents, depending on the state (some get more, some less)."}
