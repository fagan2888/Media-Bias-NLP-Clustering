Take the example of a woman we\u2019ll call Nancy, who lives in southern Maine.\n\nNancy had sent the scammers money after the usual promise that payment of a few \u201cfees\u201d would free up the \u201cwinnings\u201d from the lottery that she had never entered. After the \u201cfees\u201d came \u201cthe taxes,\u201d then \u201chandling expenses,\u201d and on and on \u2026 and no money back to her.\n\nNancy\u2019s family became concerned and convinced her to stop wiring money to faceless people promising riches. They even persuaded her to change her phone number to an unpublished one. But the scammers weren\u2019t through.\n\nThey called a local plumber, saying they were family members concerned because they couldn\u2019t reach Nancy; they could get a disposable cellphone to him if he would deliver it. Once she had the phone, Nancy received an angry call from the scammers: Why had she changed her number? And what was her new phone number?\n\nShe told them \u2026 and the calls continued.\n\nNancy\u2019s story reflects the extent to which crooks will go to keep a victim on the hook. Scam artists first go to great lengths to convince their victims that they are friends looking out for their best interests. In some cases, they persuade their marks that they know better than friends or family members what\u2019s best, even though the parties have never met.\n\n\u201cThey have a reply to everything a person could say to them,\u201d says Jeff Nevins, spokesman for FairPoint Communications.\n\nEarlier this year, Fairpoint teamed up with law enforcement officials, AARP, state attorneys general and federal lawmakers to create a campaign called \u201cBeware: Scams from Area Code 876,\u201d referring to the designation for Jamaica from which 30,000 scam lottery calls originate every day.\n\nAs part of the campaign, FairPoint created the website bewareof876.com. It offers the following cautions:\n\n\u2014 If a caller says you\u2019ve won a lottery, don\u2019t pay any money to collect; real lotteries don\u2019t work that way.\n\n\u2014 Federal law prohibits playing a foreign lottery, so any such call is likely a scam.\n\n\u2014 Check any unfamiliar area codes before returning calls. Know that many three-digit area codes might connect to international telephone numbers, especially 876 (809, 284 and 649 are commonly used by scammers pretending to be injured relatives or hawking an overdue bill or cash prize).\n\n\u2014 If you don\u2019t make international calls, consider asking your provider to block outgoing international calls. You might add Caller ID, which can give you the option of ignoring suspicious international calls (remember that crooks can \u201cspoof\u201d their phone numbers to fool such devices).\n\n\u2014 Never give out your Social Security number, credit card numbers or banking information to callers.\n\nIn June, a Jamaican national entered a guilty plea to scamming charges in federal court; he\u2019s believed to be the first person charged. While the Jamaican government is reportedly cracking down on the crime, the sheer volume of calls leaves people -\u2013 especially seniors -\u2013 vulnerable if they\u2019re not cautious.\n\nIf you know someone who has been scammed or suspect you\u2019re a victim, a new hotline set up by the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging may help. Committee investigators can be reached from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays at 855-303-9470.
