Yeah, me neither. However, with the introduction of cat cafes and cat libraries, it seems the new norm for so-called \u201ccat people\u201d is bringing their shady four-legged friends wherever they go. The Homeward Bound Pet Shelter in Decatur, Ill. sent six cats to Yoga at Connie\u2019s in Latham, Ill. in hopes of finding suitable owners for cats in need of homes.\n\n\u201cJune is Adopt-a-Cat Month,\u201d the video descriptions reads. \u201cHere is the feature everyone has been talking about! The cats of #\u200eHBPS enjoyed some time on the mat with the students of Yoga at Connie's in this purrfect promotion. This small event raised over $500 for HBPS, including paw protector sponsors for two cats. In addition to those you see here, we have many other friendly and interactive felines patiently waiting for their forever homes.\u201d\n\nAlthough this is the first time Homeward Bound Pet Shelter and Yoga at Connie\u2019s collaborated for this unique feline-friendly event, they fully expect similar partnerships in the future to help raise awareness of pet adoption \u2014 especially since the event successfully raised $500 and facilitated the adoption of one of the yoga-loving cats. Considering only 37 percent of cats that arrive at animal shelters across the United States are eventually adopted, perhaps other shelters should ponder a similar course of action.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cat, yoga, its, bring, your, cat, work, day, yoga, studio, and, good, reason", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A yoga studio teamed up with this pet shelter to raise awareness for animals in need of adoption.", "title": "Bring Your Cat To Yoga Day!
