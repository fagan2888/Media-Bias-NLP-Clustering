The fact that they passed a motion like this and created an additional protected class in the policy, and then they are going to let people see later what this means, that\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s exactly what happened with Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBoard members said they had no choice in the matter: The feds were threatening to yank $47 million, or 1.7 percent of the district\u2019s annual budget, if they did not comply with the Obama administration\u2019s reinterpretation of Title IX. Title IX says nothing about transgender students, and Congress has rejected efforts to incorporate the issue into it, so the Obama administration just rewrote the law and is using it to smack around districts like Fairfax.\n\nThe consequences of federal involvement in classrooms have now become extremely clear. If the federal government did not subsidize classrooms with a dime of every dollar schools spend, it would have no power to march into classrooms and bully local school boards and teachers to submit to whatever whims seize the current president. That one man can have so much power, especially power outside the law, is plain tyranny. It is not rule by consent of the governed. It is not the rule of law. It\u2019s rule by brute force.\n\nThis incident and the growing number like it are not necessarily about, as here, transgender students and teachers. Americans believe in the dignity and intrinsic value of every human person. The root issue is who gets to tell local schools what to do, and whether they can fairly be called \u201clocal\u201d schools given increasing federal power over them.\n\nTo put it another way, at issue is whether individuals, families, and communities are free to address their concerns in a variety of ways, through diverse solutions they achieve on their own through self-government. Transgenderism is an entirely new frontier, and we don\u2019t know enough about its causes, effects, and solutions to demand that everyone address it in the same way. Central planning, besides destroying individual freedom, also is likely to harm the most vulnerable by restraining their ability to experiment with ways to meet their needs. In the process, it harms everyone else as well by preventing us from being part of a genuine solution.\n\nIt\u2019s time to roll back the federal role in education. Clearly, it\u2019s not using its power well.\n\nSOURCES: LifeSiteNews.com, Washington Times, Washington Post\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\nSchool Choice Roundup\n\nTENNESSEE: Gov. Bill Haslam has signed into law the state\u2019s first school choice program, an education savings account law providing for disabled children. Approximately 2 percent of K\u201312 students in Tennessee are eligible. More.\n\nMONTANA: A small tax credit scholarship program, the state\u2019s first, has become law without the governor\u2019s signature.\n\nTROJAN HORSE: The grassroots that typically would support school choice is growing leery of the idea given that it often comes with regulations that destroy private school autonomy and parent choice, several leaders say in reaction to a speech from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nFLORIDA: A foster child thrives in his new school, thanks to school choice. And a judge\u2019s decision to throw out a lawsuit against the state\u2019s popular school choice program means that little boy and other children can continue to enjoy the program\u2019s benefits.\n\nNEW YORK: Gov. Andrew Cuomo is stumping for an education tax credit program that would benefit both public and private schools.\n\nCHARTERS: Charter school \u201cauthorizers could shorten the average [charter school] application by at least one-third without sacrificing their ability to ensure quality--a change that could save applicants more than 700 hours of work,\u201d finds a new study on charter school overregulation from the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nCommon Core and Curriculum Watch\n\nOHIO: A bill to drop national Common Core tests and limit state tests\u2019 length to three hours per year passed the state House 92\u20131 this week.\n\nWISCONSIN: A massive increase in test opt-outs this year has accompanied opposition to Common Core, reports the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. Opt-out rates were as high as 80 percent at some elementary schools, and they tracked in tandem with the strength of local opposition to Common Core. In response, state lawmakers have introduced legislation to require districts to inform parents they may excuse their children from the tests, and require districts to publish which tests they administer and how long they take.\n\nMAINE: State lawmakers are considering bills to repeal Common Core and codify parents\u2019 testing opt-out rights. Meanwhile, this state is also seeing the biggest testing opt-out movement ever, with refusals by up to half the kids in some schools.\n\nDELAWARE: The state House has passed a bill, 36\u20133, to give parents explicit rights to opt their children out of tests. Parent opposition to testing has risen in conjunction with opposition to Common Core, The News Journal reports.\n\nCALIFORNIA: The governor\u2019s new budget dedicates an additional $3.5 billion for Common Core this year, which would bring the total of extra dollars taxpayers have paid for the initiative to $5.2 billion so far.\n\nTECH TROUBLES: Sixty-three percent of school districts don\u2019t have the technological capacity to administer Common Core tests online without disruptions, reports USA Today. That\u2019s a major reason the tests, rolling out just this spring, have been plagued with troubles.\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE: A teacher and self-described liberal explains why she\u2019s against Common Core--and it\u2019s largely all about the Soviet-style coercion. She would know, since she taught in the former USSR nearly 30 years ago.\n\nLOUISIANA: A compromise bill to review Common Core but not necessarily replace it made its way out of the House Education Committee this week.\n\nEducation Today\n\nDATA PRIVACY: National lawmakers are considering three new bills to restrict, to varying degrees, the data schools and education companies can collect on children, and under what circumstances. The strongest proposal is a Senate bill from Sen. David Vitter that limits schools and government agencies as well as companies.\n\nBULLYING: The latest data shows 22 percent of children reported being bullied at school in 2013, the lowest bullying rate since the national government began collecting such data eight years ago.\n\nGRIT: Here\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the new obsession with teaching and testing children for \u201cgrit\u201d (or perseverance) in an effort to help them succeed.\n\nCOLLEGE ENROLLMENT: Nationwide, college enrollment has decreased by 2 percent over past year. This is the fourth year in a row that college enrollment has declined.\n\nThank you for reading!
