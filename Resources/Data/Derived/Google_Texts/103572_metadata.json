The company has signaled it is considering pulling out of the public exchanges created as part of the federal health law, and UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley said during a Nov. 19 earnings update that reducing or eliminating commissions in most markets was among \u201cseveral immediate actions to reduce our exposure in this segment.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare has a relatively small presence on Connecticut\u2019s exchange, covering just 1.6 percent of 2016 customers. The company did not sell plans through the exchange in the first year it operated, 2014, and has since had among the highest prices on the marketplace.\n\nThe other three insurers that sell plans through Connecticut's exchange \u2013 Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ConnectiCare and HealthyCT \u2013 have said they had no plans to eliminate commissions this year.\n\nIf insurance companies want to eliminate commissions in the future, they will have to do so as part of their rate filings, Tommelleo said.\n\nAsked if the company would seek to eliminate the commissions in the future, a UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman said it was too soon to comment on plans for 2017.\n\nJim Wadleigh, the CEO of Access Health CT, the state\u2019s exchange, warned at a board meeting last month that companies eliminating commissions for exchange business was a growing national trend that would have a direct impact on customer experience. This year, 40 percent of Access Health\u2019s business came from agents and brokers. If they no longer sell exchange policies, Wadleigh added, Access Health would have to fill that role.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/12/state-says-unitedhealthcare-cant-ax-broker-commissions/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Connecticut Insurance Department, insurance, UnitedHealthcare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/12/state-says-unitedhealthcare-cant-ax-broker-commissions/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The Connecticut Insurance Department has blocked UnitedHealthcare\u2019s plan to stop paying broker commissions for plans sold through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, but will let them pay a lower rate.", "title": "State says UnitedHealthcare can\u2019t ax broker commissions", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/12/state-says-unitedhealthcare-cant-ax-broker-commissions/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/03/Pedro-Lopez-2-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/12/state-says-unitedhealthcare-cant-ax-broker-commissions/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fb0\"", "article_summary": "The Connecticut Insurance Department has blocked UnitedHealthcare\u2019s plan to stop paying broker commissions for plans sold through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, but will let them pay a lower rate.\nIf insurance companies want to eliminate commissions in the future, they will have to do so as part of their rate filings, Tommelleo said.\nUnitedHealthcare previously announced that it would stop paying commissions for new insurance policies offered through exchanges starting Jan. 1.\nIf they no longer sell exchange policies, Wadleigh added, Access Health would have to fill that role.\nThe other three insurers that sell plans through Connecticut's exchange \u2013 Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ConnectiCare and HealthyCT \u2013 have said they had no plans to eliminate commissions this year."}
