It began in Easton, Pennsylvania, ABC reported, with a Facebook-organized group called Chase the Chill, which has spread across Canada and the U.S. It dates back to 2008.\n\nChase the Chill says it\u2019s \u201can annual graffiti/yarn bombing event that distributes scarves in public places so that those in need \u2014 regardless of income and without any qualifiers \u2014 can help themselves.\u201d\n\nWilmington, North Carolina, has a similar organization: Scarves in the Port City, which has garnered national attention by doing what someone did in Deep Ellum. Says its Facebook page, \u201cWe collect and distribute scarves for the homeless during inclement weather. Our mission is to promote kindness and service in our community.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear \u2014 yet \u2014 who\u2019s doing the good deed in Dallas. A colleague believes it might be the Dallas Yarn Bombers, which did something similar with scarves conjunction with Warm Up America in February. We\u2019ve asked.
