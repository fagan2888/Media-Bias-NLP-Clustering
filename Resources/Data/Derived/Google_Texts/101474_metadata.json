Earlier this week, Guzm\u00e1n's attorney told a Mexican radio show that the cartel leader may be willing to waive extradition and plead guilty if he serves time at a medium security prison in the U.S.\n\nThis might be a hard sell considering the drug lord has escaped from maximum security prisons in Mexico \u2014 twice.\n\nPart of Guzm\u00e1n's change of mind is his treatment at the prison where he's currently held. According to his lawyer, Guzm\u00e1n is allegedly being woken up regularly to confirm he hasn't fled, something that's causing him migraines.\n\nWhile he is wanted in the U.S. on multiple charges, Guzm\u00e1n has several life sentences to serve in Mexico, which is why he hadn't been extradited before.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n's lawyer said he is talking to a U.S. lawyer to iron out the details of the extradition terms.\n\nThis video includes clips from the Government of Mexico, Univision and Telemundo and images from the U.S. Department of State and the Mexican Attorney General's Office", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n reportedly has a few terms if he's extradited to the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n reportedly has a few terms if he's extradited to the United States.", "title": "If 'El Chapo' Is Extradited To US, He Wants A Medium-Security Prison", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/if-el-chapo-is-extradited-to-us-he-wants-a-medium-security-prison/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1456582848.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n reportedly has a few terms if he's extradited to the United States.", "title": "If 'El Chapo' Is Extradited To US, He Wants A Medium-Security Prison", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/if-el-chapo-is-extradited-to-us-he-wants-a-medium-security-prison/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1456582848.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=ozbWNlMTE61QBeI56WcbYWgoxFapUXFT&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://57528", "iphone": "newsy://57528", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://57528", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "keywords": "El Chapo,Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n,El Chapo Extradition,Mexico government agrees to extradition,El Chapo US extradition,El Chapo prison escape,El Chapo prison,newsy,newsy videos", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1456582848.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n reportedly has a few terms if he's extradited to the United States.\nAccording to his lawyer, Guzm\u00e1n is allegedly being woken up regularly to confirm he hasn't fled, something that's causing him migraines.\nThis might be a hard sell considering the drug lord has escaped from maximum security prisons in Mexico \u2014 twice.\nMexico has been willing to extradite drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n to the U.S. since the beginning of the year, and now Guzm\u00e1n seems ready to take the government up on that offer.\nThis video includes clips from the Government of Mexico, Univision and Telemundo and images from the U.S. Department of State and the Mexican Attorney General's Office"}
