Medicare fully pays for mammograms once every 12 months with no upper age limit.\n\n\n\nFULL QUESTION\n\nIs it true that now that ObamaCare or Affordable Care has been enacted, yearly mammograms for women over 70 will not be covered by Medicare or Obamacare. Surely not. Awful rumor going round.\n\n_________________________\n\nDoes Obamacare limit the number of times women get a mammogram and at what age?\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nSeveral readers have asked us questions, such as those listed above, about whether the Affordable Care Act would limit their ability to get a mammogram, or if insurance or Medicare wouldn\u2019t cover mammograms under the law. One reader wrote that a doctor told her cousin she couldn\u2019t get a mammogram under Obamacare once she turned 74. If so, that doctor is misinforming his or her patients.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act actually improves coverage of mammograms for Medicare beneficiaries and an unknown number of women on private insurance, depending on what their insurance covered previously. The law requires Medicare to cover a yearly mammography screening at no cost to women starting at age 40. For private insurance plans, the law also requires coverage of mammograms, with no cost-sharing, every one to two years for women starting at age 40.\n\nFor seniors, this is a step up in benefits: Before the health care law, mammograms were also covered, but with 20 percent cost-sharing. For private plans, coverage varied, but under the ACA, women get free mammograms as part of required preventive coverage. That\u2019s for non-grandfathered plans starting on or after Sept. 23, 2010. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a big change,\u201d said Mona Shah, associate director of federal relations for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cWe know based on research that even a small cost-sharing can be a deterrent to getting screened.\u201d\n\nTraditional Medicare began fully paying for mammograms in 2011, and all Medicare Advantage plans \u2014 those offered by private insurers \u2014 were required to do so as of 2012. That information is available on the website of the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit group that offers counseling and assistance to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nAlso, the law\u2019s requirements for free preventive care \u2014 which, beyond mammograms, includes screenings for cholesterol, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancers such as prostate and cervical, and immunizations \u2014 are minimum requirements, designed to guarantee certain preventive benefits are part of insurance policies. \u201cInsurers could cover above and beyond what\u2019s in the law,\u201d Shah said.\n\nShe told us there wasn\u2019t any kind of upper age limit with Medicare \u2014 a fact that a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson also confirmed with us \u2014 and her organization hadn\u2019t heard anything about women being denied coverage. \u201cI think those claims are pretty much inaccurate,\u201d Shah said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends women continue yearly mammograms \u201cas long as they are in good health.\u201d For elderly women, mammograms should continue \u201cas long as she does not have serious, chronic health problems such as congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe dementia,\u201d the ACS says.\n\nThe Medicare Rights Center\u2019s Mitchell Clark, the senior communications associate, also told us his group hadn\u2019t \u201cheard of any issues where people have been denied coverage of mammogram or had trouble getting a mammogram based on their age, but we do get calls from time to time about unexpected costs.\u201d The group notes that while the preventive services are free, there may be a facility fee at certain hospitals or an office visit fee if the patient has a doctor\u2019s appointment before or after the preventive screening.\n\nWe also called the American Geriatrics Society. Carol Goodwin, associate vice president of communications for the group, told us: \u201cWe have not been getting any specific reports from our members or the public that screenings have been denied for women over the age of 74.\u201d\n\nSo, where does this rumor come from? That magic \u201c74\u201d age that several readers mentioned leads us to controversial recommendations in 2009 from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, recommendations that were specifically rejected by the Affordable Care Act and also widely misinterpreted.\n\nThe 2009 Controversy\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created in 1984 during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. It\u2019s an independent, and volunteer, panel of primary care physicians and experts in preventive medicine. The panel makes recommendations on preventive care based on peer-reviewed evidence. Its recommendations \u201care intended to help primary care clinicians and patients decide together whether a preventive service is right for a patient\u2019s needs,\u201d as the panel\u2019s website says.\n\nIts recommendations apply to patients \u201cwho have no signs or symptoms of the specific disease or condition under evaluation\u201d and pertain to \u201conly services offered in the primary care setting or services referred by a primary care clinician.\u201d\n\nThe task force\u2019s 2002 recommendations on mammography said that it \u201crecommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1-2 years for women aged 40 and older.\u201d And that recommendation has been echoed by many cancer organizations, with groups including the American Cancer Society encouraging a yearly screening. The panel said \u201cavailable trials also have not reported a clear advantage of annual mammography over biennial mammography\u201d for women between ages 40 and 50, and that for women over 50, there\u2019s also \u201clittle evidence\u201d that it\u2019s better to get a mammogram annually as opposed to every other year. Risk factors such as family history would strengthen a recommendation for a yearly screening, the task force said.\n\nIn November 2009, the task force issued new mammography recommendations, saying that it recommended biennial screening starting at age 50. It said that for women younger than 50, the decision to have a mammogram should be an \u201cindividual one and take patient context into account, including the patient\u2019s values regarding specific benefits and harms.\u201d The harms were mainly false positive tests.\n\nIn the grading system of the Preventive Services Task Force, that recommendation for women under 50 was a C recommendation, which means providing the service depends on \u201cindividual circumstances,\u201d but for most symptom-free patients \u201cthere is likely to be only a small benefit from this service.\u201d As for women 75 and older, the task force said evidence wasn\u2019t available to determine benefits versus harms for that age group. That\u2019s an I statement, which means \u201c[e]vidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\u201d The task force described it as a \u201cnear total lack of trial data for older women.\u201d\n\nThe 2009 recommendations did not say that women under 50 or over 74 shouldn\u2019t get mammograms at all, even though that\u2019s the way the recommendations have been wrongly interpreted by some. The task force issued the new recommendations when the health care law was being debated in Congress, likely intensifying the reaction. We debunked one ad back in 2010, from a conservative group, that falsely claimed the \u201cguidelines\u201d say that \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t receive mammograms until age 50\u2033 and that if the health care legislation were passed, such guidelines \u201ccould become the law for all kinds of diseases.\u201d\n\nThat ad also criticized the task force for being a \u201cgovernment panel\u201d that doesn\u2019t include \u201ccancer experts.\u201d As we said then, that\u2019s a matter of definition. The task force is sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, but its members are doctors and professors who volunteer their services. The task force is designed to be made up of primary care doctors and experts in preventive medicine. The 2009 panel included one public health expert and two experts in epidemiology, the study of the spread of disease.\n\nAs we said, the task force\u2019s 2009 recommendations were controversial, especially to groups that had long encouraged women to get screened every year once they turned 40. The American Cancer Society and the advocacy group Susan G. Komen for the Cure rejected those recommendations. The Susan G. Komen group said it worried confusion over the recommendations would lead women to not be screened. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said women should \u201ckeep doing what you have been doing for years.\u201d\n\nSebelius, Nov. 18, 2009: The U.S. Preventive Task Force is an outside independent panel of doctors and scientists who make recommendations. They do not set federal policy and they don\u2019t determine what services are covered by the federal government. \u2026 My message to women is simple. Mammograms have always been an important life-saving tool in the fight against breast cancer and they still are today. Keep doing what you have been doing for years \u2014 talk to your doctor about your individual history, ask questions, and make the decision that is right for you.\n\nDr. Susan Love of the Susan Love Research Foundation supported the guidelines, saying they were \u201cjust that, guidelines\u201d and that \u201cmammography is not a good tool for finding breast cancer in younger women and we need to put our efforts to finding something better.\u201d\n\nThe chair of the task force, Dr. Virginia A. Moyer, a pediatrician, was quoted by CNN in 2011 saying that the panel\u2019s recommendation wasn\u2019t that women under 40 shouldn\u2019t have a mammogram, though that\u2019s the way it was interpreted. \u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to be discussed on an individual basis. For some women, it will be consistent with their values to choose to have a mammogram between 40 and 50. For other women, they will choose not to, and those are both reasonable decisions.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nWhen the controversy erupted, Congress was debating health care overhaul legislation, which would require insurers to cover, at a minimum, certain preventive services. On Dec. 3, 2009, the Senate passed an amendment by Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland that would require full coverage of annual mammograms, including for women under 50, and many other women\u2019s preventive services. The same day, the Senate agreed, without a vote, to an amendment by Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana that said the law, and \u201cany other provision of law,\u201d should ignore the 2009 recommendations on mammography by the Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThat language was in the final legislation that was signed into law in late March 2010 by President Obama. Section 2713, which deals with \u201ccoverage of preventive health services\u201d says: \u201c[F]or the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any other provision of law, the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009.\u201d\n\nThat section says that group and individual health insurance coverage \u201cshall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements\u201d for various preventive items, including immunizations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and services with an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating from the Preventive Services Task Force. Except, as the Vitter amendment said, the law would not consider the 2009 mammography recommendations as current. That means the minimum coverage requirements follow the 2002 recommendations.\n\nThe section notes that these are not limitations on what insurers can cover: \u201cNothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in addition to those recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for services that are not recommended by such Task Force.\u201d\n\nThis page on the Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s website lists the panel\u2019s ratings that are relevant to the Affordable Care Act, noting that the law uses the 2002 recommendations on breast cancer screenings.\n\nWhen the Department of Health and Human Services issued a ruling in July 2010 saying the no-cost annual mammograms starting at age 40 and other preventive services would apply to health plans issued on or after Sept. 23, 2010, the Susan G. Komen organization applauded the announcement. \u201cBy requiring health insurers to offer no-cost access to mammography for women age 40 to 49, HHS has relieved concerns women have had since the United States Preventive Services Task Force issued its controversial guidelines last fall,\u201d said Jennifer M. Luray, president of the Komen Advocacy Alliance, in a press release.\n\nSo, the Affordable Care Act increases coverage of mammograms for women, depending on what their insurance covered previously. And it specifically rejects those 2009 mammography recommendations, which didn\u2019t limit mammography for women anyway.\n\nThe episode highlights the political pressures that may fall on this independent task force. Dr. Steven H. Woolf, a former task force member, and Dr. Doug Campos-Outcalt, a liaison between the American Academy of Family Physicians and the USPSTF, wrote of their concerns in the Journal of the American Medical Association, saying that using the USPSTF in the Affordable Care Act to determine coverage mandates exposes the board to pressure from interest groups and threatens its scientific independence. They concluded: \u201cA law that liberates the USPSTF to focus on the science and creates a more appropriate policy body to determine first-dollar coverage for preventive services would enable Congress to defend scientific independence and create a wiser structure for achieving the good intentions of the ACA.\u201d\n\nMisinformation Lives On\n\nLike a bogus viral email that won\u2019t die, false and misleading information about mammograms and the Affordable Care Act continues to circulate, as evidenced by the questions we\u2019ve received from readers over the past several months. One recent source of such misinformation is a Sept. 25 interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning show with Dr. Kris Held, an ophthalmologist and ophthalmic surgeon in Texas, a breast cancer survivor and a founder of American Doctors 4 Truth, a group that opposes the Affordable Care Act. (The group was responsible for the ad depicting President Obama throwing a grandmother off a cliff.) The Fox News segment presents a misleading version of the 2009 task force recommendations as new \u201cRestrictions on Mammograms.\u201d\n\nHeld talked to Fox News host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, telling her that \u201cObamacare has panels and task forces which have changed the very recommendations\u201d for mammography. Hasselbeck asks Held to \u201ctalk about the changes, the restrictions now,\u201d as a graphic is shown that says \u201cHealth Care Law\u201d and \u201cRestrictions on Mammograms.\u201d That\u2019s followed by a second graphic that lists \u201cMammogram Restrictions\u201d including \u201cScreenings starting at age 50, not 40\u2033 and \u201cScreenings end at age 74.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a misrepresentation of the 2009 Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, as we\u2019ve explained. The graphics on screen refer to \u201crestrictions\u201d while Held calls them \u201crecommendations,\u201d but nowhere in the segment do Held and Hasselbeck mention that they\u2019re talking about the 2009 recommendations that aren\u2019t part of the law.\n\nWhen we reached Held by phone, she said that she wasn\u2019t trying to say that women under 50 can\u2019t get a mammogram under the Affordable Care Act. She knew that the 2009 recommendations had been rejected by the law, saying that was \u201cin added on parts to it\u201d and after a \u201cpublic outcry.\u201d\n\nHeld said her point was to criticize the task force and compare the 2009 recommendations with a recent study published in the journal Cancer that found a significant death rate among younger women who didn\u2019t get regularly mammograms. She said that \u201cexperts in the field\u201d come up with \u201cvery different recommendations\u201d than the Preventive Services Task Force, which the law refers to in determining free preventive coverage requirements. She said that \u201cgovernment task forces are different\u201d and factor in \u201callocation of resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think those task force recommendations were appalling\u201d she said of the 2009 recommendations. \u201cSo they got addressed and [the law] got changed.\u201d But, \u201cwhat happens in the future?\u201d\n\nThat point, however, wasn\u2019t made in the news segment, which leaves the distinct impression that Obamacare is restricting women\u2019s ability to get a mammogram or have one covered by insurance. Held twice stressed to us that it was \u201creally hard in three minutes\u201d to get her points across. We asked in a follow-up email if she thought there should be a clarification or correction to the segment, and she replied: \u201cThe clarification to the segment should be for me to emphasize more clearly how horrible the USPSTF is and how powerful their bad recommendations are.\u201d\n\nHeld told us over the phone that there was nothing stopping insurance companies from not covering mammograms before the Affordable Care Act, but now \u201cyou\u2019re forced to buy something and pay for services you may or may not want.\u201d Indeed, the American Doctors 4 Truth 11-point plan for a health care overhaul says insurance should cover \u201cunanticipated\u201d care, not preventive. \u201cThe notion that insurance is pre-payment for routine and preventive healthcare cannot be fiscally sustained,\u201d it says.\n\nIn the Fox News interview, Hasselbeck asks about screenings ending at age 74, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re 75 years old, even if you\u2019ve had a history? How can this be?\u201d\n\nHeld responds: \u201cWhat does that tell you? They don\u2019t even want to know because I guess they don\u2019t want to spend the money then to go ahead and treat you.\u201d\n\nIn our phone interview, Held maintained that mammograms weren\u2019t covered by Medicare for women over age 74, saying her 78-year-old mother \u201cwent to have one, and they didn\u2019t cover it this year.\u201d But after we challenged that, Held said, in a subsequent email, that her mother \u201cgot through to Medicare\u201d on Oct. 16, and was told annual mammograms are covered, and a letter she says her mother had received denying coverage was wrong. She said she would send us the letter, and we will update this article if we receive it. \u201cIn fact, if a doctor says it\u2019s medically necessary a woman could even have one more often\u201d than annually, Held wrote. \u201cI hope it stays that way.\u201d\n\nThat makes at least one senior who is no longer misinformed about mammograms and Obamacare.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 21: Held sent us the Medicare document that she says led her mother to believe mammograms weren\u2019t covered. The document says nothing about mammograms. Instead, the Medicare Summary Notice \u2013 a summary of what was billed to Medicare and the amount seniors may owe \u2013 says a \u201ccervical or vaginal cancer screening; pelvic and clinical breast examination\u201d wasn\u2019t approved because \u201cMedicare pays for a screening Pap smear and/or screening pelvic examination only once every 2 years unless high risk factors are present.\u201d A pelvic examination can include a clinical breast exam, in which a doctor examines a patient\u2019s breasts, according to Medicare documents. The form Held\u2019s mother received said she couldn\u2019t be billed anything for the pelvic exam, even though it was not an approved service. A note at the bottom of the page said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know this service isn\u2019t covered so you don\u2019t have to pay. \u2026 Future services of this type won\u2019t be paid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson\n\nSources\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
