And while bias in the media is rampant regardless of the source, National Review, CNS, and my bosses at LifeSiteNews.com admit where we\u2019re coming from.\n\nMeanwhile, mainstream outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC News, and others not only claim to be straight down the middle in their reporting and editorializing, but they also garner far more viewership than the admittedly biased media sources. (Fox is an exception in its avoidance of liberal bias and its outsized ratings, but the king of cable, Bill O\u2019Reilly, for example, garners far less viewership than each of the CBS, NBC, and ABC evening shows.)\n\nSo it\u2019s important that the American voter, who uses the Times, the Post, and the evening news shows as their main outlets for news, understands how they can frame the news such that they essentially become shills for the Democratic Party\u2019s policies and attack lines.\n\nFour broad examples of this pattern:\n\n\n\nGetting presidents elected\n\nIt\u2019s easy to cherry-pick the mainstream media\u2019s reporting and opinions and claim media bias. (Certainly, that is what critics of this piece will claim I\u2019ve done.) It\u2019s a favorite pastime of conservatives, and sometimes we can overstate individual circumstances.\n\nTherefore, I\u2019d like to start off with some empirical data showing widespread bias for Democrats in election coverage. Let\u2019s start with the 2012 presidential race.\n\nBack then, liberals cheered the results of a study showing that Obama received more negative coverage than 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney during the Republican party\u2019s primary season. But it doesn\u2019t make much sense to compare a sitting president to a front-runner nominee\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Journalism Project, in a period from late August to late October, during the general election, both Obama and Romney faced periods of intense imbalance when it came to positive vs. negative news coverage. But while Obama\u2019s worst period showed less than a 3:1 imbalance of negative to positive coverage, Romney\u2019s worst period showed a 4:1 ratio.\n\nLikewise, coverage of Obama was 22 percent positive and 27 percent negative during his most favorable period. Romney\u2019s best time period was still negative: 20 percent positive coverage to 30 percent negative.\n\nAnd this imbalance isn\u2019t confined to the 2012 election. After the 2008 election, the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affiars (CMPA) found the following:\n\nCMPA analyzed every soundbite by reporters and nonpartisan sources (excluding representative of the political parties) that evaluated the candidates and their policies. On the three broadcast networks combined, evaluations of Obama were 68% positive and 32% negative, compared to the only 36% positive and 64% negative evaluations of his GOP opponent John McCain. In fact, Obama received the most favorable coverage CMPA has ever recorded for any presidential candidate since we began tracking election news coverage in 1988.\n\nEven the reporting portion of Fox News\u2019s primetime Special Report, which was relentlessly negative on Senator Obama in 2008, was more even-handed than the mainstream networks. From CMPA\u2019s analysis:\n\nMeanwhile, Fox\u2019s Special Report was dramatically tougher on Obama, with only 36% favorable vs. 64% unfavorable evaluations during the same time period. But McCain didn\u2019t fare much better, garnering only 40% favorable comments vs. 60% negative ones. So the broadcast networks gave good marks to one candidate and bad marks to another, while Fox was tough on both\u2013and most balanced overall.\n\nAnd remember: The mainstream evening news garners millions of more viewers than Special Report.\n\nIn 2004, CMPA also found a distinct bias. It examined the three mainstream evening news shows, Special Report, and Time and Newsweek, from June 2 to September 1 of that year. While then-senator John Kerry got a two-to-one positive coverage differential, they found \u201cevaluations of George W. Bush were over 60 percent negative.\u201d\n\nAlso, they report, \u201camong non-partisan sources, Kerry\u2019s evaluations were almost three-to-one positive; Bush\u2019s were over two-to-one negative.\u201d\n\nSo, overall, the mainstream media has been incredibly biased toward Democrats for the last three presidential election cycles. But even that big-picture analysis can miss the egregious nature and damage of individual attacks.\n\nAs the 2012 presidential campaign picked up speed, PolitiFact often acted as a de facto member of the Obama campaign: For instance, it failed to correctly assess a claim by Obama and a campaign surrogate about alleged cuts to federal education funding. The fact-checking site actually made the error twice \u2014 once when grading Obama, and once when grading the surrogate.\n\nAnd, of course, who can forget that the Washington Post somehow unearthed an unsourced story about Romney\u2019s allegedly bullying a classmate in high school \u2014 five decades before the 2012 elections?\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWar on Women\u201d\n\nThis was a particularly effective Democratic attack line that began in the 2012 elections. It may have been in large part responsible for Democratic wins in Indiana and Missouri Senate races and ginned up a great deal of cultural-liberal enthusiasm for President Obama\u2019s reelection victory. It even helped boost Terry McAuliffe to victory over Ken Cuccinelli in the 2013 Virginia governor\u2019s race.\n\nDemocrats had plenty of help on this front from the mainstream media. In January of 2012, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News asked Republican primary candidates if they would ban contraception \u2014 which wasn\u2019t a public-policy issue until the Obama administration put forth its unconstitutional mandate less than two weeks later, and was never a public-policy proposal any prominent Republican, let alone one of the candidates, had considered.\n\nAnd, of course, who can forget how mainstream-media outlets somehow found Richard Mourdock\u2019s clumsy but morally sensible comments about pregnancies resulting from rape worth a firestorm of attention? Unsurprisingly, these comments were tied to the inarticulate \u2014 at best \u2014 and scientifically inaccurate comments of Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin. Both comments somehow ended up being connected to the GOP nominee for president, Mitt Romney.\n\nFinally, in 2013, Democrat Terry McAuliffe went after his Virginia gubernatorial opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, claiming that the candidate wants to ban contraception. This inaccurate claim relied on conflating contraceptives \u2014 which prevent pregnancy \u2014 with abortifacients, which end a pregnancy, and thus cause an abortion.\n\nRather than correct the record, the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board hopped on the bandwagon, accusing Cuccinelli of the same. As Drew Belsky correctly highlighted in a post for Live Action, however, opposing certain abortifacients has nothing to do with one\u2019s stance on contraception.\n\nPolitiFact declined to include the so-called \u201cWar on Women\u201d in its year-end list of 2012\u2019s biggest lies. Its reasons were less than convincing, as I noted in a fact-check at the time.\n\n\n\nTargeting the Tea Party\n\nSince 2009, the Tea Party has been one of the most important influences in American politics. While Republicans have been a bit wary of the movement in their own way, it\u2019s Democrats who have waged a real war on it, claimed the movement is flush with racism and extremism.\n\nUnfortunately, this lie \u2014 refuted by more than one intellectually honest liberal \u2014 has been repeated throughout mainstream and liberal media sources.\n\nMedia Research Center\u2019s Dan Gainor has noted that tea partiers were prominently linked to, or blamed for, the shooting of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater.\n\nLarry O\u2019Connor also highlighted how rock-throwing by Ferguson protesters has been treated with more respect by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes than legal tea-party activism. And who can forget the race-baiting accusation that tea partiers spit on Representative Emanuel Cleaver as he and other Democrats purposely marched through crowds of tea-party protesters in order to spark a confrontation that never happened? That was treated as serious rather than utterly spurious and unsupported.\n\nFlacking for the Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is an immensely complicated and controversial piece of legislation, some provisions of which can be misconstrued. But the mainstream media has repeatedly tried to reframe or refute conservative criticisms.\n\nFor instance, the Huffington Post grossly misled readers about a study examining whether the ACA would reduce worker hours. While the HuffPo article on the study made a sweeping conclusion that a small number of businesses nationwide would reduce hours, the study itself only looked at one region of the country. Meanwhile, the study noted that \u201csome [business owners] commented that it is too early to know the effects of the law\u2019s detailed regulations.\u201d Hardly conclusive, in other words. And besides, the study concluded that there would be a 10 percent shift to part-time employment by business owners on account of the ACA \u2014 which, if it actually took place, would constitute an enormous change in the employment situation in America.\n\nHuffPo\u2019s treatment of this study is emblematic of how the media has dealt with the ACA\u2019s economic downsides more broadly \u2014 try to discredit GOP worries because the effects haven\u2019t shown up yet (even though, for instance, the employer mandate hasn\u2019t even gone into effect yet) and then just argue that the effects will be only marginal.\n\nTake another complicated debate about the ACA: the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which is designed to rejigger Medicare payments in the future to restrain health costs. During the 2012 elections, FactCheck.org targeted conservatives\u2019 claims that this means the ACA\u2019s IPAB rations health care, saying that no such thing exists.\n\nYet less than a year later, former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean said that was exactly what IPAB amounts to.\n\nDean wasn\u2019t alone in his assessment. My good friend and occasional client James Agresti, president of Just Facts, proved the same thing, and famous rationing proponent Dr. Donald Berwick \u2014 who was considered to head Medicare and Medicaid by President Obama \u2014 also agreed that IPAB was a tool for rationing. Of course, it\u2019s possible to argue otherwise \u2014 but the mainstream media has dismissed the GOP argument on this issue as if it\u2019s a conspiracy theory.\n\nFinally, the same dishonest representation of contraceptives referenced in above, related to Cuccinelli and McAuliffe, has played itself out in numerous mainstream-media stories on the ACA.\n\nBelsky and I highlighted on how Politico, NBC News, Pew Research, and the New York Times all did this in early 2014, thus misleading their millions of readers on the realities of how employees are being required to cover abortifacients under the Affordable Care Act. NBC News even had the gall to write the following beneath one of its articles:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story stated the Affordable Care Act requires companies to offer health-care coverage that provides abortion-inducing drugs to their employees. It does not.\n\nThe federal government happens to disagree.\n\nIs this a comprehensive list of media biases? Absolutely not, and the fine folks at the Media Research Center do a great job of highlighting such bias, as do the reporters at Heritage\u2019s Daily Signal and other outlets. But on such important broad issues and narratives as I\u2019ve covered, it\u2019s important that the average American knows some of the historical bias in the mainstream media so they can parse the truth. With two months to go in the 2014 midterm elections, we haven\u2019t seen much improvement.\n\n\u2014 Dustin Siggins is the D.C.

Unsurprisingly, these comments were tied to the inarticulate \u2014 at best \u2014 and scientifically inaccurate comments of Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin. Both comments somehow ended up being connected to the GOP nominee for president, Mitt Romney.\n\nFinally, in 2013, Democrat Terry McAuliffe went after his Virginia gubernatorial opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, claiming that the candidate wants to ban contraception. This inaccurate claim\u00a0relied on conflating contraceptives \u2014 which prevent pregnancy \u2014 with abortifacients, which end a pregnancy, and thus cause an abortion.\n\nRather than correct the record, the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board\u00a0hopped on the bandwagon, accusing Cuccinelli of the same. As Drew Belsky correctly highlighted in a post for Live Action, however, opposing certain abortifacients has nothing to do with one\u2019s stance on contraception.\n\nPolitiFact declined to include the so-called \u201cWar on Women\u201d in its year-end list of 2012\u2019s biggest lies. Its reasons were less\u00a0than\u00a0convincing, as I noted in a fact-check at the time.\n\nTargeting the Tea Party\n\nSince 2009, the Tea Party has been one of the most important influences in American politics. While Republicans have been a bit wary of the\u00a0movement in their own way, it\u2019s Democrats who have waged a real war on it, claimed the movement is flush with racism and extremism.\n\nUnfortunately, this lie \u2014 refuted by more than one intellectually honest liberal \u2014 has been repeated throughout mainstream and liberal media sources.\n\n#page#Media Research Center\u2019s Dan Gainor has noted that tea partiers were prominently linked to, or blamed for, the shooting of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater.\u00a0\n\nLarry O\u2019Connor also highlighted how rock-throwing by Ferguson protesters has been treated with more respect by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes than legal tea-party activism. And who can forget the race-baiting accusation that tea partiers spit on Representative Emanuel Cleaver as he and other Democrats purposely marched through crowds of tea-party protesters\u00a0in order to spark a confrontation that never happened? That was treated as serious rather than utterly spurious and unsupported.\n\nFlacking for the Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is an immensely complicated and controversial piece of legislation, some provisions of which can be misconstrued. But the mainstream media has repeatedly tried to reframe or refute conservative criticisms.\n\n#ad#For instance, the Huffington Post grossly misled readers about a study examining whether the ACA would reduce worker hours. While the HuffPo article on the study made a sweeping conclusion that a small number of businesses nationwide would reduce hours, the study itself only looked at one region of the country. Meanwhile, the study noted that \u201csome [business owners] commented that it is too early to know the effects of the law\u2019s detailed regulations.\u201d Hardly conclusive, in other words. And besides, the study concluded that there would be a 10 percent shift to part-time employment by business owners on account of the ACA \u2014 which, if it actually took place, would constitute an enormous change in the employment situation in America.\n\nHuffPo\u2019s treatment of this study is emblematic of how the media has dealt with the ACA\u2019s economic downsides more broadly \u2014 try to discredit GOP worries because the effects haven\u2019t shown up yet (even though, for instance, the employer mandate hasn\u2019t even gone into effect yet) and then just argue that the effects will be only marginal.\n\nTake another complicated debate about the ACA: the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which is designed to rejigger Medicare payments in the future to restrain health costs. \u00a0During the 2012 elections, FactCheck.org targeted conservatives\u2019 claims that this means the ACA\u2019s IPAB rations health care, saying that no such thing exists.\n\nYet less than a year later, former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean said that was exactly what IPAB amounts to.\n\nDean wasn\u2019t alone in his assessment. My good friend and occasional client James Agresti, president of Just Facts, proved the same thing, and famous rationing proponent Dr. Donald Berwick \u2014 who was considered to head Medicare and Medicaid by President Obama \u2014 also agreed that IPAB was a tool for rationing. Of course, it\u2019s possible to argue otherwise \u2014 but the mainstream media has dismissed the GOP argument on this issue as if it\u2019s a conspiracy theory.\n\nFinally, the same dishonest representation of contraceptives referenced in above, related to Cuccinelli and McAuliffe, has played itself out in numerous mainstream-media stories on the ACA.\n\nBelsky and I highlighted on how Politico, NBC News, Pew Research, and the New York Times all did this in early 2014, thus misleading their millions of readers on the realities of how employees are being required to cover abortifacients under the Affordable Care Act. NBC News even had the gall to write the following beneath one of its articles:\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story stated the Affordable Care Act requires companies to offer health-care coverage that provides abortion-inducing drugs to their employees. It does not.\n\n\nThe federal government happens to disagree.\n\nIs this a comprehensive list of media biases? Absolutely not, and the fine folks at the Media Research Center do a great job of highlighting such bias, as do the reporters at Heritage\u2019s\u00a0Daily Signal and other outlets. But on such important broad issues and narratives as I\u2019ve covered, it\u2019s important that the average American knows some of the historical bias in the mainstream media so they can parse the truth. With two months to go in the 2014 midterm elections, we haven\u2019t seen much improvement.\n\n\u2014 Dustin Siggins is the D.C.

And while bias in the media is rampant regardless of the source, National Review, CNS, and my bosses at LifeSiteNews.com admit where we\u2019re coming from.\n\nMeanwhile, mainstream outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC News, and others not only claim to be straight down the middle in their reporting and editorializing, but they also garner far more viewership than the admittedly biased media sources. (Fox is an exception in its avoidance of liberal bias and its outsized ratings, but the king of cable, Bill O\u2019Reilly, for example, garners far less viewership than each of the CBS, NBC, and ABC evening shows.)\n\n#ad#So it\u2019s important that the American voter, who uses the Times, the Post, and the evening news shows as their main outlets for news, understands how they can frame the news such that they essentially become shills for the Democratic Party\u2019s policies and attack lines. \u00a0\n\nFour broad examples of this pattern:\n\nGetting presidents elected\n\nIt\u2019s easy to cherry-pick the mainstream media\u2019s reporting and opinions and claim media bias. (Certainly, that is what critics of this piece will claim I\u2019ve done.) It\u2019s a favorite pastime of conservatives, and sometimes we can overstate individual circumstances.\n\nTherefore, I\u2019d like to start off with some empirical data showing widespread bias for Democrats in election coverage. Let\u2019s start with the 2012 presidential race.\n\nBack then, liberals cheered the results of a study showing that Obama received more negative coverage than 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney during the Republican party\u2019s primary season. But it doesn\u2019t make much sense to compare a sitting president to a front-runner nominee\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Journalism Project, in a period from late August to late October, during the general election, both Obama and Romney faced periods of intense imbalance when it came to positive vs. negative news coverage. But while Obama\u2019s worst period showed less than a 3:1 imbalance of negative to positive coverage, Romney\u2019s worst period showed a 4:1 ratio.\n\nLikewise, coverage of Obama was 22 percent positive and 27 percent negative during his most favorable period. Romney\u2019s best time period was still negative: 20 percent positive coverage to 30 percent negative.\n\nAnd this imbalance isn\u2019t confined to the 2012 election. After the 2008 election, the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affiars (CMPA) found the following:\n\n\nCMPA analyzed every soundbite by reporters and nonpartisan sources (excluding representative of the political parties) that evaluated the candidates and their policies. On the three broadcast networks combined, evaluations of Obama were 68% positive and 32% negative, compared to the only 36% positive and 64% negative evaluations of his GOP opponent John McCain.\n\nIn fact, Obama received the most favorable coverage CMPA has ever recorded for any presidential candidate since we began tracking election news coverage in 1988.\n\n\nEven the reporting portion of Fox News\u2019s primetime Special Report, which was relentlessly negative on\u00a0Senator Obama in 2008, was more even-handed than the mainstream networks. From CMPA\u2019s analysis:\n\n\nMeanwhile, Fox\u2019s Special Report was dramatically tougher on Obama, with only 36% favorable vs. 64% unfavorable evaluations during the same time period. But McCain didn\u2019t fare much better, garnering only 40% favorable comments vs. 60% negative ones. So the broadcast networks gave good marks to one candidate and bad marks to another, while Fox was tough on both\u2013and most balanced overall.\n\n\nAnd remember: The mainstream evening news garners millions of more viewers than Special Report.\n\nIn 2004, CMPA also found a distinct bias. It examined the three mainstream evening news shows, Special Report, and Time and Newsweek, from June 2 to September 1 of that year. While then-senator John Kerry got a two-to-one positive coverage differential, they found\u00a0\u201cevaluations of George W. Bush were over 60 percent negative.\u201d\n\nAlso, they report, \u201camong non-partisan sources, Kerry\u2019s evaluations were almost three-to-one positive; Bush\u2019s were over two-to-one negative.\u201d\n\n#page#So, overall, the mainstream media has been incredibly biased toward\u00a0Democrats for the last three presidential election cycles. But even that big-picture analysis can miss the egregious nature and damage of individual attacks.\n\nAs the 2012 presidential campaign picked up speed, PolitiFact often acted as a de facto member of the Obama campaign: For instance, it failed to correctly assess a claim by Obama and a campaign surrogate about alleged cuts to federal education funding. The fact-checking site actually made the error twice \u2014 once when grading Obama, and once when grading the surrogate.\n\n#ad#And, of course, who can forget that the Washington Post somehow unearthed an unsourced story about Romney\u2019s allegedly bullying a classmate in high school \u2014 five decades before the 2012 elections?\n\nThe \u201cWar on Women\u201d\n\nThis was a particularly effective Democratic attack line that began in the 2012 elections. It may have been in large part responsible for Democratic wins in Indiana and Missouri Senate races and ginned up a great deal of cultural-liberal enthusiasm for President Obama\u2019s reelection victory. It even helped boost Terry McAuliffe to victory over Ken Cuccinelli in the 2013 Virginia governor\u2019s race.\n\nDemocrats had plenty of help on this front\u00a0from the mainstream media. In January of 2012, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News asked Republican primary candidates if they would ban contraception \u2014 which wasn\u2019t a public-policy issue until the Obama administration put forth its unconstitutional mandate less than two weeks later, and was never a public-policy proposal any prominent Republican, let alone one of the candidates, had considered.\n\nAnd, of course, who can forget how mainstream-media outlets somehow found Richard Mourdock\u2019s clumsy but morally sensible comments about pregnancies resulting from rape worth a firestorm of attention?
