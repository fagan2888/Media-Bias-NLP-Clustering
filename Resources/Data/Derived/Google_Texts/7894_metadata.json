Ted Cruz (R-TX), a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, accused GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump of supporting the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill pushed through the U.S. Senate in 2013 by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).\n\nDespite Cruz\u2019s claim, several interviews and stories Trump did with Breitbart News at the time show he was fighting the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill and called it a \u201cdeath wish\u201d for the GOP.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nListing various instances of battles against the permanent political class\u2014calling each a different \u201ctime for choosing\u201d\u2014Cruz noted that one was the \u201cbattle over amnesty.\u201d Cruz said:\n\nWe had in 2013, as well, an epic, knockdown drag-out battle on amnesty. President Obama and Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid and the Democrats joined up with establishment Republicans to try to pass a massive amnesty. The bill didn\u2019t secure our borders, the bill expanded President Obama\u2019s ability to bring in Syrian refugees without mandating background checks, and the bill would have granted amnesty to 12 million people here illegally. For everyone in this country, that was a time for choosing. On which side do you stand? There are individuals on that stage that answered that question and said, \u2018I stand with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama and I stand against the American [worker].\u2019 I can tell you I was proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Iowa\u2019s own Steve King and Jeff Sessions fighting to stop amnesty and secure the border and to keep this country safe.\n\nCruz continued by noting that the \u201cleader\u201d of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d was \u201cmy friend Marco Rubio.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, charming, but when he ran for Senate, he promised the people of Florida that \u2018I will lead the fight against amnesty,\u2019\u201d Cruz said of Rubio. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told voters. Then he came to Washington and immediately joined with Chuck Schumer in offering the Rubio-Schumer amnesty.\u201d\n\nCruz continued by imploring voters to hold him accountable to his word, and noting correctly that he\u2019s kept his promise to Texans to fight against amnesty. Everything up until that point was accurate on the amnesty point. But then Cruz claimed Trump backed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill. Cruz said, referring to Trump:\n\nI would note as well there\u2019s another candidate in this race who talks quite a bit about immigration\u2014and everything else. Well, in 2013, the battle was being fought. If it is in fact the case that Mr. Trump opposes amnesty, one might ask where was he during that battle? I can tell you where he was: He was publicly at the time supporting amnesty, Tweeting out support for the \u2018Gang of Eight.\u2019 He was publicly at the time supporting Marco Rubio\u2019s DREAMer legislation. He was publicly at the time criticizing Mitt Romney for being too tough on illegal immigration. Now, when it comes to amnesty, even today\u2014listen, I like Donald Trump\u2014he may say unpleasant things about me, and I have no intention of responding in kind. I do not intend to insult him.\n\nThe crowd went wild.\n\n\u201cAnd I respect the men and women here, the men and women of Iowa, too much\u2014I don\u2019t think you want or deserve to see politicians engaging in name-calling and insults,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut I do think substance matters. I think record matters. I think issues matter.\u201d\n\nDuring the timeframe the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill was moving through the committee process in the U.S. Senate, however\u2014and before it was even introduced\u2014in a series of interviews and stories with Breitbart News, Trump was very publicly opposed to the amnesty bill, fighting it from outside the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn one such interview, published on June 3, 2013, Trump called the bill a \u201cdeath wish\u201d for the GOP.\n\n\u201cI think you have a country, or you don\u2019t have a country,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News in that interview. \u201cIf you have a country, you have borders. And you either live with the fact that you have borders, or you don\u2019t. Congress is going at jet speed to try and get something passed, and the Republicans better be careful, because anything that\u2019s passed, as they [illegal immigrants] become voting citizens, they will only vote for Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you have 11 million people right now in this country illegally, as they start to vote they will be voting for the Democrats,\u201d Trump added in that June 3, 2013, interview. \u201cThey will not be voting for the Republicans. The Republicans better be careful of their own death wish.\u201d\n\nIn a previous story regarding his 2013 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland\u2014months before Rubio and Schumer even introduced their bill\u2014a Trump spokesman told Breitbart News that he was opposed to the forthcoming amnesty bill.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is very worried that the Republican Party has learned the wrong lessons from the 2012 defeat,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesman told Breitbart News at the time. \u201cHe felt it was important to stress to the party leaders and faithful that immigration and entitlement reform should not be a top priority. If the Republicans are going to be successful, they must focus on the economy, jobs, OPEC, reining in China and our debt crisis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz Claims Donald Trump Supported Marco Rubio\u2019s \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 Amnesty Bill", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz Claims Donald Trump Supported Marco Rubio\u2019s \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 Amnesty Bill", "title": "Ted Cruz Claims Donald Trump Supported Marco Rubio\u2019s \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 Amnesty Bill - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/ap_ted-cruz_ap-photo8-wi.jpg", "height": 853}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/23/ted-cruz-claims-donald-trump-supported-marco-rubios-gang-of-eight-amnesty-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz Claims Donald Trump Supported Marco Rubio\u2019s \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 Amnesty Bill", "title": "Ted Cruz Claims Donald Trump Supported Marco Rubio\u2019s \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 Amnesty Bill - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/ap_ted-cruz_ap-photo8-wi.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Amnesty, border security, Donald Trump, Gang of Eight bill, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,amnesty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-01-23T18:32:01-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think you have a country, or you don\u2019t have a country,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News in that interview.\nBut then Cruz claimed Trump backed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill.\nTrump is very worried that the Republican Party has learned the wrong lessons from the 2012 defeat,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesman told Breitbart News at the time.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERANKENY, Iowa \u2014 Sen.
