As witnessed by the current shutdown of the U.S. government, enacted by a political party hellbent on sabotaging a major health care law that has already been passed and placed into action, the ultra-conservative faction of our legislative body has desperately thrown every wrench and roadblock possible into the ACA implementation, to no avail.\n\nWhat has resulted is a public divided on truth and benefit, with a great deal of confusion over not only the ACA but the accountability and motives of our entire political system.\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie guitarist Chris Walla explained to POLITICO why he\u2019s gotten involved.\n\n\u201cThe effort to derail, defund and discredit the ACA (\u2018ObamaCare\u2019) is ridiculous and insulting. The law serves to help all Americans more easily access affordable, reliable health insurance, even those who were previously shut out of private insurance because of a pre-existing condition. These objective basics of the law are rarely front-page news. Healthcare.gov does a great job of detailing out the most important features.\u201d\n\nWalla has rightfully accused ACA critics as misrepresenting the law and misleading the public.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a communication problem so much as I see an upsetting misinformation campaign by the law\u2019s opponents,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law is a monumental step forward from where we were. Two of the changes already in effect as a result of the ACA\u2019s passage are tangible and real: children can stay on their parents\u2019 plans until they\u2019re 26, and no one can be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. That\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nAddressing the frustrations of Republicans whose obstructions and political hostage-taking have failed, Walla continued:\n\n\u201cAs for the Republican efforts to defeat this law, I\u2019d like to recommend any of the time-tested, American-as-apple-pie methods of repealing a law,\u201d Walla said. \u201cThere are many. Like, say, winning an election and repealing a law through legislation which can be enacted by the executive branch. I can also recommend the judicial branch as a place to sort through grievances and contests of law. Our three branches of government provide ample checks and balances, in a sound framework, for any party wishing to engage them.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIn short, I have no problem with anyone who dislikes just about any law on the books. And while I can\u2019t fathom why the ACA is a law that anyone would stake their reputation on trying to defeat, I certainly support the GOP\u2019s right to their pet rock. (Don\u2019t get mad, I totally have pet rocks too.) But the GOP\u2019s willingness to shut down the government and threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America \u2014 on purpose! \u2014 over a law that helps Americans have access to quality, affordable health care? That effort is immoral, unpatriotic, cruel, and blisteringly stupid.\u201d\n\nWalla is right. Rather than join the tide of the misinformed, the kneejerk Facebook chorus, it is vital to inform ourselves about not only one of the most pressing social issues of our time, but also on the staggering dysfunction and ineptitude on display by elected representatives in Washington D.C. who do not, in any conceivable way, represent the will or well-being of the American public.\n\nIf words like \"hope\" and \"change\" are to ever be anything more than cheap campaign buzzwords, if the word \"freedom\" can ever be rid of its nauseating stench of hypocrisy and political manipulation, if we're to reclaim any sense of domestic stability and promise for the future of this nation, it's absolutely crucial that we inform ourselves on what's happening in America today. It's of utmost importance that we demand our voices be represented once more, rather than silenced by political puppets, saboteurs of the diminishing middle class, strictly serving the lobbying interests of corporations and conservative extremists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several artists are joining the fight against the campaign of misinformation about the Affordable Health Care Act (aka Obamacare).", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"description": "Several artists are joining the fight against the campaign of misinformation about the Affordable Health Care Act (aka Obamacare).", "creator": "@JohnnyFirecloud", "image": "http://cdn1-www.craveonline.com/assets/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-08-at-3.59.48-PM-1.png", "title": "Pearl Jam, Death Cab Partner With HeadCount To Raise Obamacare Awareness", "site": "@craveonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "CraveOnline", "description": "Several artists are joining the fight against the campaign of misinformation about the Affordable Health Care Act (aka Obamacare).", "title": "Pearl Jam, Death Cab Partner With HeadCount To Raise Obamacare Awareness", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://cdn1-www.craveonline.com/assets/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-08-at-3.59.48-PM-1.png", "height": 395}, "updated_time": "2013-10-16T06:39:01-07:00", "url": "http://www.craveonline.com/music/588647-pearl-jam-death-cab-partner-with-headcount-to-raise-obamacare-awareness", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "63c0468f119bfd20fb875772b70663de"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000399936875}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CraveOnline", "published_time": "2013-10-16T06:34:06-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com", "section": "Music", "modified_time": "2013-10-16T06:39:01-07:00", "tag": "Pearl Jam"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie, Jason Mraz, My Morning Jacket and more are teaming up with voter registration group HeadCount to raise awareness among young voters about health insurance and encourage them to look into the Affordable Health Care Act (aka \"Obamacare\"), according to POLITICO.\n\u2014 over a law that helps Americans have access to quality, affordable health care?\nDeath Cab for Cutie guitarist Chris Walla explained to POLITICO why he\u2019s gotten involved.\nThe law serves to help all Americans more easily access affordable, reliable health insurance, even those who were previously shut out of private insurance because of a pre-existing condition.\n\u201cThe effort to derail, defund and discredit the ACA (\u2018ObamaCare\u2019) is ridiculous and insulting."}
