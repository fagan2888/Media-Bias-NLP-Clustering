Schaefer won the 19th senatorial district by about 1,500 votes in an election with more than 90,000 ballots cast.\n\nFour years later, Democrats were confident that the seat could be recaptured. They dispatched Mary Still, a state representative at the time whose resume included work for a Democratic governor and Attorney General. Schaefer, a bespectacled litigator with a piercing voice and sober disposition, seemed like an easy target.\n\nBut Schaefer\u2019s work ethic and generous contributions, along with a well-staffed campaign, allowed him to cruise to an easy victory. Out of 81,000 votes cast, Schaefer won by a breezy 13,000.\n\nBy the time his re-election came in 2012, Schaefer had ascended to Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, a slot that comes with plenty of big money donors and more than a little legislative clout.\n\nSchaefer\u2019s background as a litigator is dizzying in length. In about two decades, Schaefer served as Assistant Missouri Attorney General, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney, General Counsel and Deputy Director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Special Counsel to the Governor and Special Counsel to the Missouri Department of Agriculture. Currently, he\u2019s a partner at Lathrope and Gage in Columbia.\n\nWith a resume like that, it wasn\u2019t long before his colleagues assumed Schaefer would consider a bid for attorney general in 2016.\n\nRobert Knodell, a partner at Barklage & Knodell, said Schaefer\u2019s back-to-back wins in presidential years in Boone county speak directly to his electability.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I think about is that he\u2019s a proven winner,\u201d Knodell said. \u201cHe\u2019s won that district, which was very competitive, and he won it in presidential years. People forget that in 2008 he won and it was on the heels of Obama\u2019s visit to Columbia. But he still won.\u201d\n\nAs a senator, Schaefer seemed to revel in playing the part of thorn in the side of Gov. Jay Nixon. In 2013, Schaefer spearheaded an investigation into Nixon\u2019s Department of Revenue for releasing information on CCW permits to the federal government without appropriate authorization.\n\nIn an odd moment of symmetry, Schaefer became the first state lawmaker since Nixon himself in 1991 to subpoena witnesses to appear before a special committee. Schaefer\u2019s role as a permanent pain for Nixon grew in recent days.\n\nLast Friday, Nixon announced he\u2019d be calling a special session for lawmakers to appropriate more funds to pay the bills for the National Guard actions in Ferguson. Three days later, Schaefer sent out an email to his colleagues which he made available to Nixon in which he laid out the case that, in fact, there was no need for such a session, and there were more than enough funds available.\n\nHours later, Nixon sent out a release \u201cagreeing with an alternative interpretation of current appropriation authority offered by legislative leadership.\u201d Schaefer had won the day.\n\n\u201cBeing a former prosecutor, I\u2019ve always had a focus on law enforcement,\u201d Schaefer said of his legislative work. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve also been as open as I can be with my colleagues about my desires or my intentions about the future.\u201d\n\nSchaefer plans on leaning heavily on his experience to win over Missouri voters. He wastes no time in reminding people that he\u2019s brief and argued appeals cases about 100 times, he\u2019s argued before the Supreme Court, and worked in the AG\u2019s office previously.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single job in [the AG\u2019s office] that I couldn\u2019t walk in and do myself as a litigator for 20 years,\u201d Schaefer said.\n\nKnodell said that Schaefer\u2019s resume was hard to beat for members of either party, and that his deep background as a litigator could win him the day in a general election.\n\n\u201cI think in Attorney General races around the country we\u2019re seeing people want an Attorney General who is conservative and will stand up to the overreach in the federal government.\n\nMost were expecting Schaefer to collide with former House Speaker Tim Jones, who dropped strong hints he was eyeing his own bid for AG. Jones, widely considered a formidable Republican primary candidate, announced rather suddenly just weeks ago that he would not be seeking any statewide office in 2016.Jones\u2019 exit from the race all but clears the field for Schaefer, whose time as a senator is increasingly looking like an audition for the state\u2019s top attorney job. After hammering Nixon on the unauthorized CCW release, Schaefer wasted no time attacking the EPA for what he calls \u201cobvious overreach,\u201d before slamming the Democratic governor for his \u201cillegal\u201d budget withholds.\n\nFrom his powerful post in Appropriations, Schaefer has made it clear he has no desire to entertain a bill expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Schaefer\u2019s resistance is absolute, despite the fact that his own vice chair, Sen. Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City, is a supporter of expansion.\n\n\u201c[Medicaid expansion] is substantially less likely since even last year,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cThe unifying message from [the election] was that we need to find another way to address healthcare in the U.S. because obviously Obamacare isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s a quagmire that needs to be addressed, and we hopefully have senators and congresspeople smart enough to address those issues and not simply make a mass expansion of welfare.\u201d\n\nWith more than $1 million in the bank, a powerful Appropriations chairmanship and one of the state\u2019s deepest resumes as a litigator, Schaefer\u2019s run for attorney general is more and more likely going to face it\u2019s most significant speed bump in the general election, not the primary.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done everything you could realistically expect him to do to clear the field,\u201d said Rep. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia. \u201cHe\u2019s a very hard working guy and that\u2019s something people pick up on quickly, and with the funds he\u2019s been able to put together, he\u2019s done a very good job.\u201d\n\nThe only Democrat who has already declared his AG intentions is Sen. Scott Sifton, a colleague of Schaefer\u2019s in the Senate. Sifton is not without experience, he\u2019s an attorney in St. Louis with the powerhouse Husch Blackwell law firm. While Sifton and Schaefer are not immediately prone to the ugliness voters have come to expect from a statewide campaign, neither man is unwilling to throw mud if it becomes necessary.\n\nSchaefer, on the heels of his public schooling of Nixon on budget rules, will now stride into January a leading candidate for one of the state\u2019s most powerful posts and a growing bank account. In six years, Schaefer has gone from long shot to frontrunner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "COLUMBIA, Mo. \u2014 If you\u2019d told the state\u2019s leading Republican thinkers just six years ago that a Columbia-area Republican senator was their best chance of seizing the Attorney General\u2019s office, you probably would have been laughed out of the room.
