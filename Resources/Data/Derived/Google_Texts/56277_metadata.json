Either way, the policy is nonsense\u2014a university may not prevent students from posting unkind remarks on social media.\n\nAnd who wrote this censorious, ungrammatical, brazenly unconstitutional speech code? You guessed it: the law students. Specifically, the officers of MU\u2019s Student Bar Association, which comprises \u201cevery member of the law school\u2019s student body,\u201d according to its website.\n\nAbove the Law\u2019s Elie Mystal exposed the new social media policy in a recent article:\n\nIt is easily the worst social media policy I have ever seen. It is probably the worst social media policy you have seen. It is so bad that a University of Missouri student could get in trouble for going on Facebook and talking about how bad the policy is. I\u2019m afraid to actually quote directly from the policy, lest somebody send it to Kim Jong-un to give him new ideas on how to crush the freedom of his people. But the policy is so disgustingly anti-intellectual and anti-expression that it\u2019s worth the risk.\n\nThis isn\u2019t hyperbole; the policy really is that bad:\n\nBefore you post content to any social-media outlet affiliated, or reasonably possible to be associated with; yourself, the School of Law, the student organizations here at the school, the Missouri Bar Association, the American Bar Association, or any other legal association, and the University of Missouri, please take a moment to review our official guidelines. If you are a member of the University of Missouri School of Law - Student Bar Association (i.e. a person enrolled in classes at the University of Missouri School of Law), then these rules apply to you.\n\nThese rules\u2014rules that all law students are supposedly obligated to follow\u2014are farcically censorious. They instruct students to re-read their comments before they post them to screen for any content that could be construed as \u201cnegative or inappropriate.\u201d Disagreements should only be addressed in a \u201cprofessional and respectful manner.\u201d Transparency is required, but students must also be careful not to be so transparent that they violate anyone\u2019s privacy. The rules not only restrict speech\u2014they also compel it; \u201cEngage in conversation,\u201d the policy blithely commands.\n\nSuch a policy is unenforceable on sheer practicality grounds (not to mention First Amendment grounds), and yet the officers of SBA not only expect students to obey\u2014they expect students to inform on other students who violate the policy:\n\nIt is the duty of each member of the SBA to report instances of possible non-compliance with this policy to the Vice-President of the SBA-all reports will be kept anonymous and in confidence.\n\nKeep in mind that the SBA wrongly believes its power to regulate speech includes students posting on \u201cany social-media affiliated outlet, or reasonably possible to be associated with; yourself.\u201d To the extent this declaration makes any sense, I understand it to include personal Facebook pages.\n\nSince I am not a Missouri law student, I presume no one is attempting to deny my right to make despairing\u2014er, disparaging\u2014remarks about the policy. To that end, I tweeted at the SBA for clarification on its social media policy; this post will be updated if I receive a response.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "University of Missouri School of Law students told to self-censor on social media.", "title": "Law Students Wrote This Unconstitutional, Ungrammatical Speech Code: \u2018Do Not Comment Despairingly on Others\u2019", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/05/law-students-wrote-this-unconstitutional", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14467627192349.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "University of Missouri School of Law students told to self-censor on social media.", "title": "Law Students Wrote This Unconstitutional, Ungrammatical Speech Code: \u2018Do Not Comment Despairingly on Others\u2019", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14467627192349.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-11-05T22:50:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Above the Law\u2019s Elie Mystal exposed the new social media policy in a recent article:It is easily the worst social media policy I have ever seen.\nYou guessed it: the law students.\nThese rules\u2014rules that all law students are supposedly obligated to follow\u2014are farcically censorious.\nTo that end, I tweeted at the SBA for clarification on its social media policy; this post will be updated if I receive a response.\nIt is probably the worst social media policy you have seen."}
