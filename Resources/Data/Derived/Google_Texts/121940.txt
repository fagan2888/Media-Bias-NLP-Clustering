'Affordable' Health Care's pricey pitfalls

I would like to thank everyone who worked so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act. Recently my wife had a hysterectomy and the hospital charges were $7,550, of which our fabulous ACA-required health insurance plan covered a whopping $1,414 — yes, less than 20 percent the cost.

Our out-of-pocket deductible and co-pay was $6,136 and this is in addition to paying nearly $800 per month in premiums for a family bronze plan. Note that these figures don't include the pathology costs and the bill from the doctor.

My family was perfectly happy with the health insurance plan we had prior to all of the changes that were forced upon us.

We were promised we could keep our health insurance plan if we liked it and told that the average family would save about $2,500 per year.

I can tell you from experience (and we're certainly not the only Americans dealing with this) we were not allowed to keep the health insurance plan we liked and our monthly premiums have nearly doubled over the past two years while our out-of-pocket deductibles and co-pays have also increased significantly.

I'm sorry, the “Affordable” Care Act is anything but more affordable for the vast majority of Americans.
