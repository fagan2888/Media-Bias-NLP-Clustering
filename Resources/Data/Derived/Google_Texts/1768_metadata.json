Candidates made statement after statement that represented distortion, mistruths, and outright lies. Here are 11 whoppers:\n\n1. Insisting That Hispanics Used to Love Republicans: Lindsey Graham scolded the other three candidates in his debate, telling them that Hispanics voted for \u201cus\u201d under previous Republican president George W. Bush. Although it\u2019s true that frontrunner Donald Trump has depleted much of what was left of Hispanic support for the GOP, even under Bush, that wasn\u2019t a vote they won. At the high point in 2004, Bush won 44 percent of that vote, and Romney won only 27 percent.\n\n2. Ridiculously Saying That Iran Threatens The Whole Western World: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee wanted the audience to know that Iran threatens the \u201cessence of Western civilization.\u201d Except Iran\u2019s defense budget is around $10 billion, a fractionof our own $600 plus billion defense budget. How a country with no weapons of mass destruction and a tiny defense budget can be threatening the United States, let alone our NATO allies, was not explained by Huckabee. Probably because it makes no sense.\n\n3. Implying the U.S. Government Funds Abortion: Over and over, the assertion was made that the United States federal government finances abortions, such as by giving subsidies to Planned Parenthood. While you can make a convoluted argument that money is indirectly spread around, the fact is the the federal government has followed a blanket ban on such funding except in cases of rape, incest, or when it threatens the health of the mother.\n\n4. Claiming Obama Is Trying to Circumvent the Process to Let In Syrian Refugees: Bobby Jindal said that Obama was trying to \u201cshort-circuit the vetting process\u201d to let in Syrian refugees, a dangerous dog whistle to imply that the president was going to let in terrorists. As CNN\u2019s own fact-check pointed out, the 10,000 refugees \u2013 truly a paltry amount \u2013 are slated to come in through the exact same process as any other refugees.\n\n5. Saying We Are Almost the Only Ones With Birthright Citizenship:Trump said almost no one else \u2013 including Mexico \u2013 has birthright citizenship, and moderator Jake Tapper agreed with him. That\u2019s true, if you think the entire rest of the world consists of Europe. Almost everywhere in the Americas has birthright citizenship and that includes Mexico.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb's whopper about his brother's legacy made headlines, but the party's deceit extended well beyond just him", "author": "Zaid Jilani", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jeb's whopper about his brother's legacy made headlines, but the party's deceit extended well beyond just him", "title": "11 distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies from the GOP debates", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/18/11_distortions_misrepresentations_and_outright_lies_from_the_gop_debates_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/carly_fiorina3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb's whopper about his brother's legacy made headlines, but the party's deceit extended well beyond just him", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/carly_fiorina3.jpg", "title": "11 distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies from the GOP debates", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "11 distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies from the GOP debates", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At the high point in 2004, Bush won 44 percent of that vote, and Romney won only 27 percent.\nBoth debates offered a window into an entirely different world, completely unrelated to the world we actually live in.\nCandidates made statement after statement that represented distortion, mistruths, and outright lies.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that frontrunner Donald Trump has depleted much of what was left of Hispanic support for the GOP, even under Bush, that wasn\u2019t a vote they won.\nThat\u2019s true, if you think the entire rest of the world consists of Europe."}
