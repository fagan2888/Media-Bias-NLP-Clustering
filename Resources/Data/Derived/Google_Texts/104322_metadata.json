But a new expose\u2019 video catches a Planned Parenthood staffer engaging in her own war on women.\n\nThe pro-life group Live Action released the third installment today in its \u201cSexEd\u201d investigative series, showing a Planned Parenthood staffer in Portland, Oregon offering disturbing sex counseling to someone she thinks is a fifteen-year-old girl. The video clearly shows the counselor encouraging the young girl to allow herself to be victimized in violent sexual encounters with her partner.\n\nThe staffer tells the investigator that \u201cit\u2019s very common to experiment with different things,\u201d including \u201cbeing tied up\u201d and \u201cwhipped\u201d and \u201cthe baby thing, where they will put on diapers[.]\u201d\n\nSome girls like being \u201cspanked,\u201d \u201chit,\u201d or \u201cwhipped,\u201d said the counselor.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood staffer also encourages the 15-year-old girl to obtain pornography.\n\nThe Portland counselor tells Live Action\u2019s investigator that there are \u201ceducational pornos out there\u201d and recommends \u201cfemale-oriented porn.\u201d Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette continues to operate facilities in six locations in Oregon, including three others in Portland and one in the capital city of Salem.\n\nLive Action\u2019s president, Lila Rose, commented that \u201cno one can justify a counselor telling a fifteen-year-old girl that \u2018some people like being spanked, or whipped, or hit.\u2019 This is not sex education, but rather a disturbing and dangerous ideology consciously being pushed on our nation\u2019s youth.\u201d\n\nRose is particularly disturbed that Planned Parenthood clinics are receiving taxpayer dollars and dispensing such advice to young girls.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is poised to receive significant additional funding through ObamaCare, including via PREP (the Personal Responsibility Education Program), a $75-million sex education program funded by taxpayers through the Department of Health and Human Services. Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette, the affiliate that runs the facility in Live Action\u2019s latest video, has itself been allocated grants through PREP.\n\nAdditionally, Planned Parenthood nationally receives over $500 million annually in taxpayer funds, plus more to be an ObamaCare \u201cnavigator.\u201d\n\nThe Portland video is the third in a series. Previous SexEd installments showed Planned Parenthood locations in Indianapolis and Denver offering similarly disturbing advice to investigators posing as minor girls. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, under whose jurisdiction the Denver facilities lie, is now being sued for sending a 13-year-old abuse victim back to her abuser after aborting her baby.\n\n\u201cAs our videos show,\u201d Rose said, \u201cand as more videos will continue to show, Portland is not an outlier. You\u2019ll see the exact same institutional ethos of promoting destructive sexual activity in every other city and state where Planned Parenthood operates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a bipartisan issue,\u201d Rose commented. \u201cPolitical ideology shouldn\u2019t affect parents\u2019 desire to protect their children. Whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative, or even pro-life or pro-abortion, tax-funded \u2018counseling\u2019 sessions directing kids to porn sites and sex shops, and teaching them how to beat and choke each other, are completely unacceptable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Counselor Caught Telling Teen to Let Her Boyfriend Beat Her", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Abortion activists claim pro-lifers are engaging in a \"war on women:\" by passing legislation to protect women and unborn children from abortion.
