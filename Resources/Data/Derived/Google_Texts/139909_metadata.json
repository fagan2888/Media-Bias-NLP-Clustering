It was Sarah Myers, Ally Welch and a loaded South Forsyth team; Caroline Bowns, Lochlain Corliss, Avery Scarbrough at North Forsyth, and Maddie O\u2019Connor and Jenna Staiti at West Forsyth.\n\nKidwell wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way.\n\n\"You don\u2019t want to play against girls who aren\u2019t as good as you,\" she said. \"It\u2019ll make you look good but won\u2019t help at all with your game. Playing against girls like that taught me what it takes to compete against them.\"\n\nThe Lady Longhorns finished 6-19 last season under Tony Watkins, who departed for Grayson High School. Jaime Fisher, a former head coach at South Gwinnett and an assistant under Watkins in his only season at Lambert, takes over a team that returns all five starters in Kidwell, Leah Cote, Ashley Johnson, Corrie Baker and Caroline Wilson.\n\nFisher, an Honorable Mention All-ACC selection during her playing career at Georgia Tech, has been imploring her young team to give the same effort in practice as they would in a game. If the Lady Longhorns can limit the effectiveness of opponents\u2019 top scorers and control tempo, they\u2019ll be more competitive, Kidwell said.\n\nIn other words, Lambert is still learning how to win, and that\u2019s to be expected. Wilson is the only senior among that group of returnees.\n\n\"I learned [last year] that it\u2019s not easy,\" Kidwell said. \"It may not come tomorrow or the next day but you have to keep pushing.\"\n\nSouth showed the Lady Longhorns there\u2019s still plenty of work to be done: the Lady War Eagles jumped out to a 14-point halftime lead and doubled their lead after three quarters in a 62-37 win on Nov. 21. North visited Lambert on Tuesday night; that game finished too late for this edition.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of familiarity among girls in Forsyth County from the AAU circuit. Kidwell, Cote, South\u2019s Emily Dreslinski and West\u2019s Abby Quincy know one another from the Celtics.\n\n\"It\u2019s really competitive in the county,\" Kidwell said. \"Off the court, we\u2019re best friends. As soon as you step on the court, you try to not think of them as your friends, but it\u2019s still fun to get to play against them.\"\n\nKidwell said she spent the offseason working on her shot to make it more consistent, though she admits scoring isn\u2019t the biggest part of her game.\n\n\"I may not be the most skilled out of anybody,\" she said. \"I\u2019m always trying to work the hardest, be a team player, always looking for the open pass. Personal gain isn\u2019t as important to me as the team doing well.\"\n\nTo that end, the Lady Longhorns are hoping to enjoy a few more celebratory locker rooms in 2014 and into 2015.\n\n\"I definitely want to win more than we did last year,\" she said. \"With the girls we have this year and how competitive it\u2019s gotten [among ourselves], I think we can do that.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/26257/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2014/12/02/Grind_Kara_4_120314_web.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For most freshmen, starting from day one on varsity\u2014in one of the state\u2019s toughest girls basketball regions, no less\u2014would\u2019ve been overwhelming.", "title": "THE GRIND: Lambert's Kidwell had early hoops education"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "THE GRIND: Lambert's Kidwell had early hoops education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd43\"", "article_summary": "To that end, the Lady Longhorns are hoping to enjoy a few more celebratory locker rooms in 2014 and into 2015.\nIf the Lady Longhorns can limit the effectiveness of opponents\u2019 top scorers and control tempo, they\u2019ll be more competitive, Kidwell said.\nThe Lady Longhorns finished 6-19 last season under Tony Watkins, who departed for Grayson High School.\n\"I think it helped take some of the nerves off that came with playing against older girls.\"\nGirls are stronger, faster, more skilled, and Lambert\u2019s Kara Kidwell knew that would be the case."}
