It was one of two states \u2014 New Mexico is the other \u2014 that had to wait a year for its own site, and exchange officials say the delay has been a plus as they meet with other states to discuss what went right or wrong during Obamacare\u2019s first round.\n\nSEE ALSO: For Obamacare 2.0, more states look to browsing\n\n\u201cHindsight is 20-20, so we have the advantage or going through the open enrollment period and taking lessons from their successes and failures,\u201d said Jody Olson, communications director for Your Health Idaho.\n\nIdaho\u2019s situation is anomalous in certain respects. Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter and other Republicans in Boise dislike Obamacare, yet many of them said they should take the reins of its new marketplace instead of relying on the federal government.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, we felt like we could do it better,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Dean Cameron, an insurance agent.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats privately calling Obama \u2018incompetent,\u2019 \u2018detached\u2019\n\nThe state-based exchanges are a key pillar of the Affordable Care Act that allow qualified consumers to select and purchase private plans online, often with the help of government subsidies. The District of Columbia and 16 states opted to set up their own exchanges, while 27 relied on the federal government\u2019s marketplace and seven set up a federal-state partnership.\n\nBut only 15 of the 17 state-run web portals went live in October, because of the delays in Idaho and New Mexico. The federal website\u2019s early stumbles did not help either state, but matters could have been much worse. Several state-run exchanges that were supposedly ready for enrollment faced problems long after a \u201ctech surge\u201d patched the federal system.\n\nOregon became the first state to abandon its own exchange, after an ugly rollout that has prompted an FBI investigation into whether the exchange misrepresented its progress to federal officials. This month, Nevada decided to drop its tech contractor and rely on HealthCare.gov for the 2015 plan year.\n\nThose stumbles haven\u2019t rippled into Idaho, where officials said they are working diligently to make sure their portal is up by November.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re on really solid ground,\u201d Mr. Cameron said.\n\nIdaho\u2019s Republican senators in Washington say it is up to state officials to decide if the state-run website is worth it.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need me telling them what to do,\u201d said Sen. James Risch, a former governor. \u201cThis is their decision and I\u2019m not going to state my preference. I\u2019m not going to get involved.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, Mr. Otter objected to the president\u2019s reforms. But after the Supreme Court upheld it and President Obama won re-election, \u201cthe governor believed that it would be far wiser to have people in and from Idaho working on the exchange than to walk away from the table and just let the federal government make decisions that affect the lives of our citizens,\u201d Otter spokesman Jon Hanian said.\n\nAbout 76,000 people signed up for private health insurance in Idaho during Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment period. Even if 15 percent of people do not pay up and effectuate their coverage, the state still exceeded expectations by 185 percent, according to an Avalere Health analysis.\n\nExchange officials said the results reflect pent-up demand, while others noted Idaho is not the wealthiest state, meaning many consumers qualify for subsidies on the exchange. The state has not opted to expand its Medicaid program under Obamacare, which may be a bridge too far for moderate Republicans who supported the exchange and would face intense primary challenges.\n\n\u201cDespite the pathetic national rollout, we have spent, comparatively speaking, a much smaller amount of money ($11 million) on our exchange and have the third highest enrollment per capita in the nation,\u201d Mr. Hanian said in an email. \u201cCompare that experience to Oregon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials in Idaho say they're undaunted by the well-documented failures of Obamacare exchanges in neighboring states and are moving full-steam ahead with plans to launch their own web portal this November.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Officials in Idaho say they\u2019re undaunted by the well-documented failures of Obamacare exchanges in neighboring states and are moving full-steam ahead with plans to launch their own web portal this November.", "title": "Idaho moving forward with state-run Obamacare exchange", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/26/idaho-moving-forward-with-state-run-obamacare-exch/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/12/13/20121213-210822-pic-933592894.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/12/13/20121213-210822-pic-933592894.jpg", "description": "Officials in Idaho say they're undaunted by the well-documented failures of Obamacare exchanges in neighboring states and are moving full-steam ahead with plans to launch their own web portal this Nov", "card": "summary", "title": "Idaho moving forward with state-run Obamacare exchange"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb458\"", "article_summary": "While executives at Cover Oregon and Nevada Health Link abandon their state-run websites and turn to the federal exchange (HealthCare.gov), Your Health Idaho is headed in the opposite direction.\nExchange officials said the results reflect pent-up demand, while others noted Idaho is not the wealthiest state, meaning many consumers qualify for subsidies on the exchange.\nSeveral state-run exchanges that were supposedly ready for enrollment faced problems long after a \u201ctech surge\u201d patched the federal system.\nIdaho\u2019s Republican senators in Washington say it is up to state officials to decide if the state-run website is worth it.\nOfficials in Idaho say they\u2019re undaunted by the well-documented failures of Obamacare exchanges in neighboring states and are moving full-steam ahead with plans to launch their own web portal this November."}
