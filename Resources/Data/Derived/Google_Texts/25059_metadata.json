It\u2019s WellPoint\u2019s only rival: Maine Community Health Options, a startup that didn\u2019t exist three years ago.\n\nThe newcomer, funded primarily by taxpayer money lent under the U.S. health-care law, has won about 80 percent of the market so far in Maine\u2019s new insurance exchange, exceeding its own expectations, said Kevin Lewis, the chief executive officer.\n\nObamacare opponents predicted early on that insurance co-ops created by the law would fail, and that much of the $2.1 billion they were loaned to get started would be lost. Instead, the 23 co-ops that now exist nationally have enrolled about 300,000 people in health plans by combining low premiums with a certain homespun appeal, according to company executives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing really well,\u201d Lewis said in a telephone interview. Taxpayers face \u201cno risk whatsoever\u201d that Maine Community will go under, he said. \u201cA lot of those early, dire concerns just need to be re-examined.\u201d\n\nKristin Binns, a spokeswoman for Indianapolis, Indiana-based WellPoint, declined to comment on her company\u2019s co-op competition.\n\nThe 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act refers to these new companies as \u201cConsumer Operated and Oriented Plans,\u201d or co-ops. To be sure, not all of the new companies have thrived. Some, such as Maryland\u2019s, have struggled to sign people up because of problems with their state\u2019s exchange while others, including Michigan, have set their premiums too high.\n\nPrice Leaders\n\nThe successful co-ops \u201cemerged as price leaders,\u201d responsible for more than a third of the lowest-premium plans offered on U.S. exchanges, according to an October report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\n\nExecutives from these nonprofit groups in part credit innovative benefit designs for their success, including features that offer free doctors\u2019 visits and generic drugs, and even $100 gift cards for people who get an annual physical. In Wisconsin, many customers of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative appreciate the company\u2019s nonprofit, member-governed business model, CEO Bob DeVita said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long-standing upper Midwest tradition with co-ops,\u201d DeVita said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think there was a lot of pent-up demand for that.\u201d\n\nIn Windsor Heights, Iowa, 35-year-old Geoffrey Wood, the chief operating officer of Startup Genome, said he signed on for the state\u2019s co-op, CoOportunity Health, because he had grown tired of dealing with his previous insurer, Aetna Inc.\u2019s subsidiary Coventry Health Care Inc.\n\n\u2018New Guy\u2019\n\n\u201cGiven the choice between them, as the incumbent company, and an innovative company trying to do something different, I didn\u2019t feel like I had much choice,\u201d Wood said in a telephone interview. \u201cI decided to give the new guy a shot.\u201d\n\nCynthia Michener, an spokeswoman for Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna, said Coventry\u2019s advantages for enrollees include experience with the Iowa health-care system and stability. She declined to discuss Wood\u2019s case without authorization from him.\n\n\u201cCoventry Health Care has served Iowans for more than two decades, and knows the community and its health-care needs well,\u201d Michener said in an e-mail. \u201cWe have long-standing experience of providing health insurance and benefits and helping members access care, and a track record of financial stability to pay claims.\u201d\n\nAbout 4 million Americans have signed up for private health plans using new marketplaces created by the law, the U.S. government says. The Congressional Budget Office projects 6 million will enroll this year, a reduction of 1 million from estimates before the troubled introduction of the law began in October.\n\nSlow Starts\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been a smooth road for some of the co-ops. The computer bugs and errors that prevented many Americans from signing up for coverage in October and November took a toll and, in some states, the startups continue to struggle.\n\nCo-ops in Maryland, Oregon and Massachusetts, for instance, haven\u2019t hit their target enrollments because their state-run exchanges still aren\u2019t functioning well. And Vermont\u2019s co-op dissolved in September, returning its federal solvency loans, after state regulators denied it an insurance license, saying the company\u2019s enrollment expectations were unrealistic and its proposed rates weren\u2019t competitive.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re finding their way to us off the exchange, fortunately,\u201d Dawn Bonder, CEO of Oregon\u2019s Health Republic Insurance, one of two co-ops in the state, said in a phone interview. She estimated the company signed up about 4 percent to 5 percent of customers using Oregon\u2019s exchange, which had enrolled about 33,800 people by February, according to the U.S. government.\n\nOpportunity Ahead\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at 2015 as an opportunity to just do what we hoped to do in 2014 -- but with a lot of experience under our belt,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same time, co-ops in Michigan and Tennessee haven\u2019t grown at the rate of peers because they initially over-priced their plans relative to competitors, spokesmen for the companies said.\n\n\u201c2014 is preparation, really, for \u201915,\u201d said David Eich, a spokesman for Consumers Mutual, the Michigan co-op, in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be really engaged back on the individual market.\u201d He said the company isn\u2019t in danger of going out of business.\n\nAbout 16 percent of the loans are for the co-ops\u2019 startup expenses, such as leasing office space and hiring staff, and must be repaid in five years. The rest is to be saved to meet state regulatory requirements for insurers\u2019 financial reserves, and is due in 15 years.\n\nOpponents Remain\n\nSome Republicans, meanwhile, still contend taxpayers remain at risk of losing much of the money loaned to the companies. At a Feb. 5 hearing on the co-ops, Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma called the program \u201can investment disaster,\u201d and said there remains \u201cthe possibility that American taxpayers will be left on the hook.\u201d\n\nJan VanRiper, the executive director and CEO of the co-ops\u2019 trade group, told lawmakers at the hearing that the premium savings the companies have generated for consumers have \u201calready gone a long way toward paying for loan costs\u201d and that the co-ops are financially viable.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to worry that co-ops will not be paying back their federal government loans on time,\u201d she said, according to prepared testimony. \u201cShould it appear to their lender or their state insurance regulators that they are floundering, either or both entities will intervene well before loan funds are substantially expended.\u201d\n\nAlong with Maine, co-ops have attained large market share in New York, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Kentucky, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Utah, Montana, Nevada and New Mexico, said John Morrison, a board member and founding president of the co-op trade group, and other executives.\n\nNew York\u2019s co-op, Health Republic Insurance of New York, which was founded by the same organization, Freelancers Union, that started Bonder\u2019s company in Oregon, is probably the largest in the country, with more than 50,000 members. It was second in market share to WellPoint\u2019s Empire brand on the state\u2019s exchange as of the end of December, according to data from the exchange, New York State of Health.\n\nPlanned Expansion\n\nFederal authorities have approved plans by the co-ops in Montana, Massachusetts and Kentucky to expand into neighboring states next year -- Idaho, New Hampshire and West Virginia, respectively. The companies have received a total of $113 million for their expansion plans, according to a government budget document published March 4.\n\nFor a handful of co-ops, success has raised a new concern. If they enroll many more customers than they expected, they could run afoul of state regulators who require companies to maintain cash reserves sufficient to cover medical claims in the event they go out of business. All the co-ops received multimillion dollar loans from the government to fund solvency reserves, and the size of each loan was based on projected enrollment.\n\nThe Iowa co-op, CoOportunity, which also serves Nebraska, has signed up about 54,000 members, after projecting it would enroll just 11,800 by the end of March, said Cliff Gold, the chief operations officer.\n\nSolvency Loans\n\n\u201cWe do have concerns about the solvency loans if we continue to grow at this rate,\u201d Gold said. The co-op was signing up as many as 1,000 people a week in February, he said.\n\nThe co-ops have lobbied the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which controls the loans, to make more money available for reserves. Congress capped spending on the co-ops as part of a budget deal in January 2013, leaving $253 million in a \u201ccontingency fund for oversight and assistance\u201d to the firms, according to another budget document published March 4.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s still early, we are encouraged by what we have seen so far, and we will continue to work closely with these co-ops to monitor their progress and assess their performance,\u201d a spokesman for the agency, Aaron Albright, said in an e-mail.\n\nIf the co-ops continue to grow, Obama administration officials have promised to support them, Morrison said. Morrison and co-op executives met with U.S. Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other top administration health officials at the White House on Feb. 6 to brief them on their progress.\n\nThe officials told the companies that \u201cif co-ops continue to perform well in the years ahead, the administration will look to expand the availability of co-ops into the remaining states that don\u2019t currently have them,\u201d Morrison said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-13/obamacare-co-ops-defy-forecasts-to-win-market-share", "title": "Obamacare Co-Ops Defy Forecasts to Win Market Share", "description": "In Maine, the insurer that has enrolled the most Obamacare customers isn\u2019t the state\u2019s well-established Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, owned by WellPoint Inc.
