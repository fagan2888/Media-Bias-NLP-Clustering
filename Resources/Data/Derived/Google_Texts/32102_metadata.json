The economy is up and unemployment is down. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has proved successful beyond most predictions because health care delivery is improved and health care costs are reduced. Additionally, 20 million more Americans now have affordable health coverage, three million young adults stayed on their parents\u2019 health insurance, and nearly 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are now protected from discriminatory practices.\n\nAs reported in magazines and recent books by Michael Grunwald and Roger Draper, the Republican plot to obstruct President Obama began with secret meetings even before he was inaugurated. The strategy Republicans settled on was to obstruct everything that President Obama supported, then to blame Democrats for the resulting damage. It\u2019s probable that these Republican schemers were encouraged by rich donors who are faithfully served via advantageous legislation. Additionally, Republicans at that time were comfortable with the make-up of the Supreme Court. South Dakota\u2019s Sen. John Thune may not have attended these secret meetings. Never-the-less, he and the future two elected officials from S.D. have willingly joined other Republican sheep in Washington who support this nefarious plot.\n\nThe results of this obstruction can now be told. As one small segment of the story, Republicans proceeded to block every veterans\u2019 support bill. These bills included: a bill to help millions of unemployed veterans find work; a bill to provide job security to wounded veterans; a bill to reauthorize help for homeless veterans; a bill to help finance home structural alterations for disabled veterans; a bill supporting a Veterans Business Center; and a bill to support veteran entrepreneurs. Every single one of these bills would have helped veterans and every single one was killed exclusively by Republican opposition. The sad thing is that when reports say \u201cboth sides do it,\u201d people get mixed up about who should get their vote, or people decide not to even bother to vote. The American Legion phrased its report as \u201cSenate vote on veterans\u2019 bills was inexcusable.\u201d It\u2019s amazing how Republicans can say with a straight face that they are friends of veterans, but they do.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1N2N6wT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In spite of Republican attempts to derail Obama, the President has had success.", "og": {"site_name": "Argus Leader", "description": "In spite of Republican attempts to derail Obama, the President has had success.", "title": "Letter: Republican obstruction in Washington, D.C.", "url": "http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/10/letter-republican-obstruction-washington-dc/82870058/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/argusleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In spite of Republican attempts to derail Obama, the President has had success.", "title": "Letter: Republican obstruction in Washington, D.C.", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/806155f42b8799e18ccd1b9922c377ff319d0ed9/c=0-0-1735-1735&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/10/SiouxFalls/B9321700567Z.1_20160410160509_000_GCME16MQN.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@argusleader", "site": "@argusleader", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=823665884", "fb": {"app_id": 174484999248444}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Republican Elephant (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)It\u2019s disturbing to observe how disrespectful Republicans are to President Obama.\nAs one small segment of the story, Republicans proceeded to block every veterans\u2019 support bill.\nAs reported in magazines and recent books by Michael Grunwald and Roger Draper, the Republican plot to obstruct President Obama began with secret meetings even before he was inaugurated.\nThe strategy Republicans settled on was to obstruct everything that President Obama supported, then to blame Democrats for the resulting damage.\nhave willingly joined other Republican sheep in Washington who support this nefarious plot."}
