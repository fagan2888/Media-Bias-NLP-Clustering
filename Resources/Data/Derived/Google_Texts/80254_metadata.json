Aprecia Pharmaceuticals\u2019 individually dosed tablets were produced using a layering technique called ZipDose. It is a form of 3D printing a porous formulation of a drug that\u2019s designed to dissolve on contact with liquid. The idea is to make it easier for epilepsy patients to swallow the drug. SPRITAM (levetiracetam) is used as a therapy for epileptics to help control partial onset seizures and myoclonic seizures. \u2014 Medgadget, Cincinnati Business Courier\n\nOraSure Technologies said it received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test. The fingerstick test has not yet been cleared or approved by the FDA.\n\nThe emergency authorization is part of a declaration made by the Secretary for the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services one year ago that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests for the detection of Ebola virus. The test can be used in laboratories and facilities equipped, trained, and capable of testing for Ebola infection, as well as treatment centers and public health clinics. \u2014 OraSure Technologies\n\nLIFE SCIENCE\n\nA new prescription treatment for the common skin condition rosacea, Bayer HealthCare\u2019s Finacea Foam, was approved on by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe approval is based on the results of two 12-week clinical trials that included more than 1,300 people, aged 19 to 92. Finacea Foam will be available by prescription only beginning in September, according to Bayer. \u2014 Drugs.com\n\nHere\u2019s a look at drug patent expiration dates set for August of this year.\n\n\u2014 Biotech Blog\n\nPAYERS-PROVIDERS\n\nPhysicians in Europe have mixed feels about digital health according to a new report from Ipsos Healthcare. About 72 percent of doctors surveyed in the UK, Germany and France said they have used or recommended an app, online forum or wearable technology in the past year. Four of every five doctors see digital health tools as more than just a fad or trend. But more than one-fourth disagreed that mobile technology would replace routine checkups for patients with chronic conditions under control or that apps were key to improving adherence.\n\n\u2014 mHealth News\n\nA first-in-the-nation program aimed at controlling costs and improving healthcare for some of Massachusetts\u2019 poorest and sickest residents, which involves three insurers, lost a combined $54 million in 18 months. It dealt a setback to the state\u2019s efforts to control rising medical spending through more coordinated care.\n\n\u201cThis is a very expensive experiment \u2014 at public expense,\u201d said Al Norman, executive director of Mass Home Care, a network of nonprofit agencies monitoring the program. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say a lot about health outcomes, but there\u2019s a whole lot of spending going on here.\u201d \u2014 Boston Globe\n\nTECH\n\nA new study shows how the use of the iPad in medical education has worked at UC Irvine. The results look good. \u2014 iMedicalApps\n\nWebMD CEO David Schlanger has stated that the site\u2019s content will be moving to focus more on social media.\n\n\u201cIn the digital ecosystem it\u2019s become clear that people are using social platforms as means to do more than just connect with their friends and family, but really as destinations to find information and consume information,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we want to make sure that WebMD content is discoverable and can be consumed on the social platforms. That\u2019s an important strategy to make sure that we grow deeper engagement with our existing users and bring in more users to using WebMD and Medscape as content sources.\u201d \u2014 Mobihealthnews\n\nPOLITICS\n\nPlanned Parenthood is now officially the focus of the showdown in the U.S. Senate as congressional Republicans are trying to cut off Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding. \u2014 Reuters\n\nAccording to a new poll from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, only 30 percent of people with insurance through ObamaCare\u2019s marketplaces are satisfied with their plans.\n\nThat compares with 42 percent satisfaction from people with employer-sponsored plans, 48 percent with Medicaid and 58 percent with Medicare. Cost is the most common reason cited for the dissatisfaction with ObamaCare. Republicans have attacked the high deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses under the system. \u2014 The Hill\n\nA LITTLE BIT EXTRA\n\nWhen do young kids learn how to distinguish what joking is?\n\nNew research, which appears in Cognitive Science, finds parents can offer explicit cues to help distinguish between joke and pretend intention contexts, and children, even as young as 16 months old, pick up on those cues. \u2014 Futurity\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Richard Walker", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FDA has approved a 3D-printed drug designed to treat epileptics, OraSure Technologies' Ebola test gets emergency use authorization.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The FDA has approved a 3D-printed drug designed to treat epileptics, OraSure Technologies' Ebola test gets emergency use authorization.", "title": "Morning Read: FDA approves the first 3D printed drug, OraSure Ebola test gets FDA Emergency Use Authorization", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Staples-3D-printer.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T11:54:36-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/08/morning-read-fda-approves-3d-printed-drug-for-epileptics-proposal-to-cut-off-planned-parenthood-funding-officially-hits-the-u-s-senate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Staples-3D-printer.jpg", "description": "The FDA has approved a 3D-printed drug designed to treat epileptics, OraSure Technologies' Ebola test gets emergency use authorization.", "card": "summary", "title": "Morning Read: FDA approves the first 3D printed drug, OraSure Ebola test gets FDA Emergency Use Authorization - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Aprecia Pharmaceuticals, ebola virus, Epilepsy, morning read, Orasure Technologies, pharmaceuticals, SPRITAM, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "SPRITAM", "published_time": "2015-08-04T07:55:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T11:54:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Biotech BlogPAYERS-PROVIDERSPhysicians in Europe have mixed feels about digital health according to a new report from Ipsos Healthcare.\nFour of every five doctors see digital health tools as more than just a fad or trend.\n\u2014 Medgadget, Cincinnati Business CourierOraSure Technologies said it received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test.\nIt is a form of 3D printing a porous formulation of a drug that\u2019s designed to dissolve on contact with liquid.\nTOP STORIESThe FDA has approved the first 3D printed drug, this one for epilepsy."}
