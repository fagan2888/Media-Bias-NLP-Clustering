Donald Trump has a healthcare "plan" now, one that he prefaced with the claim that "the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act—Obamacare," which "has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don't work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices."

Try telling that to the 20 million people who have health insurance because of the law, Mr. Trump.

MILWAUKEE — President Obama came to this city on Thursday to highlight the success of the Affordable Care Act, which he said had now allowed 20 million people to gain health care coverage, a new high. "Today I can announce that thanks to the law, 20 million more Americans now know the security of health insurance," Mr. Obama said. In its last comparable estimate, in September, the administration said that 17.6 million uninsured people had gained coverage under the health law because of the new public marketplaces, the expansion of Medicaid and the opportunity for young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26.

Breaking down those gains: 6.1 million uninsured young adults ages 19 to 25 are now insured; about three million African Americans gained insurance, with their uninsured rate dropping by more than 50 percent ; the uninsured rate among Hispanics dropped by more than 25 percent, with about 4 million Hispanic adults gaining coverage; and 8.9 million White adults go coverage, dropped the uninsured rate for by more than 50 percent.

Brent Brown from Mosinee, Wisconsin is one of those millions. He's also a Republican who never voted for President Obama and in fact, he writes to the president, "was very vocal in my opposition to you—particularly the ACA." And then, this.
