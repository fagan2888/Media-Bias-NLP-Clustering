They were looking for a line down because they had a disruption in service. They sent a man out to try and find their line down. He was unable to find it. about seven o'clock Sunday morning, when he went back out to the scene to find the line in daylight he was able to find the vehicle bayou."

Lott was pronounced dead at the scene.
