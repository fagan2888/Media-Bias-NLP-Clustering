Looking closely at the existing research, the scientists on the panel didn\u2019t find much to implicate the MMR vaccine, but they did find much to exonerate it. To begin with, the MMR vaccine was licensed long before prevalence of autism spectrum disorders began to climb. Eight different epidemiological studies showed no association between MMR vaccination and autism. These studies didn\u2019t definitively disprove a causal relationship, but at the same time, the single study suggesting a link between vaccines and autism\u2014Wakefield\u2019s study\u2014failed to prove a causal relationship. Epidemiological evidence aside, there was also no good biological model to explain how MMR vaccines could contribute to autism, in either lab animals or humans. The likelihood of a causal relationship, the committee concluded, seemed remote.\n\nIn 2004 the IOM committee revisited the connection between vaccines and autism, in order to take into account the most recent research. This time, they reported that they had found no support for a causal relationship between the two. Media reports had adopted a reassuring tone when the IOM released its 2001 report: \u201cParents worried about the potential links between one of the most common [vaccines] and autism can rest easier tonight,\u201d said network news anchor Tom Brokaw. But the tone of media reports on the occasion of the IOM\u2019s 2004 findings reflected a noteworthy shift. Some reports were defensive. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d CDC immunization adviser and pediatric infectious disease specialist Paul Offit not only disputed the vaccine-autism link; he emphasized that vaccines were \u201cwithout question, the safest, best-tested thing we put into our bodies. . . . [T]hey have a better safety record than vitamins, a better safety record than cough-and-cold preparations, a better safety record than antibiotics.\u201d Still other reports suggested that scientific assurances were now beside the point. While scientists say it\u2019s \u201cclear\u201d that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, said NBC news reporter Robert Bazell, \u201cfor some parents, the doubts will always linger.\u201d Scientific conclusions, reassuring in 2001, were now no salve for parental fears. The vaccine-autism story, clearly, would not be put to rest. In fact, it only became more prevalent as the decade progressed. U.S. newspapers mentioned the link four hundred times in 2001 and more than three thousand times in 2009. And there were five times the number of evening news stories on the link in 2010 than there had been in 2001.\n\nA number of events helped keep the story in the news. Studies large and small continued to investigate the relationship between vaccines and autism, and a few endorsed the plausibility of a link. Wakefield and his study became news fodder as various conflicts of interest were uncovered and his coauthors withdrew their support for the study; soon after, he was found guilty of misconduct, stripped of his medical license, saw his study retracted from the Lancet, and made a new home for himself among supporters in Austin, Texas. The continuing spread of autism did its part, as well. In 2005, autism prevalence rose to 1 in 166. children. A year later, it rose again, to 1 in 110; two more years later, it climbed further still, to an unfathomable rate of 1 in 88.\n\nAll the while, parents continued to suspect vaccines. In part, this was likely due to the fact that the media didn\u2019t let go of the story; scholars have shown that public concern about a risk increases as news coverage of the risk increases\u2014no matter how small, or unproven, that risk may be. Moreover, as vaccine worries were being amplified in the news, the rise of the Internet created yet another forum for parents\u2019 suspicions to circulate and gain momentum. Americans in the early 2000s were flocking to the Internet for all sorts of reasons, including the quest for health and medical information. Physicians and health experts lamented that patients\u2019 web research was changing the traditional office visit, and not for the better. But for the parents of autistic children, the online world was a limitless source of information that empowered them to understand and manage their children\u2019s needs. A couple in Massachusetts said they spent five hours a day researching autism tips online. A California mom connected with other parents of autistic children online and learned about their successes and failures. Still others went online to diagnose their own children: \u201c[We] put [the kids] to bed and then got on the Web to do the research,\u201d said a mother in Illinois. \u201cBy the end of the night, we knew [our son] Weston had autism.\u201d\n\nThe web also gave such parents plenty of reasons to worry about vaccines. In the late 1990s, fledgling autism sites, such as Unlocking Autism and the Autism Autoimmunity Project, noted that vaccines\u2019 effects on the immune system could lead to \u201cprofound neurological damage,\u201d including autism\u2014a connection Andrew Wakefield had \u201cdiscovered.\u201d As time progressed, autism sites not only summed up the evidence supporting a link between vaccines and autism; they also gave parents instructions on how to reduce the risk of vaccine harm. Avoid vaccines with thimerosal, they instructed, and make sure children weren\u2019t deficient in vitamin A. Give kids a dose of vitamin C before and after getting vaccinated, they advised, space out vaccines so children didn\u2019t receive them all in one day, and opt for separate shots against measles, mumps, and rubella in place of the combined MMR vaccine.\n\nInformation about the connections between vaccines and autism multiplied and spread like wildfire on the Internet\u2014just as all information did. At the end of the decade, the CEO of Google estimated that humans were creating as much information in two days as they had since the appearance of Homo sapiens through 2003. The abundance of information online\u2014and the countless hours that parents of autistic children spent combing through it all\u2014led autism advocate (and model, television personality, and author) Jenny McCarthy to joke that she \u201cshould have a doctorate in Google research.\u201d McCarthy began writing popular books about pregnancy and motherhood while pregnant with her son Evan, born in 2002; when Evan was diagnosed with autism two years later, the focus of her work changed. Her 2007 best seller, \u201cLouder than Words,\u201d detailed the trials of seeking treatment for Evan: the frustrations of dealing with the health care system, the doctors who belittled her concerns and dismissed her observations, the friends who couldn\u2019t sympathize, even the spouse who pulled away. Only the Internet offered answers and support twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Online and through other mothers, McCarthy said she discovered the treatments, therapy, and dietary changes that helped pull her son out of his autistic world.\n\nFor parents like McCarthy, the Internet was an invaluable source of community; it was also a powerful tool for creating and disseminating \u201cexperiential knowledge,\u201d the form of knowledge production cultivated by the women\u2019s health movement three decades before. In the late seventies, the feminist authors of \u201cOurselves and Our Children\u201d had lamented that modern parents were \u201cseparated from the accumulated wisdom of other parents,\u201d a fact that \u201cdeepens our dependence on experts\u201d; this was precisely the problem their book and others like it were designed to address. Three decades later, the Internet provided access to a collective wisdom that was a health feminist ideal, in many ways. Science and medicine had few answers or solutions for the parents of autistic children, but in one another they found abundant expertise, shared across cultures and time zones. Each valuable piece of advice was profoundly treasured, simultaneously deepening the sense that shared lay wisdom was invaluable\u2014and expert wisdom flawed. It was a sentiment McCarthy expressed repeatedly, as when another mother told her about treatment regimens that could free Evan from autism: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they tell me all this at the doctors\u2019 office?\u201d she bemoaned.\n\nMcCarthy and parents like her may have been empowered by the experiential knowledge they shared, but in encounters with health care experts they still found themselves dismissed. \u201cSometimes mothers instinctively know what works and what doesn\u2019t, but the doctor wasn\u2019t interested in hearing anything I had to say,\u201d noted McCarthy. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how easily medical staff ignores crying, yelling mothers.\u201d McCarthy wasn\u2019t alone in feeling this way. She recounted being thanked by thousands of parents who felt abandoned and belittled in pursuit of treatment for their children; she dedicated her next book, \u201cMother Warriors,\u201d to them. \u201cMother Warriors\u201d was dedicated to all parent \u201cwarriors\u201d fighting on behalf of their autistic children, but here and elsewhere, mothers were, once again, the primary caretakers of children and the ones uniquely frustrated by health care professionals who disparaged their expertise. \u201cI would just say to the pediatricians, listen to [mothers] sometimes and give us a little bit more respect,\u201d said Holly Robinson Peete, actress, autism advocate, and mother of an autistic son. \u201cOur gut is really dead on.\u201d Peete made her plea in an appearance on \u201cOprah.\u201d Across the media\u2014in particular in media targeting women\u2014the fight for answers to autism was portrayed as a mother\u2019s fight, and a fight that only mothers could truly understand.\n\nMedia representations of the autism epidemic, in short, pitted mothers against experts and institutions that didn\u2019t listen to them and showed them little respect. Not surprisingly, a similar representation appeared in media coverage of the autism-vaccine link. McCarthy\u2019s own autism advocacy quickly turned into a vaccine-safety crusade, when she concluded that Evan was born with an immune deficiency that was aggravated by vaccines and contributed to his autism. \u201cI am not a doctor, and I am not trying to tell you how to treat your child,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut . . . I feel it\u2019s good to be aware of the dialogue surrounding a possible link between vaccines and autism.\u201d On \u201cLarry King Live,\u201d McCarthy appeared as the sole woman and vaccine critic in a panel discussion on autism. She argued with an all-male panel of health experts over vaccine-safety testing, the number of shots, and pharmaceutical companies\u2019 undue influence. Gendered contestations of vaccine risks weren\u2019t limited to late-night cable news. On a PBS \u201cFrontline \u201cepisode titled \u201cThe Vaccine War,\u201d groups of mothers described their vaccine hesitations to a male reporter. Vaccine advocates in the film weren\u2019t all male, but vaccine fears, it was clear, belonged to a domestic, feminized sphere while rationality and vaccine confidence resided in the masculinized professional domain. Throughout the 2000s, McCarthy kept asking experts to \u201clisten to what the moms are saying\u201d\u2014but the message across the mainstream media was that while mothers were permitted to speak, if they said anything that cast doubt on vaccines, then what they were saying was simply wrong. The vaccine debate had become a gender war\u2014and that was good for ratings.\n\nRatings and risk\n\nMcCarthy aired her views in numerous high-profile media appearances, including interviews with Oprah Winfrey, Diane Sawyer, Ellen De- Generes, and the hosts of \u201cThe View.\u201d Three years after the IOM had refuted the claim that vaccines caused autism, McCarthy\u2019s celebrity made her take on the matter newsworthy and helped keep the vaccine-autism story alive. Her cause was much broader than the contested link between vaccines and autism, but her media appearances typically served to forge that very link. When, for instance, she appeared on \u201cLarry King Live\u201d in 2008 and again in 2009, she debated pediatricians and health experts on the subject of childhood vaccines, even though the occasion for her appearance was World Autism Day, both times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The vaccine/autism conversation has been abetted by a media determined to pose everything as a conflict", "title": "Jenny McCarthy\u2019s new war on science: Vaccines, autism and the media\u2019s shame", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The vaccine/autism conversation has been abetted by a media determined to pose everything as a conflict", "title": "Jenny McCarthy\u2019s new war on science: Vaccines, autism and the media\u2019s shame", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/jenny_mccarthys_new_war_on_science_vaccines_autism_and_the_medias_shame/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/jenny_mccarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The vaccine/autism conversation has been abetted by a media determined to pose everything as a conflict", "title": "Jenny McCarthy\u2019s new war on science: Vaccines, autism and the media\u2019s shame", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/jenny_mccarthy.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elena Conis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Autism, Editor's Picks, Jenny McCarthy, Media criticsm, Science, vaccines, War on science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how easily medical staff ignores crying, yelling mothers.\u201d McCarthy wasn\u2019t alone in feeling this way.\nIn 2004 the IOM committee revisited the connection between vaccines and autism, in order to take into account the most recent research.\nHer cause was much broader than the contested link between vaccines and autism, but her media appearances typically served to forge that very link.\nOnline and through other mothers, McCarthy said she discovered the treatments, therapy, and dietary changes that helped pull her son out of his autistic world.\nInformation about the connections between vaccines and autism multiplied and spread like wildfire on the Internet\u2014just as all information did."}
