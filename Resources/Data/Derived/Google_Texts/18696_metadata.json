Lincoln was a Republican.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination and segregation in schools and places of public accommodation. It was passed in Congress with overwhelming support by Republicans in spite of bitter opposition by Southern Democrats who staged a Senate filibuster that lasted two months.\n\nSo why do blacks almost unanimously vote for Democrats, with typically 95 percent doing so in presidential elections? A big reason is a significant percentage of blacks are dependent on government handouts. Democrats are the party of big government, especially through redistribution of other people\u2019s income in the body of myriad social and welfare programs, of which blacks receive an inordinate share.\n\nLiving on public charity can damage one\u2019s self-esteem. A remedy for that is to regard such handouts as \u201centitlements,\u201d something you\u2019ve \u201cearned\u201d not by labor, ability or achievement but by victimhood. Although slavery was abolished 150 years ago, it\u2019s still rationalized by many blacks as a legitimate excuse for individual underachievement, while polls show a majority favor some form if \u201creparations\u201d \u2014 the ultimate prize.\n\nNow, there is a precedent for reparations. In 1988, Congress authorized $1.2 billion to pay $20,000 each to 60,000 Japanese-Americans who were forcibly relocated to internment camps during World War II. But that money went to those who had actually been imprisoned in the camps and were still alive. There are no surviving African-American slaves.\n\nIn 1990, Kwame Afo, an official of a group called New Africa, called for a payment of $133,000 to every African-American man, woman and child in the U.S. That would have cost $4 trillion, four times the then-level of total federal spending.\n\nIn 2002, Washington lawyer Robert Brock filed a class-action lawsuit demanding $250,000 in gold bullion for each of the nation\u2019s 35 million blacks, plus payments to an unnamed country in Africa, where they could resettle. The price tag for that: about $10 trillion.\n\nUpdating for inflation and population growth, awarding reparations today at $330,000 for each of the 45 million people that the Census Bureau defines as black or mixed-race black comes to a tidy $15 trillion. That\u2019s four times total federal spending as well as three-fourths of our GDP.\n\nWhere on earth would the money come from? And by what principle should white people today \u2014 and those of other races and nationalities who came to America long after slavery was abolished \u2014 \u2500be held financially or morally liable for what others did as far back as the 1600s, even predating our nation\u2019s founding?\n\nConceding that reparations are infeasible and never going to happen, Theodore Johnson, a black doctoral candidate writing recently in The Washington Post, proposed a scheme he calls \u201cweighted voting\u201d for blacks. Arguing that since the Constitution originally \u201cvalued\u201d slaves as only three-fifths of a person, we should now invert that fraction and give blacks five-thirds of a vote, thereby increasing their leverage in elections.\n\nOf course, slaves couldn\u2019t vote, so the three-fifths of a person rule was only about determining how many seats each state would have in the U.S. House. Ironically, the Southern slave states would have preferred that slaves be counted as whole persons, thereby giving those states more seats. The Northern states bargained that down to three-fifths.\n\nGood try, Johnson, but the three-fifths clause was erased by the 14th Amendment, and your fantasy is patently unconstitutional and a direct assault on the principle of one person, one vote.\n\nInstead of ever-more creative reparation schemes and dependence on government subsidies, that cohort of blacks who are mired in a victim mentality might far better serve their interests by taking more responsibility for their individual behavior.\n\nFreelance columnist Mike Rosen\u2019s radio show airs weekdays from 1 to 3 p.m. on 850-KOA.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rosen: A reparations entitlement?
