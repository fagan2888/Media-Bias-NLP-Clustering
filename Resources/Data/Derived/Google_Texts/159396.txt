What a tangled web presidential candidates weave.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush will step down from the board of directors of Tenet Healthcare Corp., a Texas-based company that has seen big profits thanks to Obamacare, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Bush will disentangle himself from Tenet Healthcare effective Dec. 31, the second such move he has made since announcing that he will "actively explore" a 2016 run for the White House. Earlier this month Bush ended his advisory role with Barclays Bank.

“It's a steep ramp of people who are now accessing the health care system.” Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter

The number of people signing up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act has been great business for Tenet Heatlhcare.

"As we look at the past four months, we can see a steep ramp of people who are newly insured and are seeking care in our hospitals," Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter told the Dallas Business Journal back in May. "February was double January, and March was double February. It's a steep ramp of people who are now accessing the health care system."

So far, 6.4 million people have signed up for Obamacare, and the government's goal is to have 9.1 people enrolled for 2015. Tenet Healthcare has been building new hospitals, in part on the promise of all those new customers.

Whether Bush's moves to distance himself from the kinds of business relationships that proved a liability for Mitt Romney in the 2012 election will prove effective remains to be seen.
