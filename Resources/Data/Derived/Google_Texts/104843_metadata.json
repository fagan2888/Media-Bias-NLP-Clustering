Money Isn\u2019t One-Size-Fits-All \u201cOur motto is that personal finance is personal,\u201d Rhodes says.\n\nIn other words, there are no hard and fast rules that work for everybody.\n\n\u201cInstead, you have to learn basic financial principles\u2014such as spending less than you earn\u2014to make the right choices for your own situation, regardless of what others are doing,\u201d he explains.\n\n2. Time Is Your Biggest (Money) Ally O.K., there is one absolute that\u2019s right for everyone: Start saving\u2014now! In fact, the Money Professors advise all of their pupils to start putting money into a retirement plan on day one of their post-grad career life.\n\n\u201cMost twentysomethings say they can\u2019t afford to do so right now,\u201d Weitzel says. \u201cBut by starting from the first day of their first job, they\u2019ll end up having to save a lot less in order to retire comfortably.\u201d\n\n3. Ditch the Joneses At the start of each semester, the professors ask the class if they think most people are financially successful\u2014and the students overwhelmingly say no.\n\n\u201cIf most people aren\u2019t financially successful, then it makes sense to stop doing what most people do,\u201d Pratt explains. \u201cJust because everyone else is getting a new car every five years doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d\n\nRelated: Financially Fit Cities Across America: The Right Way to Keep Up With the Joneses\n\n4. Talk Money With Loved Ones The trio actually spends a significant portion of their course discussing relationships. The reason? \u201cYou can\u2019t divorce your life from your money,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cYour finances bleed over into your spiritual, social and relational life.\u201d\n\nAs a result, students learn to openly discuss financial goals with siblings, parents and partners. One undergrad even told the Money Professors that when her boyfriend proposed, her answer was yes\u2014with one caveat. He had to take their class first!\n\n5. Expect to Make Mistakes\u2014but Don\u2019t Make the Mistake of Not Having a Plan Most people spend their twenties messing up their money, their thirties trying to figure out what they did wrong, their forties trying to dig out of the hole, and their fifties trying to catch up for retirement, Weitzel says.\n\n\u201cBut if you focus on money now, you avoid having to focus on money later,\u201d Rhodes says, adding that\u2019s why he recommends grads arm themselves early on with a personalized financial plan to guide them through the decades.\n\n\u201cYou might still mess up in your twenties,\u201d Rhodes explains. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have the information you need to change course quickly\u2014so you can spend your thirties building wealth instead.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When East Carolina University dismissed for the semester on April 28 this year, 500 st", "title": "5 Money Rules for New Graduates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/11/5-Money-Rules-New-Graduates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11202013_Graduation_Cap_Money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/11/5-Money-Rules-New-Graduates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11202013_Graduation_Cap_Money.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When East Carolina University dismissed for the semester on April 28 this year, 500 st", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f45\"", "article_summary": "In fact, the Money Professors advise all of their pupils to start putting money into a retirement plan on day one of their post-grad career life.\nOne undergrad even told the Money Professors that when her boyfriend proposed, her answer was yes\u2014with one caveat.\nMoney Isn\u2019t One-Size-Fits-All \u201cOur motto is that personal finance is personal,\u201d Rhodes says.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t divorce your life from your money,\u201d Rhodes says.\nThat slippery slope barter inspired him to launch an elective class aimed at helping undergrads grasp the realities of Money 101."}
