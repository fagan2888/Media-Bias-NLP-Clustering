CHESHIRE >> The Board of Education has approved a new four-year contract with its paraprofessionals, classroom aides and hall monitors that helps the school district avoid paying the so-called “Cadillac Tax” on the employees’ health care plans.

The board voted unanimously Thursday night to approve the contract with CSEA/SEIU Local 2001/760. The deal is retroactive to July 1, 2015, and runs through June 30, 2019.

The union represents about 150 employees who ratified the deal Tuesday, said Vincent Masciana, director of management service for Cheshire’s public schools.

“The main benefit of this for us is that it helps us avoid the ‘Cadillac Tax’ on their plans through 2020.”

The so-called “Cadillac Tax” refers to an annual 40 percent excise tax on health plans with annual premiums exceeding $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for a family. The tax, which came into existence through the creation of the Affordable Care Act, is schedule to begin in 2018.

In return for a concession that will allow the district to avoid the tax through 2020, the board agreed on raises in excess of two percent in all four years of the contract, topping out at 2.8 percent in 2018-2019.

“These folks do a great job for the district, so we are happy to get this resolved,” Masciana said. “We started negotiating this back in April 2015.”

Union officials were not immediately available for comment Thursday night.
