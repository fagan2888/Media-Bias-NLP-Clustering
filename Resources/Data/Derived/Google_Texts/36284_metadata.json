For years, financial experts have touted the benefits of helping consumers understand their retirement trajectories. Otherwise, how will they know if they're on the right track to a successful retirement?\n\nFinancial egg with \"401K\" on the side\n\nReasonable or not, the legislation has become a perennial in the garden of consumer finance proposals.

More fundamentally, exactly what assumptions about future investment returns and rates of inflation should be used in calculating lifetime income projections? What is the ideal or \"right\" rate of withdrawing assets from a plan during retirement? Even Nobel Prize winners wouldn't agree on such numbers.\n\nWhat does Washington say? Here is the description provided by the Congressional Research Service of the current version of the proposed law:\n\n\"[The Lifetime Income Disclosure Act] requires such lifetime income disclosure to set forth the lifetime income stream equivalent of the participant's or beneficiary's total benefits accrued. Defines a lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued as the monthly annuity payment the participant or beneficiary would receive if those total accrued benefits were used to provide lifetime income streams to a qualified joint and survivor annuitant.\n\n\"Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) issue a model lifetime income disclosure, written in a manner which can be understood by the average plan participant; and (2) prescribe assumptions that plan administrators may use in converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents.\"\n\n[Read: 3 Highly Personal Threats to Your Retirement.]\n\nAre we all clear on this?\n\nIn the interest of plain language \u2013 whether driven by government mandate or voluntary industry compliance \u2013 employees and retirees with 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts would be better off with clear answers to practical questions.
