But the untold story, until now, is that a key White House ally in passing the Affordable Care Act may have helped lay the groundwork for these very anti-ACA legislations being introduced across the country.\n\nBilly Tauzin, the president of the pharmaceutical lobby, couldn\u2019t help gloating while delivering a keynote speech at his final PhRMA annual meeting before his 2010 retirement. Reflecting on the industry\u2019s decision to support comprehensive healthcare reform, the mega-lobbyist quipped, \u201cThis PhRMA team is a Super Bowl championship team of advocacy.\u201d\n\nThat comparison might be more accurate if the NFL\u2019s championship team had rigged the Super Bowl.\n\nPublicly, PhRMA had banded together in negotiating its conditional support for the Affordable Care Act, and Tauzin, a former Louisiana congressman-turned-lobbyist, was the man responsible for protecting drug industry profits. In exchange for the industry\u2019s public support of healthcare reform, his organization extracted a series of drug pricing concessions from the White House. But privately, Salon has learned, while the industry was outwardly supporting the Affordable Care Act, it was also quietly funding a nationwide effort to derail its implementation at the state level.\n\nTax records show that PhRMA initiated a series of payments to the American Legislative Exchange Council with a $379,192 contribution in 2008. Tauzin\u2019s powerful lobby continued its payments to ALEC throughout its negotiations with the White House. Between 2008 and 2011, those contributions exceeded $1.25 million.\n\nALEC, a conservative group serving as a clearinghouse for state-level legislation, opposed the Affordable Care Act and launched its Health Care Freedom Initiative in 2008, the same year that PhRMA initiated its support. The project promised to \u201cexpose the truth about ObamaCare and fight back \u2014 one state at a time.\u201d It also armed state lawmakers with \u201c14 specific recommendations to push back against Obamacare\u201d and offered boilerplate legislation with its \u201cFreedom of Choice in Health Care Act.\u201d While publicly disclosed filings show PhRMA\u2019s support of ALEC beginning in 2008, the ALEC-PhRMA relationship may have begun earlier: In 2007, Tauzin received ALEC\u2019s Adam Smith Free Enterprise Award.\n\n\u201cThe support PhRMA provided to ALEC was for the all-around philosophy of ALEC and the free market. It wasn\u2019t connected to the passage or defeat of the [ACA],\u201d Tauzin told Salon. \u201cWhen we finally saw the [ACA] and it didn\u2019t have the single payer system or the provisions we were concerned about, we endorsed it at the end with reservations. [\u2026] By and large we ended up endorsing the final product,\u201d said Tauzin.\n\nIn a previously unpublished \u201cSchedule of Contributors\u201d tax filing, PhRMA is listed as contributing $339,000 to ALEC in 2010, making it ALEC\u2019s second largest donor after cigarette giant Reynolds American. The filing lists Pfizer, a member of the pharmaceutical lobby, as contributing an additional $136,000 on its own.\n\n\u201cOne [of PhRMA\u2019s strategies] might be to put on a public face of saying they\u2019re on board with the administration but behind the scenes working to undermine it,\u201d said Wendell Potter, a former insurance executive turned consumer advocate, in an interview. \u201cThere probably are some companies within PhRMA who were fine [with the ACA] and felt it was appropriate to work with the administration but even then, knowing that was the case, these companies also have bifurcated strategies to get what they want.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on background, a former congressional staffer familiar with the Affordable Care Act negotiations said they were unaware of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s support of ALEC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New documents reveal drug lobby's president posed as law's savior, then pumped cash to ALEC in effort to kill it", "title": "Exclusive: Shady double-agent\u2019s Obamacare sabotage: Top \u201csupporter\u201d quietly funded its opposition", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New documents reveal drug lobby's president posed as law's savior, then pumped cash to ALEC in effort to kill it", "title": "Exclusive: Shady double-agent\u2019s Obamacare sabotage: Top \u201csupporter\u201d quietly funded its opposition", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/08/obamacares_shady_double_agent_how_phrma_publicly_backed_the_bill_while_quietly_funding_its_opposition/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/billy_tauzin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New documents reveal drug lobby's president posed as law's savior, then pumped cash to ALEC in effort to kill it", "title": "Exclusive: Shady double-agent\u2019s Obamacare sabotage: Top \u201csupporter\u201d quietly funded its opposition", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/billy_tauzin.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eli Clifton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ALEC, Barack Obama, Big Pharma, Billy Tauzin, Editor's Picks, Healthcare Reform, Lobbying, Lobbyist, Obamacare, Pharmaceuticals", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0281\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe support PhRMA provided to ALEC was for the all-around philosophy of ALEC and the free market.\nWhile proponents of the Affordable Care Act took a victory lap on the April 1 signup deadline, opposition to the state-run marketplaces continues to expand across the country through \u201cHealth Care Freedom Acts,\u201d bills that would seek to limit state governments\u2019 cooperation with the Affordable Care Act.\nBut privately, Salon has learned, while the industry was outwardly supporting the Affordable Care Act, it was also quietly funding a nationwide effort to derail its implementation at the state level.\nBut the untold story, until now, is that a key White House ally in passing the Affordable Care Act may have helped lay the groundwork for these very anti-ACA legislations being introduced across the country.\nPublicly, PhRMA had banded together in negotiating its conditional support for the Affordable Care Act, and Tauzin, a former Louisiana congressman-turned-lobbyist, was the man responsible for protecting drug industry profits."}
