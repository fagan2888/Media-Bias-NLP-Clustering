TRENTON — New Jerseyans shopping for health coverage on the insurance marketplace will have their choice of five companies when open enrollment begins Nov. 15.

Oscar Health Insurance, a year-old start-up that serves 16,000 New Yorkers, is expanding to New Jersey, company representatives confirmed yesterday.

Co-founded by venture capitalist Josh Kushner — the son of real estate developer and philanthropist Charles Kushner — Oscar encourages consumers to use an app, a website and the telephone to compare prices and locate and communicate with doctors.

Oscar, according to its website, is “a new kind of health insurance company that is using technology to make insurance simple, intuitive and human. In other words, the kind of healthcare we want for ourselves.”

Oscar joins another newcomer to the New Jersey exchange, UnitedHealthcare, which announced its participation in June.

Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, Health Republic of New Jersey and AmeriHealth participate in the marketplace, and will continue to in 2015.

About 162,000 New Jerseyans signed up for private insurance using the federally run health exchange, and 140,000 for Medicaid, according to federal officials.

There are just 11.5 percent of New Jerseyans under the age of 64 who lacked health coverage in March, compared to 21 percent in September 2013, before enrollment in the exchange began in October, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
