One key component of his speech is the \u2018need\u2019 to reclassify broadband to a Title II public utility. More on that later.\n\nPresident Obama is risking the success we have witnessed by advocating for the reclassification of broadband as a Title II public utility \u2013 unprecedented government interference that would stifle private investment, hinder innovation and undermine the growth of the Internet.\n\nThe theme of his speech is reminiscent of those given prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA/\u201dObamacare\u201d) being passed. Before then, there was much talk about the failings of universal healthcare in Europe. When it comes to the internet proposal, the comparisons to failed, European models continue.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s call for Title II reclassification would mirror Europe\u2019s failed over-regulated, utility-style model that has resulted in a slower Internet, less investment, higher prices and less innovation.\n\nTitle II reclasification is part of the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d package. Although some considered that proposal to be dead, much like \u201camnesty,\u201d the President has found a way to resurrect it.\n\nThe declared motive behind net neutrality is claimed to be the same as the declared motive in the President\u2019s speech: internet accessibility and affordability for all. And like Obamacare, the \u201caffordability\u201d claim is in question.\n\nAccording to a Progressive Policy Institute study, Iowans would be hit especially hard by new taxes and fees, paying up to $49.59 annually in new wire line fees and up to $52.98 in new mobile broadband fees.\n\nIn his statement, Obama mentions \u201cexecutive action.\u201d This means, like amnesty, he may intend to bypass the legislative branch \u2013 Congress \u2013 and make \u201cnet neutrality\u201d law via an executive order or memo.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\". . . unprecedented government interference that would stifle private investment . . . \"", "published_at": "2015-01-14T16:31:06+00:00", "tags": "Technology", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\". . . unprecedented government interference that would stifle private investment . . . \"", "title": "Obama Hints at Executive Actions on 'Accessible and Affordable' Internet for All in New Video", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 688, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ObamaNN1.jpg", "height": 340}, "updated_time": "2015-01-14T18:16:49-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/232619-broadband-for-america-responds-to-obamas-call-for-accessible-and-affordable-internet-for-all-i-e-executive-net-neutrality/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\". . . unprecedented government interference that would stifle private investment . . . \"", "creator": "@KPendletonBooks", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ObamaNN1.jpg", "title": "Obama Hints at Executive Actions on 'Accessible and Affordable' Internet for All in New Video", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kara Pendleton", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-14T16:31:06-04:00", "wp-categories": "579 14074 14075 14076 4889 482 1471 14342", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/232619-broadband-for-america-responds-to-obamas-call-for-accessible-and-affordable-internet-for-all-i-e-executive-net-neutrality/", "wp-category-slugs": "business, companies-business, economy-business, industry-business, legal, nation, politics, technology", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-01-14T16:31:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-14T18:16:49-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mskarapendleton"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ObamaNN1.jpg", "post_id": 232619, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaaf7\"", "article_summary": "PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0ibWlkX2FydGljbGUgIiBpZD0ibWdhLWFkLWNvbnRlbnRfbWlkX2FydGljbGUiID48ZGl2IGlkPSJ0YWJvb2xhLXRhYm9vbGEtdGVhZHMtbWVkaWF0aW9uIj48L2Rpdj4KPHNjcmlwdCB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPgogd2luZG93Ll90YWJvb2xhID0gd2luZG93Ll90YWJvb2xhIHx8IFtdOwogX3RhYm9vbGEucHVzaCh7CiBtb2RlOiAndGh1bWJuYWlscy1iJywKIGNvbnRhaW5lcjogJ3RhYm9vbGEtdGFib29sYS10ZWFkcy1tZWRpYXRpb24nLAogcGxhY2VtZW50OiAnVGFib29sYSBUZWFkcyBNZWRpYXRpb24nLAogdGFyZ2V0X3R5cGU6ICdtaXgnCiB9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+Cgo8ZGl2IGNsYXNzPSJwdWJuYXRpb24gY3VzdG9tIiBkYXRhLXRhcmdldD0idGJ4MDEiIHN0eWxlPSJ2aXNpYmlsaXR5OiBoaWRkZW47Ij5yZXBvcnQgdGhpcyBhZDwvZGl2Pgo8L2Rpdj4=Broadband for America released a statement prior to President Obama\u2019s planned Iowa speech regarding \u201caccessible\u201d and \u201caffordable\u201d internet for all.\nIn his statement, Obama mentions \u201cexecutive action.\u201d This means, like amnesty, he may intend to bypass the legislative branch \u2013 Congress \u2013 and make \u201cnet neutrality\u201d law via an executive order or memo.\nThe declared motive behind net neutrality is claimed to be the same as the declared motive in the President\u2019s speech: internet accessibility and affordability for all.\nOne key component of his speech is the \u2018need\u2019 to reclassify broadband to a Title II public utility.\nTitle II reclasification is part of the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d package."}
