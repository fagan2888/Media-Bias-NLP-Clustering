Here are HuffPost's favorite losers of the year, in no particular order.\n\nJames Clapper -- The intel honcho oversaw one of the greatest losses of intelligence in U.S. history and was also caught lying to Congress. He still has his job somehow, but otherwise he likely wants to forget 2013.\n\nGrand Bargaineers -- This year saw the death of the Grand Bargain and the rise of the Petite Bargain. Henceforth, Barack Obama and John Boehner will have to find some other way to cut Social Security. Maya MacGuinneas, the head of Fix the Debt, raised tens of millions of corporate dollars to pressure Washington into a grand bargain, but began the year on the losing end of the \"fiscal\" cliff deal and ended it completely marginalized, with everyone from all sides dismissing the group's central aim. Biggest loser runner-up in the deficit scold category is Peter Peterson, the private equity billionaire who funded much of MacGuinneas' failed effort.\n\nFix The Debt's can that kicks back is on its way to the recycle bin of history.\n\nTed Cruz -- The Texas GOP senator's vaunted strategy to foil Obamacare shut down the government, but did not foil Obamacare.\n\nPine Trees -- Warmer weather allowed the mountain pine beetle to continue to gorge itself on Western forests. It's just one of the many plagues that climate change is visiting upon the globe.\n\nBigots -- Gay people have been getting married left and right; the sky hasn't fallen.\n\nMmmhmm.\n\nVoters -- The Supreme Court struck down part of a landmark civil rights law that protected voting rights for minorities, with Chief Justice John Roberts arguing that racism is over. Southern states immediately began passing laws intended to block minorities from voting.\n\nJudgmental Catholics -- Pope Francis said an amazing thing: \u201cIf someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\u201d Indeed.\n\nWorkers -- The year started with shrunken paychecks thanks to the expiration of a 2 percent Social Security payroll tax cut, which essentially wiped out wage gains for millions. Then, Black Friday canceled Thanksgiving.\n\nDan Snyder -- His Washington, D.C., football team began the year with its star quarterback's tragic knee injury in the playoffs. Then, everyone started talking about the team's racist name again, and Snyder trotted out a fake chief. Then, the team lost most of its games in the new season, and the organization is closing the year in hopelessness and disarray.\n\nThe Washington Department of Football's season in a nutshell.\n\nGun Control Advocates -- How many mass shootings does it take to get to the hearts of gun lobbyists? The world may never know.\n\nThe Long-Term Unemployed -- Congress had already shortened the duration of unemployment benefits available to the long-term unemployed, but people like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) still beat them up for receiving 99 weeks of aid. On Dec. 28, extra benefits will disappear altogether.\n\nRand Paul -- So, so much plagiarism.\n\nPeople on Food Stamps -- Republicans spent the summer claiming food stamp recipients are lazy surfers who use their benefits for sushi and lobster. Then in the fall, Democrats cut their assistance by $5 billion. Experts say it was the first-ever month-to-month drop in benefit amounts.\n\nThird Way -- Took on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Whoops.\n\nWomen in North Dakota, Arkansas, Texas -- These states passed harsh abortion restrictions as part of a lesser-known Obamacare backlash. Reproductive freedom advocates in Texas had state Sen. Wendy Davis to thank for her filibustering high point, though a few weeks later Texas passed its unconstitutional abortion bill anyway. But we'll always have that night.\n\nAnthony Weiner -- For a minute there he was actually winning the New York mayor's race, despite being a serial sext offender. Then he flipped the bird and conceded he is an empty, soulless vessel.\n\nA blurry image of #Weiner saying goodbye with his middle finger as he drives off from HQ tonight. cc: @BuzzFeedAndrew pic.twitter.com/8fKnA5yLLz \u2014 Kate Rose (@KateRoseMe) September 11, 2013\n\nDetroit Civil Servants -- Because Detroit's public employees have it so good, the vampire squid is sucking blood from their pensions.\n\nTrey Radel -- Florida man busted for cocaine possession. This time he also happened to be a GOP congressman.\n\nUndocumented Immigrants -- They're being detained and deported at record rates, the president's way of showing he's tough on enforcement so Republicans will join him in reforming the system. Instead, reform went nowhere in 2013. People just got the stick.\n\nBarack Obama -- The signature achievement of his first term has badly underperformed in a big year, and the president's \"you can keep it\" promise proved false. Despite his best efforts to prosecute leakers, a leaker exposed the administration's extremely vast and creepy and probably unconstitutional surveillance activities. And his approval ratings, those aren't so hot right now.\n\nKim Jong Un's Uncle -- If you were the uncle of a 30-year-old North Korean dictator, this was not your year.\n\n\n\nFederal Workers -- President Obama earlier implemented a pay freeze to show how tough he is on spending and then spent the next several years being dubbed a big spender. After that thankless sacrifice, federal workers were furloughed in 2013, and the latest budget deal asks them to give up some of their pensions so we can keep tax rates low. We can't think of a better way to manage employee morale and attract and retain top-quality talent.\n\nMarco Rubio -- The rising Republican star and Florida senator abandoned what could have been his first big legislative achievement. We don't understand the long game here -- the man wants to be president and he's slowly losing his hair! Americans haven't elected a bald president since Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s ... and that guy had won World War II.\n\nAmerica -- My God, what a year.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Anthony Weiner's Uncomfortable Faces Anthony Weiner's Uncomfortable Faces\n\n1 of 22 New York City Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner attends the Council of Senior Centers and Services of NYC Mayoral Forum at New York University on July 11, 2013 in New York City.
