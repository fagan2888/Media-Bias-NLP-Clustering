A history professor will discuss the more than 10,000 German prisoners of war who were held in North Carolina during World War II in a lecture at Tryon Palace in New Bern.

Robert Billinger of Wingate University will lead the Sunday afternoon lecture titled "Nazi POWs in the Tar Heel State, 1942-1946." The event will be held in the Cullman Performance Hall starting at 2 p.m.

The more than 10,000 German POWs were held at 18 camps in North Carolina. Billinger will use photos, maps and documents to talk about the arrival of the first prisoners, the work program, escapes, re-education, and repatriation.

Those captured in German uniforms included U-Boat men who worked off the coast along with infantry men and paratroopers captured in Italy, North Africa, and France.

Billinger is a professor emeritus of history at Wingate University.
