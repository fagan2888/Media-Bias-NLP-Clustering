The beneficiaries range from low-income workers to giant corporations, and even include the all-important horse racing and motorsports industries. The measures, which passed the House on Thursday, are now headed to the desk of President Barack Obama.\n\nBoth parties came away from the frantic negotiations claiming some victories. Democrats managed to make permanent a series of anti-poverty tax breaks, including an expansion of the child tax credit\u2014which will keep the threshold above which a percentage of a parent's income can be deducted to defray childcare costs at $3,000, rather than allowing it to rise to $10,000\u2014and the earned income tax credit. \u201cThese improvements lift about 16 million people, including about 8 million children, out of poverty or closer to the poverty line each year,\u201d Robert Greenstein, president of the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said of the measures.\n\nTwo other newly permanent tax breaks are the research and experimentation credit\u2014which allows companies to deduct R&D costs\u2014and a tax deduction allowing small businesses to write off up to $500,000 for the purchase of heavy machinery or office equipment. These proposals found support on both sides of the aisle. Republicans, meanwhile, managed to extend or make permanent deductions that will largely benefit large corporations, including one that expands th e category of foreign income that is not taxed and another allowing businesses to write off investment costs up front.\n\nThe tax bill may raise some problems for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama\u2019s landmark health coverage bill. It delays the unpopular \u201cCadillac tax\u201d\u2014a tax on expensive employer-provided health plans\u2014as well as taxes on medical devices and health insurance. Altogether, these cuts will cost the healthcare program more than $30 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a bipartisan fiscal policy education organization, making Obamacare just that much more expensive for the government over the coming years.\n\nAccording to CRFB, the tax deal will cost the government a whopping $680 billion over the next decade\u2014after interest, about $830 billion. With no new revenue sources, the expense will just be tacked onto the yawning US deficit. \"The failure to pay for this legislation is completely at odds with rhetoric about fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets,\" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Now we have to pay for them.", "title": "Congress to Americans: You Get a Tax Break!
