John Kasich, whose allies are behind the effort to take down the billionaire candidate and shared their plans exclusively with POLITICO:\n\nStory Continued Below Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nJohn Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nJohn Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nI want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don\u2019t want to waste my money. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nWatch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nKasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nI loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy\u2014he came in dead last! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nJohn Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off \u2013 I said NO! Now ripping Kasich. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nDoesn\u2019t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he\u2019s almost last. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nJohn Kasich fell right into President Obama\u2019s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nOnce John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud! \u2014 Donald J.

No one loses it that bad unless, for some reason, they're feeling very insecure.\"\n\nAnd later in the evening, Kasich uncorked a tweetstorm of his own, hitting Trump on a range of foreign-policy issues and tying him to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton:\n\n.@realDonaldTrump thinks @hillaryclinton would be terrific negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran.
