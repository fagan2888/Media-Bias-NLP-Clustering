The Senate, he said, used to be a collegial atmosphere but is now \"going through some real struggles\" unlike its historic legacy as a the most deliberative political body in the world.\n\n\"The reason they worked [previously] is because people were ladies and gentleman and wouldn't take advantage of the rules,\" Reid said. \"The last few years, rules have been used, in my opinion, not for the good of the country.\"\n\nIn the wide-ranging discussion, Reid joked at how he asks God for help before facing the news media \u2014 so that he doesn't \"make a fool of myself\" \u2014 and noted that the students were asking tougher questions than their professors. But he also took on a slate of serious issues from religious liberty to money in politics to voting rights.\n\nReid said that the question of how to ensure religious liberty has been an ongoing issue since the founding of the country, and trying to solve it through legislation is a \"lot harder to do than it appears to be.\"\n\n\"Anytime you try to have someone legislate religious liberty, there are other people who feel they're doing just the opposite,\" Reid said.\n\nThe audience for Reid's speech included Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and Richard Turley, the faith's assistant historian.\n\nAsked about lawsuits filed over the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive-coverage mandate, Reid noted that there was a simple answer: \"If you don't want contraceptives, don't use them.\"\n\nThough Reid attempted to stay apolitical in his remarks, he occasionally strayed, castigating the Republican Party for being intransigent and citing a recent CNN/ORC poll showing some 40 percent of Republicans believe that President Barack Obama is Muslim.\n\nObama is Christian.\n\n\"You can be a conservative and still work for a better country and I think part of that has been lost,\" Reid said, adding later, \"something has got to change. This is so foolish.\"\n\nAnd the senator saved his biggest criticism of the GOP on efforts to pass voter ID laws or cut down on early voting.\n\n\"The Republican Party is doing so much that's awful to keep people form voting,\" Reid said.\n\nThe minority leader said that the Supreme Court's ruling in the Citizens United case and the endless amounts of cash flowing into super PACs and politics in general is dangerous and could lead to a political system like Russia, where a few rich people own the political system.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say, it's just not good for our country,\" Reid said.\n\nWhen a young woman asked Reid how he handled the lop-sided political leanings of his fellow Mormons, the senator said he goes to church to get away from politics, and added that while he has found comfort in all of the congregations he's visited, he wouldn't let someone who disagreed with him ruin the experience.\n\n\"If they don't like me,\" Reid said, \"I don't care.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday echoed Pope Francis' remarks to Congress, calling for more inclusion within religion and urging compromise over extremism.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune", "parsely-title": "Echoing Pope Francis, Harry Reid calls for inclusion, compromise in religion", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/echoing-pope-francis-harry-reid-calls-inclusion-compromise-religion", "twitter": {"description": "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday echoed Pope Francis' remarks to Congress, calling for more inclusion within religion and urging compromise over extremism.", "title": "Echoing Pope Francis, Harry Reid calls for inclusion, compromise in religion", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/echoing-pope-francis-harry-reid-calls-inclusion-compromise-religion", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1003602131%2520REID%2520GLASSES-SEP_6.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2104301"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=4009011", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=4009011", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday echoed Pope Francis' remarks to Congress, calling for more inclusion within religion and urging compromise over extremism.", "title": "Echoing Pope Francis, Harry Reid calls for inclusion, compromise in religion", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/echoing-pope-francis-harry-reid-calls-inclusion-compromise-religion", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1003602131%2520REID%2520GLASSES-SEP_6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Las Vegas,News, Politics,", "parsely-section": "Las Vegas", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T15:49:38-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Las Vegas,News,Politics", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1003602131%2520REID%2520GLASSES-SEP_6.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-26T22:49:38Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14d8\"", "article_summary": "\"In the name of Catholicism and absolutism, we had the crusades, horrible things done in the name of religion,\" Reid said.\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday echoed Pope Francis' remarks to Congress, calling for more inclusion within religion and urging compromise over extremism.\n\"I think that there's a lot of compromise in religion, as there should be,\" Reid said.\n\"Anytime you try to have someone legislate religious liberty, there are other people who feel they're doing just the opposite,\" Reid said.\nBut he also took on a slate of serious issues from religious liberty to money in politics to voting rights."}
