ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - Volunteers with Habitat for Humanity continue to build homes in the Tiffany neighborhood of south St. Louis. This morning one of the homes being built on Folsom Avenue was blessed as the Pope Francis House.

A Jesuit Priest from St. Louis University conducted the ceremony and people are invited to write their own blessings for the homeowner on the walls of the house.
