I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m joking. The best decision I ever made.\u201d\n\nAll of which leads one to wonder, once more, what Old Handsome Joe Biden has against dogs, like that time he just cold killed one. (OK, his motorcade did. Still, he\u2019s a monster.)\n\nTalking Points Memo provided this note, by way of context:\n\nBiden is known for often making verbal gaffes, perhaps his most famous coming when he was caught on an open mic telling President Obama that passage of the Affordable Care Act was a \u201cbig fucking deal.\u201d Biden later said he was \u201cembarrassed as hell\u201d about it.\n\nIs that a \u201cgaffe,\u201d even? A gaffe is saying something embarrassingly wrong, like when Gerald Ford said there was \u201cno Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.\u201d But passing the ACA really was a big fucking deal. Guys, if you\u2019re going to talk about Biden gaffes, at least go with his real gaffes, like that weird \u201cShylock\u201d line a few weeks back.\n\nAlso, sorry, OHJB \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to go a long way to reach the stratosphere of slams on your own job. The best, of course, still belongs to John Nance Garner, FDR\u2019s first veep, who today is known for exactly one thing, which was calling the vice-presidency \u201cnot worth a bucket of warm piss\u201d \u2014 often toned down for the more easily upset as \u201cwarm spit\u201d (either bucket can give you Ebola, though).\n\n[WaPo via TPM]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prepare for some pissing and moaning, probably, over Old Handsome Joe Biden just being Old Handsome Joe Biden again: Thursday, at a Harvard event, His", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Doktor Zoom", "og": {"url": "http://wonkette.com/562351/old-handsome-joe-biden-said-another-swear", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/biden-5.jpg", "title": "Old Handsome Joe Biden Said Another Swear!"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prepare for some pissing and moaning, probably, over Old Handsome Joe Biden just being Old \u2026", "title": "Old Handsome Joe Biden Said Another Swear!", "url": "http://wonkette.com/562351/old-handsome-joe-biden-said-another-swear", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/biden-5.jpg", "creator": "@wonkette", "site": "@wonkette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Prepare for some pissing and moaning, probably, over Old Handsome Joe Biden just being Old Handsome Joe Biden again: Thursday, at a Harvard event, His Handsomeness said a swear, kinda-sorta:\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bitch, I mean \u2026 that vice president thing?\u201d Biden joked, as the audience reportedly erupted with laughter.\nThe best decision I ever made.\u201dAll of which leads one to wonder, once more, what Old Handsome Joe Biden has against dogs, like that time he just cold killed one.\n\u201dI\u2019m joking.\nI\u2019m joking.\nGuys, if you\u2019re going to talk about Biden gaffes, at least go with his real gaffes, like that weird \u201cShylock\u201d line a few weeks back."}
