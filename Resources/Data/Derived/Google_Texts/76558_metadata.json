If Cruz isn\u2019t an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate, the backroom maneuvers that have been the hallmark of Cruz \u201cvictories\u201d in those states certainly seem to indicate the opposite.\n\nHiel asked Cruz, \u201cHow can you say that you aren\u2019t THE establishment candidate?\u201d\n\nCruz responded by saying that the people who pulled the strings to ensure his delegate wins in those states are grassroots activists, the \u201cexact opposite of establishment.\u201d He pointed to the 65,000 people who participated in Colorado\u2019s delegate selection process as proof of grassroots activism. Hiel, like Trump of course, can point to that same number and ask why no traditional election was held.\n\nAccording to Cruz, \u201cEvery state sets up the rules. I don\u2019t control the rules but I can tell you the Washington establishment is who I\u2019ve been fighting against every day, whether it is leading the fight against Obamacare or leading the fight against amnesty I\u2019m the one who\u2019s led the fight, Donald Trump is the one who funded the Gang of Eight that pushed for amnesty\u2026\u201d\n\nHiel was quick to respond with accurate figures. She said abruptly, \u201c50,000 dollars over four years isn\u2019t funding much of anything.\u201d\n\n(The Cruz contention (lie) that Trump somehow \u201cfunded\u201d the Gang of Eight, as if Trump gave that money so the bill would be passed, is a far cry from giving eight different senators $50,000 over several years.)\n\n\u201cWell I gave zero dollars to them and I led the fight against it.\u201d Cruz then accused Trump of tweeting his support for amnesty in 2013 (another lie).\n\nHer next comments left Cruz at a loss for words and forced him to grasp at the \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a respectful conversation\u201d lifeline. \u201cYou led a fight [in favor of] auditing the Fed and didn\u2019t show to vote. You led the fight against TPP but yet voted in favor of it,\u201d Hiel told Cruz.\n\nPerhaps Cruz is starting to learn why so many \u201cgrassroots\u201d American working folks aren\u2019t supporting him!\n\nSign up for our morning news blast HERE", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz probably regrets talking to THIS Trump supporter outside an Indiana ice cream shop.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Ted Cruz probably regrets talking to THIS Trump supporter outside an Indiana ice cream shop.", "title": "Ted Cruz walked into a buzzsaw when he encountered THIS Trump supporter", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hielcruz-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2016/04/26/ted-cruz-walked-into-a-buzzsaw-when-he-encountered-this-trump-supporter-333325", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-04-26T08:14:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:29:59+00:00", "author": "www.facebook.com/amorefieldlife"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hiel, a Donald Trump supporter, got the chance to question Cruz in front of the media, and she wasn\u2019t about to let the opportunity go to waste.\nIf Cruz isn\u2019t an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate, the backroom maneuvers that have been the hallmark of Cruz \u201cvictories\u201d in those states certainly seem to indicate the opposite.\n\u201cWell I gave zero dollars to them and I led the fight against it.\u201d Cruz then accused Trump of tweeting his support for amnesty in 2013 (another lie).\nYou led the fight against TPP but yet voted in favor of it,\u201d Hiel told Cruz.\nWhen Ted Cruz made a campaign stop outside an Indiana ice cream shop on Monday, the last person he probably expected to run into was Kathy Hiel."}
