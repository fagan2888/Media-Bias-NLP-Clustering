And with good reason: Nearly one-third \u200bof all new jobs between 2012 and 2022 will be in industries related to health care and social assistance, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As part of that trend, employment for nurses is expected to increase.\u200b\n\n\n\nTo make sure an online nursing program offers students adequate preparation, it\u2019s important to know what is the right training for the shifting health care industry. \u200b\n\nWith the growth in health care, students should look at trends and new positions that are being created as a result of the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s why many schools are now offering training for guided care managers \u2013 a new government role where a health care professional guides patients through their experience, says Madeline Mattern, who oversees Pennsylvania State University's \u200bonline nursing programs.\u200b \u200bThere\u2019s also a growing need for nursing management degrees, she says.\n\nStudents should also make sure their online program offers some training in health informatics, the study of how technology is used to transmit electronic health records, health information exchange standards and portable medical data.\n\n\"It\u2019s a huge topic right now,\" says Taylor McKeowen,\u200b who is earning his doctor of nursing practice online at Medical University of South Carolina. As health care becomes a more technology-based industry\u200b, more nurses are required to be competent in their tech skills, he says.\n\n\n\n[Weigh the cost of an online master's in nursing.]\n\nNursing students should also consider learning how to work in a telemedicine environment, in which health care professionals and patients communicate through tablets and other devices, says Catherine Durham, interim director of the Master of Science in Nursing/Doctor of Nursing Practice program for Medical University of South Carolina. \u200bThere is a growing trend in telemedicine that allows patients in rural areas to communicate their health concerns to specialists. \u200b\n\nStudents should also look for online programs that offer classes focused on health care prevention, a skill that many medical professionals now need as they look to prevent diabetes, stroke and other conditions, McKeowen says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160504_Chinese\",\"text\":\"Upward of 304,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. during the 2014-2015 academic year.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Students should make sure their online program offers some training in health informatics and&nbsp;telemedicine.", "zone": "homepage", "author": "Dawn Reiss", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Students should make sure their online program offers some training in health informatics and&nbsp;telemedicine.<br>", "title": "Look at Health Care Trends, Growth to Research Online Nursing Programs", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2014/10/22/look-at-health-care-trends-growth-to-research-online-nursing-programs", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e1/73/37d78c4344a8bbf58ef6537afb12/141021-stock.nursecomputer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Students should make sure their online program offers some training in health informatics and&nbsp;telemedicine.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Look at Health Care Trends, Growth to Research Online Nursing Programs - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "Online Education", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-10-22", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/d86316b/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe1%2F73%2F37d78c4344a8bbf58ef6537afb12%2Fresizes%2F500%2F141021-stock.nursecomputer.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "online education,students,colleges,education,nursing programs,nurses,health care,medicine,health,graduate schools,Dawn Reiss", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-10-22"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3qo6w", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a84\"", "article_summary": "\u200bWith the growth in health care, students should look at trends and new positions that are being created as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nAfter taking classes online for a few months, Marenakos now appreciates how online learning gives her the flexibility to balance her multiple commitments.\nAs health care becomes a more technology-based industry\u200b, more nurses are required to be competent in their tech skills, he says.\n\"Online learning is a big change for me,\" says Marenakos, a 43-year-old mother who lives in Charleston, South Carolina.\nMarenakos is one of the many professionals returning for advanced health care degrees."}
