Bernie Sanders is the clear choice for moving this country forward. Hardly a day passes without some political pundit telling us they agree with Sanders, but then label his goals as “pie in the sky.” They use this rational to favor Clinton over Sanders, telling us that her positons are more reasonable. They seem to have forgotten how real progress is made, that you don’t make much progress if you begin a debate having compromised far away from your goals.

President Obama started with lofty goals. He wanted healthcare for all. Obamacare was the compromise. Though 16 million people gained coverage, another 29 million still live without it. Healthcare is just one example of a discussion that must be led by a strong voice saying healthcare is a right, not a privilege.

That voice belongs to Bernie Sanders.

Whether it is college education, taxing Wall Street and wealth, breaking up banks, the minimum wage, or Social Security, Sanders has visionary goals while Clinton does not. We need the Sanders agenda as the starting point because we all know that Washington D.C. is going to be about compromise.

Using Clinton’s middle-of-the-road positions as the starting point for discussions makes no sense. Bernie Sanders offers the best choice to build on what President Obama has started.
