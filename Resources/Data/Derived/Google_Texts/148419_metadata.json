But on Thursday afternoon, before the last militant left at the refuge finally surrendered, it took quite a different turn.\n\nDavid Fry, the lone occupier in the building after the rest of the militants stood down, initially refused to come out until his \u201cgrievances were heard.\u201d And even though the occupation was sparked by a disagreement over land use, Fry\u2019s grievances appeared to center on abortion.\n\nThough Fry eventually surrendered mid-afternoon on Thursday, he first suggested he would cut a deal with the FBI only if his demands were met. He was engaged in a long and rambling discussion with U.S. officials that kept returning to his opposition to his taxpayer dollars funding abortion.\n\nDavid Fry's demand is that he not pay a percentage of his taxes that goes to abortions. \u2014 Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) February 11, 2016\n\nThis isn't about the Hammonds at this point. It's about abortion, taxes and David Fry's demons. #oregonstandoff \u2014 Anna Griffin (@annargriff) February 11, 2016\n\nFry: \"They haven't addressed my concerns.\"\n\nGavin: \"What are your concerns?\"\n\nFry: \"I have a legit job, pay taxes, but I pay for abortion.\" \u2014 bravegirl01 (@bravegirl01) February 11, 2016\n\nFry sounds frantic, continues to talk about abortion: \"I don't want to pay for murder.\" \u2014 Wanda Moore (@WandaKTVZ) February 11, 2016\n\nFry\u2019s taxpayer dollars do not, in fact, fund abortions. Thanks to a longstanding federal policy called the Hyde Amendment, the government is already prohibited from using those funds toward abortion services. Hyde has been in place for the past four decades.\n\nMainstream anti-abortion rhetoric, however, has successfully clouded this point. Conservative lawmakers frequently argue that government programs like Obamacare are secretly funding abortion, and claim that organizations like Planned Parenthood are finding a way to circumvent the taxpayer funding ban.\n\nThis is not the first example of the potentially dangerous consequences of relying on misleading rhetoric about abortion.\n\nLast fall, for example, after a shooter opened fire in a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic, he told law enforcement officials \u201cno more baby parts\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to a a smear campaign that accused the national women\u2019s health organization of illegally selling baby parts. Although those accusations have been thoroughly discredited, the narrative that Planned Parenthood is ripping babies limb from limb continues to influence the conversation about abortion rights at the highest levels of government.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "David Fry's taxpayer dollars do not, in fact, fund abortions.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "David Fry's taxpayer dollars do not, in fact, fund abortions.", "title": "Last Oregon Militant Demands His Taxes Not Be Used For Abortion Before Surrendering", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/11/3748695/abortion-extreme-bundy/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11140608/AP_232736906566-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Fry's taxpayer dollars do not, in fact, fund abortions.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11140608/AP_232736906566-321x214.jpg", "title": "Last Oregon Militant Demands His Taxes Not Be Used For Abortion Before Surrendering", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11140608/AP_232736906566-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/11140608/AP_232736906566-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-11T14:08:36+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6965\"", "article_summary": "Fry: \"I have a legit job, pay taxes, but I pay for abortion.\"\nHe was engaged in a long and rambling discussion with U.S. officials that kept returning to his opposition to his taxpayer dollars funding abortion.\nIt's about abortion, taxes and David Fry's demons.\nHealth Last Oregon Militant Demands His Taxes Not Be Used For Abortion Before Surrendering CREDIT: AP Photo/Keith Ridler A road sign marks a highway closed near Burns, Ore., near the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016.\nConservative lawmakers frequently argue that government programs like Obamacare are secretly funding abortion, and claim that organizations like Planned Parenthood are finding a way to circumvent the taxpayer funding ban."}
