But first, host Neil Cavuto asked him about the recent Pakistan terror attack and the threat of terrorism in general: \u201cHow do you deal with that\u201d and \u201cHow would you change that?\u201d Cavuto asked, with a straight face.\n\nPredictably, Trump had no answers, other than to bash President Obama. But later, they moved on to Trump\u2019s hypothetical candidacy, especially in light of the noises Jeb Bush is making about running.\n\nTrump said, \u201cI think the last thing we need is another Bush, and he\u2019s looking like he\u2019s announcing. \u2026I\u2019ve had it with the Bushes.\u201d\n\nCavuto asked, \u201cIf it was Jeb Bush challenging Hillary Clinton who would you vote for?\u201d\n\nTrump thought it was too early and didn\u2019t want to say.\n\nCavuto prodded, \u201cIt sounds to me if you\u2019re not a fan of Jeb Bush.\u201d\n\n\u201dI\u2019m not a fan of the job that his brother did at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think his brother was terrible. Look, I\u2019m a Republican, I\u2019m a very conservative guy.\u201d\n\n\u201dThen what about you? What are you going to do? Are you going to run?\u201d Cavuto asked. As if he didn\u2019t know already Trump won\u2019t run.\n\nTrump claimed, \u201cI\u2019m giving it very, very serious thought. I can tell you that. I\u2019m giving it very serious thought. \u2026Obama\u2019s been a terrible President, but Bush likewise was a terrible President, and Bush gave us Obama, and Bush gave us Justice Roberts who made ObamaCare possible because, frankly, Obamacare could\u2019ve been ended if Bush\u2019s appointment voted against it which everybody says he should have and every legal scholar says he should have. What he did was disgraceful.\u201d\n\nHow does Trump know this? Which legal scholars did he ask, if any? Trump didn\u2019t say, of course. But none other than FoxNews.com cites legal experts who think otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "p0bZ6g8mcny3E62prpkntyCOuF4YhfRhCdKudM4ILZE=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/_terrorism_expert_donald_trump_slams_jeb_bush_and_pretends_he_might_run_for_president_again_121714", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Terrorism Expert\u2019 Donald Trump Slams Jeb Bush And Pretends He Might Run For President (Again)"}, "Title": "\u2018Terrorism Expert\u2019 Donald Trump Slams Jeb Bush And Pretends He Might Run For President (Again)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f5f\"", "article_summary": "But later, they moved on to Trump\u2019s hypothetical candidacy, especially in light of the noises Jeb Bush is making about running.\nTrump said, \u201cI think the last thing we need is another Bush, and he\u2019s looking like he\u2019s announcing.\n\u2026I\u2019ve had it with the Bushes.\u201dCavuto asked, \u201cIf it was Jeb Bush challenging Hillary Clinton who would you vote for?\u201dTrump thought it was too early and didn\u2019t want to say.\nPredictably, Trump had no answers, other than to bash President Obama.\nDonald Trump visited Fox\u2019s Your World yesterday to pimp yet another phony presidential campaign."}
