But he said he did not believe that Washington would act rashly in dealing with Tehran because of the nuclear deal, which was implemented earlier this month and has given Tehran access to billions in formerly frozen assets.\n\n\u201c\u2018Overall, the United States is very aware of the mischief that Iran\u2019s nefarious activities can do in the region,\u201d Jubeir said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the United States is under any illusion as to what type of government Iran is.\u201d He criticized Iran for briefly taking 10 U.S. sailors captive in early January, saying \u201cnormal countries do not act like this.\u201d\n\nHe also took a swipe at Iran by noting that in the prisoner swap that resulted in the release of four imprisoned Americans in Iran, none of the seven Iranians cleared of charges in the United States opted to return to Iran. It \u201ctells you what a great country Iran is that no one wanted to return to it,\u201d he said.\n\nKerry avoided such blunt criticism of Iran but stressed that the U.S. shares concerns about Iran\u2019s behavior and will act against it when necessary, including imposing new sanctions, as it did last week in response to Iranian ballistic missile tests.\n\nShiite-led Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia are longtime regional rivals that support opposite sides in the wars in Syria and Yemen. Relations plunged to a new low when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite opposition cleric earlier this month, drawing outrage from Shiites across the region and igniting mob attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Syria, Iran top agenda as Kerry meets wary Arabs in Saudi", "title": "Syria, Iran top agenda as Kerry meets wary Arabs in Saudi", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Syria, Iran top agenda as Kerry meets wary Arabs in Saudi", "title": "Syria, Iran top agenda as Kerry meets wary Arabs in Saudi", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/23/syria_iran_top_agenda_as_kerry_meets_wary_arabs_in_saudi/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/saudi-arabia-us-kerry.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Syria, Iran top agenda as Kerry meets wary Arabs in Saudi", "title": "Syria, Iran top agenda as Kerry meets wary Arabs in Saudi", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/saudi-arabia-us-kerry.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Lee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Shiite-led Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia are longtime regional rivals that support opposite sides in the wars in Syria and Yemen.\n\u201c\u2018Overall, the United States is very aware of the mischief that Iran\u2019s nefarious activities can do in the region,\u201d Jubeir said.\nRelations plunged to a new low when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite opposition cleric earlier this month, drawing outrage from Shiites across the region and igniting mob attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran.\nIt \u201ctells you what a great country Iran is that no one wanted to return to it,\u201d he said.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsRIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Gulf Arab officials on Saturday to ease their concerns about warming U.S.-Iranian ties and seek consensus on which Syrian opposition groups should be represented at upcoming peace talks."}
