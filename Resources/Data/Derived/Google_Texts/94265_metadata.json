In the case, litigators cited Section 1557 of the ACA, which prohibits sex discrimination, as just cause for the complaint.\n\nAs part of the settlement agreement, the Brooklyn Hospital Center can\u2019t deny equal services, accommodations, or other opportunities to any patient because of their sex, gender identify, gender expression, and nonconformity with gender stereotypes. Staff members also have to undergo training where they\u2019ll discuss Section 1557 and learn proper trans terminology. Brooklyn Hospital Center will update its nondiscrimination policy within 90 days so that it\u2019s inclusive of trans patients.\n\n\u201cThrough the Affordable Care Act, for the first time, individuals are protected from discrimination on the basis of sex, which includes gender identity, in health programs,\u201d Jocelyn Samuels, director of OCR, wrote in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased that we were able to come to a voluntary agreement with the Brooklyn Hospital Center to ensure that all patients have full and equal access to health care services, regardless of their sex or gender identity.\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, trans people have protections against discriminatory policies, privacy of identifiable healthcare information, and autonomy in choosing their own visitors and medical decision makers, regardless of their relationship to the patient. The ACA also raises the standards for patient protection by outlawing unfair insurance practices \u2014 including the exclusion of trans people via its preexisting conditions provision, the denial of services, and the cancellation of plans in the cases of gender transition.\n\nMost importantly, the ACA allows trans people to file a discrimination complaint when they believe they have encountered unethical behavior in medical settings.\n\nThe case out of Brooklyn follows other efforts around the country to address administrators\u2019 missteps and put Section 1557 to use. Earlier this year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that a trans man had plausible cause to believe he experienced gender-based discrimination in a St. Paul, MN emergency room. In 2013, hospital administrators made him wait more than four hours for care and later asked a barrage of questions about his sex life. Last month, a trans woman alleged that Medstar Georgetown University Hospital discriminated against her by denying a breast implant surgery because of her gender.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised and disappointed to learn of Georgetown\u2019s statement and its implications for access to much-needed surgery services for the metro D.C. transgender community,\u201d Shawn Jain, director of communications for Whitman-Walker Health, told the Washington Blade at the time, saying that the LGBT community health center often refers its clients to qualified specialists at Georgetown. \u201cBased on our reading of Georgetown\u2019s statement, we believe this will present some very real and tangible access to care issues for our transgender patients.\u201d\n\nLong before the ACA\u2019s passage, trans people \u2014 particularly those who have undergone female-to-male gender reassignment surgery \u2014 have reported discrimination in hospitals and clinics. A study released in March found that nearly 42 percent of female-to-male trans patients recounted instances of verbal harassment, denial of equal treatment, and physical assault. A small number of respondents said they never accessed care at a doctor\u2019s office or the hospital \u2014 perhaps out of fear of bias.\n\nThe authors of the study said improving health care for trans people requires tangible changes, including the addition of options on medical forms that go beyond binary gender designations. The report also highlighted the importance of continuous medical training that addresses the intricacies of the trans patients\u2019 care. Although LGBT patients\u2019 medical needs mirror those of their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, they abuse tobacco, alcohol, and other substances at higher aggregate rates. They also stand a greater risk of mental illness, cancer, and some sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nFor medical providers, confronting the root causes of such disparities would require growing comfortable with LBGT-related policy and social matters. Previous research, however, has found that most medical schools spend an average of just five hours on LGBT issues, most of which take place during non-patient care years. This ultimately surfaces in the doctor\u2019s office, where the topic matter scares a significant number of physicians, as found in a 2011 study.\n\n\u201cPeople are uncomfortable with things, and until people get to know people who are gay, lesbian and transgender, they are going to feel uncomfortable,\u201d Dr. Harvey Makadon, the director of the National LGBT Health Education Center at the Fenway Institute in Boston, told reporters in March. \u201cAnd how that manifests itself can affect someone\u2019s comfort level in terms of coming for care. And so we need to work on those issues if we are going to really make a difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A recent court case put Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to the test -- and it won.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A recent court case put Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to the test -- and it won.", "title": "How Obamacare Is Helping Protect Trans People\u2019s Right To Health Care", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/07/15/3680878/obamacare-trans-health/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent court case put Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to the test -- and it won.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529-321x214.jpg", "title": "How Obamacare Is Helping Protect Trans People\u2019s Right To Health Care", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-Supreme-Court--e1415756577529.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T12:25:39+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf82d\"", "article_summary": "The report also highlighted the importance of continuous medical training that addresses the intricacies of the trans patients\u2019 care.\nBrooklyn Hospital Center will update its nondiscrimination policy within 90 days so that it\u2019s inclusive of trans patients.\nA study released in March found that nearly 42 percent of female-to-male trans patients recounted instances of verbal harassment, denial of equal treatment, and physical assault.\nAlthough LGBT patients\u2019 medical needs mirror those of their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, they abuse tobacco, alcohol, and other substances at higher aggregate rates.\nThe authors of the study said improving health care for trans people requires tangible changes, including the addition of options on medical forms that go beyond binary gender designations."}
