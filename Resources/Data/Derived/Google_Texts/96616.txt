NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Many consumers don't even know if they have or have not opted out of bank overdraft protection.

That's dangerous when a bank charges a "$35 or so" overdraft penalty fee every time it covers the difference between an everyday debit or ATM charge and what's in your account.

But Pew Charitable Trust reports that more than half of bank customers do not recall "opting in" to overdraft coverage despite having paid a penalty fee, which requires account holder consent. That was true for 54% of respondents in 2012 and 52% the next year.

As a result of a service that often hurts as much as it helps, 68% of bank consumers say they prefer that a transaction be declined rather than processed at the cost of a penalty fee, and 28% of overdrafters say that they closed a checking account in the past because of overdrafts.

"Bank account overdraft protection is just a marketing term," says Brian Penny, a banking industry veteran who's worked at Bank of America, Chase and American Express. "In my view, having your checking pull from your savings account to avoid overdrafts defeats the purpose of a separate savings account."

If you're going to have overdraft protection, Penny advises negotiating it at the right level. "Always ask for a supervisor when negotiating overdraft refunds — they have higher limits of credits to give customers, and at Bank of America and other banks, once the associate gives a credit, the manager is locked out of giving an additional credit," he says. "This is to ensure nobody at the bank is overly generous."
