Starting in the first quarter of next year, the firm will begin offering the plans to employers, with a focus on smaller businesses (though it\u2019s essentially equipped to handle larger ones, too).\n\nStein said he hoped to elevate 401(k) plans to the next level, bringing the kind of holistic service that personal finance nerds could only dream of. You know, things like automatic management and rebalancing, taking into account your rollover individual retirement account, a spouse\u2019s plans and future Social Security benefits.\n\nBy looking at the entire picture, it can tell you how much you need to save and in which accounts \u2014 say a 401(k) vs. a Roth or taxable account.\n\n\u201cThat is like fundamental stuff that everyone should have a right to if we are going to put the responsibility of saving for retirement on individuals, which is what we\u2019ve done in this country,\u201d Stein said.\n\nSince all of this advice is driven by algorithms, not humans, it helps contain costs: 401(k) plans with less than $1 million in assets had an average cost of 1.6 percent of the plan\u2019s total assets in 2012. That compares with 0.54 percent for plans with $100 million to $250 million, according to a research report by BrightScope and the Investment Company Institute in 2014.\n\nThe fees for small plans also tend to vary greatly. The vast majority of 401(k)s with less than $1 million in total assets had costs that ranged somewhere from 0.68 percent to a scandalous 2.66 percent.\n\nPart of the reason is economics. Small plans have less money to manage, so they generate less in fees and have less negotiating power. But another driving factor is the way the industry is structured.\n\n\u201cIt has tended to attract the high-cost providers in part because of the economics, but in part because in this area of the market, the plans are sold, not bought,\u201d said Mike Alfred, co-founder and chief executive of BrightScope, which tracks and rates retirement plans. \u201cSo there is an adviser or rep going into that company and convincing the chief executive officer, human resources or the chief financial officer to set up a plan,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd usually the high-cost providers are the ones that have the economics to pay the adviser to support that effort.\u201d\n\nFor the tiniest companies, Betterment will charge 0.60 percent of plan assets, plus the cost of the actual investments, which tend to be another 0.1 percent, on average. There is also a $1,500 setup fee for new plans. The fees decline as the company\u2019s assets grow.\n\nThose expenses are all inclusive, wrapping in the customized, automatically managed portfolio and all of the administrative work that a 401(k) plan demands, a task that is often handled by a third-party administrator or record-keeping firm. (Vanguard, for instance, works with Ascensus.)\n\nEven though the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plans, now requires plan providers to itemize their costs of services \u2014 separating investment costs from administrative ones \u2014 comparing plan prices can still be mind-boggling, particularly for a time-constrained entrepreneur.\n\nThe Labor Department is now trying to take its oversight a step further, and has proposed a rule that would require more brokers to act in the best interest of their small business customers when selling retirement plans and suggesting investments, a rule that is now easily bypassed. Brokers must meet a five-part test before they are deemed a fiduciary, which means they must put their customers\u2019 interest before their own. Depending on how the final rule is written, it could force even more transparency.\n\nThe financial services industry has argued that such a rule would make it too costly to work with smaller investors and plans, but there are plenty of providers, including Betterment, lining up to take their place, at least in the 401(k) space.\n\n\u201cThey are using low-cost funds and exchange-traded funds, so it is a lot cleaner and cheaper for everyone,\u201d said William Trout, a senior analyst at Celent who tracks technology-focused financial firms.\n\nGiven the rising number of options, there hasn\u2019t been a better time for workers in small businesses to make a case to their employer for a new or improved 401(k) plan.\n\n\u201cThis is something of a national scandal,\u201d Trout said. \u201cWe lionize small business in this country. But the fact of the matter is that part of working for a small business means paying a lot more \u2014 and in many cases, twice as much more \u2014 for their 401(k) plans than big corporate employees.\u201d\n\nTara Siegel Bernard,\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robo-advisers \u2014 companies that automatically build and manage customized portfolios of low-cost investments \u2014 are gaining ground in the retirement investing world.", "og": {"description": "Robo-advisers \u2014 companies that automatically build and manage customized portfolios of low-cost investments \u2014 are gaining ground in the retirement investing world.", "title": "Simpler, less expensive 401(k) options emerge for small businesses", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150920-simpler-less-expensive-401-k-options-emerge-for-small-businesses.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150920-your_money_45966367.ece/BINARY/original/YOUR_MONEY_45966367", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-21T01:25:45Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-09-21T01:13:31Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Simpler, less expensive 401(k) options emerge for small businesses\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150920-simpler-less-expensive-401-k-options-emerge-for-small-businesses.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150920-your_money_45966367.ece/BINARY/original/YOUR_MONEY_45966367\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2444575\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-21T01:13:31Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150920-your_money_45966367.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/YOUR_MONEY_45966367", "publishtime": "2015-09-21T01:13:31Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe130e\"", "article_summary": "Small plans have less money to manage, so they generate less in fees and have less negotiating power.\nGiven the rising number of options, there hasn\u2019t been a better time for workers in small businesses to make a case to their employer for a new or improved 401(k) plan.\nThe fees for small plans also tend to vary greatly.\nStein said he hoped to elevate 401(k) plans to the next level, bringing the kind of holistic service that personal finance nerds could only dream of.\nThose expenses are all inclusive, wrapping in the customized, automatically managed portfolio and all of the administrative work that a 401(k) plan demands, a task that is often handled by a third-party administrator or record-keeping firm."}
