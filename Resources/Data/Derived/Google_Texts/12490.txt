In denouncing religion in schools, the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers isn't just protecting Atheists, they are protecting all of our rights and liberties

I applaud Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers for their recent letter ["District should strike overtly religious songs," Aug. 12], in which they denounced the singing of religious songs in schools. I'm a Jewish 16-year-old, and I go to Waukee High School. I see religion in school frequently, and the IAF is correct in pointing out how wrong religion in schools really is. My school district has many religions, Jews, Muslims, atheists, Hindus, etc. We all go to school, and Waukee School District isn't a Christian school district.

When I have talked about my dislike about prayer groups on school grounds, the use of Christmas trees and Christmas lights, and how I don't think they are appropriate, some have suggested that I simply start a Jewish prayer group, or bring Jewish decorations. This isn't a valid solution. I don't want more religions in schools, because it's a certainty that others will be left out. Rather, I want no religion in my school. It's a constant reminder that I'm an outsider, different, whenever I have to play a Christmas song in band, or walk past Christmas lights in classrooms. Of course, musical masterpieces should always be appreciated, even when religious, and I think there is a place in the curriculum for such masterpieces.

As IAF Press Officer Jason Benell stated, "It creates an atmosphere of exclusivity and sectarianism that is not welcome in a state where free exercise is championed." Having been at the receiving end of this atmosphere, I agree completely.

In denouncing religion in schools, the IAF isn't just protecting atheists. They are protecting all of our rights and liberties, and as a Jew, I am thankful to see them stand up for me, and all other minorities in our schools.
