Feeling that their presence bogs down hospitals, he wants to free emergency rooms from the obligation of having to take care of poor people.\n\nIn 1986, the federal government enacted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The legislation ensures that both pregnant women and people in need of immediate medical care aren\u2019t turned away for being unable to pay the skyrocketing hospital bills. Though the Act hardly fixed the myriad of problems with health care in the United States, it has definitely helped Americans living in poverty.\n\nThis legislation doesn\u2019t sit well with the conservative governor, however. Deal doesn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s fair for facilities to be obligated to treat poor people, thereby overflowing emergency rooms and turning them into unprofitable businesses. Accordingly, he\u2019s calling on Congress to reverse the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act so that hospitals can stay open and treat people who are financially well-off more efficiently, the poor be damned.\n\nWell, not quite damned. In his speech, Deal said, \u201cI think we should be able in this passage of time to figure out ways to deal with those situations [of treating the poor] but not have the excessive costs associated with unnecessary visits to the emergency room.\u201d In other words, he wants to get rid of the legislation that protects the lower class now and eventually address these problems in other ways. Those who get sick or pregnant in the meantime are out of luck, apparently.\n\nAs The Rachel Maddow Show points out, though, the easiest way for hospitals to manage the costs of treating poor people \u2014 without having to turn them away \u2014 is to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That way, hospitals would be reimbursed for the care they provide and can keep their doors open without financial concerns.\n\nThere\u2019s one problem with that, though: Governor Deal is actively blocking the Affordable Care Act in his state and advocating for Obamacare to be repealed. By most accounts, Deal is \u201cdoing everything in his power to ensure the law\u2019s failure in Georgia,\u201d leaving 20% of his constituents without any health care. Therefore, it should be no surprise why people are showing up at hospitals unable to pay for their care.\n\nInterestingly, Republicans have often said that the Affordable Care Act is unnecessary because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act already exists to take care of the uninsured. Governor Deal, however, has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want either.\n\nLately, Governor Deal has not shied away from controversy. Just two days after his statements about emergency treatment, he said that he saw no problem with allowing custom Confederate flag license plates in his state because \u201cit is a part of a cultural heritage of our state.\u201d Perhaps that sentiment is to be expected from a politician who seems \u2013 at best \u2013 indifferent to the idea of poor people remaining sick and untreated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nathan Deal, Governor of Georgia, is concerned that giving health care to poor people is killing hospitals, yet seems indifferent to the idea of killing poor", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3078/3077248.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "nathan deal,georgia,health care,affordable care act,obamacare,pregnant,poverty,class warfare,hospitals,medical care,emergency rooms", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd577\"", "article_summary": "Interestingly, Republicans have often said that the Affordable Care Act is unnecessary because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act already exists to take care of the uninsured.\nIn 1986, the federal government enacted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.\nFeeling that their presence bogs down hospitals, he wants to free emergency rooms from the obligation of having to take care of poor people.\nThe legislation ensures that both pregnant women and people in need of immediate medical care aren\u2019t turned away for being unable to pay the skyrocketing hospital bills.\nThere\u2019s one problem with that, though: Governor Deal is actively blocking the Affordable Care Act in his state and advocating for Obamacare to be repealed."}
