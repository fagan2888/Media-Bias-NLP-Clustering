While Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, sought to include an amendment that would add exceptions for cases of rape and incest, bill author Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, declined to accept it \u2013 despite indicating he would favorably consider the addition during floor debate on Tuesday. (The motion to table Garcia's amendment passed 19-12.)\n\nSen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, hoped to tack on an addition to Garcia's amendment that would have required police reports for the exceptions. Garcia countered that 91% of sexual assaults go unreported due to emotional trauma and argued, \u201cWe need to trust women and respect their judgment, not second guess them.\u201d Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, also criticized the proposal for overburdening victims and urged Campbell and others to show compassion. \"Women who are already victims will be further victimized,\" he said. Campbell ended up withdrawing her amendment.\n\nReproductive rights advocacy group, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the move to deny rape and incest exceptions to women \"disgusting and cruel.\" The Texas Legislature, \"should not add to tragedy by forcing them to pay for pregnancy terminations out of pocket,\" said executive director Heather Busby in a statement.\n\nEARLIER: On Tuesday, the Texas Senate approved a bill that prohibits abortion coverage under both private and public insurance plans, marking one of the first pieces of anti-abortion legislation to make it through a preliminary vote on the floor.\n\nSenate Bill 575 by Friendswood Republican Sen. Larry Taylor bans private insurance as well as those offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace from covering abortion care services, unless women are facing a \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d Women would need to purchase supplemental health insurance to gain abortion coverage under Taylor\u2019s bill. To date, 25 states restrict abortion coverage in plans offered through the insurance exchanges, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nIn an all too ironic statement, Taylor made the argument his bill is really about choice. \u201cThis is not a ban on elective abortion. In fact, this bill is all about choice,\u201d he told colleagues on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, offered real-world scenarios in which SB 575 would pose difficult complications for women, such as cases of rape or abnormal pregnancy that may not necessarily classify as a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d under the given definition. \u201cWe need to be sensitive as to how the decisions we're making might impact people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Watson. \u201cA person who finds themselves in any of the three scenarios I just talked about might consider our actions to be extreme if we make their very difficult situation even more difficult by denying them insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nTaylor \u2013 an insurance agent, not a physician \u2013 minimized Watson\u2019s concerns, calling the instances \u201crare\u201d and \u201cvery extreme\u201d (a term which he later retracted). Abortion providers have payment plans, argued Taylor, so women can still receive abortion: \u201cThey\u2019ll just have to come up with another means to pay for it other than having all the people across Texas who buy insurance be forced to pay for something they don\u2019t believe in or agree with.\u201d\n\nSen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, took issue with Taylor\u2019s inability to include exceptions for rape or incest in his bill. (\u201cIt just didn\u2019t address it. \u2026And those cases are a very small percentage,\u201d replied Taylor, saying he would consider a possible amendment.) Buying into supplemental insurance may be too expensive for women already struggling with added costs and diminished access inflicted by stringent abortion laws, she argued. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019ve already denied access to poor women and now we\u2019re working at chipping away at women who do have insurance to present yet another barrier,\u201d said Garcia.\n\nDrawing the point that abortion care is being unfairly targeted by the legislation, Garcia asked, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t believe in vasectomies, did you consider other issues that people may have a problem with?\u201d Admitting that the abortion exclusion rule would prove \u201cunique\u201d in Texas, Taylor said the bill was meant to address anti-choice qualms. His reason for filing the bill: \u201cBecause the people who are opposed to abortion don\u2019t like to be forced into paying for others who are choosing to have abortion.\u201d (His definition, apparently, of granting people \u201cchoice.\u201d)\n\nSB 257 passed on a 21-10 largely party line vote with the support of a lone, anti-choice Democrat Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville (Lucio stood as the sole Senate Dem to vote for 2013\u2019s abortion restrictive House Bill 2). The legislation still needs final approval from the Senate before it makes it way to the House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP moves to prevent health insurers from covering abortion", "og": {"image": "http://www.austinchronicle.com/imager/b/original/1633296/f5c1/pols_feature1-1.jpg", "title": "Senate Votes to Ban Insurance Coverage for Abortion"}, "keywords": "84th Texas Legislature, Abortion", "google-site-verification": "qnrKtufqpmTjGUn37hMteGd7m_7o98t42RcbtZJAXRs", "viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0 user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "84th Texas Legislature, Abortion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec94\"", "article_summary": "Illustration by Jason StoutUPDATE: By a 21-10 vote the Texas Senate passed SB 575 on third reading Wednesday afternoon.\nTo date, 25 states restrict abortion coverage in plans offered through the insurance exchanges, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\nThe measure bans health insurance plans from providing abortion coverage.\nReproductive rights advocacy group, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the move to deny rape and incest exceptions to women \"disgusting and cruel.\"\nThe legislation still needs final approval from the Senate before it makes it way to the House."}
