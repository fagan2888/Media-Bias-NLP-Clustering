The Babylonians and Romans routed the Jews. Muslims booted the Byzantines. Christian Crusaders mauled Muslims and were, in turn, tossed out by the Tartars.\n\nThe Ottomans followed, then Britain, then Jordan, before finally, in 1967, the city came nearly full circle when Israel annexed East Jerusalem. That sparked another cycle of violence, this time between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easily the most contentious piece of real estate in the world,\u201d says Anthony Bourdain, who visits Jerusalem in the season premiere of \u201cAnthony Bourdain Parts Unknown,\u201d which debuts Sunday night on CNN.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s no hope - none - of ever talking about it without pissing someone off.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM CNN: Exploring Jerusalem's Old City\n\nWhy would people argue about a holy place?\n\nYou might call it the Jerusalem Paradox: If the city wasn't considered so sacred, there'd be nothing to fight about.\n\nBut since the days of the Jebusites, more than 3,000 years ago, the otherwise unremarkable place has been called a portal to paradise, and everyone elbows for a closer look.\n\nAfter all, how many places can list God on their guest registry? And Abraham, David, Solomon, the Virgin Mary, Jesus and the Prophet Mohammed as well.\n\n\u201cThe city is chockablock full of places that have historical meaning for different groups of people - and they are all contested,\u201d said Samuel Heilman, a professor of Jewish Studies at Queens College in New York and author of \u201cA Walker in Jerusalem.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s story is just one of many,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cAnd so they not only try to make their story the right story, they try to delegitimize everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSome Muslims say Jerusalem never housed a Jewish temple; some Jews argue that Mohammed never visited the sacred city, and the argument runs on and on \u2026 for centuries.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Muslims, Christians and Jews fighting each other. Sometimes the most serious squabbles erupt within the faith themselves. Want to see Christian monks fist-fight? Go to Jerusalem.\n\nThe good news is, all three Abrahamic faiths teach that the Messiah will eventually return to Jerusalem and sort the whole thing out.\n\nUntil then, here are the sacred city\u2019s five most contested sites:\n\n1. The Temple Mount\n\nThis broad platform in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City is said to have hosted an almost unimaginable series of sacred events.\n\nThe rabbinic sages say that God gathered dust from this spot to create Adam, the first man, before setting him loose in the Garden of Eden.\n\nJewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount also contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son - under God\u2019s orders - before an angel intervened.\n\nLater, Solomon constructed the first Jewish Temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant, which was said to contain the tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments.\n\nOnly the Jewish high priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, where tradition holds he met with God on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. Rabbis say that Jews are still forbidden to step on the Temple Mount, for fear of intruding on the Holy of Holies.\n\nThe Temple was destroyed twice, first by the Babylonians and then by the Romans. Religious Jews pray the Third Temple will be built by the Messiah himself.\n\nSince 1967, the Temple Mount has been an almost constant source of tension because it is also home to the \u2026\n\n2. Haram al-Sharif\n\nMuslims call the Temple Mount \"Haram al-Sharif\" (the Noble Sanctuary), and it's home to one of the most sacred sites in Islam: the al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nMuslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to al-Aqsa during his miraculous Night Journey, said Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about al-Aqsa,\u201d said Khan. \u201cThat\u2019s why all Muslims are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.\u201d\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, the night journey took Mohammed to the same Jerusalem rock on which Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, where the Muslim founder led Abraham, Moses and Jesus in prayers as the last of God's prophets.\n\nThat rock is now said to sit in the Dome of the Rock, whose golden roof gleams above the Old City skyline.\n\nSince its construction in the seventh century, the Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews.\n\nIn the 1980s, Jewish radicals plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa, believing that it would lead to a spiritual revolution and usher in the messiah.\n\nIn 2000, the Second Intifada \u2013 a five-year-long Palestinian uprising - was sparked, Palestinians say, after Ariel Sharon, then a candidate for Israeli Prime Minister, visited the compound surrounding al-Aqsa.\n\nSharon insisted that his visit was not intended to provoke Palestinians, but many saw it as an attempt to underline Israel\u2019s claim to Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites.\n\n3. The Western Wall\n\nIsraeli soldiers wept when they saw the Western Wall in 1967, after seizing East Jerusalem from Jordan.\n\n\u201cWe have returned to our most holy places,\u201d said one Israeli general. \u201cWe have returned and we shall never leave them.\u201d\n\nLocated at the foot of the Temple Mount, the 62-foot-tall stone wall once supported the courtyard of the ancient temple, the center of Jewish spiritual life for centuries.\n\nFor Jews, the wall is one of the last remaining links to that time, and they gather before it to hold religious services, to pray or to slip notes into its cracks.\n\n\u201cThere's a tradition that notes put in the wall are like notes transmitted to heaven,\u201d Heilman said, \u201csince this is as close as Jews were able for generations to get to the Temple Mount where they believed God dwelt on earth.\u201d\n\nHow close Jews get - and which kind of Jews - has been a subject of fierce debate in recent years.\n\nThe praying area is divided into men\u2019s and women\u2019s sections, and ultra-Orthodox men have hurled chairs at women who sing and pray at the wall or try to enter the men\u2019s section, accusing them of violating Jewish law.\n\nIn response, a group called Women of the Wall has launched a highly publicized protest campaign to win the right to wear prayer shawls, lead prayers and read collectively from the Torah at the holy site.\n\n4. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre\n\nIn the fourth century, after converting to Christianity, Emperor Constantine launched what historian Karen Armstrong calls \u201cone of the first recorded archaeological excavations in history.\u201d\n\nHe was looking for Jesus\u2019 tomb and thought he found it in Jerusalem. Constantine asked his mother to oversee the construction of a magnificent church on the site.\n\nOriginally called the Church of Resurrection, it was destroyed by a Muslim caliph in 1009, but later Muslim leaders allowed Christians to rebuild the church.\n\nNow called the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, it is believed by many Christians to house a piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, his tomb and the site of his resurrection.\n\nUnder a centuries-old agreement, the church is shared by six Christian communities, but they squabble over every stone, sometimes coming to blows over perceived slights.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Israeli riot police broke up a melee between Greek Orthodox and Armenian monks. Ethiopian monks reportedly sneaked into the church's rooftop monastery during Easter prayers in 1970 and changed the locks, evicting the its former owners, the Copts.\n\nThe six Christian communities at the Holy Sepulcher don\u2019t even trust each other with the church keys. A Muslim family has held them, opening the church every morning and closing it every night since the 12th century.\n\n5. The Garden Tomb\n\nNot all Christians believe that Jesus was buried and rose again at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nIn the 19th century, doubts crept in about Constantine\u2019s site, said Robert Wilken, a professor of Christian history at the University of Virginia.\n\n\u201cWhat it really boils down to is that Protestants came to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the 19th century and were appalled that it was an Orthodox church,\u201d Wilken said. The icons and incense were apparently too much for Protestants more austere sensibilities.\n\nIn 1867, British Christians unearthed what they believe was the garden of Joseph of Arimathea, outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, where they believe Jesus was entombed.\n\nThe Gospel of John says that Jesus' tomb was near a garden, and the British Christians who run the Garden Tomb say their site matches the Bible\u2019s descriptions perfectly.\n\nThe tomb is carved from solid rock, it sits near an escarpment that looks like a skull (Golgotha, where Jesus was crucified, means \u201cplace of the skull,\u201d) and most importantly, they say, the tomb is empty, signifying a resurrected Jesus.\n\nREAD MORE: 10 things to know before visiting Israel, the West Bank and Gaza\n\nSo, is there any chance the battle for Jerusalem will end before the End Times?\n\nMuqtedar Khan says yes, if the traditions that trace their history to Abraham - Jews, Muslims and Christians - start seeing themselves as part of the same sacred lineage, rather than three separate religions.\n\n\"If there were willing to share this identity,\" Khan said, \"perhaps they'd be more willing to share Jerusalem.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke,\u00a0CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) -- \u00a0Heaven and Earth are said to meet atop Jerusalem\u2019s sacred mounts, but the city\u2019s stony streets have seen more than their share of violence.
