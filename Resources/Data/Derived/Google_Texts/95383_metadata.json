Clarice Navarro-Ratzlaff\u2019s bill to increase funding for Colorado\u2019s fraud investigation unit hit a roadblock among representatives who\u2019d already voted for the measure in committee.\n\nNavarro\u2019s bill, HB 1057, would divert an extra dollar of current $8 commercial filing fee to the investigation unit. Right now the Secretary of State\u2019s office collects the fee and sends $3 to the investigation unit. Navarro\u2019s bill would call on the Secretary\u2019s office to collect a dollar less in order to send $4 to the unit. In testimony, Secretary of State officials said they couldn\u2019t be sure that sending more money to the unit wouldn\u2019t force them to raise filing fees overall for small businesses.\n\nBy the time she came to the floor today, however, Navarro said she\u2019d spoken with the Secretary\u2019s office which said an unexpected revenue surplus would allow it to cover the extra funding for at least the next three years until her measure comes up for review.\n\nThe legislature has been in a nasty fight with Secretary of State Scott Gessler over his office\u2019s budget. Nasty enough, it turns out, that the very mention of his office making a fiscal deal with Navarro caused something of a floor fight.\n\nRep. Joe Salazar of Thornton questioned Gessler\u2019s word.\n\n\u201cDid the Secretary of State\u2019s office make that commitment to you in writing? If so, could we get a copy of that?\u201d he said. \u201cFurther, if they have unexpected revenue, why are we charging anyone at all?\u201d\n\nNavarro said she didn\u2019t have anything in writing from the Secretary\u2019s staff promising that they wouldn\u2019t raise fees on small businesses as a result of her anti-fraud bill, but that she bought what they told her.\n\nThat\u2019s about the moment the debate became more about the Secretary\u2019s trustworthiness than about fraud prevention. At various points, and from various sides of the aisle, representatives accused each other of making back-room deals, showing partisanship, flip flopping and turning their backs on small businesses.\n\nEventually Rep. Daniel Kagan of Cherry Hills Village proposed an amendment to settle the debate.\n\n\u201cMembers, this amendment would simply make clear what\u2019s been made clear at the mike. If we pass the bill, the Secretary of State will reduce the filing fee from five to four dollars and keep it there for three years,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter another rousing round of debate over partisanship and separation of powers, the amendment was ruled out of order and Kagan pulled it. In the end, the House went ahead and gave initial approval to the measure on a voice vote, since ultimately the only thing the members seemed to agree on were the merits of the bill\u2019s intention to reduce fraud.\n\nHouse makes moves against tricksy tobacconists\n\nGiving initial approval to SB 18, a bill to explicitly prohibit the marketing of any kind of nicotine device to kids under 18, the House issued a loud(ish) anti-tobacco statement today. That\u2019s a bit of a flip from yesterday when a separate bill that would have raised the smoking age to 21 years old died by a single vote in the House Finance Committee.\n\nSB 18 essentially expands current statute that says it\u2019s illegal to sell tobacco products to children so that it includes all nicotine products. Lest the measure seem like a redundant redundancy, the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Dave Young of Greeley, explained that under the law\u2019s current wording retailers (mostly convince stores and hookah bars) testified that they weren\u2019t entirely sure if they were allowed to sell non-cigarette nicotine products to kids.\n\nWhile that may sound like deliberate ignorance on the part of vendors, Rep. Jeanne Labuda of Denver took the floor to note just how covert the nicotine market has become. She said the bill responds to \u201ccontinued efforts by tobacco companies to market nicotine to children.\u201d Efforts that Labuda said include bubble gum, cherry flavored candies and nicotine products with a Tinker Bell theme.\n\nEven Rep. Daniel Kagan , the deciding vote in failing yesterday\u2019s bill to raise the legal smoking age to 21 years old, voiced his support of the nicotine restriction bill.\n\n\u201cNicotine is an addictive product. Believe me I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this bill strikes the right balance. It sets the right age \u2014 we treat people as adults beyond 18 and as children below 18.\u201d\n\nHouse says insurance commercials don\u2019t have to be bilingual\n\nLast session the legislature passed HB 13-1233 requiring that insurance policies offered in other languages have to be provided alongside a controlling copy in English. The bill made sense as the Affordable Care Act opened up policies to more and more Americans for whom English may not be a first language. However, as sometimes happens with legislation, the language applied more broadly in practice than the sponsors intended.\n\n\u201cWe went a little far and required the same of advertising statements, which doesn\u2019t make a lot of practical sense,\u201d admitted Rep. Dan Pabon of Denver, the sponsor of last year\u2019s bilingual legislation and this year\u2019s HB 1282, which clarifies it.\n\nThe measure, initially approved by the House today, would allow companies to advertise using billboards, for example, written in just one language.\n\nCharter school security officers get go-ahead to carry guns\n\nAmbiguous language in Colorado\u2019s statutes governing school security officers made it impossible for folks employed by charter schools to carry a weapon at work even if they had the appropriate permit. Today, the House gave initial approval to a bill including charter schools in provisions that already allow for public school security officers to conceal carry. HB 1291, though a gun bill, passed handily and without debate.\n\n\u201cThis is an equity bill which adds three words to statue,\u201d said the measure\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephen Humphrey of Severance.\n\nThe bill has bipartisan co-sponsorship in Democratic Rep. Mike McLachlan of Durango, who was one of a number of Democrats threatened by gun-control motivated recall efforts that didn\u2019t make it to a vote last fall.\n\nProtecting elders against financial exploitation\n\nThe House gave first-round approval today to a bill THAT would create a new crime for the exploitation of elders. An extension of elder-protection legislation passed last year, SB 98 broadens protections to include not just abuse from someone in a legal position of power over an elder, but someone who has \u201cinfluence\u201d over them in general. The bill also makes it easier to report elder abuse by removing requirements that reports be directly forwarded to the district attorney and allowing local law enforcement an social services to take reports as well.\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Rep. Mike Foote of Lafayette, called the measure a simple clean-up focused on closing a few loopholes in the previous legislation.\n\n\u201cThis bill continues the state of Colorado\u2019s progress towards protecting at-risk elders, who are persons over the age of 70,\u201d said Rep. Sue Schafer of Wheat Ridge, the bill\u2019s other sponsor. Schafer noted that before last year\u2019s legislation, Colorado was one of only three states without specific laws to protect elderly people from financial predators. She joked that her colleagues should vote for the bill since many of them may soon need its protection.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Notes from the first day of spring, AKA the 72nd day of the 2014 legislative session.", "title": "Fisticuffs over fraud bill while nicotine restriction and guns for charter school cops garner support", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/146581/fisticuffs-over-fraud-bill-while-nicotine-restriction-and-guns-for-charter-school-cops-garner-support", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/cap-note.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/cap-note.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-21T00:17:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T00:18:48+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/tessa-cheek"}}, "article_summary": "Fisticuffs over fraud bill while nicotine restriction and guns for charter school cops garner supportAnti-fraud measure sparks partisan fisticuffsToday, Pueblo Rep.
