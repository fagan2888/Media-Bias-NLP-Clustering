No, you can\u2019t. No, you can\u2019t\u2019 \u201d in Lyons.\n\nMost complaints centered on the confoundingly long process of getting permits from the town to do repairs, revamps or rebuilds for homes slammed in September 2013 by a rain-bloated, out-of-control St. Vrain River.\n\nNancy Arp said she put in a request with the town for a new fence 11 weeks ago and was told she would need to conduct a $5,000 engineering study first.\n\nUntil she gets the fence built, she can\u2019t run her day-care business on Park Street.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need studies done and more hoops to jump through. I need a fence,\u201d Arp told the town board. \u201cWhat\u2019s being done to us is morally wrong.\u201d\n\nOne resident said the process of trying to secure a floodplain permit for repairs to her home \u2014 she finally received one this summer \u2014 was so frustrating and fraught with setbacks that she had contemplated taking her life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to say, \u2018Enough,\u2019 \u201d she said through a cascade of tears, as neighbors put their arms around her.\n\nResident after resident described submitting repair or building plans to the town\u2019s engineering department only to have them returned with requested changes to be made. When new plans with the desired changes were turned into the town, the homeowner would receive a whole new set of items to address.\n\nIn the back and forth of paperwork, months would often go by \u2014 a process one resident described as a war of \u201cescalating engineering studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the two years since the flood, we have been living in a camper or in our business,\u201d Cat Wechsler said.\n\nWechsler said she and her husband submitted to the town an application for a permit six times. Their situation is still not resolved, she said.\n\n\u201cThis town needs more engineers working with residents,\u201d she said.\n\nMuch of the blame for the numerous delays in reviewing building plans was leveled at Lyons\u2019 engineer Jim Blankenship, who did not attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nTrustee Dawn Weller apologized, saying she \u201clost touch\u201d with the neighborhood at the west end of town.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were doing right by you,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is going to be strong commitment from this board to wade through this mess.\u201d\n\nMayor John O\u2019Brien acknowledged that Lyons needs to be \u201cmore efficient\u201d in dealing with residents trying to turn their lives around from Colorado\u2019s most expensive natural disaster.\n\n\u201cWe know this is an important issue, and we want to raise it to another level,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nSeveral residents urged town leaders to hire more engineers to help go through applications more quickly.\n\nResident Rick DiSalvo said that would alleviate the bottleneck that exists now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an adversarial process to getting a permit \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are living in RVs and in makeshift quarters.\u201d\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lyons residents demand a better permitting process to fix flood damage", "title": "Lyons residents demand a better permitting process to fix flood damage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/01/lyons-residents-demand-a-better-permitting-process-to-fix-flood-damage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150901__CDXXCHANGINGLYONS_BL11025xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150901__CDXXCHANGINGLYONS_BL11025xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-01T21:06:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:01:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9be5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201dSeveral residents urged town leaders to hire more engineers to help go through applications more quickly.\nNo, you can\u2019t\u2019 \u201d in Lyons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an adversarial process to getting a permit \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said.\nResident after resident described submitting repair or building plans to the town\u2019s engineering department only to have them returned with requested changes to be made.\nMuch of the blame for the numerous delays in reviewing building plans was leveled at Lyons\u2019 engineer Jim Blankenship, who did not attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting."}
