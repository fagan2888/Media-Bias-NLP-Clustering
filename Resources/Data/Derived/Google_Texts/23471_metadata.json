Now they\u2019ll have to find other cruelties to inflict.\n\nThey\u2019ve been predicting the demise of Sydney\u2019s favourite hairstyle for quite a few years now, long before it actually came true.\n\nNobody\u2019s getting vajazzled any more. Vatooing hasn\u2019t been heard of since 2011.\n\nThe once-ubiquitous landing strip cannot be discerned by approaching pilots, now it is indistinguishable from surrounding bushland.\n\nThe lady-shave giants Gillette and Schick have even started selling hair-trimming attachments for their disposable razors.\n\nOld-school feminists will rejoice, proclaiming a new generation of women are rediscovering the beauties of natural upholstery, and are no longer playing into the fantasies of blokes.\n\nThey\u2019ve been predicting the demise of Sydney\u2019s favourite hairstyle for quite a few years now, long before it actually came true.\n\nSo I\u2019m here to speak up in favour of the full monty.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of feminine badge of honour, I reckon. Forget doing an iron-man for personal challenge and hardship. If a woman can maintain her sense of humour and a civil tongue in her head while having every strand ripped from her body, she is truly a lady to be reckoned with.\n\nThis has been predicted before, but I\u2019m seeing a genuine climate change: 2014 is shaping up as the hairiest year since records commenced.\n\nOne of the first, most shocking revelations about Brazilians, when they emerged in Australian suburbia in the mid-1990s, was that schoolgirls as young as 14 were having them done.\n\nBack then, there was a period of feminist soul-searching: if barely pubescent girls are racing to the salon to get nude, there\u2019s a serious problem with the culture of premature sexualisation, they said.\n\nStill today you\u2019ll hear some women argue Brazilians are unnecessary, that they cause ingrown hairs, are too painful, are informed by porn culture, and are something men like, as opposed to something women actually want to do.\n\nTo all of which I say: rubbish.\n\nFor a start, it\u2019s only painful if you try to do it sober. Men and porn-fans might like it, but I\u2019m yet to meet a single woman who gets a Brazilian because her boyfriend wants her to.\n\nThe mundane truth is this: Brazilians are just a fashion. They\u2019ve got nothing to do with gender relations or women\u2019s liberation.\n\nWomen do it because they find it feels nice, and because it keeps everything tidy in the swimsuit department.\n\nThey\u2019re as much interested in looking neat and tidy in the gym change room - in case any other women glance sideways - as they are in what some dude might think.\n\nAnd you know what? They\u2019re kind of harmless - even on a 14-year-old.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s surprised that teenage girls are into Brazilians doesn\u2019t know many teenage girls very well.\n\nIf a woman can maintain her sense of humour and a civil tongue in her head while having every strand ripped from her body, she is truly a lady to be reckoned with.\n\nOne of the great markers of womanhood, for the average teenage girl, is the arrival - and then the removal - of bodily hair.\n\nLittle ladies spend a lot of time in their late-girlhood anticipating (and worrying about) the arrival of puberty, and all the new bumps and growths it will bring.\n\nThe notion of shaving one\u2019s legs with an orange plastic throwaway razor, even when I was at school, was an act absolutely laden with adult sophistication.\n\nIt seemed, in prospect, almost as elegant and classy as smoking with a long, tapered cigarette-holder like Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, or having hot-pink acrylic fingernails like Hope Williams Brady in Days of Our Lives.\n\nNone of those activities have anything to with impressing teenage boys.\n\nAnd nor, I think, do Brazilians. If you consider the scope of \u2018dangerous things girls can do to themselves in the name of sophistication\u2019, Brazilians are pretty mild.\n\nI\u2019d rather young women inflicted pain on themselves with strips of calico than raided mum\u2019s prescription meds, or racked up thousands on a credit card, or chatted online with strangers, or developed eating disorders.\n\nI think a lot of contemporary \u2018feminism\u2019 fundamentally misunderstands modern young women.\n\nGirls naturally reach out for the accoutrements of womanhood, from the first time a six-year-old drapes herself in mum\u2019s plastic pearls and clops around the house in a pair of gigantic high heels. They like feminine things. They enjoy acts of adulthood.\n\nAnd adult women enjoy grooming and preening themselves for reasons entirely unconnected with the desire to attract men.\n\nWe do it because it feels good. And if you\u2019re really a feminist, that should be more than reason enough for a woman to do whatever the hell she wants, hairy or not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Brazilian wax, I&#8217;m here to tell you, is finally dying.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "The Brazilian wax, I&#8217;m here to tell you, is finally dying.", "title": "Brazilian waxing: I\u2019m in favour of the full monty", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/brazilian-waxing-im-in-favour-of-the-full-monty/story-fni0cx12-1226826939549", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/02/14/1226826/937884-640003e4-9507-11e3-8d43-e004d36a6c9a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/02/14/1226826/937884-640003e4-9507-11e3-8d43-e004d36a6c9a.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226826939549, "keywords": "single woman, hot-pink acrylic fingernails, feminine things, personal challenge, shopping-mall beauty parlours, modern young women, ingrown hairs, eating disorders, plastic throwaway razor, feminist soul-searching, women glance, gender relations, Brazilian waxes, approaching pilots, premature sexualisation, feminine badge, Claire Harvey, Holly Golightly, genuine climate change, favourite hairstyle, civil tongue, young women, teenage girls, Waxing habits, Brazilian wax, dangerous things girls, selling hair-trimming attachments, orange plastic throwaway, once-ubiquitous landing strip, average teenage girl", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Feb 16 15:03:42 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Feb 16 15:03:42 EST 2014", "author": "Claire Harvey"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88ea\"", "article_summary": "Anyone who\u2019s surprised that teenage girls are into Brazilians doesn\u2019t know many teenage girls very well.\nSo I\u2019m here to speak up in favour of the full monty.\nI think a lot of contemporary \u2018feminism\u2019 fundamentally misunderstands modern young women.\nMen and porn-fans might like it, but I\u2019m yet to meet a single woman who gets a Brazilian because her boyfriend wants her to.\nThe Brazilian wax, I\u2019m here to tell you, is finally dying."}
