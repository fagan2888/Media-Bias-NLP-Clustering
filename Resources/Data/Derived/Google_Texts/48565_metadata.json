Sign up for our morning news blast HERE\n\nSitting down for his first interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in eight years, President Barack Obama was not hesitant to get a dig in against the network, insisting \u201cRepublicans have their own TV stations.\u201d\n\nIt would not be much of a stretch to say Obama was hanging the candidacy of Donald Trump around the neck of Fox News.\n\nHost Chris Wallace asked the president if he felt personally responsible for the sense of anger voters in both parties are feeling over being cut out from the decision-making process.\n\nWith surprising candor, Obama said he was \u201cfrustrated about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber one, we\u2019re still shell-shocked from what happened in 2007-2008. People lost homes, lost jobs, lost life savings and they still don\u2019t fully know how that happened and was the system fixed in a way they can have confidence in.\u201d\n\nWallace questioned why, after eight years, Obama had not \u201cfixed\u201d people\u2019s perception of the system.\n\n\u201cThe perception is going to be changing over time as people see results, as they get more confident\u201d the president replied. \u201cBut, and this is the big but, nobody is going to be 100 percent satisfied in a democracy like ours with every outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think the danger both among Republicans and among Democrats who just listen to each other or they just listen to people that already agree with them,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou know, Republicans have their own TV station.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Wallace quipped. \u201cYou can say Fox News.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got their own publications, their own blogs,\u201d the president continued. \u201cDemocrats, same thing. Increasingly what happens is, we don\u2019t hear each other. And so what happens then is when Republicans promise to repeal Obamacare and it doesn\u2019t get repealed, they\u2019re outraged.\u201d\n\nHe said some Democrats are also outraged over not getting a single payer system. Surprisingly, Obama acknowledged that \u201c85 percent of the people get health care through their jobs, they\u2019re pretty satisfied with it \u2026 they don\u2019t want big change on them.\u201d\n\nAn admission that undermines a big part of why Democrats felt the need to shove Obamacare down America\u2019s throat.\n\nObama concluded on an uncharacteristically optimistic note, telling people to step back and recognize that \u201cAmerica has the best cards. We are the envy of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis can be our century just like the 20th century was as long as we don\u2019t tear each other apart because our politics values sensationalism or conflict over cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get that part right, nobody can stop us.\u201d\n\nSign up for our morning news blast HERE", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Sitting down for his first interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" in eight years, President Barack Obama was not hesitant to get a dig in against the network, insisting \"Republicans have their own TV.\"", "title": "Obama takes no responsibility for angry voters: \u2018Republicans have their own TV stations\u2019", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Obama-screen-shot-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-10T13:00:47+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2016/04/10/obama-takes-no-responsibility-for-angry-voters-republicans-have-their-own-tv-station-327390", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-04-10T12:57:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-10T13:00:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know, Republicans have their own TV station.\u201d\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Wallace quipped.\nWith surprising candor, Obama said he was \u201cfrustrated about it.\u201d\u201cNumber one, we\u2019re still shell-shocked from what happened in 2007-2008.\nObama concluded on an uncharacteristically optimistic note, telling people to step back and recognize that \u201cAmerica has the best cards.\nHost Chris Wallace asked the president if he felt personally responsible for the sense of anger voters in both parties are feeling over being cut out from the decision-making process.\n\u201cThe perception is going to be changing over time as people see results, as they get more confident\u201d the president replied."}
