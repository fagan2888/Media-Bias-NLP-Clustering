(Sept. 16, 2015) \u2013 In July, Missouri Gov. Nixon signed a bill into law to help promote freedom pertaining to medical services.\n\nPassed by a wide margin in both Houses this year, House Bill 769 (HB769), sponsored by Rep. Keith Frederick, states that medical retainer agreements \u2013 in which the person pays in advance for services to be specified later \u2013 are not \u201cinsurance\u201d under the law. As a consequence, such programs are not subject to state insurance regulations.\n\nThe new law defines a medical retainer agreement as \u201ca contract between a physician and an individual patient or such individual patient\u2019s legal representative in which the physician agrees to provide certain health care services described in the agreement to the individual patient for an agreed-upon fee and period of time.\u201d\n\nThe law\u2019s text also expressly states that this agreement is \u201cnot insurance\u201d and entering into one is \u201cnot the business of insurance.\u201d Supporters say this is an important part of an overall strategy to fight back against increasing government control over health care.\n\n\u201cThis is a Missouri plan that offers quality direct primary care that is efficient, effective and affordable,\u201d Sen. Bob Onder (R-Lake St. Louis) said in a press release covered by the Missouri Times. \u201cUnlike the Obamacare plan, which is really just insurance reform not health care reform, this plan restores the power of health care decisions to you and your doctor. It\u2019s also a way to fight against increasing government control in our health care system.\u201d\n\nThe research and analysis backs up Sen. Onder\u2019s assertions. According to Michigan Capitol Confidential, medical retainer agreements helps both the physician and patients minimize costs, since there is no third party footing the bill, thus lowering the price for services. The result is cheaper basic medical services, which proponents of Obamacare promised but obviously failed to deliver. Jack Spencer writes:\n\nUnder medical retainer agreements, patients make monthly payments to a physician who in return agrees to provide a menu of routine services at no extra charge. Because no insurance company stands between patient and doctor, the hassles and expense of bureaucratic red tape are eliminated, which have resulted in dramatic cost reductions. Routine primary care services (and the bureaucracy required to reimburse them) are estimated to consume 40 cents out of every dollar spent on insurance policies, so lower premiums for a given amount of coverage are another potential benefit. \u2026\u2026Medical retainer agreements, which are also sometimes referred to as \u201cdirect primary care,\u201d \u201cconcierge medicine,\u201d \u201cfixed fee agreements,\u201d \u201cretainer medicine,\u201d \u201cmembership medicine,\u201d and \u201ccash-only practice,\u201d can vary widely in their structure, payment requirements, and form of operation. In particular, they can differ in the level of service provided and the fee charged.\n\nUnder Obamacare, regulations define such programs as a primary care service and not a health insurance plan, and current IRS policy treats these monthly fee arrangements just like another health plan.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary care option helps to transform the doctor-patient relationship in Missouri by giving consumers the option to choose more personalized care. It also gives physicians the ability to get back to the business of creating relationships and providing close personal care to their patients,\u201d Sen. Onder said in the aforementioned press release. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful Missourians will take advantage of this option.\u201d\n\nSuch direct primary care offers better incentives to lower costs compared to one paid for through an insurance plan, according to Concierge Medicine Journal (emphasis added).\n\nMost of our doctors make money by billing the insurance company for each visit. How much they charge is defined by two factors: 1. A menu of billing codes set by the American Medical Association called CPT codes and, 2. Prices negotiated with insurance companies for each CPT code (usually +/- a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement rate). CPT codes are scaled based on the complexity and severity of the patient / disease treated. Because reimbursement is only available when care is delivered, doctors have the incentive to deliver as much care as possible, and will naturally (and perhaps subconsciously) prioritize those procedures and consultations that yield the highest reimbursement rates. In short, the sicker you are, or the more frequently you need to visit, the more money the doctor makes. Contrast this with a direct primary care model, where a single fixed fee is paid per patient, regardless of how sick the patient is or how many times they will visit the doctor. Insurance reimbursement codes (and the administrative expense of administering insurance billing and coding) are not part of the equation. Under this scenario, the doctor actually makes more money when you\u2019re well than when you\u2019re sick. This introduces the incentive to deliver treatment that will have the best long-term outcome, regardless of its near term cost or whether the treatment or therapy is reimbursable by insurance.\n\nSuch a system uncontrolled by government regulations is essential in allowing individual freedom when it comes to people\u2019s medical decisions. Allowing people to contract through medical retainer agreements unfettered by insurance regulations will open the market for more people to participate. It will help set the price for services based on both demand and what people are willing, and able, to pay.\n\nIn this way, a free marketplace will help de facto nullify the federal program as much as state legislation, making it a crucial part of our strategy of defeating Obamacare. That is what HB769, now in effect, has accomplished in the state of Missouri. Now Missouri residents have to build upon this victory, and enact our comprehensive five-step plan to derail Obamacare to fully restore health care freedom in the Show Me State!\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.
