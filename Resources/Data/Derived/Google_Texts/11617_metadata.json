Who wrote them, and why? Were they really intended, as the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell claim, to make the tax subsidies in the law available only in states that established their own health insurance marketplaces, and not in the three dozen states with federal exchanges?\n\nThe answer, from interviews with more than two dozen Democrats and Republicans involved in writing the law, is that the words were a product of shifting politics and a sloppy merging of different versions. Some described the words as \u201cinadvertent,\u201d \u201cinartful\u201d or \u201ca drafting error.\u201d But none supported the contention of the plaintiffs, who are from Virginia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever recall any distinction between federal and state exchanges in terms of the availability of subsidies,\u201d said Olympia J. Snowe, a former Republican senator from Maine who helped write the Finance Committee version of the bill.\n\n\u201cIt was never part of our conversations at any point,\u201d said Ms. Snowe, who voted against the final version of the Senate bill. \u201cWhy would we have wanted to deny people subsidies? It was not their fault if their state did not set up an exchange.\u201d The four words, she said, were perhaps \u201cinadvertent language,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to explain it.\u201d\n\nFormer Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, said there may have been \u201csome sloppiness in the drafting\u201d of the bill. Mr. Bingaman, who was a member of both committees that developed the measure, said he was surprised that the lawsuit had reached the Supreme Court because the words in dispute appeared to be a \u201cdrafting error.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, it escaped everyone\u2019s attention, or it would have been deleted, because it clearly contradicted the main purpose of the legislation,\u201d Mr. Bingaman said. He added, \u201cIn all the discussion in the committees and on the floor, I didn\u2019t ever hear anybody suggest that this kind of distinction between federal and state exchanges was in the bill.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the Supreme Court offers its judgment, it could affect more than 7.5 million people now receiving subsidies through the federal exchange and a health care industry that accounts for 17 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the law allows subsidies only where marketplaces have been \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d It is a distinction that those who drafted the law say they did not intend to make.\n\nThe story of the four words has its loose origins in Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign pledge in 2008 to overhaul the health insurance system, something presidents had tried to do for decades.\n\nAfter he offered broad guidance on what the plan should include, two Senate panels \u2014 the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee \u2014 began working on the legislation in summer 2009. Staff members began reconciling many complex and competing imperatives.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe idea of denying subsidies to people who bought insurance through the federal exchange \u201cwas never discussed,\u201d said Charles M. Clapton, a lawyer who worked on both committees for Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming. Mr. Clapton said he had difficulty accepting the argument advanced by the plaintiffs because it was \u201cso contrary to the intent\u201d of those who had written the legislation.\n\nAt the Finance Committee, which thrashed out its version of the bill in September and October 2009, senators initially assumed that all states would set up exchanges, so they added a section to the Internal Revenue Code to provide subsidies, in the form of tax credits, for insurance purchased through an exchange.\n\nBut senators and staff lawyers came to believe that some states \u2014 \u201cfive or 10 at the most\u201d \u2014 would choose not to set up exchanges, said Christopher E. Condeluci, who was a staff lawyer for Republicans on the Finance Committee.\n\nAt that point, senators authorized a backup plan to allow the federal government to establish an exchange in any state that did not have its own, but they failed to include that language in the section of the tax code providing subsidies. \u201cWe failed to include a cross-reference to the federal exchange,\u201d Mr. Condeluci said. \u201cIn my opinion, due to a drafting error, we overlooked it. It was an oversight. Congress, in my experience, always intended for the federal exchange to deliver subsidies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRuss Sullivan, the staff director for Democrats on the Finance Committee, gave a similar account. The language in the law providing tax credits through state exchanges was \u201ca holdover from what we had in the Finance Committee,\u201d which originally assumed that \u201cevery state was going to set up an exchange,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nThe idea of a federal backstop came later, he said, when people started asking what would happen if some states did not set up an exchange.\n\nVideo\n\nConsistent with its usual practice, the Finance Committee voted on a detailed conceptual description of the bill. The actual legislative language was not available at the time of that vote.", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "King v.
