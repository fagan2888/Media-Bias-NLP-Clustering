LEEDS, England (AP) — The 198 competitors in the 101st Tour de France have started their grueling three-week ride through four countries before ending the world’s greatest cycling race in Paris on July 27.

Saturday’s 190.5-kilometer (118.4-mile) Stage 1 takes the pack on a rolling loop along the bucolic English countryside from Leeds to Harrogate — a layout that could be tailormade for a sprinter to win.

Many enthusiastic Union Jack-waving fans on the course are hoping that Britain’s Mark Cavendish, one of the world’s great sprinters, will win this first of three tour legs in England before the race enters France. It would be Cavendish’s first ever yellow jersey.
