(AP) \u2014 Come February, the owners of Farmstead Flowers begin nurturing seedlings and preparing three acres for their cash crop reaped from April through October \u2014 cut flowers.\n\nMegan Hird and her husband founded their rural southeast Nebraska business in 2012 and are among the growing number of \u201cfarmer florists\u201d intent on providing consumers the option to buy local \u2014 much as the slow food movement has sought to increase the use of locally grown, sustainable food.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the cut flowers used in florists\u2019 bouquets are imported, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says. But flower industry experts anticipate that heading into Valentine\u2019s Day, more people will eschew bouquets of imports for American blooms.\n\nThere\u2019s been a recent \u2014 if small \u2014 rebound in the number cut-flower growers in the U.S., from 5,085 in 2007 to 5,903 in 2012. The Association of Specialty Cut Flower Growers recently reported an all-time high of 700 members, the majority of which are based in the U.S.\n\nThe shift is two-fold, according to Debra Prinzing, a Seattle-based outdoor living expert who operates Slow Flowers, an online directory of florists, wedding and event planners and growers who use stateside flowers.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of it is just this rejection of the more structural bouquets \u2014 the flowers that are the Dirty Dozen, the same-old, same-old,\u201d Prinzing said. \u201cThe romance of a meadow or a cottage-garden flower or an heirloom flower is really penetrating the consciousness of floral designers.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a rising consciousness about the carbon footprint caused by the distance from which flowers are shipped, \u201cjust the same as it is with food,\u201d she said. Critics of the flowers grown in South America and other places say those countries often don\u2019t employ fair labor practices and that the flowers are often coated with chemicals to preserve them for a long journey.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Association of Floral Importers of Florida \u2014 based in Miami, where more than 90 percent of imported flowers enter the country \u2014 said they\u2019re using outdated information. While Colombia and Ecuador\u2019s industries had questionable labor practices and used pesticide years ago, Christine Boldt said, those are now heavily regulated and have minimum wage requirements and bans on certain chemicals.\n\nSouth America is the most hospitable environment for flowers to grow year round, Boldt said, which also makes them cheaper. But American-based growers counter that you get what you pay for.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 movement pushes local, US-grown cut flowers", "title": "\u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 movement pushes local, US-grown cut flowers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 movement pushes local, US-grown cut flowers", "title": "\u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 movement pushes local, US-grown cut flowers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/07/slow_flowers_movement_pushes_local_us_grown_cut_flowers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/food-and-farm-farmer-florists.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 movement pushes local, US-grown cut flowers", "title": "\u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 movement pushes local, US-grown cut flowers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/food-and-farm-farmer-florists.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Margery A.
