Under the Affordable Care Act, states are eligible for federal money to pay for expanding access to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. Herbert\u2019s spent more than a year pushing Utah\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature to accept the cash, but he\u2019s run into resistance from conservatives opposed to Obamacare. Lately he\u2019s gotten help making his case from an interest group not known for its liberal inclinations: cops.\n\nPolice chiefs and sheriffs who run local jails in states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid are coming out in favor of Obamacare on the grounds that it could help drug addicts and people with mental illness get help before they commit crimes. Thirty states have increased access to Medicaid. Broadening eligibility could extend coverage to about 3.7 million people in 20 states, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That includes 30,000 in Utah, about 1 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nJim Winder, the elected sheriff of Salt Lake County, says 15 percent to 18 percent of the 40,000 people booked each year into the county jail\u2014Utah\u2019s largest\u2014are severely mentally ill, about the same as the national rate. He spends $3 million to $5 million a year on psychotropic medication, out of a budget just shy of $90 million. Even if inmates have private insurance, the jail picks up the tab for them while they\u2019re locked up. It often takes days or weeks to stabilize them, and many are arrested again soon after release. \u201cI\u2019ve got people who we\u2019re booking 150 times a year,\u201d says Winder, a Democrat serving his third term. \u201cIf people think for a moment we\u2019re not paying for this, they are sadly mistaken.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s eyes glaze over, and they just say one word: Obamacare.\u201d Salt Lake County Sheriff Winder\n\nIn March, Utah\u2019s legislature passed a justice reform bill lowering the penalties for drug possession. The law contains provisions for putting addicts in treatment rather than in jail. Law enforcement leaders say that\u2019s a step in the right direction but worry that without additional funding\u2014whether from federal Obamacare funds or some other source\u2014there won\u2019t be enough space in rehab programs to accommodate the increased demand. \u201cAt the end of the day we will just have more crimes committed by people who are trying to fund their drug habits,\u201d says Chief Tom Ross of the Bountiful (Utah) police department, who hasn\u2019t taken a position on Medicaid expansion. He\u2019s president of the Utah Chiefs of Police Association, which has also stayed neutral on the Medicaid issue.\n\nMore than 350,000 people with serious mental illness are incarcerated, or about 16 percent of America\u2019s 2.1 million inmates, according to research by the Treatment Advocacy Center. The group estimates that more than half of those shot and killed by police each year are mentally ill.\n\nGabriel Morgan, the sheriff of Newport News, Va., says improving mental health care became a priority for him after a deputy was assaulted by an unstable inmate in 2007. The deputy lost an eye and wound up with five titanium plates in his face. The department frequently responds to mental health crises, including some people who aren\u2019t accused of crimes. In a recent week, Morgan says, officers took custody of 14 people who had to be involuntarily committed, in a city of 188,000. Morgan supported Virginia Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid, which Republicans scuttled earlier this year. \u201cWe are arresting too many people who would never have committed a crime if they had gotten help,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThe question is, do we go upstream? Or do we go downstream and wait for the bodies to come down?\u201d\n\nSalt Lake County Sheriff Winder says lawmakers he talks to in Utah appreciate the adverse social effects of making it difficult for the poor and indigent to get medical care, but that doesn\u2019t stop partisanship from getting in the way. \u201cPeople\u2019s eyes glaze over, and they just say one word: Obamacare,\u201d says Winder. \u201cAfter that, you may as well be talking to a pig about Christmas. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Some cops support expanding Medicaid to cut crime by increasing access to mental health care and addiction treatment.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Tozzi", "description": "Police and jail chiefs say expanding health coverage can reduce crime.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ij6CNBfs1HWE/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Police and jail chiefs say expanding health coverage can reduce crime.", "title": "Obamacare's Unlikely Supporters: Utah Cops", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-05/obamacare-s-unlikely-supporters-utah-cops", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ij6CNBfs1HWE/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police and jail chiefs say expanding health coverage can reduce crime.", "title": "Obamacare's Unlikely Supporters: Utah Cops", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-05/obamacare-s-unlikely-supporters-utah-cops", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ij6CNBfs1HWE/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Police and jail chiefs say expanding health coverage can reduce crime."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Obamacare's Unlikely Supporters: Utah Cops", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NPGU7S6KLVR401", "parsely-author": "John Tozzi", "date": "2015-06-05T09:55:04.744Z", "keywords": "Health,Utah,Health Insurance", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Health,Utah,Health Insurance", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-05T09:55:04.744Z", "parsely-tags": "Health,Utah,Health Insurance,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-05/obamacare-s-unlikely-supporters-utah-cops"}, "article_summary": "Lately he\u2019s gotten help making his case from an interest group not known for its liberal inclinations: cops.\nHe spends $3 million to $5 million a year on psychotropic medication, out of a budget just shy of $90 million.\nHe\u2019s president of the Utah Chiefs of Police Association, which has also stayed neutral on the Medicaid issue.\n\u201cWe are arresting too many people who would never have committed a crime if they had gotten help,\u201d says Morgan.\nIt\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201dThe bottom line: Some cops support expanding Medicaid to cut crime by increasing access to mental health care and addiction treatment."}
