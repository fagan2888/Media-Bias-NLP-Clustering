Money has so perverted our electoral system that, according to Princeton University, we now live not in a democracy, but in an oligarchy. Republican senators, poisoned by partisan spleen, dispatch an unsolicited letter to the leaders of Iran and treasonously subvert President Obama\u2019s bona fide negotiations to thwart the possibility of that country\u2019s developing nuclear weapons. Islamist terrorists slaughter innocent cartoonists in the heart of Western Europe. Drug-resistant microbes threaten to leave us without effective antibiotics, and a once-rare hemorrhagic fever devastates entire swaths of West Africa. Climate change poses dangers to humanity\u2019s future so grave that it worries the Pentagon and the European Union.\n\nAnyone can browse the headlines and add even more troubles to the list. All these problems speak to the sad reversibility of hard-won progress, to our shattered political systems, to our vulnerability as a species before the caprices of nature, and, let\u2019s face it, to the rank selfishness and out-and-out stupidity of our fellows. We already know how to deal with at least some of the above woes, but for a host of reasons, we find ourselves paralyzed, unable to do anything much but watch them worsen.\n\nThere are also less momentous concerns \u2014 societal ills in America, to be specific \u2013 to worry about, and these especially bother the New York Times columnist David Brooks. In a recent Op-Ed, \u201cThe Cost of Relativism,\u201d he proposes a remedy. But he plays coy and does not tell you straight out what it is. So I will.\n\nBrooks starts his column by decrying what he sees as our banes \u2014 single motherhood, slack parenting, a fall in church attendance, what once was called \u201cjuvenile delinquency,\u201d and even clubbing and sex, all of which lead, as he puts it, to an \u201canarchy of intimate life\u201d and \u201cfamily breakdown.\u201d A book by Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, \u201cOur Kids,\u201d arms him with the stats and anecdotes he needs to arrive at this judgment:\n\n\u201cThe health of society is primarily determined by the habits and virtues of its citizens. In many parts of America there are no minimally agreed upon standards for what it means to be a father. There are no basic codes and rules woven into daily life, which people can absorb unconsciously and follow automatically.\u201d\n\nTo set things right, Brooks proposes \u201creintroducing norms\u201d \u2013 a task that will \u201crequire, first, a moral vocabulary.\u201d Says he, a \u201cplague of nonjudgmentalism\u201d destroyed these norms, which \u201cneed repair up and down the scale, universally, together and all at once.\u201d To accomplish this, we need, it follows, judgmentalism, a \u201cholding everybody responsible.\u201d We also need to be more \u201cmorally articulate,\u201d and devise \u201cclearer definitions of how we should be behaving at all levels.\u201d\n\nSuch rectitudinous generalizations hardly warrant a response, but those familiar with Brooks\u2019 work understand what the provenance of the aforementioned morality is likely to be, and that does deserve rebuttal. He hints at it, reminding us of times of \u201cmoral revival\u201d when \u201cbehavior was tightened and norms reasserted.\u201d He has in mind, he says, \u201cEngland in the 1830s and . . . the U.S. amid economic stress in the 1930s.\u201d He suggests we engage in an \u201corganic communal effort, with voices from everywhere saying gently: This we praise. This we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhat in those two disparate, long-ago decades is to be emulated Brooks doesn\u2019t say. But let\u2019s think a bit. In the United States, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 brought to a quasi-apocalyptic close the famously fun, culturally effervescent rip-Roaring Twenties. I know of no \u201crevival\u201d in the decade that came afterward, nor do I see any moral tutelage Brooks would wish us to extract from one of the bleakest, most hardscrabble times in our history. Moreover, the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 constituted a triumph of rationalism and realism over the faith-besotted killjoys who helped get the restrictions on tipple passed into law 13 years earlier. Hardly \u201cBrooksian,\u201d that.\n\nBut what of \u201cEngland in the 1830s\u201d? The badass sensualist poet Lord Byron and his fellow atheist versifier Percy Bysshe Shelley had just tragically departed this world for the Eternal Void. The novelists Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bront\u00eb were coming of age, and would produce such wonders as \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d and \u201cThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall.\u201d Samuel Butler, author of \u201cThe Way of All Flesh\u201d (a moving, must-read semi-autobiographical account of a journey from religious belief to atheism), was born.\n\nNone of this sounds very Brooksian either. But what must have been Brooks\u2019 moment came in 1837, when a certain queen ascended the throne \u2013 a stern, pudgy, bedizened sourpuss by the name of Victoria, the standard-bearer, of course, of Victorian morality. Just Brooks\u2019 kind of queen, we might think, though the discovery of her private passion for drawings of naked men eventually revealed her to be less of a wet blanket than was commonly understood.\n\nIn any case, Queen Victoria\u2019s was a faith-infused epoch of flaunted piety and secret vice, and it would last 73 long, dreary years. The Anglican Church set moral standards for the time, yet as might be expected under the stifling atmosphere religion fosters, prostitution flourished. Victorians, especially upper-class ones, felt such shame at their bodies that during beach vacations they entered the sea in clunky \u201cbathing machines\u201d; homosexuality was a capital offense; and extramarital sex and masturbation were so frowned upon that widows turned to the family doctor for \u201cpelvic\u201d (that is, clitoral) \u201cmassages\u201d in order to relieve themselves of their \u201chysteria.\u201d (The invention of the vibrator toward the end of Victoria\u2019s term in office greatly reduced the time necessary for such \u201ctreatment.\u201d) And of course children toiled away in Dickensian poverty, prey to beatings and other abuse by their factory bosses.\n\nThe only bright spot \u2013 and it was a considerable one \u2013 came in 1859, when Darwin\u2019s \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d hit the bookstands and accelerated humanity\u2019s journey away from the practice of sacred superstitions and belief in magic books toward truth and science, progress and light.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYT columnist urges us all to the pews, but the Bible can not help us live", "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYT columnist urges us all to the pews, but the Bible can not help us live", "title": "David Brooks just makes God up: More horse-and-buggy priggishness from deeply unserious NYT writer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/david_brooks_just_makes_god_up_more_horse_and_buggy_priggishness_from_deeply_unserious_nyt_writer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/david_brooks_church.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYT columnist urges us all to the pews, but the Bible can not help us live", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/david_brooks_church.jpg", "title": "David Brooks just makes God up: More horse-and-buggy priggishness from deeply unserious NYT writer", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "David Brooks just makes God up: More horse-and-buggy priggishness from deeply unserious NYT writer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, David Brooks, Editor's Picks, Media crticism, New York Times, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14f8\"", "article_summary": "In any case, Queen Victoria\u2019s was a faith-infused epoch of flaunted piety and secret vice, and it would last 73 long, dreary years.\nThere are also less momentous concerns \u2014 societal ills in America, to be specific \u2013 to worry about, and these especially bother the New York Times columnist David Brooks.\nTopics: David Brooks, Editor's Picks, Media crticism, New York Times, Religion, Life News, NewsWe are, it is generally recognized, suffering through an era of crises \u2013 political, civilizational, biological and environmental.\nDrug-resistant microbes threaten to leave us without effective antibiotics, and a once-rare hemorrhagic fever devastates entire swaths of West Africa.\nClimate change poses dangers to humanity\u2019s future so grave that it worries the Pentagon and the European Union."}
