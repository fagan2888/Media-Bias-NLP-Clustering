Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required.\n\n\"Religious employers\" are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals don\u2019t qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs.\n\nIn an interview with David Gregory on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills.\n\nAt the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration it\u2019s been battling.\n\n\"We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care,\" Dolan said. \"We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay?\"\n\nWe wondered whether the bishops\u2019 support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century.\n\nExperts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care.\n\nDuring the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan , published the Bishops\u2019 Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice . Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance , his spokesman said.\n\n\"The state,\" the guide read, \"should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age.\"\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clinton\u2019s ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993.\n\n\"The flap is over the (contraception) issue,\" said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. \"That\u2019s where it comes to appear that they\u2019re against universal health care.\"\n\nMazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. He\u2019s correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.
