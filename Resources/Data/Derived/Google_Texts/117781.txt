For the first time ever, we have video of a meteorite in “dark flight,” the period after a burning meteor passes through the Earth’s atmosphere, stops emitting light, and falls straight to the ground at terminal velocity (200 to 400 miles per hour).

You can find plenty of videos showing meteor fireballs blasting through the sky. For example, check out this particularly impressive meteor that lit up the sky over Russia in 2013:

Whatever meteor fragments survive that craziness fall to Earth in much less dramatic fashion. But we’ve never seen it happen, until now.

That’s why it was a huge deal when a small stone hurtled past Norwegian skydiver, Anders Helstrup, shortly after he pulled his parachute during a wingsuit jump in the summer of 2012.

Helstrup didn’t realize in-flight that he’d just been buzzed by a meteorite, but he sensed that something was up.

“I got the feeling that there was something, but I didn’t register what was happening,” he told the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), which broke the story.
