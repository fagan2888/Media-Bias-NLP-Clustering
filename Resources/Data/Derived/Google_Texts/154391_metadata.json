It bucked a difficult stretch for IPOs, which are trading down about 5 percent for the year.\n\nInvestors wary of Square's valuation likely waited until the shares landed on the public market to buy, analysts said, and the weak price set on Wednesday created a pile-on Thursday morning that drove the stock higher.\n\n\"The IPO buyers have very healthy skepticism about unicorn valuations,\" said Chris Bulger, managing director of Bulger Partners, a tech advisory firm in Boston.\n\nDespite Square's 42 percent valuation drop from its last private financing round, most backers scored a payday. Investors who bought shares a year ago were protected by a 'ratchet', ensuring they would get a 20 percent return, and some early-stage investors bought Square at less than a dollar a share.\n\n\u201cIt's still a good game,\" Bulger said. \"Just in the last two rounds you're not getting venture capital-like returns for the risk you are taking.\"\n\nSquare's strong start was followed by a positive debut by online dating empire Match Group Inc, whose shares finished the day up nearly 23 percent.\n\nTom Donino, co-head of trading at FNY Capital Management, said it is unusual to see a stock trade up so much after pricing below the expected range, as Square's did.\n\n\"There's obviously retail and other demand for the stock, but the pricing seems strange,\" he said. \u201cThe fact the stock is now this strong will probably quash\" the bearish sentiment around private-company valuations, he added.\n\nSquare raised $243 million in its IPO, money the company needs to cover heavy losses. It reported a loss of $131.5 million in the first nine months of the year after losing $117 million in the same period a year earlier, though revenue rose 49 percent to $892.8 million.\n\nThe debut comes at a time when slowing global growth and uncertainty about the timing of a U.S. interest rate hike have kept investors on edge.\n\nKen Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities, said he thought the low price of the offering, which cleared the way for the first-day pop, was a smart move in the current market environment.\n\n\u201cThose particular types of companies - these unicorns that have these crazy valuations - you are going to see some of them become more conservative in their pricing because it makes sense. What they don\u2019t want to do is damage themselves by trying to be so super-aggressive.\"\n\nDORSEY IN THE SPOTLIGHT\n\nDorsey, who was celebrating his 39th birthday on Thursday, owns 21.5 percent of Square following the IPO and is the company's biggest single shareholder, with a stake now worth almost $930 million.\n\nThe high-flying executive is also trying to run Twitter, another company with substantial obstacles to growing profits. Shareholders in both companies have been concerned about Dorsey's dual role.\n\nSquare's IPO filings show a net loss of $29.6 million in the second quarter, ballooning to nearly $54 million in the third quarter.\n\n\"Square's financials leave much to be desired,\" said Brian Hamilton, chairman of data firm Sageworks. \"But there's still a lot to like here.\"\n\nSquare Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in an interview with Reuters that the company has been investing heavily in new hardware, such as chip-enabled card readers, and building out its lending business, Square Capital.\n\n\u201cThe slope of the line is up and to the right in terms of our operating margin,\" she said. \"So we are going to grow but we are going to do it in a disciplined way.\u201d\n\nFriar pointed to the consumer trend of shopping less with cash.\n\n\u201cStill, 40 percent of all commerce is done with cash and check, but slowly that\u2019s eroding. So that\u2019s one big reason for the growth,\u201d she said.\n\nSquare, founded in 2009, has built buzz and a substantial customer base with a credit card reader that can turn a mobile device into a payment terminal. It has made its mission to enable any small business to easily accept any form of payment, and also provide them with additional services ranging from lending to payroll management.\n\nBut the company faces intense competition in the payments market, with Apple Inc launching its Apple Pay service, Amazon.com Inc exploring in-store payments, and startups such as Stripe Inc entering the fray. Meanwhile big banks and card processors continue to dominate the payment business, and Square has to pay out most of its gross revenues to banks and credit card networks.\n\nSquare sold 25.7 million class A common shares in the offering, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. Start Small Foundation, a charitable fund created by Dorsey, sold about 1.35 million shares. The low offering price triggered a 'ratchet' in which late-stage investors get an addition share distribution.\n\n(Reporting by Rachel Chitra in Bangalore and Heather Somerville in San Francisco; Writing by Jonathan Weber and Stephen R.
