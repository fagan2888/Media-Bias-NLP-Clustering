As Jon Stewart’s tenure as the host of The Daily Show draws to a close, dignitaries, stars, and monarchs are angling for an opportunity to bid farewell to the departing late night ruler. One head of state who has made the cut is President Obama.

The commander in chief will make his seventh appearance on the Comedy Central talk show on Tuesday the 21st, two weeks ahead of Stewart’s final broadcast on August 6, Comedy Central announced Friday. Obama is getting to be an old hand at the late-night goodbye. He was one of David Letterman’s final guests on the Late Show in May, and helped send off The Colbert Report in December, even stepping behind Stephen Colbert’s desk for a special edition of the show’s “The Word,” all about Obamacare.

Obama has appeared on The Daily Show twice as president and four times as a presidential candidate and U.S. senator. Back in 2010, he became the first-ever sitting president to visit the show.

On Obama’s most recent visit to The Daily Show, on Oct. 18, 2012, the president was in the middle of his re-election campaign and Stewart grilled him about his debate performance against then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. (If you have blocked out the 2012 election in response to the specter of the 2016 election, Obama had a self-professed “off night” during one of his debates against Romney. Don’t worry, he still won the presidency.)

As for what lies in store for Obama’s third appearance since taking office, Obama could try to sell The Daily Show audience on his Iran deal, talk federal penitentiaries, have a Donald Trump singalong, or simply bid a fond farewell from one boss to another.

Trevor Noah will officially take over as The Daily Show host on Sept. 28.
