The Climate Depot website obtained the latest satellite measurements and found the Earth\u2019s thermostat hasn\u2019t budged since September 1996.\n\nThat\u2019s 210 straight months without any trend of the planet growing hotter, or colder, by even a tenth of a degree. This ought to be good news for buyers of a Toyota Prius or carbon-dioxide offsets. They could imagine themselves as having saved the world. But they\u2019re more depressed than ever.\n\nMatthew Ranson, an economist, describes in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management the chaos that he thinks awaits. \u201cBetween 2010 and 2099,\u201d he writes in the peer-reviewed journal, \u201cclimate change will cause an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 cases of rape, 1.2 million aggravated assaults, 2.3 million simple assaults, 260,000 robberies, 1.3 million burglaries, 2.2 million cases of larceny, and 580,000 cases of vehicle theft in the United States.\u201d No estimates of mopery or pillaging.\n\nMr. Ranson said he examined the effect that temperature has on crime rates, based on FBI records. The numbers recognize the obvious criminal preference to rob and pillage in balmy conditions; a blizzard is bad for everybody\u2019s business.\n\nHe speculates that a great crime wave would follow the heat wave predicted by computer models of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe U.N. panel is raising its rhetoric, too. London\u2019s daily Independent reports that the panel predicts crop yields will fall by 2 percent every decade, leading to malnutrition and starvation. There will be floods, fires, civil war, hay fever, heat waves, boils, various itches, pestilence and plagues on mankind.\n\nThe net cost to the world\u2019s economy could be as much as $1.4 trillion a year, disaster on the scale of Obamacare.\n\nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, researchers at the University of Maryland insist that global warming will destroy civilization. A forthcoming journal article asserts that expanding population and the difference in wealth between the rich (\u201cthe elites\u201d) and the poor (\u201ccommoners\u201d) will bring down the United States in the way the barbarians brought down the Roman Empire.\n\nThere\u2019s a solution, of course. Higher taxes, increased regulation and more government supervision of everyone\u2019s lives, and other liberal nostrums.\n\nIn an earlier presentation on \u201cPopulation and Climate Change,\u201d the Maryland researchers find hope. \u201cIn order to avoid collapse, government policies are needed to stabilize population and stabilize industrial production per person.\u201d\n\nA powerful centralized government must take over the means of production and even reproduction. \u201cFamily planning is cost-effective,\u201d they write, \u201cand should be a primary method to reduce [carbon-dioxide] emissions.\u201d\n\nSacrificing babies to the ancient gods of Carthage didn\u2019t save that ancient empire, and abortion won\u2019t chill the climate today. The public is tuning out the likes of Al Gore and his prophecies because they notice that two decades of hysterical predictions haven\u2019t come true.\n\nIn a climate of skepticism, the only way for scientists with a scam to get attention (and government grants) is to concoct ever more over-the-top claims.\n\nIf driving a Chevy Volt will reduce incidents of rape or a curlicue light bulb will rescue Western civilization, a finding that Earth\u2019s temperature hasn\u2019t budged in 210 months should be something to celebrate. It means the planet is doing just fine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The world isn't warming.
