Home of beaches, mountains and an extremely homophobic governor,\u201d the fake ad begins. \u201cNow you can experience the beautiful outdoor cityscapes and incredible ignorance by hang-gliding backwards in time, racing to the wrong side of history in a kayak, teaching your children to judge others while frolicking in the waves, and enjoying our waterfalls without fear of gay people falling on you.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Gov. Pat McCrory signed the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (HB 2) into law on Wednesday, making it illegal for local municipalities in the state to pass their own non-discrimination bills, and mandates that people must use public bathrooms that correspond with their \u201cbiological sex\u201d and not the gender with which they identify. Critics have called the bill \u201canti-gay\u201d and \u201canti-trans,\u201d and several major corporations have threatened the state with an economic boycott in response.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re grossed out when same-sex couples order wedding cakes, or if you\u2019re obsessed with who is in what bathroom, or if you think religious liberty laws only apply to your religion, North Carolina is for you,\u201d the fake ad continued. \u201cWe\u2019re resisting social progress rather than helping people in need. Because North Carolina stands for\u2026 Nobody Cares.\u201d\n\nFunny or Die released a similar \u201canti-gay tourism commercial\u201d for Indiana last year after Gov. Mike Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last March.\n\nThe comedy website, founded by liberal filmmakers Adam McKay and Will Ferrell in 2007, has long served as both a liberal creative tastemaker and as a functioning outreach vehicle for progressive, Democratic policies. The site\u2019s popular \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d series memorably invited President Obama to plug the then-new Affordable Care Act in 2014, and the site has taken aim at conservatives repeatedly over the years with skits like \u201cProp 8: The Musical\u201d and \u201cGays Beware.\u201d\n\nJust last month, the site released a 50-minute \u201clong-lost made-for-TV\u201d film based on GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s The Art of the Deal, with Johnny Depp playing Trump.\n\nIn April 2015, Funny or Die opened an office in Washington, D.C. and announced that Brad Jenkins, the former associate director of the White House Office of Public Engagement in the Obama administration, would serve as its managing director. In February, the comedy website hired former senior Obama speechwriter David Litt to be its head writer in D.C.\n\nThe backlash over North Carolina\u2019s religious freedom bill mirrors a similar battle waging in Georgia over the state\u2019s Free Exercise Protection Act, which critics have also called an \u201canti-gay,\u201d discriminatory law. Major corporations, film and television studios and the NFL have all threatened an economic boycott of the state if Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal does not veto the bill before the May 3 deadline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Funny or Die Mocks North Carolina Religious Freedom Law with Fake 'Anti-Gay Tourism Commercial'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Funny or Die Mocks North Carolina Religious Freedom Law with Fake 'Anti-Gay Tourism Commercial'", "title": "Funny or Die Mocks North Carolina Religious Freedom Law with Fake 'Anti-Gay Tourism Commercial' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 641, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/nc-nobodycares.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/03/25/funny-or-die-mocks-north-carolina-religious-freedom-law-with-fake-anti-gay-tourism-commercial/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Funny or Die Mocks North Carolina Religious Freedom Law with Fake 'Anti-Gay Tourism Commercial'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/nc-nobodycares.jpg", "title": "Funny or Die Mocks North Carolina Religious Freedom Law with Fake 'Anti-Gay Tourism Commercial' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Adam McKay, anti-gay, Anti-Trans, Funny or Die, Georgia, North Carolina, Religious freedom, The Art of the Deal, Will Ferrell,Big Hollywood, Faith,funny or die", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Will Ferrell", "published_time": "2016-03-25T17:22:28-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Because North Carolina stands for\u2026 Nobody Cares.\u201dFunny or Die released a similar \u201canti-gay tourism commercial\u201d for Indiana last year after Gov.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cAh, North Carolina.\nMike Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last March.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERComedy website and cultural arm of the Democratic Party Funny or Die released a new sketch Thursday skewering North Carolina\u2019s recent passage of a religious freedom law with a fake tourism commercial highlighting what critics call the law\u2019s \u201canti-gay\u201d bias.\nThe backlash over North Carolina\u2019s religious freedom bill mirrors a similar battle waging in Georgia over the state\u2019s Free Exercise Protection Act, which critics have also called an \u201canti-gay,\u201d discriminatory law."}
