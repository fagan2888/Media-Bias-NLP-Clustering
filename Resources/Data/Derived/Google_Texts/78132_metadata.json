Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah may be dead in the Utah House, but now there\u2019s a new compromise in the works.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan told a gaggle of journalists Friday afternoon that he has a plan \u201cthat will work\u201d while, for just two years, cover 60,000 Utahns who are \u201cin the gap\u201d for around $65 million in total dollars.\n\nDunnigan, R-Taylorsville, didn\u2019t really want to talk about it, as he still has to have more discussions with GOP senators, Herbert, and his own caucus.\n\nStill, pressed by reporters, he gave up a bit:\n\n-- The neediest of Utahns, those that are between 0 percent and 100 percent of the federal poverty line, would get coverage for the next two years.\n\n-- Come January 2017, when a new U.S. president takes office \u2013 whether a Democrat or Republican \u2013 Utah would push hard (and perhaps with other states onboard) to get the 90 percent federal dollars for Medicaid expansion as ordered by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nThe Obama administration has been dead-set against allowing any state which stays at 100 percent of poverty or below to get that 90 percent federal match.\n\nFederal Health and Human Services officials say if a state stays under 100 percent of poverty, they get only a 70 percent federal match \u2013 and have to pick up 30 percent with state dollars.\n\nHerbert\u2019s Healthy Utah goes up to 138 percent \u2013 where Obamacare wants Medicaid expansion to be.\n\nSo, Healthy Utah covers more people and costs less than any plan under 100 percent of poverty \u2013 something the governor has been arguing for, and something that has forced any House GOP plan UNDER 100 percent to bear more state dollars.\n\nBut Dunnigan, who has worked on this issue for years, said his compromise will cost less than Healthy Utah and \u2013 with a reasonable new federal administration \u2013 will provide a pathway to help Utah\u2019s poorest, sickest Utahns while remaining \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been the key word for House Republicans \u2013 \u201csustainable\u201d -- they don\u2019t want the federal match to drop, don\u2019t want to see the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion costs to skyrocket.\n\nThat, House Speaker Greg Hughes reiterated Friday afternoon, is just unacceptable, and would be irresponsible to treat all Utahns to that result.\n\nThe Senate this past week passed SB164, Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan.\n\nBut the GOP House caucus, says Hughes, doesn\u2019t even come close to having the 38 votes needed to pass it.\n\nSo Hughes has said SB164, or Healthy Utah, won\u2019t come out of the House Rules Committee, and won\u2019t be heard \u2013 mainly because it would be a waste of valuable, and limited, time.\n\nHughes has been taking a lot of public and private political heat for that decision.\n\nBut now Dunnigan says there may be a compromise House Republicans may accept \u2013 although that is yet to be decided within the 63-member caucus.\n\nHis idea \u201cwould fund all the people in the gap\u201d \u2013 the 0 percent to 100 percent of poverty who don\u2019t have health insurance or Medicaid now.\n\n\u201cIt would be sustainable\u201d at $65 million in total cost over the next two years, he added.\n\nThen, in January 2017 Utah can go to the new president and ask to allow the state to have 90 percent of the federal match.\n\n\u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d he added.\n\nEven if the new president would agree, then Dunnigan\u2019s plan would still be controllable \u2013 either by placing a cap on the financial cost, capping the number of people on the plan, or a combination of both.\n\nOr, a future Legislature could decide to put more money in the that plan to fully, or partly, let the program costs and the number of recipients grow.\n\nIn the meantime, said Dunnigan, Utah would be helping the poorer, sicker among us, \u201cand solve a problem\u201d forced on Utah and other states with the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nMore details of his compromise will come early next week, Dunnigan said.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
