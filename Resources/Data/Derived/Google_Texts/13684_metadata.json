Check out the agency\u2019s tweet in all its wintry glory below.\n\nThe card in question offers up some useful information to those who may have trouble dealing with this winter\u2019s potentially dangerous weather. In addition to asking people to limit travel during periods of heavy snowfall, the CDC reminds folks to keep their cars filled with gas over the next few months.\n\nThe Game of Thrones eCard also advises folks to put together a \u201cFamily Communication Plan\u201d should things get crazy this winter. The CDC also suggests keeping a stockpile of food, water, and blankets in case heavy snowfall prevents people from venturing outdoors. Snow shovels and properly maintained heating equipment are also recommended.\n\nIf blankets of ice and mountains of snow prevent people from heading outside this winter, the folks over at HBO are probably hoping they don\u2019t spend their free time downloading countless Game of Thrones episodes from torrent sites. The series was once again the most popular TV show with pirates over the course of 2013.\n\nAccording to TorrentFreak, the Game of Thrones season three finale was reportedly snatched around 5.9 million times since arriving online. However, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes seems to think all of these downloads are more of a compliment than anything else.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with this for 20, 30 years\u2014people sharing subs, running wires down the backs of apartment buildings. Our experience is that it leads to more paying subs. I think you\u2019re right that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s better than an Emmy,\u201d Bewkes explained.\n\nCheck out the CDC\u2019s recent eCard tweet below.\n\n\n\nShare our @GameOfThrones eCards to help protect the realm from #winter weather.
