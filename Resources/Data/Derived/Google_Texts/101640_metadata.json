Other companies must provide contraception to women free of charge under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGreg Baylor, a lawyer for Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma, told The AP that, \"It is morally problematic\" to sign the forms that pass the responsibility for prescribing the contraceptives along to another entity.\n\n\"There are plenty of other ways the government could put (emergency contraception) in the hands of the people without us,\" Baylor said.\n\nPlaintiffs bringing suit include a group of Catholic nuns from Colorado and four Christian colleges in Oklahoma, according to a Colorado Public Radio story.\n\nAccording to the AP story, Judge Bobby Baldock asked why the exemption process burdens religious groups when the form essentially tells the government, \"You can go pound sand because we don't condone it, we don't agree with it.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Debbie M.
