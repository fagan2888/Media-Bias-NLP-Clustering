John Mica is one, indeed, at least when it comes to Amtrak.\n\nThe Florida Republican\u2019s self-description last week reminded me of how politicians here have passions that are often out of sync with the media pack.\n\nThe press tends to focus on what\u2019s politically hot. That means snubbing many policy-driven matters (too \u201cdry\u201d) and the often impactful (but \u201cunsexy\u201d) acts of government agencies.\n\nThursday brought us President Obama Contrition Day. His pained lecture on health insurance, disguised as a press conference on Obamacare changes, dominated coverage.\n\nEven if we had bombed Syria, it would have been overshadowed by Contrition Day, the crack-smoking Toronto mayor and perhaps a speculative new poll involving Chris Christie running for President against either Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren or perhaps Ashley Judd.\n\nSo it was no surprise that I was the only media person to show when the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a full-fledged hearing on \u201cReviewing Alternatives to Amtrak\u2019s Annual Losses in Food and Beverage Service.\u201d\n\nYes, a hearing on all the not-so alluring cuisine found on Amtrak. Pass the peanuts and Diet Coke, please.\n\nCongressional hearings are orchestrated. So the witness list was characteristically stacked by Mica, a conservative big on mass transit, privatization and needling Amtrak.\n\nAmtrak\u2019s dour inspector general cited food and beverage losses of $72 million a year and even gingerly suggested contracting out those services.\n\nAn Amtrak bigshot executive said they\u2019re really trying to do better, and are. A Smithsonian Institution retail chief heralded privatized services at the museums in what he later conceded was not a terribly relevant apples-to-oranges comparison.\n\nA North Carolina state rail official detailed how they make a few bucks with vending machines on trains. He later admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t think vending machines are appropriate for longer routes.\u201d\n\nAnd a bone was thrown to Amtrak\u2019s working stiffs, with a few minutes given to a longtime food-beverage worker who is also an official with its union, UniteHere.\n\nAmtrak onboard workers earn $41 an hour, including full benefits, said Inspector General Ted Alves. He\u2019s a seemingly somber Bostonian who could easily be mistaken for a small-town Iowa bank manager and Rotary Club member.\n\nDwayne Bateman, the Amtrak worker, disputed the suggestion that slashing pay was the answer. He cited his three decades of \u201chonest and respectable work with long hours,\u201d providing for his wife and kids and leading a middle-class life.\n\nOur Amtrak situation is ultimately what is faced with all mass transit: We don\u2019t fund them sufficiently, and the private sector is no panacea, given giant capital investments in rails and cars.\n\nAmtrak has lost money for four decades, but riders and revenues are up. It had 31 million riders last year. Many shorter-distances, especially in the Northeast, are profitable, typified by the Washington-to-New York run.\n\nThe problem is always the minority of money-losing, long-distance routes of 750 miles or longer. The full-fledged dining cars on longer hauls lose money, as opposed to the austere chips-and-sandwich caf\u00e9 cars on short routes. But do you want to travel three days from Chicago to San Francisco without real food?\n\nEd Howell, Amtrak\u2019s customer services honcho, warned that eliminating many food and beverage services would prompt ticket revenue losses in excess of what is spent on them.\n\nAnd while those longer routes are also essential for rural America, the Republicans who control the House \u2014 and frequently represent those same areas \u2014 want to slash Amtrak\u2019s $1.3 billion in subsidies by half.\n\nAn irony is that Mica and Democrats like Rep. Gerald Connolly (Va.) acknowledged the superior rail systems of other nations and their reliance on government help.\n\nHeck, Mica enviously cited how Turkey just opened a gleaming eight-mile rail link under the Bosphorus Strait that connects the Asian and European sides of Istanbul.\n\nAnd this was on a morning when Washington\u2019s most important rail line was crippled for the second straight day, creating rush-hour havoc (I can attest).\n\nBut the hearing broke up with no consensus about that those Amtrak food and beverage losses of $72 million.\n\nMeanwhile, an aircraft carrier named after President Gerald Ford is still under construction and now $2 billion over budget, at $13 billion. The Pentagon wants another $500 million to finish it.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that the Amtrak situation really and truly is about peanuts.\n\njwarren@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "James Warren", "twitter": {"description": "Warren: \"I'm a relentless bastard.\u201d U.S. Rep.
