Dean Heller said Thursday he expects legislation to be introduced in the next month or so to outlaw all Internet gaming except online poker, putting a stop to what he called \u201cthe wild wild West\u201d of gambling if every state were allowed to operate online games of chance that compete with Nevada casinos.\n\nHeller, R-Nev., also said he believes Las Vegas Sands Corp. Chairman Sheldon Adelson, who is waging an all-out campaign to stop Internet gaming, makes some good points, including how widespread online gambling could cause social ills and how online competition could devastate the Silver State\u2019s gaming and tourist industry.\n\n\u201cI think Adelson brings up some reasonable concerns,\u201d Heller said in an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial board. \u201cAnd to have the wild wild West as an empire of gambling for the country would have some serious social implications. And I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s concerned with.\u201d\n\nHeller said he has talked to Adelson and met with the other side, or the vast majority of gaming leaders who favor unchecked Internet gambling. Steve Wynn recently joined Adelson in opposing Internet gaming, but otherwise the two giants of the industry stand alone against the American Gaming Association.\n\n\u201cI think the devastation for bricks and mortar (casinos) in this state \u2026 would just be a final nail, I think, in keeping these businesses healthy,\u201d Heller said.\n\nAsked why he thinks most gaming properties favor Internet gambling, Heller said they think they can make money.\n\n\u201cThese are corporate entities and they believe they can play the game,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThey\u2019re corporate entities. They\u2019ve got to keep their shareholders happy. \u2026 They\u2019ve made the determination that they can compete in that market.\u201d\n\nHeller and U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., have been working together to come up with a bill to restore the Wire Act, which used to prohibit Internet gambling until the Obama administration several years ago loosened the law to allow Illinois to offer lottery tickets online. The two Nevada senators also want to carve out an exception for online poker.\n\n\u201cThere is no daylight between where Senator Reid and and myself are on this particular issue,\u201d Heller said.\n\nNow, 16 states are considering online gambling, including California, Heller said, adding there would be no incentive for Southern and Northern Californians to visit Las Vegas or Reno if they can gamble at home.\n\nHe said a carve-out for online poker makes sense because it\u2019s a game of skill, not chance.\n\n\u201cGames like poker, I think, it takes a little more skill,\u201d he said.\n\nHeller said he expects legislation in the next month or so. He said he and Reid are working with their Republican and Democratic colleagues to come up with a bill that could have broad support.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep it from being just a Nevada issue,\u201d Heller said. \u201cSo Harry and I are trying to look for help from members in each of our conferences to come forward with legislation that, hopefully, long term provides a solution for us.\u201d\n\nAny bill could face strong opposition from powerful gaming leaders who are fighting Adelson on the issue.\n\n\u201cRight now there\u2019s a majority probably around here that want nothing done,\u201d Heller acknowledged. \u201cYou know, they want it wild wild West when it comes to Internet gambling. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nHeller said he and Reid are \u201ctrying to do what\u2019s best for the state of Nevada.\u201d\n\nAdelson has said he\u2019ll spend whatever it takes to kill Internet gaming proposals on Capitol Hill and in individual states. The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, a grass-roots advocacy group funded by Adelson, launched in November.\n\nMeanwhile, Caesars Entertainment Corp. and Station Casinos have invested millions of dollars in legal online wagering efforts in Nevada and New Jersey and hope to expand the businesses into other states that allow it. And the American Gaming Association has contracted with several big consulting companies to promote Internet gambling bills.\n\n\u201cYou have members of the AGA taking one position then you have members taking a different position,\u201d Heller said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of tough trying to keep on the straight and narrow \u2026 when this is an issue that changes every day \u2014 who\u2019s for it and who\u2019s against it.\u201d\n\nHeller addressed many other hot topics during the wide-ranging interview:\n\n\u2014 On gay marriage, he said he is still against it. \u201cI think marriage is between a man and a woman,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 On immigration, he voted for a comprehensive reform bill in the Senate and said he believes the House is ready to approve legislation, too, although not the exact version of the Senate bill. In Reno, the day before, he said he \u201cmade some pretty bold comments,\u201d but tempered them a bit on Thursday.,\n\n\u201cI do believe that if you took a comprehensive immigration reform bill \u2014 maybe not what the Senate passed, but something that\u2019s worthy of discussion \u2014 and you brought that down to the House today, I believe it would pass,\u201d he said. \u201cI also believe that most, if not all, of the members of our (Nevada) delegation would vote for it in the House.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On raising the minimum wage, he said it should be left up to the states and not the federal government. He said he likes how Nevada handles it, indexing the minimum wage to inflation so it rises as costs rise. (Nevada\u2019s minimum wage is now $8.25 compared to the federal base of $7.25. President Barack Obama has suggested increasing it to $10.10.)\n\nHeller said a 40 percent increase would cost 500,000 jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. He added that in Nevada only 1 percent to 2 percent of those employed make minimum wage and most are teenagers in entry-level jobs.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s wrong when the city of New York has the same minimum wage as Elko does, or for that matter Los Angeles or somewhere else,\u201d Heller said.\n\n\u2014 On medical marijuana, he said \u201cas long as the public supports it, that\u2019s fine,\u201d but he opposes social use of pot.\n\n\u2014 On Obamacare, he said it should be replaced and include tort reform as the best way to cut health care costs 15 percent to 20 percent. He said he would preserve provisions such as allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans until age 26 and the ban on denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.\n\nPersonally, Heller joined the health insurance exchange in the District of Columbia and said it would have cost him more money to keep his two sons, ages 25 and 22, on his plan because he sought a higher level of coverage. His sons each got their own plans with limited coverage to keep costs down and because they\u2019re young and healthy, he said.\n\n\u201cWe had to remove both of our boys on our health care plan because it was so expensive,\u201d he said.\n\nHeller also sped up his plans to have surgery on his right Achilles tendon, having the procedure in December before Obamacare changes kicked in because he wanted to make sure he could use the same doctor and hospital.\n\nHeller said any GOP health care plan should include tort reform and changes to make coverage more competitive to cut costs. Now he said doctors conduct too many \u201cdefensive\u201d tests, fearing lawsuits. His father, for example, once had to go through $6,000 worth of tests before he was diagnosed as being dehydrated, Heller said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have true competition in this country and that\u2019s why our health care costs were going up.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On requiring a voter ID to cast a ballot, the former secretary of state said he\u2019s for it.\n\n\u2014 On the Nevada Republican Party\u2019s plan to endorse candidates during the primary season, Heller said he doesn\u2019t approve and if he were running for re-election this year he would not go through the process, including filling out a questionnaire. He said he would do as GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval did, saying voters can judge him based on his record.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really agree with the endorsement process,\u201d Heller said.\n\n\u2014 On the Republican Party infighting and disarray in Nevada, Heller quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would argue there\u2019s room for improvement.\u201d He said he sees Sandoval as the leader of the party, which he says accommodates all types.\n\n\u201cWe always talk about a big tent,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different points of view in the Republican Party today. We have conservatives. We have moderates. And we have liberals. And I think that\u2019s healthy. I think short term maybe it\u2019s not working for us, but in the long term it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he said GOP primaries often are very competitive while Democrats often put up one anointed candidate.\n\nHe said, however, he would do whatever Sandoval asked to help GOP candidates win election this year.\n\n\u2014 On Sandoval\u2019s future plans after governor, Heller said he has not talked to the him about whether he might challenge Reid for the Senate in 2016. He added he thinks Sandoval is interested in returning to the federal bench.\n\n\u201cMaybe going to the (U.S.) Supreme Court or back to the bench would be an option,\u201d Heller said.\n\n\u2014 On his relationship with Reid, he said it\u2019s \u201cgood enough.\u201d Reid once said he missed former U.S. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who resigned in scandal, opening his seat for Heller\u2019s initial appointment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Harry about this,\u201d Heller laughed. \u201cI just throw it out as a Joe Biden moment.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Laura Myers at lmyers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2919.
