Photo: Louie Douvis\n\nSonic Healthcare is on the hunt for a new chief executive of its troubled United States pathology business \u2013 its third in two years.\n\nA job advertisement posted on healthecareers network on Wednesday said the company was looking for candidates with leadership experience in medicine and business. The successful candidate will take on the role in Sonic\u2019s US head office in Austin, Texas.\n\nSonic\u2019s US pathology business accounts for about 22 per cent of the $7 billion company\u2019s revenue. In the first half of the 2014 financial year US revenue hit $411 million. On a statutory basis revenue rose 12 per cent, but in constant currency revenue was flat.\n\nThe executive search comes less than two years after the current CEO David Bryant took over the job from his predecessor David Schultz in September 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere has been some churn in this role,\u201d an analyst who declined to be named said. \u201cI thought they had a fairly stable CEO [in Mr Bryant].\u201d\n\nMr Schultz originally joined Sonic in 2005 when the company bought Texas-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories, the company he founded. His retirement lead to the appointment of Mr Bryant.\n\nSydney-based Sonic is undertaking a $US60 million cost cutting initiative in its US business in order to boost earnings at a time when revenue growth is hard to come by.\n\nThe introduction of US President Barack Obama\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, was expected to boost revenue given more Americans would have access to healthcare. But the country\u2019s big pathology players Quest and LabCorp have admitted some \u201cuncertainty\u201d around the impact of the policy changes.\n\nSonic was forced to update the market on the US division\u2019s performance in December 2013 when the two big competitors announced earnings downgrades. \u201cWhilst there are currently certain pressures in the US market, which Sonic has discussed in previous announcements and reports, Sonic has experienced substantial earnings growth in its US business for the 5 months to 30 November 2013, and expects to continue to do so for the full 2014 and 2015 financial years, largely as a result of the US$60 million cost out program that has previously been announced,\u201d the company said at the time.\n\nThe company is slated to announce its full year results to the market on August 19. Sonic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BusinessDay", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Sonic Healthcare is on the hunt for a new chief executive of its troubled United States pathology business &ndash; its third in two years.", "title": "Sonic Healthcare on the hunt for new US chief", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/business/sonic-healthcare-on-the-hunt-for-new-us-chief-20140724-zwejx.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/s/8/q/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zwejx.png/1447908322668.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/s/8/q/o/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zwejx.png/1447908322668.jpg"}, "title": "Sonic Healthcare on the hunt for new US chief", "description": "Sonic Healthcare is on the hunt for a new chief executive of its troubled United States pathology business \u2013 its third in two years.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Sonic Healthcare is on the hunt for a new chief executive of its troubled United States pathology business \u2013 its third in two years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf763\"", "article_summary": "Photo: Louie DouvisSonic Healthcare is on the hunt for a new chief executive of its troubled United States pathology business \u2013 its third in two years.\nSonic\u2019s US pathology business accounts for about 22 per cent of the $7 billion company\u2019s revenue.\nSonic Healthcare's US business accounts for more than a fifth of its revenue.\nSonic was forced to update the market on the US division\u2019s performance in December 2013 when the two big competitors announced earnings downgrades.\nSydney-based Sonic is undertaking a $US60 million cost cutting initiative in its US business in order to boost earnings at a time when revenue growth is hard to come by."}
