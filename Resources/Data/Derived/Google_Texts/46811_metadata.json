For some, it started last week. Others declared the whole month \u201cBlack November.\u201d\n\nThe extended sale frenzy, however, has made scoring that one-time deal more elusive then ever.\n\nAn editor at DealNews questioned whether early Black Friday sales are true deals. In a comparison, the site found that the best deals came even later in November.\n\n\u201cWe urge you once again to hold off on buying, as these deals still don\u2019t compare to the great offers that are just a few weeks away,\u201d wrote features editor Benjamin Glaser in October.\n\nWhen WalletHub, a personal finance site, compared current prices and expected Black Friday prices this year, it found not everything is a good deal on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nJewelry prices averaged a measly 4 percent discount, while furniture was 8 percent off pre-Black Friday prices.\n\n\u201cJewelry is the least discounted item on Black Friday, mostly because it\u2019s discounted at a rate of 50 percent to 60 percent throughout the year since markups are so high to begin with,\u201d analyst Jill Gonzalez said.\n\n\u201cFurniture has the second-worst discount because most of the retailers choose to apply steeper discounts around other holidays like Presidents Day, Memorial Day and Labor Day.\u201d\n\nWalletHub\u2019s research showed the best discounts on Black Friday are books (28 percent off), software (22 percent) and toys (22 percent).\n\nBe informed\n\nThe best way to shop online or offline is to be prepared with the information you need to make a decision.\n\nDenver-based PlaceWise Media, which manages and provides digital tools for 750 shopping malls nationwide, recommends using your local mall\u2019s app. PlaceWise works with more than 500 retailers to schedule limited and local deals, such as a 30 percent coupon from 9 a.m. to noon.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of people who interact with (our mall clients\u2019 apps or sites) are going into the mall. They\u2019re not looking. They\u2019re inside the mall,\u201d said John Dee, PlaceWise\u2019s president. \u201cThey\u2019re getting the answers to make sure they\u2019re getting the right information.\u201d\n\nHis research shows that shoppers don\u2019t use their mobile devices to \u201cshowroom,\u201d or see the product and buy it online later. They want to see more product details, read reviews and compare prices.\n\n\u201cAs a tip, I would say bring your phone to the mall because everyone else is, too,\u201d Dee said, adding that the most crowded time to visit a mall on Black Friday is from noon to 4 p.m.\n\nDigital shopping tools\n\nSeveral shopping apps are available, including some longtime favorites like eBay-owned RedLaser, ShopSavvy and RetailMeNot. These apps are comprehensive in price comparisons and can quickly link you to a good deal using your phone.\n\nOther online tools to help shoppers see the historic price of a product and decide whether today is the best time to buy it \u2014 or last week, when it was half the price.\n\nThe Camelizer, at camelcamelcamel.com, tracks prices on Amazon and will send you price-watch alerts on Twitter.\n\nSome stores have tools to convince shoppers they\u2019re getting the lowest price \u2014 or will. Last year, Walmart rolled out Savings Catcher, a mobile app that refunds the price difference if something you just bought from Walmart happens to be on sale elsewhere. It is a mostly automated refund via gift card, as long as you scan in your Walmart receipt.\n\nThe Slice app provides a haggle-free mobile form to request a refund if it finds a price dropped on an item you just purchased. Merchant partners include Best Buy, The Home Depot and Zappos. The app also tracks recalls and deliveries.\n\nTamara Chuang: tchuang@denverpost.com or visit dpo.st/tamara", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Extended Black Friday sales mean deals are more elusive", "title": "Extended Black Friday sales mean deals are more elusive", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/extended-black-friday-sales-mean-deals-are-more-elusive/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__Was8984689p1.jpg", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__Was8984689p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T13:36:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:15:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Personal finance"}, "article_summary": "In a comparison, the site found that the best deals came even later in November.\nRetailers have extended the popular shopping day to last several days.\nOthers declared the whole month \u201cBlack November.\u201dThe extended sale frenzy, however, has made scoring that one-time deal more elusive then ever.\nAn editor at DealNews questioned whether early Black Friday sales are true deals.\nSome stores have tools to convince shoppers they\u2019re getting the lowest price \u2014 or will."}
