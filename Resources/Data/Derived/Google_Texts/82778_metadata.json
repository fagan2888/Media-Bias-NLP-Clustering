He was 82.\n\nThe Allegheny County Medical Examiner said Noll died of natural causes.\n\nNoll transformed the Steelers from a long-standing joke into one of the NFL\u2019s pre-eminent powers, becoming the only coach to win four Super Bowls. He was a demanding figure who did not make close friends with his players, yet was a successful and motivating leader.\n\nThe Steelers won the four Super Bowls over six seasons (1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979), an unprecedented run that made Pittsburgh one of the NFL\u2019s marquee franchises, one that breathed life into a struggling, blue-collar city.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the great coaches of the game,\u201d Steelers owner Dan Rooney once said. \u201cHe ranks up there with (George) Halas, (Tom) Landry and (Curly) Lambeau.\u201d\n\nNoll\u2019s 16-8 record in postseason play remains one of the best in league history. He retired in 1991 with a 209-156-1 record in 23 seasons, after inheriting a team that had never won a postseason game. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nNoll worked so well with Steelers President Rooney that the team never felt the need to have a general manager. When he retired, and was replaced by Bill Cowher, only four other coaches or managers in modern U.S. pro sports history had run their teams longer than Noll had.\n\n\u201cChuck Noll is the best thing that happened to the Rooneys since they got on the boat (to America) in Ireland,\u201d Art Rooney II, the former Steelers personnel chief and the son of the team founder, once said.\n\nA former messenger guard for his hometown Cleveland Browns who earned the nicknamed Knute Knowledge \u2014 as in Knute Rockne \u2014 Noll was an assistant with the San Diego Chargers and Baltimore Colts for nine seasons. Then he accepted what seemed a dead-end job in January 1969 as coach of the NFL\u2019s least-successful organization.\n\nArt Rooney Sr. often hired friends and cronies as coaches, and only two of the Steelers\u2018 first 13 coaches had winning records. At the time Noll took over, the franchise was 105 games below .500 in its history.\n\nNoll, hired only after Penn State\u2019s Joe Paterno turned down a $350,000, five-year offer, was different from any Steelers coach before him. He immediately brought intelligence, toughness, stability, confidence, character and a can-do mindset to a franchise accustomed to constant upheaval and ever-changing personnel.\n\nAsked at his first news conference if his goal was to make the Steelers respectable, Noll said, \u201cRespectability? Who wants to be respectable? That\u2019s spoken like a true loser.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not the most colorful coach behind the microphone, Noll could often be counted on for memorable, motivational one-liners that became rallying cries. Phrases like \u201cA life of frustration is inevitable for any coach whose main enjoyment is winning,\u201d and \u201cBefore you can win a game, you have to not lose it,\u201d and \u201cThe thrill isn\u2019t in the winning, it\u2019s in the doing,\u201d spoke volumes about what Noll was trying to accomplish. They went over well in a football-crazed region of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe day after Noll was hired, the Steelers drafted defensive lineman Joe Greene. He was the first of the nine Hall of Famers selected during the Noll era. Four of the others were drafted within Noll\u2019s first four seasons: Terry Bradshaw, Mel Blount, Jack Ham and Franco Harris.\n\nFour more arrived in the first five rounds of the 1974 draft: Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth and Mike Webster. And the 1971 draft, though it produced only one Hall of Famer (Ham), generated seven starters.\n\nWhile the Steelers surprisingly won their opener under Noll in 1969, beating Detroit, they lost their final 13 games that season, and their first three in 1970. By then, some were questioning Noll\u2019s hiring.\n\nThe Steelers\u2018 turnaround began in earnest in 1970, the year they moved into the AFC after the NFL and AFL merged. They drafted Bradshaw with the No. 1 pick, moved into Three Rivers Stadium after years of being a secondhand tenant of Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field. They won five of eight during one stretch.\n\nBy 1972, the year Harris arrived to give them the ground game Noll sought, they were championship contenders with an 11-3 record and a we\u2019ve-turned-the-corner attitude. Noll had long since run off underachievers and pushed the Rooneys to bring in the players he wanted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll argue a point with you and keep yelling, \u2018No, this is right, you\u2019re wrong,\u2019\u201d Dan Rooney said. \u201cSometimes you have to say, \u2018This is the way we\u2019re going to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe first traditional playoff game in Steelers history on Dec. 23, 1972, also signaled what was to come. The Steelers were in control of the John Madden-coached Raiders most of the game, until quarterback Ken Stabler scored in the final two minutes to put Oakland up 7-6.\n\nWith the Steelers down to fourth-and-10 on their side of the field, Bradshaw lofted a pass downfield intended for Frenchy Fuqua. As Fuqua and safety Jack Tatum converged on the ball, it bounded high in the air for what looked to be a certain incompletion. Instead, Harris, trailing on the play, caught the ball nearly at his shoe tops and raced into the end zone for an improbable touchdown.\n\nThe play would quickly become known as the \u201cImmaculate Reception.\u201d\n\nNoll\u2019s Steelers did not win the Super Bowl that season \u2014 they lost to unbeaten Miami on a fake punt in the AFC title game.\n\nBut, with their roster completed by their remarkable 1974 draft, they finally became NFL champions and did it three more times by January 1980.\n\nStill, Noll\u2019s best team might have been in 1976, when the Steelers rebounded from a 1-4 start to go 10-4 \u2014 even with Bradshaw injured and out most of the season \u2014 by playing the greatest stretch of defense in NFL history.\n\nThe Steel Curtain shut out five of their final nine opponents while yielding only 28 points. At one point, they didn\u2019t allow a touchdown for 22 quarters.\n\nHowever, Harris and Rocky Bleier, 1,000-yard rushers that season, were injured in a playoff game against Baltimore. Without a running game, they lost the AFC title to Oakland.\n\nA year later, Noll wound up in a federal court trial. He accused Raiders defensive back George Atkinson, who had leveled Swann with a brutal hit the season before, of being part of the NFL\u2019s \u201ccriminal element.\u201d\n\nNoll prevailed, but there were hard feelings when, under oath, he included Blount as also being part of that criminal element. The Steelers went 9-5 that season, but rebounded to win the championship in the 1978 and 1979 seasons.\n\nWhen all the talent began to retire, the championships ended. Great drafts gave way to poor ones. The Steelers won only two playoff games and no conference championships in Noll\u2019s final 12 seasons, missing the postseason eight times.\n\nNoll never was much of a yeller or screamer, though he had his moments. He confronted Oilers coach Jerry Glanville at midfield and warned him about the team\u2019s borderline-legal blocking techniques.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t feel like it was his job to motivate,\u201d Bleier said. \u201cIt was his job to take motivated people and give them a direction and get the job done.\u201d\n\nWhen he retired, Noll always said he would never coach another team and he didn\u2019t.\n\nIn 2007, the football field at St. Vincent College, the Steelers\u2018 longtime training camp home in Latrobe, was named for Noll, even though he played at and graduated from Dayton.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Noll attended Benedictine High School, where he played running back and tackle, winning All-State honors, before gaining a scholarship to play for the Flyers. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh\u2019s biggest, most traditional rival, in 1953.\n\nAt 27, he retired as a player from the Browns in 1959.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noll transformed the Steelers from a long-standing joke into one of the NFL's pre-eminent powers, becoming the only coach to win four Super Bowls.
