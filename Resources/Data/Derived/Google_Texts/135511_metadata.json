Johnson said Obama\u2019s rejection is historic because it is the first time a president has rejected the defense measure over a provision outside the bill\u2019s reach, citing the president\u2019s push for non-defense spending.\n\nThe legislation received bipartisan support in both houses of Congress, passing through the House 270-156 and the Senate 70-27. But House members face an uphill battle to secure the 20 additional votes required to override the president\u2019s veto\u2014a challenge further complicated by a handful of Democrats who have vowed to switch their position.\n\nJohnson said if NDAA fails to survive a veto override, the bill will go into \u201climbo\u201d until overarching budget negotiations are settled, delaying military programs and important authorities granted to the president under the legislation.\n\nThis is the fifth time Obama has asserted his veto power since taking office and the third this year, following a rejection of Keystone XL Pipeline approval and a bill pertaining to the National Labor Relations Board.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama boldly used his veto pen Thursday in a rare rejection of an annual defense bill during a photo-op event in the Oval Office.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama boldly used his veto pen Thursday in a rare rejection of an annual defense bill during a photo-op event in the Oval Office.", "title": "Obama Blocks Defense Bill in Consequential Veto", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151022_NDAA_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-22T21:58:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LPTDZ2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "President Barack Obama boldly used his veto pen Thursday in a rare rejection of an annual defense bill during a photo-op event in the Oval Office.", "title": "Obama Blocks Defense Bill in Consequential Veto", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151022_NDAA_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "defense", "published_time": "2015-10-22T19:18:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T21:58:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama used his veto pen Thursday in a rare rejection of an annual defense bill during a publicized photo-op event in the Oval Office.\nObama additionally demanded that any increases in defense spending must match increases in non-defense domestic spending.\nNDAA has been vetoed only four times since its creation more than 50 years ago, not including Obama\u2019s veto.\nThe president\u2019s consequential veto of the $612-billion National Defense Authorization Act will face a Republican-led override attempt in the House Nov. 5, though it is uncertain whether the GOP can coalesce the support needed to overcome Democratic opposition.\nThis is the fifth time Obama has asserted his veto power since taking office and the third this year, following a rejection of Keystone XL Pipeline approval and a bill pertaining to the National Labor Relations Board."}
