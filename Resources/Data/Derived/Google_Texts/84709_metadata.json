That amounts to roughly a quarter of Florida's population, giving it the third-highest rate in the country.\n\nIn a statement clarifying the navigators directive on Wednesday, the state health department said the counselors trained to help people sign up for health insurance have been barred, at least in part, in the interest of consumer protection.\n\n\"This (Navigator) program has raised privacy concerns due to the consumer information that will be gathered for use in a federal database,\" the statement said.\n\nSimilar concerns have been raised by Scott and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, amid allegations that navigators might steal personal information, but they have been rejected out of hand by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.\n\nU.S. Representative Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, said hampering the work of navigators was a \"plain absurdity\" in a harshly worded letter she fired off to Scott on Thursday.\n\n\"The continued obstruction by you and many state leaders of the Affordable Care Act is contrary to the best interests of the citizens and businesses of Florida,\" Castor said.\n\n\"To deny access to Navigators to health departments is another obstructionist measure that elevates ideology over the interests of Floridians who simply need to see a doctor or nurse and take personal responsibility through enrolling in affordable insurance,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Department officials say the Florida restrictions will not impede the program. \"Despite the state's attempts, we are confident that Navigators will still be able to help Floridians enroll in quality, affordable health coverage when open enrollment begins on October 1,\" Levy said.
