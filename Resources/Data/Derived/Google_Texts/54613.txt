A south Mississippi wildlife refuge has been releasing hundreds of critically endangered frogs into the wild, hoping they will repopulate inside the refuge.

The Sun Herald reports that workers at the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge in Gautier have released 1,074 dusky gopher frogs into the refuge since May.

The species, which has been on the endangered species list since 2001, is indigenous to Saucier in Harrison County.

Wildlife biologist Angie Dedrickson says the Saucier tadpoles are brought to the Gautier refuge. The frogs are cared for and then released once they have matured.

Refuge ranger Melissa Perez says the frog's greatest foe is the shrinking of the wet-pines savanna environment.

Dedrickson says it will be a few years before the success of the project can be measured.
