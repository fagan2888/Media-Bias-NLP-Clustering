PART 2 OF 6\n\nAnalysts Project Weak 4Q15 Revenue Growth for Aetna\n\nWeak revenue growth\n\nOn February 1, 2016, Aetna (AET) is expected to announce its 4Q15 earnings. The quarter ended on December 31, 2015. Wall Street has estimated Aetna\u2019s 4Q15 revenue to be about $14.9 billion, a growth of only 1.1% on a year-over-year (or YOY) basis. In 4Q15, Aetna is expected to register a net profit margin of 2.8%, equal to the 2.8% reported by UnitedHealth Group (UNH).\n\nThe above chart shows that analysts expect Aetna\u2019s revenues to rise and reach $15.5 billion in fiscal 1Q16. This is mainly attributed to the expected increase in enrollments in the company\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid segments. The revenue growth is projected to be partly offset by the future impact of known membership attrition in the company\u2019s commercial self-insured business due to a few large insurance customers who are expected to switch to alternative funding arrangements.\n\nProfitability margins\n\nWall Street has also projected that Aetna\u2019s net profit margins will rise in 1Q16 and reach 5.4%. However, in 4Q15, margins are expected to be pressured by the individual and small group Affordable Care Act (or ACA) compliant business. The individual exchange business has also proved challenging for peer companies such as Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI).\n\nIn 2015, the small group ACA business is projected to account for approximately $3.5 billion in premiums. The on-exchange individual business will be about $2.7 billion in premium revenues. While the ACA-compliant small group business is expected to be profitable in 2015, the margins will be below the target. The individual exchange business is estimated to be unprofitable, while the off-exchange individual business, which is worth approximately $0.8 billion, is projected to break even in 2015.\n\nYou can get exposure to Aetna through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).
