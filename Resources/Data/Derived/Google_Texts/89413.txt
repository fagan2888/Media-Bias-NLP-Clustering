Posters of tatted up Ted Cruz appear in L.A.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is straying from his typical straight-edged, suit-and-tie look ahead of a speaking engagement in Los Angeles, Calif., appearing in mysterious posters that show the conservative with edgy tattoos and a cigarette dangling from his lips.

The posters of a rough-around-the-edges Cruz appeared Thursday night around several locations in the City of Angels ahead of a speaking engagement at the Beverly Hills Wilshire Hotel for the Claremont Institute.

A shirtless Cruz appears to be photoshopped into the images and dons several tattoos, including one of the bald eagle sprawled across his muscly pecs. With a cigarette in his mouth and the word “Cruz” inked across his stomach, the poster reads “TED CRUZ’S SO-CAL ‘BLACKLISTER & LOVING IT’ TOUR” with the date March 15th written across the top.

Cruz is the keynote speaker for the Claremont Institute’s annual Winston Churchill dinner at the Wilshire on the 15th.

The senator, who must’ve received word of the odd posters, decided to join in the fun.

Saw this, but noticed an error. So I wanted to make one thing clear: I don't smoke cigarettes http://t.co/3nn2740kkP pic.twitter.com/tPFNqg9vu8 — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 15, 2014

The posters appeared in front of a bevy of L.A. hot spots, including the Viper Room, the Seventh Veil and Whiskey a Go Go, Breitbart reported. The Cruz-laden images also were spotted plastered on utility poles and on car windshields.
