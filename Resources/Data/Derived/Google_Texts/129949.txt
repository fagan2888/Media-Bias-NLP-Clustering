This week’s Saturday Night Live mocked General Motors CEO Mary Barra during her hearing on Capitol Hill, portraying her as someone who knows nothing about anything in regard to the auto manufacturer.

In the hearing about the GM ignition switch problem linked to multiple deaths, faux Barra — played by Kate McKinnon — began pleading her case by apologizing to those affected, stressing that the old guard is out and a new GM has arrived.

“I can’t tell you why it took GM so long to address this safety issue, but I promise we are investigating the matter fully because I represent the new GM, and the new GM is all about honesty and transparency,” she said.

But as the members of Congress began to ask Barra questions, that “honesty and transparency” didn’t hold up. The CEO deflected the questions with the responses like “we’re looking into that” and “that is part of our investigation.”

As the questioning continued, Barra took even more drastic measures to avoid answering, even restarting the new GM and trying to roll away in her chair.

Sadly, the SNL cold open skit is relatively accurate. In the hearing on Tuesday, the CEO of GM didn’t provide the panel of Representatives with many answers, especially in regard to the long period of time — 10 years — between when the ignition problem was evident and when the company took action to address the issue.

By the end of the fake SNL hearing, no real questions were answered, and the case had gone virtually nowhere. Sounds about right.
