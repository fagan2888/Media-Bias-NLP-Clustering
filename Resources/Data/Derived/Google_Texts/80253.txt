Well you might have seen the dandiest and the most expensive shelving units. But we can bet that you would have never seen a shelf like this. The CLM 1 + shelving unit is used to keep stuff just like a regular shelf, only that it suspends that stuff mid-air. Surprised already, right! Well this creation of pure scientific genius uses an assembly of ultra-powerful magnets to suspend whatever objects are set upon it in midair.

The shelf is a two-piece setup — a non-floating base and a relatively smaller rubber ring. When the ring is placed on the non-floating base it levitates two inches above, in a stable equilibrium of the opposing magnetic forces. You can apparently place almost anything that you place on regular house shelf on the CLM 1 +. But don’t launch an assault on the shelf as the weight limit tops out at 2.2 pounds. So anything under that weight limit can be flaunted on this shelf. The best part is that it works even better with the base covered.
