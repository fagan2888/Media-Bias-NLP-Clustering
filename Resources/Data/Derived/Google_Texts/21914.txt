Cedar Falls, Iowa (CNN) Ted Cruz faulted his fellow Republican senator and likely presidential rival Rand Paul on Thursday for refusing to vote for the National Security Agency reform bill, saying he was "dismayed" that the legislation never advanced last year.

At an event in Cedar Falls, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate was asked by a voter why he voted in favor of extending the Patriot Act. The voter was referring to a piece of legislation that sought to curb the government's meta data phone collection effort.

Paul, though a stalwart critic of the NSA, indeed voted against the bill, saying it didn't go far enough. The legislation "did not fix the problem" and reauthorized expiring parts of the Patriot Act, Paul's top adviser said Thursday.

"Others are welcome to their decision to compromise on American's 4th Amendment rights, but not to cast it misleadingly as a vote for liberty," Doug Stafford said.
