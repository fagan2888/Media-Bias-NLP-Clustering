For some reason President Obama decided to make pre-Super Bowl interviews with the network airing the game an annual tradition, so this year he had to subject himself to a ten-minute chat with Bill O’Reilly. You'll never guess what the Fox News anchor wanted to talk about: Obamacare, Benghazi, and the IRS scandal. As O'Reilly interrupted and scoffed at any answers he didn't like (almost all of them), the president made some jabs at his employer. After saying O'Reilly's assertions were proven inaccurate in "multiple hearings," Obama added, "these kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them."

After the president dodged a question about why he hasn't fired Kathleen Sebelius, O'Reilly pressed him on whether promising people they could keep their health plans was "the biggest mistake of your presidency." Obama quipped, "Oh, Bill, you've got a long list of my mistakes of my presidency."

Still, the best line came from Hillary Clinton:

It’s so much more fun to watch FOX when it’s someone else being blitzed & sacked! #SuperBowl — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 3, 2014

We suspect the pre-Super Bowl interview tradition will die with the Obama administration if she becomes president.
