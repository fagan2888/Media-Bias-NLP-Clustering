He shoots unfunded campaign videos from the basement rec room of his campaign manager\u2019s home, glass of beer a reach away.\n\nSo it was true to form that Haugh chose not to prepare any go-to talking point or incriminating accusation for what could be his only chance to debate his major-party competitors in North Carolina\u2019s marquee Senate race.\n\nIn fact, he says, he didn\u2019t prepare at all.\n\nHis decision to wear a cat-print tie for the occasion was spur of the moment, too.\n\nIt\u2019s the morning after his face-off with incumbent Democrat Kay Hagan and her Republican challenger, North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, and Haugh is analyzing his performance.\n\n\u201cLast night, I think of course I won the debate big time,\u201d Haugh says in a phone interview with The Daily Signal. He elaborates:\n\n\u201cLast night, I think of course I won the debate big time,\u201d says @EmperorSean.\n\nThat\u2019s because of two points: My debate prep was not debate prep. I only practiced the Ebola question and that was because it was a new issue. I\u2019ve been doing this a long time. I have principles, and when you have principles it makes things that much easier. As Mark Twain said, \u2018If you always tell the truth, you never have to remember a darn thing.\u2019\n\nThe second point? The tie, a Christmas gift from his mother that Haugh says randomly made its way around his neck for his shot at prime time.\n\n\u201cMy word, I think the tie will win me the election,\u201d Haugh says. \u201cI know the only way I can get people\u2019s attention is to be different. I have to give them a reason to consider crossing over.\u201d\n\nHaugh wasn\u2019t invited to the first two debates between Hagan and Tllis, who are locked in a close race expected to be one that determines which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n\nHe had not met the incumbent Democrat or her Republican challenger before Thursday night\u2019s debate.\n\nStill, Tillis and Hagan have to acknowledge Haugh\u2019s presence, even if he doesn\u2019t force it on them.\n\n>>> Take 5: Debate Attacks Scored by the Numbers\n\nHaugh\u2019s resume, by the way, exists beyond pizza.\n\nHe is former executive director of North Carolina\u2019s Libertarian Party. He also ran for U.S. Senate in 2002.\n\n\u201cEverything that I said about how this race would play out has been true,\u201d Haugh says.\n\n\u201cI was right all along. The power of a third-party Libertarian candidate is such that If they want to win elections, Democrats and Republicans have to be more Libertarian and peaceful.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have to be more \u201cpeaceful\u201d says @EmperorSean.\n\nThe power of Haugh is such that Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican with Libertarian leanings, traveled to North Carolina late last month to campaign for Tillis.\n\nConventional political wisdom holds that Republicans are more vulnerable to losing votes to Libertarians because of their similar views.\n\nBut analysts told The Daily Signal that Haugh\u2019s debate performance solidified the notion that he is not a typical Libertarian.\n\n\u201cHe has this very granola, earthy personality, which normally appeals to the left,\u201d says Andrew Taylor, a political science professor at North Carolina State University. Taylor adds of Haugh:\n\nHe\u2019s liberal on social issues. He said you can marry who you want to. His foreign policy is very dovish. People think a Libertarian hurts a Republican in a close election. I have never been sold on that with Haugh, and I still don\u2019t think so. The peel-off from either side is more evenly split than a typical Libertarian candidate.\n\nBecause Haugh might siphon votes evenly from Republicans and Democrats, his impact on the race will be minimal, Taylor predicts.\n\n\u201cHe knows he\u2019s not going to win,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if he gets more than two to three percent of the vote.\u201d\n\nThat may be true, but Haugh\u2019s place in the debate \u2014 and the race \u2014 forces Tillis and Hagan to interact and compete with him, even if they don\u2019t want to.\n\nTaylor says Haugh had a \u201ccalming influence\u201d during the debate, temporarily quieting the conflict and tension that have defined the Hagan-Tillis battle.\n\n\u201cI thought he changed the dynamic a bit,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cHe sat there in the middle and I thought he was very thoughtful and forthright. Before the debate, a lot of people thought he is a bit odd. He showed he\u2019s a pretty smart guy.\u201d\n\n>>> 9 Senate Races That Could Tip the Balance of Power\n\nAaron S. King, an assistant professor of political science at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, says he thinks Haugh had less impact.\n\n\u201cI think he had the coolest tie,\u201d King tells The Daily Signal. \u201cBut other than that, I think Hagan and Tillis sort of just ignored him. I\u2019m not sure he changed much in the debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he had the coolest tie,\u201d says one political analyst of @EmperorSean.\n\nIn his own analysis, Haugh believes he changed the tenor of his more aggressive counterparts, forcing them to engage in a way that appeals more to voters.\n\n\u201cMy presence there gave them an opportunity to break away from being artificial,\u201d Haugh says, explaining:\n\nI thought Tillis did that. Tillis told me to please call him by his first name, Tom. Hagan was more determined to stay in character. What seems to help me is that I actually listened to the questions. I tried to engage people on a conversational level.\n\nAs he reflects some more, it becomes clear Haugh sees himself not as a sideshow but as a legitimate competitor \u2014 but one who won\u2019t change character to win.\n\n\u201cI engaged the entire event,\u201d Haugh says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping last night was a game changer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sean Haugh, a Libertarian candidate, says principles propel his strategy to beat major-party competitors in a marquee U.S. Senate race.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sean Haugh, a Libertarian candidate, says principles propel his strategy to beat major-party competitors in a marquee U.S. Senate race.", "title": "Libertarian Pizza Driver Delivers Authenticity in Senate Race", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10013400_652560534817054_4649032150469103138_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-10T17:48:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1C2BTAQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sean Haugh, a Libertarian candidate, says principles propel his strategy to beat major-party competitors in a marquee U.S. Senate race.", "title": "Libertarian Pizza Driver Delivers Authenticity in Senate Race", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10013400_652560534817054_4649032150469103138_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,media", "published_time": "2014-10-10T16:50:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-10T17:48:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "North Carolina, Sean Haugh, Thom Tillis, Kay Hagan, midterm elections,  Senate 2014, Libertarian, Senate debate"}, "article_summary": "Haugh \u2014 pronounced haw \u2014 is a Libertarian who delivers pizza to pay the bills.\n\u201cBut other than that, I think Hagan and Tillis sort of just ignored him.\nBecause Haugh might siphon votes evenly from Republicans and Democrats, his impact on the race will be minimal, Taylor predicts.\nBut analysts told The Daily Signal that Haugh\u2019s debate performance solidified the notion that he is not a typical Libertarian.\n\u201cLast night, I think of course I won the debate big time,\u201d Haugh says in a phone interview with The Daily Signal."}
