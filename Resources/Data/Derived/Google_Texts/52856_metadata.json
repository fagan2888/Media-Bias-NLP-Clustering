Russell\u2019s \u201cJoy,\u201d Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cThe Martian,\u201d and \u201cThe Peanuts Movie.\u201d\n\nThe preview of \u201cJoy,\u201d which is still shooting, was merely a collection of clips showcasing the all-star cast of Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro set to ominous church bells.\n\nThe four generation family drama tells the story of Joy (Lawrence), who rises to become the head of a billion-dollar empire. It was difficult to glean a narrative from the dialogue-free clips, but the grainy aesthetic recalled the look of the \u201cGodfather\u201d films.\n\nIn \u201cThe Martian,\u201d an adaptation of Andy Weir\u2019s novel, Matt Damon plays a man who is presumed dead and left behind by his mission mates on Mars. Viewers see Mark Watney (Damon) attempting to live and survive on the hostile planet while waiting for his crew (including Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara and Chiwetel Ejiofor) to receive his distress call and embark on a four-year journey to rescue him.\n\nScott\u2019s film looks like a classic rescue adventure, imbued with humor and emotion and echoes of last year\u2019s \u201cInterstellar.\u201d\n\nThere have been previous teasers for \u201cThe Peanuts Movie,\u201d but the theater owners were treated to the first trailer for the upcoming film that finds Charlie Brown yearning to speak to the Little Red-Haired Girl. The classic structure of Charles Schulz\u2019s characters was preserved, even though the film will be presented in 3-D when it is released on Nov. 6.\n\n\u201cPeanuts,\u201d Fox Chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulous said, \u201cspeaks to the part of us that will always be young.\u201d\n\nThe audience also got a peek at the gothic horror movie \u201cVictor Frankenstein,\u201d starring James McAvoy as Victor and Daniel Radcliffe as Igor. The trailer showed only glimpses of the terrifying monster as McAvoy\u2019s character screams \u201cwhere is your soul\u201d to his creation.\n\nFox also brought out the casts of \u201cSpy,\u201d including Jude Law, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne and 50 Cent, and the entire \u201cFantastic Four\u201d group of Kate Mara, Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, and Michael B. Jordan.\n\nUniversal Studios will be the final studio to present films before the convention closes.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio has gone wild.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Leonardo DiCaprio has gone wild.", "title": "First footage shown of \u2018The Revenant,\u2019 \u2018The Martian,\u2019 \u2018Joy\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/23/first-footage-shown-of-the-revenant-the-martian-jo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/23/b4cf62ec30987512740f6a7067002932.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/23/b4cf62ec30987512740f6a7067002932.jpg", "description": "Leonardo DiCaprio has gone wild.", "card": "summary", "title": "First footage shown of \u2018The Revenant,\u2019 \u2018The Martian,"}, "Author": "LINDSEY BAHR", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture"}, "article_summary": "A first look at footage from \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d an upcoming film by Oscar-winning director Alejando I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, shows a scraggly DiCaprio in furs and skins in the snowy, bleak 1820s Canadian wilderness.\nThe footage was shown Thursday at CinemaCon, a gathering of movie exhibitors in Las Vegas.\nThe four generation family drama tells the story of Joy (Lawrence), who rises to become the head of a billion-dollar empire.\nThe movie due in January follows frontiersman Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) on his hunt for vengeance against comrades who wronged him.\nThe trailer showed only glimpses of the terrifying monster as McAvoy\u2019s character screams \u201cwhere is your soul\u201d to his creation."}
