A total of 1,086,000 students stopped buying school lunch, after participation had increased steadily for nearly a decade.\n\nThe report found that 321 districts left the National School Lunch Program altogether, many of which cited the new standards as a factor.\n\nThe decline was \u201cinfluenced by changes made to comply with the new lunch content and nutrition standards,\u201d state and local officials said.\n\nThough the USDA has claimed the standards were \u201cproving popular,\u201d the GAO report cited numerous cases where kids are unhappy with their new menus.\n\nThe standards forced some schools to stop serving peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and led middle school and high school students to opt for vending machines or buying food off campus to avoid the lunch line.\n\nThe GAO conducted a nationwide survey of nutrition directors and visited 17 schools in eight school districts for the audit. In each district, \u201cstudents expressed dislike for certain foods that were served to comply with the new requirements, such as whole grain-rich products and vegetables in the beans and peas (legumes) and red-orange sub-groups, and this may have affected participation.\u201d\n\nThe standards brought \u201cnegative student reactions.\u201d In one case, middle school and high school students organized a three-week boycott after their school changed their sandwiches to comply with the rules.\n\nAll eight School Food Authorities (SFAs) the GAO visited \u201cmodified or eliminated\u201d popular food items. One district had to cut cheeseburgers because \u201cadding cheese to the district\u2019s burger patties would have made it difficult to stay within the weekly meat maximums.\u201d\n\nThe new standards are exhaustive, including calorie ranges for each age group, sodium limits, zero tolerance for trans fats, and specific ounce amounts for meats and grains. White bread will be mostly phased out beginning in 2014 because only \u201cwhole grain rich\u201d items will be allowed.\n\nPortion requirements and calorie limits are also in conflict, leading some SFAs to add unhealthy food such as pudding or potato chips to the menu, and serve odd food combinations in order to meet the rules.\n\n\u201cFor example, one SFA served saltine crackers and croutons with certain salads to meet the minimum daily grain requirement and a cheese stick with shrimp to meet the minimum daily meat requirement,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nUnappetizing food led to the biggest problem school officials faced: food waste.\n\n\u201cStudents may take the food components they are required to as part of the school lunch but then choose not to eat them,\u201d the GAO said. As a result, 48 out of 50 states cited waste as a challenge.\n\n\u201cIn our lunch period observations in 7 of 17 schools, we saw many students throw away some or all of their fruits and vegetables,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nThe \u201cmorale\u201d for cafeteria workers has also suffered under the new standards.\n\n\u201cStaff in one SFA noted that the increased amount of time and effort to prepare fruits and vegetables also led to morale issues when staff saw students throw the fruits and vegetables in the trash,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nLunchroom costs are also going up due to the need for \u201cnew spoons and ladles to match the new portion size requirements.\u201d Thirty-one percent of SFAs nationwide said they needed additional kitchen equipment to comply with the new lunch requirements last school year.\n\nThe law mandated that schools increase the price of school lunches, causing students to stop buying \u201cbecause they felt they were being asked to pay more for less food.\u201d Kids who pay full price for meals declined by 10 percent last school year, the lowest rate in over a decade.\n\nChallenges with the school lunch program, which cost $11.6 billion in 2012, are expected to continue, as further regulations go into effect. The \u201cfirst of three\u201d sodium limits starts in 2014-2015, though \u201cmany of the foods available from manufacturers do not yet comply with these limits.\u201d\n\nSchool officials noted, \u201cit will be very difficult\u201d to serve food that is \u201cpalatable to students\u201d under the sodium standards.\n\nAs for the other requirements, the GAO said students would get used to it.\n\n\u201cAlthough school lunch participation has declined, it is likely that participation will improve over time as students adjust to the lunch changes,\u201d they said.\n\n\u2022 Elizabeth Harrington is a staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon.
