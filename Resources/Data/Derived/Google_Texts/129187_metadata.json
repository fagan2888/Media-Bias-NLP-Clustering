Jared Soule\n\nTalking to parents about sex can definitely be uncomfortable, but what if you had to work with them in a job focused on sex. Too awkward, right?\n\nNot for Meika Hollender, who calls it \u201cinteresting\u201d working alongside her dad, Jeffrey, as they market their new condom brand, Sustain, which the father-daughter duo launched this past summer.\n\n\u201cWhen an uncomfortable moment comes up, I laugh it off \u2014 it might end up in my next blog post,\u201d she told the NY Daily News.\n\nSo how do a father and daughter end up working together in the condom industry? The business venture first started as an idea Jeffrey had 20 years ago to create a sustainable and eco-friendly condom. The approach involved using renewable resources from the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Hollender came up with the idea at a time during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, we were facing a greater AIDS crisis,\u201d Hollender told Medical Daily. \u201cThere are a number of different businesses trying to figure out how to keep the rainforest intact.\u201d\n\nHollender, the owner of Seventh Generation, an eco-friendly cleaning and personal care products company, approached the idea again a few years ago and pitched it to Meika with the intent of creating a brand that was more appealing to women. Meika, though hesitant at first, finally agreed to join her father, who wanted a young woman to help lead in the marketing process. Her decision was motivated by her surprise over how many of her peers, especially females, responded to the idea.\n\n\u201cWomen felt left out of the conversation about condoms,\u201d Meika told the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technology. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t relate to the marketing. Paired with that, as I talked with peers and asked about condom usage it was shocking that MBA women who are smart and successful weren\u2019t using condoms consistently when they had sex.\n\nWhen the two then set out to create their brand, though, they ran into some obstacles: for one, the fact that the Brazilian government had claimed the rainforest for its own resources.\n\n\u201cThere was no additional capacity,\u201d Hollender told Medical Daily. \u201cWe ended up using a plantation in Southern India.\u201d\n\nKerala, the plant\u2019s name, produces the condoms by extracting sap from trees, which it then sends to an eco-friendly facility that solidifies it through vulcanization. Kerala is the only plantation in the world that is fair trade certified, meaning it offers employees a decent wage, free education, and health care. It also does not rely on child labor. Finding the plant took six to nine months.\n\n\u201cIn the condom industry, Sustain is the only one using fair trade rubber,\u201d Katy Foley, an outside public relations consultant for Sustain, told Medical Daily.\n\nThe plant is also Forest Stewardship Council certified, meaning that it practices environmentally safe conservation tactics to protect forests and trees that the plant uses, thereby making the condom brand the first in the U.S. to be both fair trade and Forest-Stewardship Council certified.\n\nThe brand comes in three styles: Comfort Fit, Ultra-Thin, and Tailored Fit. The brand also has other \u201cgreen friendly\u201d qualities, including the fact it is a vegan product (uses no animal by-products) and is one of two out of the 10 most popular condom brands on the market that does not contain nitrosamine, a cancer-causing carcinogen linked to vaginal and cervical cancer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "condom, challenge, eco, friendly, ceo, jeffrey, hollender, and, daughter, team, produce", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "CEO Jeffrey Hollender and his daughter have created the first U.S. eco-friendly and \"sustainable\" condom brand, both fair trade and forest-council certified.", "title": "Father-Daughter Duo Teams Up To Create 'Sustainable' Condoms [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/condom-challenge-eco-friendly-ceo-jeffrey-hollender-and-daughter-team-produce-311526", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/20/jeffrey-and-meika-hollender.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CEO Jeffrey Hollender and his daughter have created the first U.S. eco-friendly and \"sustainable\" condom brand, both fair trade and forest-council certified.", "title": "Father-Daughter Duo Teams Up To Create 'Sustainable' Condoms [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/condom-challenge-eco-friendly-ceo-jeffrey-hollender-and-daughter-team-produce-311526", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/20/jeffrey-and-meika-hollender.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/20/jeffrey-and-meika-hollender.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-20T11:25:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T13:34:22-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "CEO Jeffrey Hollender and his daughter have created the first U.S. eco-friendly and \"sustainable\" condom brand, both fair trade and forest-council certified."}, "article_summary": "The business venture first started as an idea Jeffrey had 20 years ago to create a sustainable and eco-friendly condom.\nJeffrey and Meika Hollender are a father-daughter duo that have teamed up to create an eco-friendly, sustainable brand of condoms.\n\u201cWomen felt left out of the conversation about condoms,\u201d Meika told the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technology.\nNot for Meika Hollender, who calls it \u201cinteresting\u201d working alongside her dad, Jeffrey, as they market their new condom brand, Sustain, which the father-daughter duo launched this past summer.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, we were facing a greater AIDS crisis,\u201d Hollender told Medical Daily."}
