Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) in the general election.\n\nThe vote reflected the party\u2019s desire to coalesce around a candidate with wide appeal and the best chance of unseating Warner, a popular former governor and one-term senator.\n\nGillespie is a favorite of donors and party insiders, yet he has also won over many tea-party-influenced conservatives who last year chose candidates who struggled to appeal to Virginia\u2019s changing electorate.\n\nNow the one-time Republican National Committee chairman turns his attention to an uphill battle against Warner, who already has a huge leg up in fundraising and name recognition. But in a year when Democrats are vulnerable and the GOP is hoping to retake the Senate, the race will draw attention and money from across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have come into this hall through different doors, but we will leave this hall through one Republican door united in our principles to defeat Mark Warner and take back the Senate,\u201d Gillespie said during his convention speech, bringing much of the crowd to its feet. \u201cI will take our fight to Mark Warner, I will lead us to victory in the fall and we can turn our great country around again.\u201d\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nWarner issued a brief congratulations Saturday to his newly minted opponent.\n\n\u201cI congratulate Ed Gillespie on winning the Republican nomination and look forward to discussing our records and our plans to give everyone in the Commonwealth a fair shot,\u201d Warner said in a prepared statement. \u201cThat is the type of campaign Virginians want and deserve.\u201d\n\nVirginia Republicans \u2014 still smarting from the loss of all three statewide races on the ballot last year \u2014 came to Saturday\u2019s convention with winning on their minds.\n\nGillespie\u2019s leading rival, retired Air Force pilot Shak Hill, conceded before all the votes were counted, allowing the convention to nominate Gillespie by acclamation. Gillespie was leading by over 60 percent with about 90 percent of the votes counted, and he touted his rivals\u2019 concession as a show of unity in an often-fractious party.\n\nThe outcome was a disappointment to some conservatives.\n\n\u201cI really think Gillespie is a Washington insider and lobbyist,\u201d said Rosanne Reddin, a retired teacher from Williamsburg who wore a homemade T-shirt that read, \u201cWe need Shak on the Hill.\u201d \u201cVoting for him [Gillespie] is like voting for Warner. He\u2019s the establishment.\u201d\n\nThe video that played before Gillespie\u2019s remarks portrayed him as a \u201cproven leader,\u201d flashing clips of his frequent appearances on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d while showing a smiling Warner clasping hands with President Obama.\n\nGoing into the convention, Gillespie was the front-runner \u2014 ahead of Hill, congressional policy adviser Tony DeTora and businessman Chuck Moss.\n\nBut conventions are unpredictable, because only the most active and committed Republicans are willing to spend a beautiful June day inside a dark convention hall, making for a tense few hours. The 2,686 people who attended the convention represent about 1 percent of the 225,826 who voted in the GOP presidential primary in 2012.\n\nInside, vendors hawked everything from toilet tissue emblazoned with Obama\u2019s face to photos of Confederate generals. Delegates were also treated to a short film about Ronald Reagan.\n\nA convention-day pitch can make or break a candidate\u2019s chances, sometimes more than traditional measures of strength such as fundraising. Last year, the most poorly funded candidate for lieutenant governor, E.W. Jackson, wowed the crowd with a stirring endorsement of far-right values.\n\nYet Jackson\u2019s firebrand conservatism helped Democrats paint the entire Republican ticket last year, including gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli II and Sen. Mark D. Obenshain, the candidate for attorney general, as out of step with Virginia. Democrats went on to sweep all three statewide offices for the first time in 24 years.\n\nThis year, Jackson reprised his role as tea-party cheerleader, thrilling some in the crowd by endorsing Hill. In his speech, Hill criticized Gillespie\u2019s background as a lobbyist.\n\n\u201cWhen you lobby for big bank bailouts, there is no separation between you and Mark Warner,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats picked up on that line of attack after Hill and the other candidates closed ranks around Gillespie.\n\n\u201cMeet Ed Gillespie, a consummate Washington insider who is the Tea Party\u2019s newly appointed candidate to be Virginia\u2019s U.S. Senator,\u201d Robert Dempsey, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said in an e-mail. \u201cEd Gillespie\u2019s never been an elected official before but as a million-dollar lobbyist he\u2019s had plenty of opportunities to influence D.C. decision-makers.\u201d\n\nBuoyed by the win, Gillespie this week will tour the state in a recreational vehicle emblazoned with his blue-and-green logo.\n\nIn his speech before Saturday\u2019s vote, Gillespie tapped into Republican anger with Obama and linked Warner to the president and to Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who would lose his leadership role in the chamber if the GOP picks up enough seats in November.\n\n\u201cWe see the damaging effects of Obama-Reid-Warner policies all around us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that our policies based on free markets and free people and our constitutional principle of limited government would make things better for ourselves and our families and our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, Gillespie said he will \u201cfight any effort to increase our taxes\u201d and will stand with coal miners \u2014 a reference to new emissions standards rolled out by the Obama administration last week.\n\nHe also stressed his dedication to human life \u2014 \u201cwhich begins at conception and ends at natural death\u201d \u2014 and support for gun rights, two points the crowd rewarded with applause.\n\nThe New Jersey-born son of grocery-store owners, Gillespie started his political career on the lowest rung, parking cars in a Senate lot while attending Catholic University. In 1985, he was hired as press secretary to former Texas congressman Dick Armey, who \u2014 Gillespie notes in his 2006 book, \u201cWinning Right\u201d \u2014 played a key role in defeating then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s health-care proposal.\n\nGillespie later formed a lobbying firm, which he left eight years ago, sticking to strategic communications. Along the way, Karl Rove asked him to join the \u201cGang of Six,\u201d advising Bush, which Gillespie calls a group of \u201cparty insiders\u201d in his book. He helped write former House speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract With America, ran the RNC and was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential bid.\n\nDemocrats pointed out on Saturday that Gillespie\u2019s official convention biography left out any mention of his lobbying days.\n\nWarner has a 4-to-1 fundraising advantage in a race in which outside groups could make the difference. Gillespie helped found Crossroads GPS with Rove but more recently has played down his role in the organization.\n\n\u201cWhat they or any other organization does is up to those organizations,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cMy view is I\u2019ve got to run my campaign and I\u2019ve got to raise the resources for me to get the message to the voters of Virginia on my own, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m preparing to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans gather in Roanoke Saturday to pick candidate to face Sen.
