Ted Cruz for his government shutdown tactics, not his tea party ideology, New York Times columnist David Brooks said on NPR\u2019s Friday edition of \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d\n\nBrooks reacted to an interview Cruz gave to ABC News, in which he justified the tactical maneuvers he supported to take on Obamacare that led to the federal government shutdown.\n\nCruz had told ABC\u2019s Jon Karl he didn\u2019t come to Washington, D.C. to make friends, but instead be appreciated by his constituents in Texas. Brooks said Cruz certainly accomplished that \u2014 but not for the reasons he might think.\n\n\u201cIf Cruz wanted to be reviled in Washington, mission accomplished,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI was in the Senate dining room the other morning having breakfast with somebody and he walked into the room and the temperature dropped about 50 degrees. I had like an omelet sorbet sitting there. So he is disliked and mostly because of incompetence, not for ideology. He led people in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nBrooks predicted that the so-called Republican establishment will make a comeback against the tea party in the wake of the fallout from the shutdown.\n\n\u201cI think the big story here is that the Republicans really have begun to shift,\u201d he continued. \u201cSomeone said recently that the worst were full of furious intensity and the best lacked all conviction. The best, meaning, I would say, the Republican reality caucus have a little furious intensity to speak back at the tea party and so the establishment has got a little muscle for the first time in a little while, or at least some resolve.\u201d\n\nBrooks also said the shutdown fallout gives President Barack Obama an opening to pursue immigration reform and the chance to score a political points regardless if he is successful in that pursuit.\n\n\u201cAnd frankly, if I were the president, I would go right into immigration reform,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the moderate Republicans or the realistic Republicans are in charge, then they get a big substantive win. We actually get this immigration reform done. If the Tea Party is still in charge, then the president gets a big political win because the Republicans will vote it down.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "The New York Times columnist believes the shutdown gives Obama a chance to pursue immigration reform and score political points.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Many Republicans despise Texas Republican Sen.
