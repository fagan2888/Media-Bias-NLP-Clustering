I think we have a cause, a cause to be defended,\u201d Zubik said. \u201c(Scalia) has been outspoken for as many years as he's been on the court for the preservation of religious freedom. It's not only a loss on this case. It's a loss around the whole issue of religious freedom.\u201d\n\nZubik and the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh contend a mandate in President Obama's health care law infringes on religious freedom by requiring employers to provide coverage that includes birth control or to sign an opt-out form created for religious institutions, nonprofits and others that object.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie and Geneva College, a Beaver Falls school affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, and six religious organizations across the country joined the suit. The Diocese of Greensburg has filed a similar challenge. Its case is on hold pending the outcome of Pittsburgh's case.\n\nScalia, a Catholic who ruled against the government in a similar case involving Hobby Lobby in 2014, died Saturday. His vote could have secured a 5-4 victory for the church.\n\nScalia's death and the vacancy on the court set up a scenario in which the remaining eight justices could deadlock at 4-4. In that case, the justices could affirm the decision of the lower courts \u2014 which ruled against the church \u2014 or put the case on hold until the court's next term.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the better that we could have a favorable decision, that is what I would like to see,\u201d Zubik said.\n\nThe Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is not complying with the health care law under an order issued in April by Justice Samuel Alito. Zubik believes Alito's stay will continue until the Supreme Court rules. The church otherwise would face fines for not complying with the contraception mandate.\n\nJohn D. Goetz, an attorney with the Downtown law firm Jones Day, which is representing the church, said his team is pressing ahead as planned and preparing to argue the case before the court March 23.\n\nZubik said he will send letters to clergy throughout the diocese asking them to hold a special time for prayer on March 23.\n\nAaron Aupperlee is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
