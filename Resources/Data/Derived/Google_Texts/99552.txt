BUTTE, Mont. -

Sen. John Walsh stopped in Butte Friday to talk about small business and jobs.

Business owners asked Walsh about the Affordable Care Act, how to best create what they call a Manufacturing Center of Excellence, and how to keep natural resource jobs.

Walsh said what he heard will help him shape policy.

"What can we do in Washington, D.C., to make it easier for small businesses here in Montana and all across the country to grow because the small businesses, the small medium size businesses, really are the economic engine to this country," said Walsh.

Walsh said when he heads back to Washington he wants to take a look at small business paperwork requirements, like GSA contracts, to reduce what is required.
