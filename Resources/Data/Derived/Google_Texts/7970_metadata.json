But the appeals court refused to assign the case on remand to a new judge, despite the trial court judge\u2019s \u201cdistinct way of proceeding in court.\u201d\n\nThe appellate opinion by Judge Henry Floyd said the trial judge did not give appropriate deference to federal regulations, which interpret Title IX to require schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe trial judge withheld a ruling on the equal protection claim, and the 4th Circuit did not consider the issue.\n\nThe student\u2019s high school initially allowed the teen to use the boys\u2019 restroom. But community members complained, prompting the school board to require the school to provide a separate, private facility for transgender students. The student complains that the separate restrooms make him feel stigmatized and he avoids using the restroom at school, which has caused multiple urinary tract infections.\n\nLawyers for the teen did not explicitly claim the trial judge, U.S. District Court Judge, Robert Doumar, is biased. But based on the judge\u2019s views about gender and sexuality, attorneys for the student sought a new judge.\n\n\u201cThe trial judge called gender dysphoria a \u201cmental disorder\u201d and rejected lawyers\u2019 attempts to clarify that it only becomes a disorder when untreated,\u201d the appeals court said. The judge also expressed concern about restroom \u201cmating,\u201d saying there are only two instincts: self-preservation and procreation.\n\nThe appeals court said, \u201cDespite the judge\u2019s views of medical facts and skepticism of the student\u2019s claims, the record does not clearly indicate he would refuse to consider contrary evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, although the district court has a distinct way of proceeding in court, the hearing record and the district court\u2019s written order in the case do not raise in our minds a question about the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, however idiosyncratic,\u201d the appeals court went on to say.\n\nIn a concurrence, Judge Andre Davis said the appeals court would have been justified in granting the preliminary injunction based on the facts in the record.\n\nA third judge agreed with the decision to keep the trial judge on the case. \u201cThe appeals court majority completely tramples on all universally accepted protections of privacy and safety that are based on the anatomical differences between the sexes,\u201d Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote.\n\nSource: Transgender teen may sue over school\u2019s restroom restriction, 4th Circuit says\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "The 4th Circuit has reinstated a Title IX claim by a transgender teen who sued over his school\u2019s refusal to allow him to use the boys\u2019 restroom.
