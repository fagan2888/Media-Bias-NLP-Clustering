Once meant to serve as a destination for homeless resources, over the last decade, the area has become what homeless advocates call a dumping ground where hospitals leave still-sick, destitute patients to fend for themselves.\n\nThe LA City Council centralized its homeless services there in the \u201970s, prompting the birth of a neighborhood that would later maintain the nation\u2019s most centralized homeless population\u2014 by some estimates, nearly 2,000 people.\n\nThe problem of homeless patient dumping\u2014 or failing to make continued care arrangements when a patient is well enough to leave the hospital but too ill to return to the streets\u2014 is only fueling Southern California\u2019s homeless problem, argue advocates familiar with the issue.\n\nPaul Gregerson is the chief medical officer at the John Wesley Community Health Institute in Los Angeles, which operates nine clinics, two of which tend to the homeless. Its clinic in Skid Row sees 8,000 unduplicated patients and manages 25,000 medical visits per year.\n\nGregerson recalled a schizophrenic patient who arrived at the institute last fall after being discharged from a hospital with only 30 days\u2019 worth of medication. The drugs were essential for quieting the voices in the man\u2019s head that demanded he hurt himself, but as he bounced from the hospital to an urgent care facility and finally a midnight mission, he ran out of his pills. The voices returned, and the man became suicidal.\n\n\u201cWe put him on the medications he needed and set him up with the Department of Mental Health\u2014 this was six months after he tried to hurt himself,\u201d Gregerson told FoxNews.com.\n\nStopping patient dumping\n\nAlthough alleged reports of homeless patient dumping span from Alabama to Nevada, perhaps no state has gotten more flak for the issue than California. The problem in California can partially be attributed to the state\u2019s limited affordable housing as well as its high concentration of the homeless, Gregerson said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), California\u2019s homeless population accounts for 22 percent, or about 136,830 people, of the nation\u2019s total homeless population. California is one of six states where more than half of the homeless population is living in an unsheltered location\u2014 that\u2019s about 91,000 people, according to a 2013 HUD report, the most recent data available.\n\nLA City Attorney Mike Feuer has filed multiple lawsuits against hospitals for alleged homeless patient dumping. He filed his latest in April against a hospital for allegedly dumping a 38-year-old schizophrenic homeless woman, wearing only paper pajamas, on Skid Row. Various reports from the past decade allege similar cases: a hospital van in 2007 dropping off a paraplegic man on Skid Row, leaving him crawling in the street wrapped in a soiled gown and a broken colostomy bag; and another female patient in 2006 transported by taxi cab to the area wearing only a hospital gown and slippers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories of [hospitals] busing people to Skid Row, giving them a one-way ticket or almost putting pressure on them, or discharging them at 2 in the morning\u2014 just really kind of mean-spirited ways of, \u2018You\u2019re done with us; don\u2019t come back,\u2019\u201d Paul Leon, CEO of the Illumination Foundation, in Irvine, Calif., which runs three respite care centers, told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act docks Medicare and Medicaid payment to hospitals that have excessive readmissions of patients within a 30-day window. But Leon pointed out that often, when homeless people aren\u2019t insured and don\u2019t have family, cases of patient dumping go unnoticed in the first place.\n\nAccording to a 2014 National Coalition for the Homeless survey of 142 multiethnic homeless people, nearly half reported feeling discriminated against by a medical professional.\n\nA two-way struggle\n\nCaring for an uninsured homeless patient in the emergency room costs an average of $2,000 a day, but admitting a homeless patient to the hospital can pose challenges that extend beyond a financial burden.\n\nBecause homeless patients often have multiple chronic diagnoses, including trauma and mental health illnesses, hospitals typically have two choices when admitting them: caring for them about twice as long as typical patients or\u2014 if community resources are lacking\u2014 discharging them inappropriately, said John Lozier, executive director of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rock in a hard place for hospitals, and we certainly understand the difficulties they face with that,\u201d Lozier told FoxNews.com. \u201c[Homeless people] can\u2019t do what other people do, which is recuperate at home.\u201d\n\nA common factor in most alleged homeless patient dumping stories is likely noncompliance, said Jennifer Bayer, vice president of external affairs for the Hospital Association of Southern California, which represents private and public for-profit hospitals. She noted that federal law prohibits hospitals from detaining patients or transporting them anywhere, even medical respite care centers, against their will.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest challenges that the public misses\u2014 that hospitals aren\u2019t prisons, and the law follows the right to the patient. And the patient has the right to refuse medication, to refuse housing, and go where they want regardless,\u201d she said.\n\nBayer\u2019s organization partners with Homeless Health Care Los Angeles to run training programs in local hospitals to help educate discharge planners and social workers about available community services. But she added that, due to the challenging nature of discharge planning, as well as the lower average salary compared to other health care jobs, the position typically has a high turnover rate in hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating for us because we get the bad rap on this, but our hands are very much tied, too,\u201d Bayer said.\n\nEven when the proper resources and staff are on hand, admitting the homeless to the emergency room comes with problems as simple as getting a patient\u2019s real name. \u201cIn most cases, they don\u2019t give their real name, and have no address or make stuff up,\u201d Bayer said.\n\nDaniel Castillo, CEO of LAC+USC Medical Center, the largest health care provider in LA County, said that how hospitals and downstream providers like medical respite care centers are reimbursed can play a role in the issue of homeless patient dumping.\n\nAccording to the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, medical respite programs use a patchwork of local grants and other one-time-only funding to run their residential and health services, while health centers that are federally qualified are able to bill Medicaid and Medicare for reimbursement.\n\nBridging the gap\n\nLozier\u2019s organization, which provides training and resources to health workers who care for the homeless, has developed 70 medical respite care facilities and counting across the United States.\n\nThe California Health and Safety Code requires hospitals to have a discharge policy in place, and recommends hospitals send recovering homeless patients to a medical respite center like the one Lozier\u2019s organization runs. Those centers can be a freestanding facility, a homeless shelter, a nursing home or transitional housing.\n\nDetermining the appropriate place to send homeless patients and having a system in place are the two main keys to preventing homeless patient dumping, homeless advocates say.\n\n\u201cThere are more homeless in LA \u2026 but there hasn\u2019t been a community-wide collaborative effort between hospitals and other key players to develop protocols and establish them\u2014 implementing how patients can be discharged, under what conditions and to where,\u201d Gregerson said.\n\nEqually important, Gregerson said, is ensuring the patient is signed up for Medicaid and has a primary care provider. In 2014, the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid coverage to those under 65 years old who have incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is even though the Affordable Care Act has made health care available not based on socioeconomic status, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone\u2019s accessing it,\u201d Gregerson said. \u201cSo this is a prime opportunity to get people to access the system because then every single patient that\u2019s discharged will go back to their primary care provider on a follow-up basis, long term.\u201d\n\nTaking that step can help hospitals avoid exorbitant costs, said Leon, of the Illumination Foundation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a hospital and you discharge a homeless patient to the street, and they never make their first follow-up with a physician, they\u2019re 92 percent more likely to show back up at the hospital for the same thing,\u201d Leon said.\n\nOrange County had previously hired Castillo, of the LAC+USC Medical Center, as an administrative manager in 2006 to run the area\u2019s Health Care Agency\u2019s Medical Services Initiative (MSI). MSI was funded with federal and county dollars and helped create an electronic health care system called Safety Net Connect. Hospitals and physicians can use the web-based program to help monitor homeless patients\u2019 health as well as the health of patients who are sheltered but uninsured. In 2007, 12,000 patients were enrolled, and by 2011, 65,000 were enrolled, Castillo said.\n\nUsing electronic medical records can help streamline discharge procedures when hospitals admit homeless patients, Castillo pointed out.\n\nA lack of funding\n\nHospitals and homeless advocates agree that carrying out discharge policies and executing patient tracking depends first on the employment of a discharge planner, as well as a designated team of social workers who specialize in trauma and mental health counseling.\n\nLozier, with the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, noted that because many homeless patients have multiple diagnoses, as well as poor health literacy, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for hospitals to muster the resources to address those issues comprehensively.\u201d\n\n\u201cHospitals need to be able to make discharge plans that clients understand, \u201che said. \u201cThat does come down to a one-on-one situation with social workers and discharge planners understanding both the capabilities involved and the community resources, which end up being the problem. The first part of that is doable, but the community resources are simply lacking.\u201d\n\nHe said the growing movement to develop medical care respite centers since the 1980s, when homelessness exploded in the U.S., has the potential to prevent homeless patient dumping, but ultimately that the issues in California are rooted in a lack of funding across the board.\n\n\u201cThe problem for hospitals is they\u2019re not in a position to guarantee housing\u2014 that\u2019s not their job. It\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s ultimate responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThe responsibility really lies with the broader economic and political housing, and making sure people have adequate income.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Medications,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-18 11:59:26 EDT",
