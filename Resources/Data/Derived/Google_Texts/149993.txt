A woman is charged with battery in Walton County after an argument over beach property rights.

Walton County sheriff's deputies arrested Edie Batt after they say she became upset with a woman who Batt believed was sitting on her private property near Miramar Beach.

Sheriff's officials say Batt slapped the woman's cell phone out of her hand after she tried to record the argument.

The cell phone video was used as evidence and officials say the woman was not trespassing.
