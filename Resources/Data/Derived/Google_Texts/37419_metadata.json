Photo: AP\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored a long-range goal worthy of the recently awarded Ballon d\u2019Or to spark Real Madrid\u2019s 5-0 rout at Real Betis, provisionally lifting his team level with the leaders of the Spanish league on Saturday.\n\nRonaldo netted one of his signature free kicks in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday to celebrate being named the world player of the year, and he topped that with a 25-metre blast on the run in the 10thminute in Seville.\n\nGareth Bale followed Ronaldo\u2019s rocket with a delicately placed free kick in the 25th minute for his first goal since November 30, leaving the hosts demoralised and in tatters at the back. Karim Benzema, Angel Di Maria and Alvaro Morata all scored before the demolition of bottom-side Betis was over.\n\nBarcelona and Atletico Madrid can both regain their advantage over Madrid when they play matches on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Everything went our way,\u2019\u2019 Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. \u2018\u2018It was an important opportunity to reach the top of the table. At least we can sleep well tonight.\u2019\u2019\n\nBetis were left eight points from safety just past the league\u2019s midway mark after Elche earned their first win in six rounds by beating 10-man Rayo Vallecano 2-0 at home.\n\nEntering the match on a 12-game winless streak and showing no improvement since Juan Carlos Garrido replaced Pepe Mel as their coach, Betis desperately needed to repeat their 1-0 win over Madrid from last season. But Madrid dominated possession from the start, and the talent of Ronaldo and company soon crushed any hopes of an upset.\n\nOsasuna, meanwhile, was outplayed at Granada but held on to draw 0-0.\n\nAncelotti said he would ask Ronaldo \u2018\u2018for more\u2019\u2019 after he won his second Ballon d\u2019Or on Monday, and his star forward has certainly done that with two superb goals in a week to help his team advance past Osasuna in the Copa del Rey and tighten the league title race.\n\nRonaldo was aggressive as ever from the start against Betis and his effort paid off when he unleashed a right-foot strike while dribbling at full speed that sailed past goalkeeper Stephan Andersen. The shot increased Ronaldo\u2019s league-leading tally to 21 goals in 20 rounds. He has 31 goals in 26 appearances overall this season for Madrid.\n\nBale turned Andersen into a helpless bystander for a second time when he lifted a free kick over the wall before it suddenly dipped down and into the net.\n\nLuka Modric then set up Benzema\u2019s goal in first-half stoppage time when he pounced on a loose ball, drew three defenders to him, changed direction and crossed for the striker to slot home. It was Benzema\u2019s 100th goal in his fifth season at Madrid.\n\nAncelotti praised the work of Modric and fellow midfielder Xabi Alonso for triggering Madrid\u2019s lethal attack.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema were very efficient. The entire team game them several scoring option because we played at a fast pace,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The help of our midfielders, above all Modric, was very important.\u2019\u2019\n\nAndersen denied Ronaldo one-on-one after half time, but he couldn\u2019t stop Di Maria from sending a rebound from outside the area skidding just inside the upright in the 62nd minute.\n\nSubstitute Morata scored the fifth in the 90th minute.\n\nElche was up a goal and a player from the 19th minute when Edu Albacar converted a penalty after Rayo\u2019s Raul Baena was red-carded for fouling Ferran Corominas in the box. Javi Marquez sealed the victory in the 79th to leave Rayo in the relegation zone.\n\nGranada mustered nine shots on goal to Osasuna\u2019s one but came no closer than Jose Recio\u2019s shot off the post in the 20th.\n\nAP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Soccer", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored a long-range goal worthy of the recently awarded Ballon d&rsquo;Or to spark Real Madrid&rsquo;s 5-0 rout at Real Betis, provisionally lifting his team level with the leaders of the Spanish league on Saturday.", "title": "Ronaldo celebrates Ballon d\u2019Or with a blast to put Real back in title race", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/ronaldo-celebrates-ballon-dor-with-a-blast-to-put-real-back-in-title-race-20140119-312vi.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/1/2/k/4/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.312vi.png/1390123710607.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/1/2/k/4/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.312vi.png/1390123710607.jpg"}, "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored a long-range goal worthy of the recently awarded Ballon d\u2019Or to spark Real Madrid\u2019s 5-0 rout at Real Betis, provisionally lifting his team level with the leaders of the Spanish league on Saturday.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ronaldo celebrates Ballon d\u2019Or with a blast to put Real back in title race"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored a long-range goal worthy of the recently awarded Ballon d\u2019Or to spark Real Madrid\u2019s 5-0 rout at Real Betis, provisionally ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2df\"", "article_summary": "Rocket man: Ronaldo scored in Real\u2019s 5-0 victory.\nPhoto: APCristiano Ronaldo scored a long-range goal worthy of the recently awarded Ballon d\u2019Or to spark Real Madrid\u2019s 5-0 rout at Real Betis, provisionally lifting his team level with the leaders of the Spanish league on Saturday.\nBut Madrid dominated possession from the start, and the talent of Ronaldo and company soon crushed any hopes of an upset.\nKarim Benzema, Angel Di Maria and Alvaro Morata all scored before the demolition of bottom-side Betis was over.\nBarcelona and Atletico Madrid can both regain their advantage over Madrid when they play matches on Sunday."}
