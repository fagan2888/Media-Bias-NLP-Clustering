FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) - General Electric Co. says it is postponing a decision until next month about whether it will move its headquarters from Fairfield.

The corporate giant had previously said it planned to decide by the end of 2015 whether to leave Connecticut. About 800 employees are located at the headquarters.

A company spokesman told the Hartford Courant (http://cour.at/1PgpwMc ) Friday that top GE officials now expect “to make a decision in January.” GE did not give a reason for the postponement.

In June, GE publicly complained about higher business taxes included in an initial version of the new state budget. The company announced it was searching for a more business-friendly state.

Connecticut lawmakers have since scaled back those tax increases and made other changes. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy recently met with GE officials.
