Tom Coburn\u2019s (R-Okla.) claim that he lost coverage for his cancer specialist because of Obamacare is \u201cgarbage,\u201d according to the New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a garbage story, it really is,\u201d Krugman said Tuesday night on CNN.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally misleading story,\u201d Krugman continued. \u201cIt\u2019s, you know \u2014 nobody has ever found that their private insurer has told them the doctor they were using is no longer in the network.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally misleading story.\u201d Share:\n\nCoburn, who was diagnosed recently with a recurrence of prostate cancer, said Tuesday that his Obamacare plan does not cover his oncologist, forcing him to pay out of pocket.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing well from a health standpoint, got great docs,\u201d Coburn told the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cFortunately \u2014 even though my new coverage won\u2019t cover my specialist \u2014 I\u2019m going to have great care and I have a great prognosis.\u201d\n\nThe Oklahoma senator announced earlier this month that he will retire when his term expires.\n\nA spokesman later confirmed to Politico that the senator lost coverage for his cancer specialist after enrolling in Obamacare.\n\nBut Krugman believes this is \u201cgarbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is, Clinton talked healthcare and didn\u2019t happen; Obama talked healthcare and it did happen. And it\u2019s not going to be reversed. And that\u2019s the important news here. He knows he\u2019s got it; Republicans know he\u2019s got it,\u201d he said.\n\nCoburn\u2019s office pushed back on Krugman\u2019s criticisms, accusing the left-leaning economist of \u201cacting out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s experiencing an intellectual crisis due to Obamacare\u2019s failures. A policy he supported is causing Americans to lose not only their doctors but their specialists and treatments,\u201d Coburn communications director John Hart told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nCoburn announced Monday a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe hope the White House will work with us to make sure Americans who can\u2019t afford to pay out of pocket don\u2019t lose access to life-saving care,\u201d Hart explained in a statement to Politico. \u201cAs Dr. Coburn\u2019s experience shows, the American people are about to learn they\u2019re going to lose access to not only their doctors and plans, but their specialists and treatments.\u201d\n\nThe senator has also battled prostate cancer and melanoma.\n\nCoburn\u2019s office did not immediately respond to TheBlaze\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 24, "twitter": {"description": "Sen.
