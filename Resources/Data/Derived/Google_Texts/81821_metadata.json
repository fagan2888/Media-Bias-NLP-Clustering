Many of those patients are probably using the emergency room now, Ansede said.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a number of those patients that now have a choice because now they can get into an after-hours urgent care,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of that demand might be coming from people who got health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Davis said.\n\n\u201cThey are probably going to start looking around for a primary care physician, and they are going to find out there aren\u2019t a lot of them out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ones that are out there are typically pretty full up. This gives those folks an opportunity to get primary care immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Prompt Care was designed so that a physician practice could be added later, Ansede said.\n\n\u201cWe know there is primary care shortage in Aiken so we know people are looking for docs,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Seeing a need for care in Aiken, University Hospital is moving to add a Prompt Care in Aiken.", "title": "University to add Aiken Prompt Care", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2014-08-28/university-add-aiken-prompt-care", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/13661803.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe56\"", "article_summary": "University\u2019s boards voted Thurs\u00adday to spend almost $2.7 million to open Aiken Prompt Care on 7.2 acres it already owned on Silver Bluff Drive in Aiken.\n\u201cWe know there is primary care shortage in Aiken so we know people are looking for docs,\u201d he said.\nUniversity already gets about a third of its patients from Aiken County and there is a shortage of primary care providers in Aiken, Davis said.\nThis gives those folks an opportunity to get primary care immediately.\u201dThe Prompt Care was designed so that a physician practice could be added later, Ansede said.\n\u201cThere are huge demands for primary care in that market,\u201d he said."}
