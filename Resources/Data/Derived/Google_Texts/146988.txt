Topeka police say a fleeing motorcyclist has died after colliding with a pole.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that the crash happened late Friday night. Police Lt. Joe Perry said in a news release that the motorcyclist who was killed was 42-year-old Joseph A. Thomas.

Police attempted to stop Thomas at 10:26 p.m. for a turn violation. He sped away, initiating a pursuit. But after just a minute, officers terminated the chase as Thomas passed Interstate 70 northbound, driving over 80 mph.

Perry says that soon afterward, officers discovered the motorcycle had collided with a light pole. Thomas was transported to a hospital, where emergency room doctors declared him dead at 10:59 p.m.
