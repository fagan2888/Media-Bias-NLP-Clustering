(The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Obama addressed the nation Monday, five years after the 2008 financial crisis, to reflect on the nation's recovery after the \"worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\" He also commented on the situation in Syria and the Navy Yard shooting. (The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Obama delivered the following remarks addressing the fifth anniversary of the 2008 economic collapse on September 16.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Good afternoon, everybody.\n\nPlease have a seat. Before I begin, let me say a few words about the tragedy that\u2019s unfolding not far away from here, at the Washington Navy Yard. That\u2019s part of why our event today was delayed.\n\nI\u2019ve been briefed by my team on the situation. We still don\u2019t know all the facts. But we do know that several people have been shot, and some have been killed. So we are confronting yet another mass shooting. And today it happened on a military installation in our nation\u2019s capital. It\u2019s a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel.\n\nThese are men and women who were going to work, going their job protecting all of us. They\u2019re patriots. And they know the dangers of serving abroad, but today they faced the unimaginable violence that they wouldn\u2019t have expected here at home.\n\nSo we offer our gratitude to the Navy and local law enforcement, federal authorities and the doctors who\u2019ve responded with skill and bravery. I\u2019ve made it clear to my team that I want the investigation to be seamless so that federal and local authorities are working together. And as this investigation moves forward, we will do everything in our power to make sure whoever carried out this cowardly act is held responsible.\n\nIn the meantime, we send our thoughts and prayers to all at the Navy Yard who\u2019ve been touched by this tragedy. We thank them for their service. We stand with the families of those who\u2019ve been harmed. They\u2019re gonna need our love and support.\n\nAnd as we learn more about the courageous Americans who died today, their lives, their families, their patriotism, we will honor their service to the nation they helped to make great. And obviously, we\u2019re gonna be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them.\n\nNow, in recent weeks, much of our attention's been focused on the events in Syria, the horrible use of chemical weapons on innocent people including children, the need for a firm response from the international community and over the weekend, we took an important step in that direction towards moving Syria's chemical weapons under international control so that they can be destroyed. And we're not there yet. But if properly implemented, this agreement could end the threat these weapons pose not only to the Syrian people, but to the world.\n\nI want to be clear though that, even as we've dealt with the situation in Syria, we've continued to focus on my number one priority since the day I took office, making sure we recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, and rebuilding our economy so it works for everybody who's willing to work hard, so that everybody who is willing to take responsibility for their lives has a chance to get ahead.\n\nIt was five years ago, this week, that the financial crisis rocked Wall Street, and sent an economy already into recession, into a tail spin. And it's hard sometimes to remember everything that happened during those -- those months, but in a matter of a frightening few days and weeks, some of the largest investment banks in the world failed, stock markets plunged, banks stopped lending to families and small businesses, our auto industry -- the heartbeat of American manufacturing -- was flat-lining.\n\nBy the time I took office, the economy was shrinking by an annual rate of more than 8 percent. Our businesses were shedding 800,000 jobs each month. It was a perfect storm that would rob millions of Americans of jobs and homes and savings that they had worked a lifetime to build.\n\nAnd it also laid bare the long erosion of a middle class that for more than a decade has had to work harder and harder just to keep up. In fact, most Americans who\u2019ve known economic hardship these past several years, they don\u2019t think about the collapse of Lehman Brothers when they think about the recession. Instead, they recall the day they got the gut punch of a pink slip or the day that a bank took away their home, the day they got sick but didn\u2019t have health insurance, or the day they had to sit their daughter or son down and tell him or her that they couldn\u2019t afford to send their child back to college the next semester.\n\nAnd so those are the stories that guided everything we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s what those earliest days of the crisis caused us to act so quickly through the Recovery Act to arrest the downward spiral and put a floor under the fall. We put people to work, repairing roads and bridges, to keep teachers in our classrooms, our first responders on the streets. We helped responsible homeowners modify their mortgages so that more of them could keep their homes. We helped jump-start the flow of credit to help more small businesses keep their doors open. We saved the American auto industry.\n\nAnd as we worked to stabilize the economy and get it growing and creating jobs again, we also started pushing back against the trends that have been battering the middle class for decades, so we took on a broken health care system, we invested in new American technologies to end our addiction to foreign oil, we put in place tough new rules on big banks, rules that we need to finalize before the end of the year, by the way, to make sure that the job is done, and we put in new protections that crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies.\n\nWe also changed a tax code that was too skewed in favor of the wealthiest Americans. We locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. We asked those at the top to pay a little bit more.\n\nSo if you add it all up, over the last three-and-a-half years, our businesses have added 7.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has come down. Our housing market is healing. Our financial system is safer. We sell more goods made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We generate more renewable energy than ever before. We produce more natural gas than anybody. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And just two weeks from now, millions of Americans who\u2019ve been locked out of buying health insurance just because they had a pre-existing condition, just because they had been sick or they couldn\u2019t afford it, they\u2019re finally going to have a chance to buy quality affordable health care on the private marketplace.\n\nAnd what all this means is, we\u2019ve cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we\u2019ve begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity. And in our personal lives, I think a lot of us understand that people have tightened their belts, shed debt, refocused on the things that really matter. All of this happened because ultimately the resilience and the grit of the American people. And we should be proud of that. And on this five- year anniversary, we should take note of how far we\u2019ve come from where we were five years ago.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the story. As any middle-class family will tell you or anybody who\u2019s striving to get into the middle class, we are not yet where we need to be.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to focus on: All the remaining work that needs to be done to strengthen this economy. We need to grow faster. We need more good-paying jobs. We need more broad-based prosperity. We need more ladders of opportunity for people who are currently poor, but want to get into the middle class.\n\nBecause even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, the top 1 percent of Americans took home 20 percent of the nation\u2019s income last year, while the average worker isn\u2019t seeing a raise at all.\n\nIn fact, that understates the problem. Most of the gains have gone to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. So in many ways, the trends that have taken hold over the past few decades of a winner-take-all economy, where a few do better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water or loses ground, those trends have been made worse by the recession.\n\nThat\u2019s where we should be focused on. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. That\u2019s what I know the Americans standing beside me, as well as all of you out there are focused on.\n\nAnd as Congress begins another budget debate, that\u2019s what Congress should be focused on: How do we grow the economy faster; how do we create better jobs; how do we increased wages and incomes; how do we increase opportunity for those that have been locked out of opportunity; how do we create better retirement security?\n\nThat\u2019s where we should be focused on, because the stakes for our middle class and everybody who\u2019s fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher.\n\nIn today\u2019s hypercompetitive world, we have to make the investments necessary to attract good jobs that pay good wages and offer high standards of living.\n\nAnd although ultimately our success will depend on all the innovation and hard work of our private sector -- all that grit and resilience of the American people -- government is going to have a critical role in making sure we have education system that prepares our children and our workers for a global economy. The budget Congress passes will determine whether we can hire more workers to upgrade our transportation and communications networks, or fund the kinds of research and development that have always kept America on the cutting edge.\n\nSo what happens here in Washington makes a difference. What happens up on Capitol Hill is going to help determine not only the pace of our growth, but also the quality of jobs, the quality of opportunity, for this generation and future generations.\n\nThe problem is -- at the moment, Republicans in Congress don\u2019t seem to be focused on how to growth economy and build the middle class. I say, at the moment, because I am still hoping that a light bulb goes off here. So far, their budget ideas revolve primarily around even deeper cuts to education, even deeper cuts that would gut America\u2019s scientific research and development, even deeper cuts to America\u2019s infrastructure investment -- our roads, our bridges, our schools our energy grid. These aren\u2019t the policies that would grow the economy faster.\n\nThey\u2019re not the policies that would grow the middle class. In fact, they would do the opposite. Up until now, Republicans have argued that these cuts are necessary in the name of fiscal responsibility, but our deficits are now falling at the fastest rate since the end of World War II. I want to repeat that. Our deficits are going down faster than any time since before I was born. By the end of this year...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBy the end of this year, we will have cut our deficits by more than half since I took office. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t still have some long-term fiscal challenges, primarily because the population\u2019s getting older, and they\u2019re using more health care services. And so we\u2019ve still got some changes that we\u2019ve got to make. And there\u2019s not a government agency or program out there that still can\u2019t be streamlined, become more customer-friendly, more efficient.\n\nSo I do believe we should cut our programs that we don\u2019t need. We need to fix ones that aren\u2019t working the way they\u2019re supposed to or have outlived their initial mission. We\u2019ve got to make government faster and more efficient.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what is being proposed by the Republican budgets. Instead of making necessary changes with a scalpel, so far at least, Republicans have chosen to leave in place the so-called sequester cuts that have cost jobs, harmed growth, are hurting our military readiness.\n\nAnd top independent economists say this has been a big drag on our recovery this year. Our economy\u2019s not growing as fast as it should, and we\u2019re not creating as many jobs as we should because the sequester\u2019s in place.\n\nThat\u2019s not my opinion. That\u2019s the opinion of independent economists. The sequester makes it harder to do what\u2019s required, to boost wages for American workers. The economy is still slack.\n\nSo, if Republicans want the economy to grow faster, create more jobs faster, they should want to get rid of it. It\u2019s irresponsible to keep it in place. And if Congress is serious about wanting to grow the economy faster and creating jobs faster, the first order of business must be to pass a sensible budget that replaces the sequester with a balanced plan that is both fiscally sound and funds investments like education and basic research and infrastructure that we need to grow.\n\nThis is not asking too much. Congress\u2019 most fundamental job is passing a budget. And Congress needs to get it done without triggering another crisis, without shutting down our government, or worse, threatening not to pay this country\u2019s bill.\n\nAfter all the progress that we\u2019ve made over these past four-and- a-half years, the idea of reversing that progress because of an unwillingness to compromise or because of some ideological agenda is the height of irresponsibility. It\u2019s not what the American people need right now.\n\nThese folks standing behind me, these are people who are small business owners; people who almost lost their home; young people trying to get a college education. And all of them went through some real tough times during the recession. And in part because of the steps we took, and primarily because of their courage and determination and hard work, they\u2019re in a better place now.\n\nThe last thing they\u2019re looking for is for us to go back to the same kind of crisis situations that we\u2019ve had in the past. And the single-most important thing we can do to prevent that is for Congress to pass a budget without drama that puts us on a sound path for growth, jobs, better wages, better incomes.\n\nNow, look, it\u2019s never been easy to get 535 people here in Washington to agree on anything. And, you know, budget battles and debates, those are as old as the republic. It\u2019s even harder when you have divided government, and right now, you\u2019ve got Republicans controlling the House of Representatives and Democrats controlling the Senate and a Democrat in the White House. So this is always going to be tough.\n\nHaving said that, I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it can\u2019t get 100 percent of what it wants. That\u2019s never happened before. But that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now.\n\nYou have some Republicans in the House of Representatives who are promising to shut down the government at the end of this month if they can\u2019t shut down the Affordable Care Act. And if that scheme doesn\u2019t work, some have suggested they won\u2019t pay the very bills that Congress has already run up, which would cause America to default on its debt for the first time in our history and would create massive economic turmoil, interest rates on ordinary people would shoot up. Those kinds of actions are the kind of actions that we don\u2019t need.\n\nThe last time the same grew threatened this course of action back in 2011, even the mere suggestion of default slowed our economic growth. Everybody here remembers that; it wasn\u2019t that long ago. Now, keep in mind, initially the whole argument was, we\u2019re going to do this because we want to reduce our debt. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the focus now. Now the focus is on Obamacare.\n\nSo let\u2019s put this in perspective. The Affordable Care Act has been the law for three-and-a-half years now. It passed both houses of Congress. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last year\u2019s election, and the candidate who called for repeal lost. The...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRepublicans in the House have tried to repeal or sabotage it about 40 times. They\u2019ve failed every time. Meanwhile, the law\u2019s already helped millions of Americans, young people who are able to stay on their parents\u2019 plan up until the age of 26, seniors who are getting additional discounts on their prescription drugs, ordinary families and small businesses that are getting rebates from insurance companies, because now insurance companies have to actually spend money on people\u2019s care instead of on administrative costs and CEO bonuses.\n\nA lot of the, you know, horror stories that were predicted about how this was going to shoot rates way up and there were going to be death panels and all that stuff, none of that stuff\u2019s happened. And in two weeks, the Affordable Care Act is going to help millions of more people. And there\u2019s no serious evidence that the law, which has helped to keep down the rise in health care costs to their lowest level in 50 years, is holding back economic growth.\n\nSo repealing the Affordable Care Act, making sure that 30 million people don\u2019t get health insurance and people with pre-existing conditions continue to be locked out of the health insurance market, that\u2019s not an agenda for economic growth. You\u2019re not going to meet an economist who says that that\u2019s the number-one priority in terms of boosting growth and jobs in this country, at least not a serious economist.\n\nAnd I understand, I will never convince some Republicans about the merits of Obamacare. I understand that. And I\u2019m more than willing to work with them where they\u2019ve got specific suggestions that they can show will make our health care system work better. Remember, initially this was like repeal and replace, and the replace thing has kind of gone off to the wayside. Now it\u2019s just repeal.\n\nBut the larger point is, after all that we\u2019ve been through these past five years, after all the work Americans like those standing behind me have done to come back from the depths of a crisis, are some of these folks really so beholden to one extreme wing of their party that they\u2019re willing to tank the entire economy just because they can\u2019t get their way on this issue? Are they really willing to hurt people just to score political points? I hope not.\n\nBut in case there\u2019s any confusion, I will not negotiate over whether or not America keeps its word and meets its obligations. I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States. This country has worked too hard for too long to dig out of a crisis just to see their elected representatives here in Washington purposely cause another crisis.\n\nLet\u2019s stop the threats. Let\u2019s stop the political posturing, Let\u2019s keep our government open. Let\u2019s pay our bills on time. Let\u2019s pass a budget. Let\u2019s work together to do what the American people sent us here to do: Create jobs; grow our economy; expand opportunity.\n\nThat\u2019s what we need to do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs far as the budget goes, it\u2019s time for responsible Republicans who share these goals -- and there are a number of folks out there who I think are decent folks -- I\u2019ve got some disagreements with them on some issues -- but I think genuinely want to see the economy grow and want what\u2019s best for the American people.\n\nIt\u2019s time for those Republicans to step up, and they\u2019ve got to decide what they want to prioritize. Originally, they said they wanted deficit reduction. As I said before, our deficits are falling fast.\n\nThe only way to make further, long-term progress on deficit reduction that doesn\u2019t slow growth is with a balanced plan that includes closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class. It\u2019s the only way to do it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThey said that they wanted entitlement reform. But their leaders haven\u2019t put forward serious ideas that wouldn\u2019t devastate Medicare or Social Security.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve put forward ideas for sensible reforms to Medicare and Social Security, and haven\u2019t gotten a lot of feedback yet.\n\nThey said that they wanted tax reform. Remember? This was just a few months ago, they said, well, this is going to be one of our top priorities, tax reform.\n\nSix weeks ago I put forward a plan that serious people in both parties should be able to support. A deal that lowers the corporate tax rate for businesses, and manufacturers, simplifies it for small business owners, as long as we use some of the money that we save to invest in the infrastructure our businesses need to create more good jobs and good wages for middle class folks who work at these businesses.\n\nMy position is, if folks in this town want a grand bargain, how about a grand bargain for middle class jobs. So I put forward ideas for tax reform. Haven\u2019t heard back from them yet.\n\nNow, Congress has a couple of weeks to get this done. If they\u2019re focused don what the American people care about -- faster growth, more jobs, better future for our kids -- then I\u2019m confident it will happen. And once we\u2019re done with the budget, let\u2019s focus on the other things that we know can make a difference for middle class families: The cost of college, finishing the job of immigration reform, taking up the work of tax reform to make the system fair and promoting more investment in the United States.\n\nIf we follow the strategy I\u2019m laying out for our entire economy and if Washington will just act with the same urgency and common purpose that we felt five years ago, then our economy will be stronger -- a year from now, five years from now a decade from now.\n\nThat\u2019s my priority.\n\nAll these folks standing behind me, and everybody out there who\u2019s listening. That\u2019s my priority.\n\nI\u2019ve run my last election. My only interest at this point is making sure that the economy is moving the way it needs to so we\u2019ve got the kind of broad based growth that has always been the hallmark of this country.\n\nAs long as I\u2019ve got the privilege of serving as your president, I will spend every moment of every day I have left fighting to restore security and opportunity for the middle class and to give everyone who works hard a chance to get ahead.\n\nThank you everybody. God bless you.
