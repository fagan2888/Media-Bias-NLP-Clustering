SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. —After welcoming a baby Baby Bull to the family, the Rockies’ Baby Bull returned to spring training Saturday morning.

Catcher Wilin Rosario, who was back in Denver to see his new daughter, Aidelys, come into the world, was all smiles in the Rockies’ clubhouse.

“She’s great, everything’s great,” Rosario said. “Now I’m ready to go to work.”

Manager Walt Weiss plans to give Rosario work at first base during camp, the idea being that if Rosario can fill in at first, the Rockies can get his powerful bat in the lineup more often. Rosario is fine with that.

“The only thing I know is that I want to win and do the best thing I can for my team,” Rosario said. “I’m not going to be that great player like (Todd) Helton or (Justin) Morneau at first, but I want to be a player. If they need me there, I will prepare.”

First and foremost, Rosario is a catcher, and he said a winter spent working in his native Dominican Republic has him well prepared. He’s down from 232 pounds to 223 and he worked hard to build leg strength.

“I’m more flexible and stronger,” he said.

Rosario has a new catching coach this season. Exuberant Rene Lachemann took over the quiet and studious Jerry Weinstein. Rosario has noticed the difference between the two men.

“They both have that special thing, the old school, to prepare you for games,” Rosario said. “Right now with Lachemann it’s a little (more) dynamic. You can laugh more and be happy. With Jerry, it was a little serious. When we were going to work, we were going to work.”
