But the view is to amend this section to ensure it is non-discriminatory. That will entail undertaking the necessary legislative work necessary to do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said that section of the act had been used only once to make a prosecution, and it was unclear whether that case would be reviewed when the section was amended.\n\n\n\nThe president of an HIV support organisation Living Positive Victoria, Ian Muchamore, said he was surprised by the announcement.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is something we have been advocating for for many years, and we strongly welcome it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to to have an unfair law that is HIV-specific. There\u2019s no reason to single HIV out over anything else, and intentional HIV cases should be dealt with under other existing criminal laws that are used when someone intentionally causes harm.\u201d\n\n\n\nMuchamore said the act prevented people from getting tested because if they did not know they had HIV, they believed they could not be criminalised. He also said the act added to stigma around people living with HIV.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re all trying to do is increase the number of people receiving HIV testing and who are receiving treatment, because treatment means they then go on to have undetectable viral loads which effectively renders them non-infectious,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t address the underlying financial and legal barriers to addressing HIV, and reach the federal government\u2019s target of eliminating new cases of HIV in Australia by 2020, without this section of the law also being addressed.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Victoria the government's chief health officer also had powers to order people receive counselling and even be detained if they were seen as a threat to the public, Muchamore said, adding that this public health response was often more effective.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know criminalising cases of deliberate HIV transmission has not led to rates of transmission going down and testing rates going up.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe federal health minister, Peter Dutton, said as the legacy statement was announced that Australia was at a critical point in the fight against HIV/Aids.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to work together to take advantage of the progress we have made to understand, prevent and treat this disease.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier in July, Dutton announced that a restriction on the sale of HIV home-tests in Australia would be lifted and HIV antiretroviral drugs would be available through community pharmacies as part of Australia\u2019s goal of significantly reducing HIV transmission.\n\nRetired high court judge and academic Michael Kirby said he was glad the act would be amended.\n\n\"While only one person was prosecuted, symbolically, it [the section of the act] is a bad thing,\" he said.\n\n\"It is wonderful Victoria is going to reform the law on this matter. \"But what is important is that the message should go to Africa, to Russia and other countries where these [discriminatory] laws exist \u2013 and we should not be polite in the delivering of that message.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description":
