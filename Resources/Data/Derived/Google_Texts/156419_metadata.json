Listen.\u201d But Cruz himself doesn\u2019t listen; he talks. And talks. And talks. It\u2019s no wonder the Texas senator can\u2019t hear what the public is actually saying.\n\nA recent CNBC poll asked whether the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act should be defunded. By 44 percent to 38 percent, Americans said no. Then the pollsters asked specifically about Cruz\u2019s plan: forcing a shutdown to defund Obamacare. The public rejected that idea 59 percent to 19 percent. But Cruz isn\u2019t listening.\n\nPublic opinion on Obamacare is complicated but generally consistent. The law is unpopular. But a solid majority wants the Republican sabotage to end.\n\nA poll this month from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that 69 percent of Americans, including many who disapprove of the law, want Congress to \u201cmake the law work as well as possible.\u201d Only 23 percent of Americans say Congress should try to \u201cmake the law fail.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party, however, has focused like a laser on making the law fail. Congressional Republicans have withheld crucial implementation funds and sent letters to everyone from the National Football League to local health groups warning them against helping with the rollout. Republican governors have, for the most part, refused to set up health-care exchanges or participate in the Medicaid expansion authorized by the law.\n\nAnd now Republicans in Congress are considering shutting down the entire government or defaulting on the national debt in order to prevent Obamacare\u2019s implementation. They\u2019ve gone from trying to make Obamacare fail to threatening to make the country fail.\n\nIn the wake of his 21-hour quasi-filibuster on the Senate floor, Republicans have made a scapegoat of Cruz. They\u2019ve pretended he\u2019s an irresponsible bomb thrower causing problems for an otherwise responsible party. Anyone who believes that should read the House Republicans\u2019 new debt-ceiling proposal.\n\nIn return for a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling, House Republicans are demanding a year-long delay of Obamacare, adoption of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s tax-reform plan, construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, more offshore oil drilling, more drilling on federally protected lands, looser regulations around ash coal, a suspension of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulation of carbon emissions, more power over the regulatory process in general, reform of the federal employee retirement program, changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, more power over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s budget, repeal of the Social Services block grant, expanded means-testing for Medicare benefits, repeal of the public health trust fund and more.\n\nYes, that\u2019s right: \u201cand more.\u201d\n\nIf this policy grab bag sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Republicans have proposed it all before. It was, more or less, Mitt Romney\u2019s agenda during the 2012 presidential campaign. The voters rejected it -- another message, it seems, that Republicans in Washington somehow failed to hear.\n\nNot only are the policies familiar, but so is the playbook. In 2011, Republicans employed similar tactics, threatening both to shut down the government and breach the debt ceiling if President Obama didn\u2019t agree to their demands. How did the public view this? According to a Gallup poll, congressional approval hit a record low. Another missed message.\n\nThe problem here isn\u2019t that Republican leaders didn\u2019t hear about the election results or can\u2019t read polls. Cruz\u2019s Republican colleagues in the Senate begged him to back off his crusade. He dismissed them as out of touch. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have desperately sought a way to avoid another ill-fated showdown and keep the government functioning. They don\u2019t have the votes.\n\nWashington's tea party Republicans, in other words, aren\u2019t listening to the public, and they\u2019re not listening to their own leaders. So who are they listening to? One another, mostly.\n\nTim Carney, a well-sourced columnist for the conservative Washington Examiner, wrote an unusual column this week titled \u201cTed Cruz Pushes Senate to Listen to the People.\u201d Carney portrayed Cruz as a committed populist who has \u201cinfuriated his fellow Republicans -- by going over their heads and straight to the voters.\u201d\n\nWhat Carney describes, however, isn\u2019t anything like a politician communing with the electorate. \u201cI call it the Tea Party Whip Operation,\u201d he wrote. The operation \u201cinvolves outside groups such as the Senate Conservatives Fund, Heritage Action, the Club for Growth, and FreedomWorks.\u201d\n\nCarney goes on to detail the success of these interest groups during the debate on expanding background checks for guns. It\u2019s a particularly telling example because the Senate background-check legislation had overwhelming public support. \u201cCruz publicly put out a letter -- timed to just before congressional recess -- calling on senators to prevent a gun control bill from even coming to the Senate floor,\u201d Carney said. \u201cGrassroots conservatives read the letter and pressured their senators to sign on.\u201d\n\nSo conservative interest groups in Washington mobilized grass-roots conservatives to persuade conservative senators to defeat enormously popular legislation.\n\nThis is the strange world much of the Republican Party now inhabits. The \u201cvoice of the people\u201d is the one they hear when they whisper into one another\u2019s ears. And they have just enough power to force the rest of the country to listen to it, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz wants D.C. to listen.
