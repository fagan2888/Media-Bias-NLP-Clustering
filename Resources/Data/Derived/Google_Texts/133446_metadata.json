(AP) - South Carolina lawmakers are reviewing stronger protections for land with no clear title that has often been handed down by blacks for generations since slavery.\n\nHeirs\u2019 property is any land passed down without a will. In South Carolina it most often refers to land in the Lowcountry handed down by former slaves that eventually ended up being owned jointly by dozens of descendants.\n\nBecause there is no clear title, any heir can go to a judge seeking their share of the property and under current law the only way to get that value is to auction the land. Third parties sometimes purchase an heirs\u2019 interest and force the auction and in some cases, developers have bought tracts at auction at well-below market price.\n\nLand owned by blacks is often vulnerable because they have been less likely to file wills. And as blacks migrated to other states over the years, many lost ties to the land and the family they left behind and were willing to collect money for their share of a tract they had never seen.\n\nA decade ago, South Carolina lawmakers passed a bill giving relatives the right of first refusal if someone wants to get their value from the land. The land is appraised and they are given 45 days to pay fair market value.\n\nBut with ever-increasing coastal land values \u201cthe big issue with that is that the heirs often have the inability to get the money together to pay,\u201d said Susan Berkowitz, director of the South Carolina Appleseed Legal Justice Center,\n\nNow lawmakers are considering the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act which went before a Senate subcommittee last week.\n\nIt maintains the right of first-refusal so other family members can purchase the property but also allows, for the first time, judge to consider more than just economics in deciding how everyone gets their value out of the property.\n\nA judge could consider such things as whether the land can be divided, the degree to which the descendants have contributed to property taxes and other costs of keeping the land, and even someone\u2019s sentimental attachment to the land such as it being where their ancestors lived.\n\nIn addition, if a settlement can\u2019t be reached, the judge can require it be sold, not at auction, but on the open market where all the descendants will receive a fair-market price.\n\n\u201cThere would be a requirement that the court weigh to totality of all the relevant factors, not just the economic issues,\u201d said Josh Walden, the attorney for the Charleston-based Center for Heirs Property Preservation, a nonprofit that works to help heirs\u2019 property owners obtain clear title and keep their family land.\n\nThere\u2019s an estimated 41,000 acres of heirs\u2019 property in the six South Carolina counties that the center serves.\n\nWalden said considering factors beyond economic value will give the judges and attorneys more leeway \u201cand probably more headaches to be honest.\u201d\n\nIt will allow \u201carguments to be made in certain cases that even if they don\u2019t prevent the entire sale of the property, maybe they can allow a partition of a portion of it. Maybe it\u2019s not an all-or-nothing thing,\u201d he said.\n\nBerkowitz said the bill will make heirs\u2019 property issues a part of South Carolina law.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the law now that recognizes heirs\u2019 property and the unique nature of it. Unfortunately a lot of property has been lost. But better late than never,\u201d she said.\n\nState Sen. Senator Gerald Malloy, D-Hartsville, said during the subcommittee hearing that \u201cit\u2019s just unfortunate we didn\u2019t have this years and years and years ago.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthere are a lot of pieces of legislation that would have been a good idea some time ago. But someone has to bring it up, somebody has to put it in action and somebody has to work on it. Hopefully we will make this into law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Carolina lawmakers are reviewing stronger protections for land with no clear title that has often been handed down by blacks for generations since slavery.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/9/sc-considers-more-protection-for-heirs-property/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "South Carolina lawmakers are reviewing stronger protections for land with no clear title that has often been handed down by blacks for generations since slavery.", "title": "SC considers more protection for heirs\u2019 property"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "South Carolina lawmakers are reviewing stronger protections for land with no clear title that has often been handed down by blacks for generations since slavery.", "card": "summary", "title": "SC considers more protection for heirs\u2019 property"}, "Author": "BRUCE SMITH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Susan Berkowitz"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s an estimated 41,000 acres of heirs\u2019 property in the six South Carolina counties that the center serves.\n\u201cThere is nothing in the law now that recognizes heirs\u2019 property and the unique nature of it.\nBerkowitz said the bill will make heirs\u2019 property issues a part of South Carolina law.\nHeirs\u2019 property is any land passed down without a will.\nCOLUMBIA, S.C.
