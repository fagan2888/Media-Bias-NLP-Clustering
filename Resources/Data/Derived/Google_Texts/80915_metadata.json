He warned that it would ultimately come down to a battle of ideologies between the two regions.\n\n\u201cOnly one of us can triumph, and it must not be them,\u201d Fox said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Talk Radio News Service", "description": "The former secretary of state for Defense of the UK and current MP, warned that ISIS would not distinguish between different allies in the coalition.", "title": "British Official Warns ISIS Won't Distinguish Among Its Enemies - Talk Radio News Service", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.talkradionews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Isiserbil.jpg", "url": "http://www.talkradionews.com/world-news/2014/09/23/war-ideaology.html", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "World News", "tag": "UK", "published_time": "2014-09-23T14:00:14+00:00"}, "generator": "WooFramework 5.5.3", "description": "The former secretary of state for Defense of the UK and current MP, warned that ISIS would not distinguish between different allies in the coalition.", "bitly-verification": "66802d0f8657"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6ac\"", "article_summary": "Fox went on to say that ISIS\u2019s hate of the West\u2019s value set contributes to its inability to distinguish between countries in the coalition that bomb and those that are giving humanitarian aid.\nThe opposing ideologies come, not from anything that the West has done, but because of the identities of the different regions, Fox said.\nHe warned that it would ultimately come down to a battle of ideologies between the two regions.\n\u201cOnly one of us can triumph, and it must not be them,\u201d Fox said.\n\u201cEverything we stand for, our desire to see equal rights across race, gender and religion, our quest for developing democracies, a secular rule of law, free markets and shared prosperity, all these things are an existential threat to their medieval, misogynistic and barbaric value set,\u201d Fox said."}
