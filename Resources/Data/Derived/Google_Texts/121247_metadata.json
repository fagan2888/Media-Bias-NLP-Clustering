(Spencer Heyfron)\n\nIn this weekend\u2019s issue of Parade, Dr. Sanjay Gupta opens up about Obamacare, medical marijuana, and what he loves about surgery.\n\nBelow, the CNN medical correspondent shares a few of his best stay-healthy tips. Plus, check out our exclusive video for even more tips and a behind-the-scenes glimpse at Parade\u2018s photo shoot with the good doctor.\n\n1. Treat your doctor as a member of your health team. I think there\u2019s a lot of suspicion of the medical system, but for the most part doctors are actually very interested in their patients\u2019 best welfare. Walk in with the assumption that he or she is on your side and that you have an opportunity to talk with someone who\u2019s going to help you.\n\n2. Don\u2019t try to self-diagnose; this can lead your doctor in the wrong direction. Just describe your symptoms as best you can, in your own words. If you have a pain in your back that\u2019s going down your leg and into your toes, that\u2019s what you should say, not \u201cI think it\u2019s a disc and it\u2019s probably related to my back.\u201d\n\n3. Spend a few minutes ahead of time to prepare a list of your concerns. It might help to run them by a loved one first to see if they match what you\u2019ve been describing. Note any medications you\u2019re taking as well.\n\n4. Remember that you have to actually change your habits and follow through on what your doctor recommends\u2014both with things that are difficult (stopping smoking) and things that are easy (taking medication). Do your part as a health team member and you may avoid needing an invasive procedure.\n\n5. Finally, if you and your doctor are simply not a good match, find another one. I\u2019ve heard people say that switching doctors can be harder than a breakup, but it may also be the right thing to do.\n\n[onescreen item=\u201d5146690\u2033 playerFill=\u201dwidth\u201d]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "doctor, health, Sanjay Gupta, Video", "author": "Leah Rozen", "og": {"site_name": "Community Table", "description": "In this weekend\u2019s issue of Parade, Dr. Sanjay Gupta opens up about Obamacare, medical marijuana, and what he loves about surgery.Below, the CNN medical correspondent shares a few of his best stay-healthy tips.
