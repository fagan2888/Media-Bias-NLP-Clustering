(AP) \u2014 California on Friday will start taking driver\u2019s license applications from the nation\u2019s largest population of immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nThe state Department of Motor Vehicles expects 1.4 million people will seek a license in the first three years of a program aimed at boosting road safety and making immigrants\u2019 lives easier.\n\nCalifornia officials say they can\u2019t predict how many people will line up immediately to apply, but the number of people making appointments for a license more than doubled when immigrants were allowed to sign up. Appointments are required to apply for a license except at four newly-created DMV offices.\n\nCalifornia is one of 10 states that now provide licenses to immigrants in the country illegally. The licenses issued to immigrants without legal status will include a distinctive marking and are not considered a valid form of federal identification.\n\nImmigrants in the country illegally have not been allowed to apply for a driver\u2019s license in California since the state began requiring proof of legal presence during the 1990s.\n\nImmigrant advocates have cheered the licenses as a way to integrate immigrants who must drive to work and shuttle children to school. But critics have questioned state officials\u2019 ability to verify the identity of foreign applicants, citing security concerns.\n\nLaw enforcement officials say the program will improve road safety because licensed drivers must be tested and insured. A DMV study of 23 years of crash data found that unlicensed drivers were more likely to cause a fatal collision than licensed drivers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Immigrants to seek California driver licenses", "title": "Immigrants to seek California driver licenses", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Immigrants to seek California driver licenses", "title": "Immigrants to seek California driver licenses", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/02/immigrants_to_seek_california_driver_licenses/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/immigrants-drivers-licenses.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Immigrants to seek California driver licenses", "title": "Immigrants to seek California driver licenses", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/immigrants-drivers-licenses.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amy Taxin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdd3\"", "article_summary": "California is one of 10 states that now provide licenses to immigrants in the country illegally.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSANTA ANA, Calif.
