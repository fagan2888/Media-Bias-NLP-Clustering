Now what?\u201d\n\nThat is the question that Andrea Ravitz, director of marketing at the state\u2019s health insurance exchange Access Health CT, says the organization will be seeking to address over the next three years.\n\nWith statewide enrollment at over 116,000 as of the end of March, AHCT will now increasingly strive to educate consumers on how to derive maximum benefits from their selected insurance plans.\n\n\u201cOur first years were about making sure people were getting enrolled and avoiding penalties,\u201d Ravitz said. \u201cNow we are addressing the fact that members are coming in with no idea of what to do with their plans and benefits. The problems are very similar to those with health insurance outside the AHCT \u2013 it can be a complicated, sometimes intimidating process to pick one plan over another \u2026 and not just the plan, but the company. There\u2019s a lot of hand-holding involved.\u201d\n\nThis shift in focus is being led by AHCT CEO Jim Wadleigh, who has noted that the exchange, created in 2012 as part of the Affordable Care Act, has as its mandate not only insuring Connecticut residents but also improving the quality of health care provided. Nevertheless, his move has ruffled a few feathers.\n\nDuring an AHCT board meeting in April, Benjamin Barnes, secretary of the state Office of Policy and Management and a board member, told Wadleigh that he felt that, given the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of residents still uninsured, the time may not yet be right to move away from enrollment efforts. Wadleigh replied that many of the remaining uninsured are illegal immigrants and thus ineligible for exchange coverage.\n\n\u201cI strongly support Access Health\u2019s work to improve the health of its enrollees, and I also believe that we need to remain committed to reducing the number of uninsured Connecticut residents,\u201d Barnes reiterated recently. \u201cThere is no conflict between these goals, and I have great confidence that we will continue to make progress toward them.\u201d\n\nAt the board meeting, Wadleigh was also taken to task for not working more closely with the state Department of Social Services (DSS), which is the administering agency for Medicaid; some 200,000 people are covered by Medicaid under the ACA.\n\nDSS commissioner Roderick L. Bremby indicated that that situation is already improving. \u201cExpanded work by Access Health in health care outcomes and related areas will dovetail nicely with the quality innovations DSS has been building into the Medicaid program over the past several years,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, Connecticut is already a national leader, if not the national leader, in successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act, thanks to the strong leadership by the Malloy-Wyman administration. We look forward to further advances over the coming year.\u201d\n\nAs for AHCT, it is embarking upon a year-round community outreach program by partnering with Grossman Heinz, a public affairs firm specializing in government relations, grassroots mobilization, and lobbying.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re out in the community talking with leaders and influencers,\u201d Ravitz said, \u201cto help spread the word about what\u2019s available and what they might already have.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Grossman is currently seeking project, events, and outreach coordinators to handle the planning and logistics of AHCT\u2019s presence at fairs, festivals, farmers\u2019 markets, AHCT-sponsored forums, and other community events.\n\nRavitz noted that that outreach will also address language barriers. Although all of AHCT\u2019s materials are available in Spanish, she said, there are obviously dozens of other languages that residents primarily speak.\n\n\u201cThere are also a lot of dialects that simply translating our printed materials in another language doesn\u2019t necessarily address,\u201d she added. \u201cWe want to explain our message to community leaders and influencers, who can then deliver that message in their own cultural ways to their peers.\u201d\n\nThe organization is in the process of rolling out a number of consumer tools on its website, accesshealthct.com. Included is a feature where a consumer inputs some basic information on the current state of their health, family, location, income, etc., after which the system responds with suggestions of the best options for them.\n\n\u201cWhen they first enroll, most people pick the plan and company based on price,\u201d Ravitz noted, \u201cbut this takes it a little bit further. Some may have chosen the bronze plan during the first year, but when they go to the doctor they have to pay a little more for that visit. That may be okay for someone who\u2019s in good health, but may not be the best way to go for those who need to make several visits throughout the year.\u201d\n\nShe said the exchange is using an expanding array of internal and external data analytics to \u201csee where we need to advance and stretch ourselves in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nAHCT admits that it still has much work to do in reaching minorities; according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data, as of July 1, 2014, 15 percent of Connecticut\u2019s population is Hispanic/Latino, followed by African-Americans (11.5 percent) and Asians (4.5 percent). \u201cThere are a lot of little percentages after those,\u201d Ravitz said. \u201cBut they are there, and we need to address them.\u201d\n\nIn another recent development, AHCT representatives have begun attending naturalization ceremonies held for newly naturalized immigrants at the U.S. District Court in Hartford to provide information about health care plan options available to them and their families. AHCT is the only state-based exchange currently involved in such efforts.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the first projects I got involved with when I joined AHCT in 2013,\u201d Ravitz said. \u201cWe address them about 45 minutes before the judge enters the courtroom. Educating new citizens and their families who are either seeking residency or citizenship, or who are applying for visas to work or study here, is very important. The majority of them don\u2019t know that they can get better insurance, and can apply as long as they\u2019re legally present.\u201d\n\nShe said that AHCT hopes to expand its presence at such ceremonies at the U.S. District Courts in New Haven and Bridgeport as well, with the ultimate \u201chome run\u201d goal of including AHCT literature in Immigration and Naturalization Service mailings \u2013 \u201cwhich everybody opens.\u201d\n\nRavitz also addressed the recent announcement by United Healthcare that it will exit the exchange at the end of the year. \u201cWe are working to address with those members who have United that it will no longer be a part of the exchange, and explaining their options,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to healthcare.gov, United had 2 percent of the exchange market share in 2015, which dropped to 1.3 percent this year. ConnectiCare currently has about 53 percent of exchange enrollees, followed by Anthem at 33 percent and Healthy CT, also known as The Co-op, at just under 12 percent.\n\nPrint", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "united healthcare,andrea ravitz,jim wadleigh,access health ct,ahct,medicaid,affordable care act,aca,obamacare,benjamin barnes,office of policy and management,department of social services,dss,roderick bremby,immigration and naturalization,new haven,bridgeport,hartford,grossman heinz,connecticare,anthem,healthy ct,the co-op", "description": "AHCT is now focused on educating consumers on how to derive maximum benefits from their selected insurance plans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now what?\u201dThat is the question that Andrea Ravitz, director of marketing at the state\u2019s health insurance exchange Access Health CT, says the organization will be seeking to address over the next three years.\n\u201cExpanded work by Access Health in health care outcomes and related areas will dovetail nicely with the quality innovations DSS has been building into the Medicaid program over the past several years,\u201d he said.\nAccording to healthcare.gov, United had 2 percent of the exchange market share in 2015, which dropped to 1.3 percent this year.\nWadleigh replied that many of the remaining uninsured are illegal immigrants and thus ineligible for exchange coverage.\nAHCT is the only state-based exchange currently involved in such efforts."}
