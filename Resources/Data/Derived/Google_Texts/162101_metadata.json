However, if this were true, then why don\u2019t energy drinks or soda have the same effect? And why does decaf coffee have the same effect as caffeinated coffee? A video from the American Chemical Society\u2019s Reactions series answers the question that everyone wants to know, but very few want to ask.\n\n\u201cSome of you folks out there know firsthand that a cup of coffee almost immediately means a trip to the bathroom,\u201d the video description reads. \u201cBut what's inside a cup of coffee that makes you have to go #2? Today on Reactions, we bring you the answer \u2014 to the best of our scientific knowledge.\u201d\n\nFirst, if coffee does make you poop, then you\u2019re one of the lucky few (or unlucky, depending on how you look at it) who experience this effect from drinking a cup of joe. Between 30 and 40 percent of the U.S. population says drinking coffee makes them poop. Frequent coffee drinkers who don\u2019t feel the need to poop after drinking a cup have likely built up a tolerance.\n\nScientists know that coffee\u2019s acidity helps with stimulating the distal colon which, in turn, leads to waste being rapidly dispelled from the body. What exactly triggers this effect gets a little more complicated. There are around 1,000 compounds found in coffee, any of which can cause our body to break down protein more efficiently, our stomach to dump its contents quickly into the large intestine, or increase our body\u2019s level of cholecystokinin and gastrin \u2014 two hormones that help with food digestion.\n\nWatch the video to learn more.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "coffees, laxative, effect, why, coffee, makes, us, poop, energy, drinks, and, soda, dont", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here's why your morning cup of coffee also leads to your morning trip to the bathroom.", "title": "The Real Reason Coffee Makes You Poop [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/coffees-laxative-effect-why-coffee-makes-us-poop-energy-drinks-and-soda-dont-347060", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/10/coffees-laxative-effect-why-coffee-makes-us-poop-energy-drinks-and-soda-dont.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's why your morning cup of coffee also leads to your morning trip to the bathroom.", "title": "The Real Reason Coffee Makes You Poop [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/coffees-laxative-effect-why-coffee-makes-us-poop-energy-drinks-and-soda-dont-347060", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/10/coffees-laxative-effect-why-coffee-makes-us-poop-energy-drinks-and-soda-dont.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/10/coffees-laxative-effect-why-coffee-makes-us-poop-energy-drinks-and-soda-dont.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-10T16:35:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T16:35:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here's why your morning cup of coffee also leads to your morning trip to the bathroom."}, "article_summary": "Between 30 and 40 percent of the U.S. population says drinking coffee makes them poop.\nFrequent coffee drinkers who don\u2019t feel the need to poop after drinking a cup have likely built up a tolerance.\nMany people are quick to blame caffeine for the laxative effect coffee has.\nHowever, if this were true, then why don\u2019t energy drinks or soda have the same effect?\n\u201cBut what's inside a cup of coffee that makes you have to go #2?"}
