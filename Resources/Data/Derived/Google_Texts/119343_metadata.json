The final talley was 218-208.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe House action is unusual. As Breitbart News reported: \u201cTo engage in the complicated procedural chicanery needed to revive the once-dead Obamatrade, bringing its Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) portion back to life, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) needed to gut a previous bill that has passed the House and Senate and then insert Obamatrade into it. It\u2019s actually a very similar process to how Obamacare passed the House.\u201d\n\nObamatrade will face more hurdles, though.\n\nBecause the Senate passed TAA and TPA together, the individual House version will now have to go back to the Senate for approval, where it may face a filibuster. It\u2019s unclear how many senators would support TPA without TAA, a measure to aid workers who lose their jobs because of trade policy.\n\nThe Senate isn\u2019t expected to take up TPA until next week, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has expressed confidence it can pass.\n\nObamatrade is making for unusual partnerships in Washington. Barack Obama is working with McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner to pass a measure his own party largely rejects.\n\nLast week he traveled to Capitol Hill to lobby for his trade measures, but shortly before the House vote on TAA, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced she opposes it. More than 300 representatives ended up voting down TAA, setting the stage for Thursday\u2019s moves to bring TPA back to life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Approves Obamatrade's TPA, Bill Must Go to Senate Next", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "House Approves Obamatrade's TPA, Bill Must Go to Senate Next", "title": "House Approves Obamatrade's TPA, Bill Must Go to Senate Next - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Boehner-Kiss-J.-Scott-Applewhite-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-18T09:39:15-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/18/house-approves-obamatrades-tpa-bill-must-go-to-senate-next/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Approves Obamatrade's TPA, Bill Must Go to Senate Next", "creator": "@RichardBTucker", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Boehner-Kiss-J.-Scott-Applewhite-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "House Approves Obamatrade's TPA, Bill Must Go to Senate Next - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-06-18T09:29:06-07:00", "categories": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T09:39:15-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Because the Senate passed TAA and TPA together, the individual House version will now have to go back to the Senate for approval, where it may face a filibuster.\nMore than 300 representatives ended up voting down TAA, setting the stage for Thursday\u2019s moves to bring TPA back to life.\nThe Senate isn\u2019t expected to take up TPA until next week, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has expressed confidence it can pass.\nIt\u2019s unclear how many senators would support TPA without TAA, a measure to aid workers who lose their jobs because of trade policy.\nBarack Obama is working with McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner to pass a measure his own party largely rejects."}
