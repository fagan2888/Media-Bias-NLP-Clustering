The Government Accountability Office reported this morning that the agency\u2019s office in charge of certifying the tax-exempt status of such groups has such poor controls in place that employees could arbitrarily use political or other criteria to make audit decisions.\n\nThe GAO report found that while there are sufficient controls and oversight in some parts of the program, which it refers to as \u201cEO\u201d for Exempt Organizations, \u201cthere are several areas where EO's controls were not well designed or implemented. The control deficiencies GAO found increase the risk that EO could select organizations for examination in an unfair manner\u2014for example, based on an organization's religious, educational, political, or other views.\u201d\n\nRelated: IRS Admits Targeting Conservatives for Tax Scrutiny in 2012 Election\n\nThe finding will confirm the accusations of many Republicans who believe that the IRS deliberately slow-walked or denied requests for tax exempt status from conservative organizations in order to blunt the ability of the Republican Party to get out the vote in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nFurthering the idea that there was a conspiracy at work, the former director of the exempt organizations division, Lois Lerner, not only refused to testify before Congress about the alleged targeting, but also was unable to produce thousands of email messages sent and received during a time period vital to the investigation of the agency\u2019s practices.\n\nLerner\u2019s computer crashed, was deemed unrecoverable by experts who examined it, and then was destroyed. The internal processes at the IRS for retaining backups of employees\u2019 email correspondence was revealed to be flawed. Investigators were eventually able to retrieve many of Lerner\u2019s emails, but the inability of the IRS to produce a definitive list of emails for the record only served to feed conspiracy theories.\n\nThe GAO\u2019s findings won\u2019t do anything to tamp them down, either.\n\nRelated: Treasury IG Finds IRS Destroyed More Lerner Emails\n\nAmong other things, the GAO found, \u201cStaff could deviate from procedures for some selection processes without executive management approval\u2026.[S]taff are not required to obtain executive management approval to deviate from these procedures. This increases the risk of unfair selection of organizations' returns for examination.\u201d\n\nFurther, GAO found that there was inadequate supervision by managers at the exempt organizations division. In up to one in three cases where the decision was made not to perform an audit that had been approved, there was no indication that the final decision had been approved by a management-level employee.\n\nFinally, GAO discovered that in many cases, a single person was responsible for making decisions about how to classify certain kinds of applicants. Meaning that all high-profile requests were routed through one individual, all requests from churches through another, and so on.\n\n\u201cEven if other safeguards are in place,\u201d the GAO found, \u201chaving the same individual initially classify all political activity or all high profile and church referrals increases the potential for error or unfairness; for example, the classifier could choose not to forward particular kinds of organizations.\u201d\n\nRelated: 32,774 \u2018Found\u2019 IRS Emails Prompt Criminal Probe\n\nIn an opening statement prepared for a hearing on the report this morning, Illinois Republican Peter Roskam, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Oversight panel, said, \u201cIt is disappointing that over two years later, it is still possible that the IRS can select groups for adverse treatment based on their personal political, religious, or educational beliefs. There isn\u2019t proper documentation of allegations or decisions to audit; there are a handful of gatekeepers with sweeping authority and broad discretion; and there is a broken referral committee process.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has been entrusted with powerful authority to review and audit organizations, and with that comes a very serious responsibility to the American people,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe IRS must acknowledge these problems and take concrete action to ensure a Lois Lerner 2.0 situation cannot happen. This committee will continue to work to reform this broken system and ensure the IRS treats all Americans fairly and equally.\u201d\n\nIn response to the GAO, the IRS issued a statement admitting that the investigators had found a \u201chypothetical risk\u201d of abuse, but claimed investigators \u201cdid not find any evidence that this has happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are troubling new findings that could reignite the controversy over the Internal", "title": "IRS Had No Process to Stop the Targeting of Conservative Groups", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/23/IRS-Had-No-Process-Stop-Targeting-Conservative-Groups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/23/IRS-Had-No-Process-Stop-Targeting-Conservative-Groups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There are troubling new findings that could reignite the controversy over the Internal", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe IRS has been entrusted with powerful authority to review and audit organizations, and with that comes a very serious responsibility to the American people,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cThe IRS must acknowledge these problems and take concrete action to ensure a Lois Lerner 2.0 situation cannot happen.\nThis increases the risk of unfair selection of organizations' returns for examination.\u201dFurther, GAO found that there was inadequate supervision by managers at the exempt organizations division.\nThe internal processes at the IRS for retaining backups of employees\u2019 email correspondence was revealed to be flawed.\nThere are troubling new findings that could reignite the controversy over the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s targeting of conservative non-profits for extra scrutiny in the year leading up to the 2012 elections."}
