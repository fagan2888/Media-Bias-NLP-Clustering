Generation Opportunity is also encouraging 'participants to drink responsibly.' | iStock Group unveils SOTU drinking game

If you’re not yet excited for Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Generation Opportunity has a something that might catch your college-age attention: a drinking game.

The conservative anti-Obamacare organization is having some fun with Tuesday’s State of the Union, hosting an open bar event on Tuesday at a local D.C. pub and handing out tongue-in-cheek drinking game rules for watching the speech.

The rules are straightforward. For example: take a shot every time the president says, “let me be clear,” or take a drink of your beer every time he mentions income inequality — if you have the fullest glass.

The event, which will be hosted at the Hawk ‘n’ Dove on Tuesday night, gained traction on social media and RSVP’s have already exceeded capacity. The event’s organizers are encouraging attendees to arrive early, but those who can’t make it can still play along at home.

Generation Opportunity is also heavily pushing its disclaimer, encouraging “participants to drink responsibly”.

Generation Opportunity is best known for its “Creepy Uncle Sam” videos, which encourage millennials to pursue alternatives to enrolling in insurance plans created by the Affordable Care Act. The organization has been criticized by proponents of the Affordable Care Act for its financial ties to the Koch brothers.
