If they want to commit acts of oral or anal sex, they can commit such crimes.\n\nThe unanimous ruling by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals strikes down an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d ban on anal and oral sex, permitting both as long as they\u2019re consensual. The ruling settled the case of Dewayne Williams v. State of Alabama. Williams, from Dallas County, Ala. was convicted of first-degree sodomy and sexual misconduct in 2010. Although he admitted to the act, he said that it was consensual, USA Today reported. Nevertheless, the prosecutor said that the ruling will only hurt the victim, a man whom he argued was forced into having sex.\n\nThe ruling begs a larger question, however. Why are there still places in this country where certain sex acts are banned? The overturning of this law was celebrated as a victory for gay rights, as it was clearly directed toward fighting homosexuality.\n\nNow that Alabama is off the list of states with sodomy laws, there are 11 more to go, including Florida, Idaho, Kansas, and Michigan. What\u2019s puzzling about all this is that all of them should have been overturned by now. It\u2019s been nearly 11 years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Lawrence v. Texas that banning consensual sex between adults was unconstitutional, and violating the 14th amendment, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSince the ruling, only Montana and Virginia took initiative to repeal their laws. But it took years for this to happen. Montana didn\u2019t repeal its law until April last year, while it took Virginia up until this past March to get up to speed. It\u2019s looking like it may take time, but eventually \u2014 and probably as cases pop up \u2014 courts will rule these unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cEach and every person, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, is entitled to equal protection under the law,\u201d said Ben Cooper, chairman of equal rights group, Equality Alabama, in a statement, according to USA Today. \u201cThe Alabama court\u2019s unanimous decision overturning the statute is a step in the right direction and makes us optimistic for future and ongoing equal rights through the continued elimination of unconstitutional provisions in our state\u2019s constitution that violate privacy and equal rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alabama, ban, anal, oral, sex, declared, unconstitutional, 11, years, late", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eleven years after the Supreme Court ruled that bans on consensual sex were unconstitutional, Alabama's ban on anal and oral sex has finally been struck down.", "title": "Alabama Ban On Oral, Anal Sex Shot Down", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alabama-ban-anal-oral-sex-declared-unconstitutional-11-years-late-288714", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/alabama-sodomy-ban-overturned.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eleven years after the Supreme Court ruled that bans on consensual sex were unconstitutional, Alabama's ban on anal and oral sex has finally been struck down.", "title": "Alabama Ban On Oral, Anal Sex Shot Down", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alabama-ban-anal-oral-sex-declared-unconstitutional-11-years-late-288714", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/alabama-sodomy-ban-overturned.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/alabama-sodomy-ban-overturned.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-06-17T18:44:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T18:44:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eleven years after the Supreme Court ruled that bans on consensual sex were unconstitutional, Alabama's ban on anal and oral sex has finally been struck down."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4e4\"", "article_summary": "The unanimous ruling by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals strikes down an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d ban on anal and oral sex, permitting both as long as they\u2019re consensual.\nIf they want to commit acts of oral or anal sex, they can commit such crimes.\nNow that Alabama is off the list of states with sodomy laws, there are 11 more to go, including Florida, Idaho, Kansas, and Michigan.\nIt\u2019s looking like it may take time, but eventually \u2014 and probably as cases pop up \u2014 courts will rule these unconstitutional.\nNevertheless, the prosecutor said that the ruling will only hurt the victim, a man whom he argued was forced into having sex."}
