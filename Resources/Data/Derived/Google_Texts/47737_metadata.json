They had to spend a second night in Dallas because they didn\u2019t have proper identification to fly back on Friday.\n\nHillman and Webster were limited in practice Monday at Dove Valley but were cleared for full participation in the Broncos\u2019 padded practice Wednesday.\n\nHowever, John Fox and his coaching staff determined later in the week that Hillman and Webster had fallen too far behind in the team\u2019s preparation and will keep them on the sidelines for the season opener.\n\nWith Hillman out, second-year back C.J. Anderson and rookie Juwan Thompson will back up starter Montee Ball. With Webster down, rookie Bradley Roby is expected to play in the nickel packages, along with starters Aqib Talib and Chris Harris. Veteran cornerback Tony Carter should also get more playing time.\n\nHillman and Webster are expected to play next week against the Kansas City Chiefs.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aqib Talib,Bradley Roby,C.J.
