Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., wondered what the limits to executive power are given many of the actions that President Barack Obama has taken with respect to immigration and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, Gowdy questioned a panel of legal experts on \u201cThe President\u2019s Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws,\u201d according to HotAir.\n\n\u201cIf the president can fail to enforce immigration laws, can the president likewise fail to enforce election laws?\u201d Gowdy asked Simon Lazarus, senior counsel to the Constitutional Accountability Center.\u201d\n\nWhen Lazarus replied in the negative, and noted that \u201cwe live in a government of laws, and the president is bound to obey them and apply them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell he\u2019s not applying the ACA [Affordable Care Act], and he\u2019s not applying immigration laws, and he\u2019s not applying marijuana laws, and he\u2019s not applying mandatory minimums. What\u2019s the difference with election laws?\u201d Gowdy shot back.\n\n\u201cWe have a disagreement as to whether in fact he is applying those laws. My view is that he is applying those laws,\u201d Lazarus said.\n\nThe president has arguably made substantive changes to his signature health care law and has decreed by executive order that he would not prosecute a class of undocumented immigrants who arrived here illegally at a young age.\n\nJohn Turley, professor at George Washington University Law School was far more definitive in his replies. He expressed a fear that Congress \u201cis being denied the ability to enforce its inherent powers\u201d when questioned by Gowdy.\n\n\u201cThe president is outside the line, but it has to go in front of a court, and that court has to grant review, and that\u2019s where we have the most serious constitutional crisis I view in my lifetime, and that is this body is becoming less and less relevant,\u201d Turley said.\n\nWatch the exchange below, and when you finish, check out A cappella group\u2019s amazing version of \u2018Little Drummer Boy\u2019 goes insanely viral.\n\n[poll id=\u201d144\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A dismayed U.S. Rep.
