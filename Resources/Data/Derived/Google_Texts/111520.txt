After an enthusiastic start to our “Ask Jeff” series, Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center, is back in 2015 to field your questions about our courts and the Constitution.

There’s no shortage of topics to discuss—from an upcoming Supreme Court challenge to Obamacare, to the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, to the ongoing lawsuits against same-sex marriage bans and more, nothing is off limits!

Rosen will answer your inquiries in an upcoming episode of our “We the People” constitutional podcasts.

Questions must be submitted no later than 11:59pm on Sunday, January 25. Some questions may not be selected due to inappropriate subject matter, time constraints or other concerns at the discretion of our staff.

We are collecting your questions right here on Constitution Daily—just comment directly on this post, or use the anonymous form at the bottom of the page.

You can also submit questions via Twitter by using the hashtag #AskJeffNCC.

We look forward to hearing from you!
