Each participant receives a personalized Medicaid benefit and healthcare services community care plan that meets their needs while also costing less than an institutional setting.\n\nOver its first six years, Connecticut\u2019s program successfully transitioned 2,262 institutional residents. Almost three-quarters of the participants moved into their own apartments (71 percent), while others moved into their or a family member\u2019s home (21 percent), or an assisted living facility, residential care home, or group home (8 percent).\n\nUp to two years after the community transitions, survey results showed 81 percent of residents were still living in the community and significantly happier with their daily lives. At 24 months post-transition, 93 percent were satisfied with their services, 93 percent liked where they lived, 96 percent felt they were treated by providers with respect and dignity, and global life satisfaction was high, at 83 percent.\n\n\u201cUConn\u2019s Center on Aging is very pleased to be evaluating this program that positively impacts the daily lives of Connecticut\u2019s older adults and persons with disabilities,\u201d says the Connecticut program\u2019s principal investigator Julie Robison, associate professor of medicine in the Center on Aging at UConn Health and the lead author of the Health Affairs article. \u201cConnecticut\u2019s program is a true win-win for institutional residents rejoining their communities and their families with enhanced quality of life and happiness, and also for the policy-makers who are improving Connecticut\u2019s financial health by rebalancing Medicaid healthcare spending.\u201d\n\nConnecticut was one of the earliest among 46 states and the District of Columbia participating in the Money Follows the Person program, which is funded by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nExpansion of Connecticut\u2019s Money Follows the Person program, launched in 2008, was one of the first initiatives announced by the administration of Gov. Malloy and Lieut.-Gov. Nancy Wyman upon taking office in 2011. The program is also an integral part of the Governor\u2019s Strategic Rebalancing Initiative for Long-Term Services and Supports.\n\n\u201cConnecticut is becoming a true leader in long-term care services enhancements for those who need them,\u201d says Dawn Lambert, Project Director of Medicaid Rebalancing Initiatives in Connecticut\u2019s Department of Social Services and a co-author of the Health Affairs article.\n\nShe notes that the program has empowered thousands of Connecticut\u2019s older adults and citizens with disabilities to live more independently in their communities, with the Medicaid support they need following them home, while also helping to improve the infrastructure of the state\u2019s community services.\n\nIn 2015, Connecticut\u2019s Money Follows the Person program recently reached the milestone of 3,000 successful transitions. It is set to continue, with increased federal funding, to transition and track residents returning to their communities through 2018; and will continue after that as a state-funded program.\n\nConnecticut statistics show the rate of institutional care versus home care in a community setting in 2008 was 48 percent to 52 percent. However, thanks in part to the Money Follows the Person program by 2014, these rates were rebalanced to 41 percent of persons in an institution to 59 percent in a community setting. In addition, the rebalancing program has helped the percentage of institutional long-term Medicaid expenditures in the state of Connecticut to drop from 67 percent in 2008 to 55 percent in 2014.\n\nTo qualify for the program, participants must have lived in institutions for at least 90 days, have Medicaid, and want to move to a community-based setting. However, the costs of the community care plan cannot exceed the individual\u2019s current institutional setting costs.\n\nThe Health Affairs article also notes potential areas for improvement in the program, since after one year 14 percent had returned to an institution; and post-transition, one fourth of participants reported a recent fall, and about half experienced symptoms of depression.\n\nThe Connecticut report suggests that state and national program leaders can make improvements to their programs by providing planning that centers on the individual, securing any unmet needs for medical and mental care, encouraging community involvement, implementing fall prevention measures, and identifying other specific community services or programs that might protect people from reinstitutionalization and further improve their quality of life.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "UConn Today", "description": "UConn\u2019s Center on Aging found that a state program to move institutionalized individuals home improved their quality of life and saved money,", "title": "Coming Home: State's Elderly Transitioning to Community - UConn Today", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://uconn-today.universityofconn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iStock_000012481478_Cropped.jpg", "height": 420}, "updated_time": "2015-10-14T09:19:05-04:00", "url": "http://today.uconn.edu/2015/10/coming-home-states-elderly-transitioning-to-community/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UConn\u2019s Center on Aging found that a state program to move institutionalized individuals home improved their quality of life and saved money,", "creator": "@uconn", "image": "http://uconn-today.universityofconn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iStock_000012481478_Cropped.jpg", "title": "Coming Home: State's Elderly Transitioning to Community - UConn Today", "site": "@uconn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UConn/", "section": "Community Impact", "tag": "UConn Health", "published_time": "2015-10-06T12:42:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-14T09:19:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Each participant receives a personalized Medicaid benefit and healthcare services community care plan that meets their needs while also costing less than an institutional setting.\nHowever, the costs of the community care plan cannot exceed the individual\u2019s current institutional setting costs.\nConnecticut statistics show the rate of institutional care versus home care in a community setting in 2008 was 48 percent to 52 percent.\nOver its first six years, Connecticut\u2019s program successfully transitioned 2,262 institutional residents.\nIn 2015, Connecticut\u2019s Money Follows the Person program recently reached the milestone of 3,000 successful transitions."}
