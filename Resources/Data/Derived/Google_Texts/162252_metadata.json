Given that the Census Bureau has reported that over half (57%) of the black American population is concentrated in the southern states and that black Americans are 55% more likely to be uninsured than white Americans, the lack of equal access to quality medical care\u2014including routine HIV testing and medical treatment\u2014underscores the urgent need for coordinated action to address these enduring health disparities and fight the AIDS epidemic sweeping through minority communities in the South.\n\n\u201cToday, income inequality, stigma, fear, and lack of equal access to healthcare are just a few of the variables that contribute to exploding HIV/AIDS rates in the Southeast\u2014particularly among young, black, gay or bisexual men,\u201d said Michael Weinstein, president of AHF. \u201cThe danger of the epidemic is compounded by the lack of routine HIV testing programs at healthcare facilities that help detect the virus at early stages. These factors were named in national headlines generated by a WABE public radio story that reported that in Atlanta, one of the most populous cities in the Southeast, nearly a third of newly diagnosed people have already progressed from HIV infection to a clinical diagnosis of AIDS. We need to mobilize on all fronts and work together as a community to address these disparities in health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I and the National Action Network have fought to bring down the confederate flag, I will also join the AIDS Healthcare Foundation to continue the fight,\u201d said Reverend Al Sharpton, president of National Action Network. \u201cWe not only need to bring down the flag but need to bring down health policies that minimize the value of Black lives.\u201d\n\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) has free HIV/AIDS treatment clinics and testing and outreach programs in six former states of the Confederacy: Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas.\n\nAbout AHF\n\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) is the largest non-profit HIV/AIDS healthcare provider in the USA. AHF currently provides medical care and/or services to over 430,000 individuals in 36 countries worldwide in the US, Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Asia.
