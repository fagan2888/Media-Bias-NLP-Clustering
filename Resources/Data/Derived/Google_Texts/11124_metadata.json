In 2008, the Eighth Circuit heard Planned Parenthood v. Rounds, a challenge to a South Dakota law that required abortion providers to tell their patients that abortions terminate \u201can existing relationship\u201d with an \u201cunborn human being\u201d and that abortions lead to an increased risk of suicide. They don\u2019t. Nevertheless, Colloton joined an opinion which reinstated the law after a panel of his court ordered it halted.\n\nThink Progress points out that the Eighth Circuit is the only federal appeals court to strike down the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.\n\nJudge Allison Eid annoys Think Progress because she clerked for Clarence Thomas and served as a speech writer to William Bennett. She also supported the Second Amendment rights of Colorado university students.\n\nThey don\u2019t like Missouri-based Judge Raymond Gruender because he\u2019d worked for Bob Dole\u2019s presidential bid and also wrote the opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Rounds.\n\nJudge Joan Larson is on their blacklist for clerking with recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia, a man she called \u201cone of the greatest legal minds of our era.\u201d\n\nThink Progress has negative things to say about each of the eleven Donald Trump is said to have come up with in consultation with conservative legal scholars.\n\nThe pro-abortion group NARAL Pro-Choice America says, \u201c\u2026these people are terrifying. And many of them are devoted members of the anti-choice movement.\u201d\n\nWilliam Pryor drew their sharpest criticism. They call him:\n\nA highly controversial George W. Bush judicial appointee, Pryor is a long time outspoken anti-choice activist who opposes legal abortion even in cases of rape or incest. Among his statements on the issue: \u2018I will never forget Jan. 22, 1973, the day seven members of our highest court ripped the Constitution and ripped out the life of millions of unborn children.\u2019 He also said Roe v. Wade was the \u201cworst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\n\nNARAL doesn\u2019t like Diane Sykes either:\n\nAlso a George W. Bush appointee, she has a long and documented history opposing the right to choose. As a judge in open court, she praised the criminal motives of anti-abortion protesters. \u201cI respect you a great deal for having the courage of your convictions and for the ultimate goals that you sought to achieve by this conduct.\u201d\n\nJudge Thomas Hardiman \u201chas contributed to the National Right to Life Committee before he was appointed to the federal bench.\u201d\n\nJudge Raymond Kethledge \u201c\u2026was the Judiciary Committee counsel for Sen. Spencer Abraham while Sen. Abraham was pushing for the Federal Abortion Ban. He also supported the Supreme Court nomination of Samuel Alito; it is worth noting that Alito became the fifth vote to uphold the constitutionality of the Federal Abortion Ban.\u201d\n\nAnd Judge Steven Colloton \u201c\u2026worked on special assignment to the Office of Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr.\u201d\n\nNARAL president Ilyse Hogue summed up their opposition: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court nominees is a woman\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nAs for conservatives, one very well connected Hill staffer who used to clerk for one Trump 11 describes the list as \u201can ideological murderer\u2019s row.\u201d\n\nIf anything it is the specter of four Hillary Clinton Supreme Court picks that may lure never-Trumpers into the yes camp. His eleven suggestions may have helped assuage the caution of many of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think Progress Cites Race Against Donald Trump's Judges", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Think Progress Cites Race Against Donald Trump's Judges", "title": "Think Progress Cites Race Against Donald Trump's Judges - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Trump-Its-Nothing-AP-PhotoMic-Smith.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-20T11:09:28-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/20/think-progress-goes-racist-trumps-judges/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Think Progress Cites Race Against Donald Trump's Judges", "title": "Think Progress Cites Race Against Donald Trump's Judges - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Trump-Its-Nothing-AP-PhotoMic-Smith.jpg", "creator": "@austinruse", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Think Progress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-05-20T07:47:41-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-20T11:09:28-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERConservatives hesitant about Donald Trump may find comfort in the genuine alarm and even hatred the left shows for the eleven judges Trump says he likes for the Supreme Court.\nThink Progress points out that the Eighth Circuit is the only federal appeals court to strike down the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.\nJudge Allison Eid annoys Think Progress because she clerked for Clarence Thomas and served as a speech writer to William Bennett.\nThey call him:A highly controversial George W.
