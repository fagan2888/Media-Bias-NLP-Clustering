Besides being the archbishop of one of the church\u2019s largest archdioceses in the country, he\u2019s been named by Pope Francis to the Pontifical Council for the Laity, which is aimed at revitalizing the role of lay Catholics in rejuvenating the church.\n\nObama is scheduled to meet with the pope in March, and Obamacare and its contraception and abortion mandates are sure to be on the agenda, so Chaput\u2019s thoughts on the subject carry some weight.\n\nAsked by CNS if he thought Christians are being \u201cpersecuted\u201d by the Obama administration, Chaput declined to get into hyperbole.\n\nThe United States is \u201cnot Pakistan or North Korea,\u201d he said (thank heaven for small favors), but nothing in human affairs is guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe United States has no magic immunity attached to its liberties,\u201d Chaput said. \u201cThe Constitution, as great as it is, is still just a piece of paper unless people vigorously protect their rights.\n\n\u201cFor religious believers, that means defending their faith in the courts and legislatures. It also means living their faith with joy and conviction, publicly as well as privately.\u201d\n\nCNS asked what that means in the context of a government that\u2019s trying to force religious groups to violate their beliefs.\n\n\u201cCatholics have a duty to respect legitimate authority and pray for our political leaders, whether we personally care for them or not,\u201d Chaput said.\n\n\u201cBut there are limits, and the more that government mandates evil actions, the more likely civil disobedience becomes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "As the White House prepares for a meeting with the Vatican next month, the archbishop of Philadelphia is warning that Obamacare\u2019s assault on religious beliefs is pushing American Catholics into civil disobedience.
