An \u201cintelligence committee\u201d created heat maps showing the ZIP codes with the region\u2019s highest number of uninsured residents and \u201caccess\u201d points, like community centers and libraries, to connect with people in those neighborhoods. Meanwhile, an \u201coperations committee\u201d uses that information to host canvassing and health insurance enrollment events in targeted neighborhoods. The groups also share an online dashboard to input data and track their coordinated enrollment efforts in real time.\n\n\u201cThe number of uninsured people that we have here in Harris County, 1.1 million, yeah, that\u2019s a public health emergency,\u201d said Ben Hernandez, deputy assistant director for the Houston Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s easy for us to say, 'Let\u2019s treat it like we\u2019d treat a hurricane.'\"\n\nWhile no one believed carrying out the Affordable Care Act in Texas would be easy, a series of additional obstacles has impeded efforts to help the 6.2 million uninsured Texans find health coverage. The launch of the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, was a technical disaster. The state\u2019s Republican leadership, saying Medicaid is broken, has refused to expand the program for impoverished adults. And last week, the Texas Department of Insurance issued state regulations that added further training and other requirements for the navigators hired and trained by recipients of federal grants to help people enroll in the health marketplace.\n\nStill, government officials and community-based organizations are working together to incorporate new rules, maximize their resources and educate uninsured Texans on how to take advantage of the federal law.\n\nWill Velazquez, a project coordinator for Bexar County\u2019s Department of Community Resources, is working to unite health care and nonprofit entities in San Antonio to educate the community about the law. \u201cWe basically said, \u2018How can we serve the community as a whole?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nTwice a week, the county reserves 16 computers at BiblioTech, the digital library in San Antonio, and brings in navigators and certified application counselors from five local organizations to assist people with enrollment.\n\n\u201cI need health care right now, so I\u2019m anxious to get in there and see how that\u2019s going to work for me,\u201d said Lisa Guerrero, a part-time clerk in the Bexar County constable office, who visited BiblioTech recently for assistance.\n\nGuerrero has been uninsured for nine years. During that time, she relied on community-health clinics that offer sliding-scale prices for low-income residents.\n\nIt can be difficult for low-income families like hers to navigate the health system, because those clinics\u2019 wait times for an appointment with a specialist can range from four to six months, and scheduling follow-up appointments with the same doctor can be nearly impossible. Guerrero said she shared diabetes and blood pressure medication with her father, because appointments are too costly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ridiculous that we have to jump through so many hoops to get cough medicine, to get diabetes meds, to get a check-up or a Pap smear,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the 6.2 million uninsured Texans, 28 percent would qualify for tax credits to help them purchase private health plans on the federal marketplace, and 14 percent would qualify for Medicaid coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn addition, more than one million Texas adults \u2014 17 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured population \u2014 fall into a coverage gap, according to Kaiser, because the state declined to expand Medicaid to include adults below the federal poverty threshold.\n\nSo far, only 118,532 Texans have selected a health plan on the federal marketplace.\n\nGov. Rick Perry has said expanding Texas\u2019 Medicaid program would cause taxes to \u201cskyrocket\u201d and crush the state\u2019s economy \u201cunder the weight of oppressive Medicaid costs.\u201d\n\nIn September, he asked the Texas Department of Insurance to enact additional regulations on federal navigators. The regulations were necessary to protect consumers, he said, because the navigators handle sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, and the federal guidelines were insufficient.\n\nThe insurance department issued the regulations Tuesday, requiring federal navigators to undergo background checks and receive an additional 20 hours of state-specific training. Navigators must register with the insurance department by March 1, and complete the additional training by May 1, the end of the six-month enrollment period for the federal marketplace.\n\n\u201cObamacare presents enough problems for Texans without the risk of a convicted felon handling their personal information,\u201d U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said in a statement. \u201cThese are basic requirements for screening individuals hired with taxpayer money to handle sensitive consumer information.\u201d\n\nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services awarded $11 million to organizations in Texas to hire and train navigators. They are required to receive 20 to 30 hours of training under federal law.\n\nThe United Way of Tarrant County received the largest grant, $5.8 million, and has distributed the money to 17 organizations around the state. There are 165 navigators in that consortium, including 13 hired by the city of Houston. To expand its efforts, Hernandez said the Houston health department has trained 90 city employees to become navigators and expanded their job responsibilities.\n\nThe Houston health department is also working with government entities and community-based organizations in Dallas, El Paso, Austin and the Rio Grande Valley to extend Enroll Gulf Coast\u2019s strategy across the state, Hernandez said.\n\nTim McKinney, the chief executive of United Way of Tarrant County, said navigators within their consortium had conducted 10,000 one-on-one information sessions with Texans, and enrolled 914 people in health plans, as of Dec. 31.\n\n\u201cThe primary mission of a navigator \u2014 it\u2019s really not to enroll, it\u2019s to educate and inform,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats and some health care advocates are critical of the new state rules, saying they are intended to obstruct navigators\u2019 work by adding additional costs and training requirements during the final weeks of the six-month enrollment period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to say that it\u2019s not a politically motivated stunt,\u201d said Tiffany Hogue, statewide campaign coordinator for Texas Organizing Project, political advocacy group for low-income Texans that is working with government entities in Dallas, San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley to educate Texans on the their insurance options..\n\nThe insurance department has said that \u201cunrelated political considerations would be an inappropriate basis for the rules,\u201d and that its intent is to broaden the pool of qualified navigators.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government officials and community-based organizations are working together to incorporate new rules, maximize their resources and educate uninsured Texans on how to take advantage of the federal health law.&nbsp;", "parsely-title": "Despite Obstacles, Local Governments Pursue Obamacare Enrollment", "twitter": {"description": "Government officials and community-based organizations are working together to incorporate new rules, maximize their resources and educate uninsured Texans on how to take advantage of the federal h...", "creator": "@becca_aa", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2014/01/26/local-governments-embrace-obamacare-enrollment-eff/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2014/01/24/TexTrib-NAVIGATOR-006_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "title": "Despite Obstacles, Local Governments Pursue Obamacare Enrollment", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "Government officials and community-based organizations are working together to incorporate new rules, maximize their resources and educate uninsured Texans on how to take advantage of the federal health law.&nbsp;", "title": "Despite Obstacles, Local Governments Pursue Obamacare Enrollment", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2014/01/26/local-governments-embrace-obamacare-enrollment-eff/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2014/01/24/TexTrib-NAVIGATOR-006_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Health,Federal Health Reform And Texas,Texas Department Of Insurance", "parsely-author": "Becca Aaronson", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2014/01/26/local-governments-embrace-obamacare-enrollment-eff/", "parsely-section": "front-page", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2014/01/24/TexTrib-NAVIGATOR-006_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-pub-date": "Jan. 26, 2014, 6 a.m."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd13e\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, an \u201coperations committee\u201d uses that information to host canvassing and health insurance enrollment events in targeted neighborhoods.\nThe insurance department issued the regulations Tuesday, requiring federal navigators to undergo background checks and receive an additional 20 hours of state-specific training.\nTo expand its efforts, Hernandez said the Houston health department has trained 90 city employees to become navigators and expanded their job responsibilities.\nThe groups also share an online dashboard to input data and track their coordinated enrollment efforts in real time.\nNavigators must register with the insurance department by March 1, and complete the additional training by May 1, the end of the six-month enrollment period for the federal marketplace."}
