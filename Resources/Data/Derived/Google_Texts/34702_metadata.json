And according to an op-ed in the Denver Post, they have an unexpected new ally who shares that opinion: Cory Gardner, a Republican lawmaker from Colorado who\u2019s running for U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cSince \u2018the pill\u2019 was first approved 44 years ago, it\u2019s been one of the most proven and tested pharmaceuticals of our time. It is safe, reliable, effective, and presents very few risks or complications for the more than 10 million women who use it,\u201d Gardner writes in an opinion piece that was published on Thursday afternoon. \u201cWhen other drugs have that kind of track record, we approve them for purchase without a prescription.\u201d\n\nThe GOP Senate candidate goes on to note that \u201ctoo many Democrats prefer to attack Republicans on the issue of contraception rather than actually make contraception more available and affordable, and too many Republicans are afraid to break the mold,\u201d and encourages both parties to work together to achieve real progress in this area.\n\nBut Gardner himself doesn\u2019t exactly have a legislative record of working to \u201cbreak the mold\u201d on the GOP\u2019s stance on birth control.\n\nBack in 2006, Gardner voted against a proposal to allow pharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception, an important step in eliminating the need for a prescription for that type of birth control. In 2008, he voted against a measure that would have required insurance companies to cover contraception \u201cin the same manner as any other sickness, injury, disease, or condition.\u201d He also opposed a bill to expand birth control coverage for low-income women who rely on Medicaid, as well as a bill that would allow hospitals to inform rape victims about the morning after pill. More recently, he has lent his support to several \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures that would have outlawed all abortions and some forms of birth control.\n\nNow, he appears to be trying to soften his stance. Three weeks after Gardner announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate, he came out in opposition to personhood efforts. \u201cThe fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position. I\u2019ve learned to listen. I don\u2019t get everything right the first time,\u201d he said at the time. Planned Parenthood Votes, a super PAC affiliated with the national women\u2019s health organization, has accused Gardner of attempting to \u201cwhitewash\u201d his past positions on reproductive health, pointing out that he still co-sponsors personhood initiatives on the national level. Gardner\u2019s op-ed was published on the same day that the group released an ad criticizing his history on personhood.\n\nPlanned Parenthood isn\u2019t impressed with Gardner\u2019s new call for over-the-counter birth control, either. \u201cIf Cory Gardner thinks he can delete his long record of restricting women\u2019s access to health care with one op-ed, he clearly doesn\u2019t respect the intelligence of Colorado women,\u201d the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Votes, Dawn Laguens, said in a statement, adding that the GOP candidate has \u201cspent his career trying to deny women access to birth control.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s issues with personhood reflect a larger divide within the anti-choice community. Abortion opponents don\u2019t necessarily agree about their best legislative tactic \u2014 whether it\u2019s better to advance an incremental strategy to gradually make it more difficult to access an abortion, or whether it\u2019s necessary to take a bold stance to ban all abortions altogether. Republican candidates in Colorado have been distancing themselves from personhood for the past several years, and state-level anti-choice groups are starting to splinter over frustrations that politicians aren\u2019t committed enough to banning abortion.\n\nRepublican candidates are currently working to rebrand their party\u2019s \u201cwar on women\u201d image, hoping to avoid another election where the GOP loses female voters by wide margins. At the same time, however, Republicans have doubled down on their anti-abortion messaging on the national level \u2014 and Planned Parenthood\u2019s action fund launched its largest campaign offensive ever, hoping to make it harder for candidates like Gardner to say their positions on the issues have evolved.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "But Cory Gardner has previously supported several pieces of legislation that would roll back women's ability to obtain contraception.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "But Cory Gardner has previously supported several pieces of legislation that would roll back women's ability to obtain contraception.", "title": "Senate Candidate Reverses Years-Long Opposition To Contraception, Suddenly Supports Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/20/3451294/cory-gardner-birth-control-access/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cory-Gardner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But Cory Gardner has previously supported several pieces of legislation that would roll back women's ability to obtain contraception.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cory-Gardner-321x214.jpg", "title": "Senate Candidate Reverses Years-Long Opposition To Contraception, Suddenly Supports Birth Control", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cory-Gardner.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cory-Gardner.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T10:37:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbeda\"", "article_summary": "Health Senate Candidate Reverses Years-Long Opposition To Contraception, Suddenly Supports Birth Control CREDIT: AP Photo/Chris Schneider Colorado Republican Congressman Cory GardnerMost American women want birth control pills to be available over the counter, without the need to get a prescription from a doctor.\nPlanned Parenthood isn\u2019t impressed with Gardner\u2019s new call for over-the-counter birth control, either.\nBut Gardner himself doesn\u2019t exactly have a legislative record of working to \u201cbreak the mold\u201d on the GOP\u2019s stance on birth control.\nMore recently, he has lent his support to several \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures that would have outlawed all abortions and some forms of birth control.\nBack in 2006, Gardner voted against a proposal to allow pharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception, an important step in eliminating the need for a prescription for that type of birth control."}
