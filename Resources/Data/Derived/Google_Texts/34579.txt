At this point, anything was possible.

There was a miss on no-doubt putt, incredible saves, even a little bit of fortune and plenty of drama found out among the bluffs of Mariana Butte Golf Course on Sunday.

After battling four more hours out in the heat, and as with any round of golf, fighting the ups and downs of 18 holes, still Loveland was no closer to crowning the Men's City Golf Championship victor.

The final group closed out the 18th hole, having no clear idea who was ahead or if that person even sat in one of the two carts. As each of the four players added up their scores, three found the magic number — 146.

Josh McLaughlin (72), Blake Mitchell (74) and Mike Schroetlin (74) were headed for a sudden-death playoff. Only McLaughlin, a 2013 Thompson Valley graduate, would come out unscathed to win his first city championship in an unforgettable manner.

"I'm feeling pretty good right now. It's exciting, obviously, when you win your first one," he said with a grin. "I definitely left a couple out there, but I'm glad I was able to still fire good enough to get into the playoff and win the playoff.

"Really (my mindset) was to play the way I had all day. I knew I was striking the ball good, so don't let the pressure ruin the swing and keep it going."

Pressure control would be the name of the game.

McLaughlin and Mitchell held firm during the first playoff hole, each draining birdie putts on the Par 5 first hole, while Schroetlin left a chip short of the green (although coming within an inch of holing out for birdie the following shot) to settle for par and exit with a third-place finish.

Both would rip tee shots down the fairway on the second, placing all the weight into the approach. Mitchell chunked a seven iron slightly, which left him in the rough short of the green, while McLaughlin stuck his below the flag to give himself the advantage.

"I just didn't quite get that seven iron flush and left it short and didn't get up and down, so that left the door open for him. He was in perfect position and he took advantage," Mitchell said. "I definitely felt the pressure. It's been awhile since I'd been in a position like that, in a playoff, so it's good experience and it was a real good time."

A crafty chip placed Mitchell's ball inside McLaughlin's with a similar line, shifting the pressure back onto the latter's shoulders to sink the birdie for an outright win, or leave the door cracked for Mitchell's par attempt.

McLaughlin hit a near-perfect putt, but tapped in for par. With their balls in similar position, had he given Mitchell the extra bit of information to read the green and extend the playoff?

"I mean, I thought that he was going to make that par because I was giving him a pretty good line there. I thought I'd made it when I hit it," McLaughlin said. "That's why I wanted to put (my birdie putt) in and end it right there."

By now, Mitchell was locked in. It seemed more likely than not he'd drop the par putt and continue on after narrowly missing an eagle putt for the win on the first playoff hole, which would have been his second eagle in a row, though by more conventional means.

The elevated green of the 18th hole sits high above the players and as they take their approach shots it's hard to see where the ball lands. Mitchell hit a nine iron from 150 yards out, but when he carted up the hill his ball was no where to be found.

Surely he didn't fly the green? He never does that. Players from an earlier group tell Mitchell he'd spun it in. Seriously?

"I didn't believe it at first. I was kind of like 'are they joking?' Then I go up there and it's in the hole. I didn't know where I was at (on the leaderboard). I was just trying to finish the round," he said. "Once I found out it was in the hole, and I was in the playoff, it was like a completely new day."

Luck had given the three-time city champion a shot at a fourth, so when his par putt on the second hole of the playoff slid wide of the cup, it was hard to feel too disappointed.

"I'm still happy; it was a great day. You'd like to win, but I was just happy to get into the playoff," Mitchell said. "Josh is a great kid, so it's good to see him win."

Casey Brock, the leader after the first day, carded a 76 Sunday missing the playoff by a single stroke to finish in fourth (147) and Tanner Swayne turned in a 72 for a fifth-place 149.
