RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Samba school Imperio da Tijuca opened Rio’s famed Carnival parade Sunday night with an over-the-top display that included buxom dancers in bikinis and feathers, thumping drum sections and a float shaped like a giant crustacean.

Six schools were scheduled to parade in the Sambodrome on the first night of a two-night competition, which attracts thousands of spectators and millions of television viewers. Many Brazilians have a favorite samba school that they root for with a passion rivaled only by the allegiances for Brazil’s football teams.

More than 2,500 people take part in each parade, which last about an hour, as groups of costumed participants and oversized floats make their way through the Sambodrome. Each samba group is judged in 10 categories, from the quality of the drum sections to the beauty of costumes. Whichever group comes in last is not allowed to compete in the next year’s competition among the 12 best groups.
