Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonJudge seals all video interviews in Clinton email case State aide thought Clinton email was for ‘family and friends’ Clinton: I'm ready for Trump's 'fantasy' campaign MORE will start doing “plenty of interviews” this week, following her official campaign kick-off speech on Saturday, Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

The Democratic presidential frontrunner has been criticized for being closed off to the media in the months leading up to her bid for the White House.

“Hillary was focused in the first two months of this campaign on being accessible to everyday Americans,” Mook said.

Mook explained that Clinton wanted to initially discuss campaign issues through “small roundtables” where Clinton could concentrate on “workshopping her policies.”

“What you saw in her speech yesterday was the result of two months hitting the ground talking to everyday Americans, getting their input,” Mook said.

But now Clinton’s White House run will start to resemble a more traditional — and accessible — campaign, said John Podesta, chairman of Clinton’s campaign.

“This really is the beginning of the long run to the nomination, and then to the presidency,” he said in an interview.
