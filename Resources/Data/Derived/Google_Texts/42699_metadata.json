A new report from the Associated Press confirmed that at least some Obamacare consumers are struggling to find doctors.\n\nWhen Olivia Papa signed up for a new health plan last year, her insurance company assigned her to a primary care doctor. The relatively healthy 61-year-old didn\u2019t try to see the doctor until last month, when she and her husband both needed authorization to see separate specialists. She called the doctor\u2019s office several times without luck. \u201cThey told me that they were not on the plan, they were never on the plan and they\u2019d been trying to get their name off the plan all year,\u201d said Papa, who recently bought a plan from a different insurance company. It was no better with the next doctor she was assigned. The Naples, Fla., resident said she left a message to make an appointment, \u201cand they never called back.\u201d The Papas were among the 6.7 million people who gained insurance through the Affordable Care Act last year, flooding a primary care system that is struggling to keep up with demand. A survey this year by The Physicians Foundation found that 81 percent of doctors describe themselves as either over-extended or at full capacity, and 44 percent said they planned to cut back on the number of patients they see, retire, work part-time or close their practice to new patients.\n\nThe wire service said that experts believe most people are still \u201creceiving the care they need, even if they have to drive farther, wait longer, or see a nurse practitioner or physician assistant rather than a doctor,\u201d but the inability for people who purchased insurance through the exchanges to obtain a primary care physician is a serious concern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of President Obama's health care reform law have long cautioned that it would make it more difficult for people to find primary care doctors.
