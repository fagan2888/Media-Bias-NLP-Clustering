This he views, though, as a problem of \u201cIslam today.\u201d (He neglects to point out that in the Muslim-dominated countries where this peaceful coexistence occurred, Christians and Jews suffered humiliating second-rate dhimmi status, unequal legally or socially to Muslims.) Writing on Al Jazeera English, Lana Asfour lauds Affleck for calling out Maher\u2019s \u201cracism\u201d and espies, in the comedian\u2019s treatment of Islam, an \u201coverriding agenda\u201d aimed at justifying the \u201cpast, present, and future mistakes\u201d of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nOne pundit in particular, though, has busied himself opining on Maher and nonbelievers in general \u2014 Reza Aslan, Islam\u2019s most prominent apologist of late. Delivered via multiple media outlets, his remarks, brimming with condescension, tinged with arrogance and laden with implicit insults to thinking people, deserve special scrutiny for one main reason: among well-intentioned liberals who don\u2019t know much about religion, his words carry weight.\n\nIn a New York Times editorial, Aslan accused Maher and other nonbelievers of \u201cexhibiti[ing] an inability to understand religion outside of its absolutist connotations.\u201d Such folk, in his telling, unjustly \u201cscour holy texts for bits of savagery and point to extreme examples of religious bigotry, of which there are too many, to generalize about the causes of oppression throughout the world.\u201d They fail to grasp, in his view, that \u201creligion is often far more a matter of identity than it is a matter of beliefs and practices.\u201d\n\nYet Aslan accuses the benighted critics of religion of a far more grievous misapprehension: the assumption that words mean what they actually mean. Here I\u2019ll quote him at length.\n\n\u201cIt is a fallacy to believe that people of faith derive their values primarily from their Scriptures. The opposite is true. People of faith insert their values into their scriptures, reading them through the lens of their own cultural, ethnic, nationalistic and even political perspectives. . . . After all, scripture is meaningless without interpretation. The abiding nature of scripture rests not so much in its truth claims as it does in its malleability, its ability to be molded and shaped into whatever form a worshiper requires. . . If you are a violent misogynist, you will find plenty in your scriptures to justify your beliefs. If you are a peaceful, democratic feminist, you will also find justification in the scriptures for your point of view.\u201d\n\nNow we have to stop and ponder what we are being sold here. Aslan is essentially taking a postmodernist, Derrida-esque scalpel to \u201cscripture\u201d and eviscerating it of objective content. This might pass muster in the college classroom these days, but what of all those ISIS warriors unschooled in French semiotic analysis who take their holy book\u2019s admonition to do violence literally? As they rampage and behead their way through Syria and Iraq, ISIS fighters know they have the Koran on their side \u2013 a book they believe to be inerrant and immutable, the final Word of God, and not at all \u201cmalleable.\u201d Their holy book backs up jihad, suicide attacks (\u201cmartyrdom\u201d), beheadings, even taking captive women as sex slaves. This is not surprising; after all, the prophet Muhammad was a warrior who spread Islam by the sword in a dark, turbulent time in history. (Christianity\u2019s propagation had, in contrast, much to do with the Roman emperor Constantine\u2019s fourth-century conversion and subsequent decriminalization of the faith.)\n\nMoreover, the razor-happy butchers of little girls\u2019 clitorises and labia majora, the righteous wife-beaters, the stoners of adulterers, the shariah clerics denying women\u2019s petitions for divorce from abusive husbands and awarding sons twice the inheritance allowed for daughters, all act with sanction from Islamic holy writ. It matters not a whit to the bloodied and battered victims of such savagery which lines from the Hadith or what verses from the Koran ordain the violence and injustice perpetrated against them, but one thing they do know: texts and belief in them have real-life consequences. And we should never forget that ISIS henchmen and executioners explicitly cite their faith in Islam as their motive. Tell that to Derrida \u2013 or Aslan.\n\nNot just belief in the Koran leads to mayhem, though. Open the Book of Leviticus (in the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament) and read the prescriptions of death (often by stoning or burning) as punishment for, among other things, cursing your parents, committing adultery, practicing bestiality (with mandatory slaughter of the unwitting animal as well), engaging in prostitution or sodomy, worshipping another god or taking God\u2019s name in vain, and being the (female) victim of rape. The New Testament is somewhat less vicious, but even gentle Jesus, meek and mild, warned in Matthew (10:34): \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword,\u201d and preached \u201cunquenchable fire\u201d and damnation for sinners.\n\nThat the faithful have always been acting on the words in their holy books may not accord with how Aslan would like us to see religion, but it is hardly news. Even Shakespeare found this problematic. In \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d he wrote that \u201cIn religion, what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text, hiding the grossness with fair ornament.\u201d Grosser \u201cerrors\u201d than beheadings or female genital mutilation cannot be imagined; intentionally trying to obscure cause and effect where faith is concerned, as Aslan does, is morally reprehensible, is insensitive to the victims, and provides cover for their butchers.\n\nThe problem with religion lies not with, as Aslan would have it, interpretation \u2013 postmodern or otherwise \u2013 but with, for starters, the founding texts themselves. The canonical writings of Islam, Christianity and Judaism all contain a plethora of macabre fables and explicit injunctions for vile, sadistic behavior that no civilized person would or should accept, but which far too many do take as literal truth. (And not just in the Middle East. Even in the United States, a Gallup poll conducted this summer established that three out of four Americans consider the Bible the actual word of God.) The only way for those hoping to justify faith while shielding their scripture from censure is to do what Aslan does: shift the focus from the \u201choly\u201d texts to the people reading them.\n\nThe so-called \u201cNew Atheists,\u201d including Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens, have tried to do the opposite: get people to examine religion and help them understand it as innately backward, obscurantist, irrational and dangerous. Their aggressive secularism has, of course, stirred controversy and resentment. It was bound to do so. For millennia, the faithful have held the high moral ground virtually unopposed. Now (at least occasionally) under fire, some modern-day believers have taken to levying a clever yet false counter-accusation; namely, that the so-called \u201cNew Atheism\u201d amounts to a \u201creligion all its own\u201d and that nonbelief can be just as hazardous as nonbelievers say religion is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Major religions all contain macabre fables, explicit injunctions for vile behavior no civilzed person should accept", "title": "Reza Aslan\u2019s atheism problem: \u201cFundamentalist\u201d atheists aren\u2019t the issue, apologists for religions are", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Major religions all contain macabre fables, explicit injunctions for vile behavior no civilzed person should accept", "title": "Reza Aslan\u2019s atheism problem: \u201cFundamentalist\u201d atheists aren\u2019t the issue, apologists for religions are", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/25/reza_aslans_atheism_problem_fundamentalist_atheists_arent_the_issue_apologists_for_religions_are/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/maher_aslan_dawkins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Major religions all contain macabre fables, explicit injunctions for vile behavior no civilzed person should accept", "title": "Reza Aslan\u2019s atheism problem: \u201cFundamentalist\u201d atheists aren\u2019t the issue, apologists for religions are", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/maher_aslan_dawkins.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Bill Maher, Christopher Hitchens, Editor's Picks, Islam, New Atheism, New York Times, Nicholas Kristof, Real Time, Religion, Reza Aslan, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9360\"", "article_summary": "One pundit in particular, though, has busied himself opining on Maher and nonbelievers in general \u2014 Reza Aslan, Islam\u2019s most prominent apologist of late.\nAnd we should never forget that ISIS henchmen and executioners explicitly cite their faith in Islam as their motive.\nThe problem with religion lies not with, as Aslan would have it, interpretation \u2013 postmodern or otherwise \u2013 but with, for starters, the founding texts themselves.\n\u201cIt is a fallacy to believe that people of faith derive their values primarily from their Scriptures.\n(Christianity\u2019s propagation had, in contrast, much to do with the Roman emperor Constantine\u2019s fourth-century conversion and subsequent decriminalization of the faith.)"}
