Fox News "Worst Host" Sean Hannity (Screencap)

Personnel at the Fox News Channel put on a great show of being outraged Friday that President Barack Obama called them out by name in a speech about lies and distortions about the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — which goes into effect Oct. 1.

Former CNN anchor turned Fox personality Bill Hemmer protested on Friday, “What have we reported that is inaccurate about this? What has been reported through the Fox News Channel that is not accurate?”

In the video embedded below, the media watchdog group Media Matters highlighted just a few of them, including Sarah Palin’s “death panels,” euthanasia for the elderly, assertions that the ACA is “unconstitutional,” that it’s going to result in “rationing” of health care and more.
