The baby had a tongue-tie, limiting his ability to nurse. A specialist confirmed the condition and snipped the baby\u2019s short frenulum \u2013 the piece of tissue that connects the tongue to the bottom of the mouth \u2013 but the long learning curve continued for both mom and son. Alcala stocked up on creams and cabbage leaves to soothe her sore breasts.\n\nThen, when Mateo was 9 weeks old, Alcala returned to her full-time job as an aquatics manager at Fairchild Air Force Base. And \u2013 as happens for many working women who want to continue to breast-feed their babies \u2013 there arose a whole new set of challenges.\n\nThe hardest part was using a breast pump to express her milk, she said.\n\n\u201cPumping in general doesn\u2019t do anything for a woman, certainly not me,\u201d Alcala said. \u201cAnd having to do it at work was really uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWhile breast-feeding rates are high in Spokane County and throughout Idaho right after babies are born, they\u2019re dramatically lower by the time babies are a few months old \u2013 partly because many women share Alcala\u2019s experience: There\u2019s a lot about going back to work that makes it difficult to breast-feed babies.\n\n\u201cGoing back to work really is one of the two biggest reasons moms give up breast-feeding,\u201d said Rachel Schwartz, who runs the Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington. \u201cThe other one is just a general lack of support from the community and health care providers. Employers recognizing that and recognizing they can take some small steps really makes a difference.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, many employees have legal rights to time and space to express their milk at work. But for some mothers, logistical hurdles to pumping milk and saving it for baby\u2019s consumption later can seem insurmountable, leading them to give up.\n\nCompared with some other working mothers, Alcala said, she was fortunate. She could close her office door and pull the window blinds. She had a refrigerator to store milk, and Alcala\u2019s husband, who works an opposite schedule, brought the baby to her once a workday to nurse.\n\nBut hooking herself up to a machine and letting it pump away, as her staff worked nearby, wasn\u2019t fun.\n\n\u201cFrom four months on, it was tempting every day to quit,\u201d said Alcala, 32, of Airway Heights. \u201cWhat kept me going was knowing the benefits for him,\u201d as well as the connection she felt with the baby through nursing.\n\nWhat also kept her going, she said: her boss, who backed her up the whole time, including when pumping and nursing took time from her workday. When she got behind, she went to work on weekends to catch up.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I could have continued to do it if I didn\u2019t have the boss that I have,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere he is really supportive and willing to let me do that.\u201d\n\n\u2018A huge barrier\u2019\n\nOther workers \u2013 especially those working minimum-wage jobs \u2013 lack lactation-support services, said Tiffany Schamber, who runs the health district\u2019s WIC program, which provides peer counselors, breast pumps and support groups to help promote and extend breast-feeding among clients.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a private room for the moms to pump in, they don\u2019t have anybody to give them a break so they can go pump,\u201d Schamber said. \u201cMany moms have reported having to pump in bathroom stalls or out in their car, or that there simply is no private place for them to go to express their milk. That\u2019s a huge barrier.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, 91.3 percent of mothers in Spokane County started to breast-feed their newborns, according to data from the Spokane Regional Health District.\n\nBut despite that high initiation rate, many women stopped nursing their babies soon after giving birth, according to a survey conducted from 2007 to 2011. Slightly less than 59 percent of Spokane County mothers were still breast-feeding their 2- to 4-month-old infants. Rates continue to decline after babies turn 6 months old, Schamber said.\n\nIn Idaho, 91.8 percent of women initiated breast-feeding after their babies were born, according to data from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. By 3 months, 60.3 percent were breast-feeding exclusively.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breast-feeding until babies are 6 months old, followed by breast-feeding in combination with other foods until they\u2019re at least 12 months and continuing as long as the mother and baby want to continue.\n\nThe business case\n\nYet employers who make it easier for women to pump can cut health care costs, time workers spend away from work with sick children, and boost employees\u2019 productivity and morale, Schamber said.\n\n\u201cThere is a ton of research and data out there that shows that (breast-fed) kids are healthier,\u201d she said. \u201cThey suffer less ear infections. They have less upper respiratory illnesses and things like that, so mom is not going to have to stay home as often with her baby because her baby isn\u2019t as sick. That speaks to the business\u2019s bottom line \u2013 and it\u2019s using less health care dollars.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agrees there\u2019s a case to be made for creating nursing-friendly worksites.\n\nIts Business Case for Breastfeeding program is designed to educate employers about the benefits of supporting nursing mothers. Businesses stand to gain happier, more loyal workers, it says \u2013 but also bottom-line savings as they\u2019re better able to keep experienced employees on the job, cut sick time parents take to care for ill kids, and reduce health care costs.\n\nThe program offers free online resources for helping employers provide lactation support for workers.\n\nIn many cases, they\u2019re legally required to do so.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers have to provide break time for pumping until the baby turns 1 and a private place, besides a restroom, to do it.\n\nThe law, which took effect in 2010, leaves it up to workers to decide when and how long the breaks should be, said Schwartz, of the Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington. The group is a program of WithinReach, a statewide organization that works to promote family health.\n\nBut while the law applies to hourly employees, salaried workers are exempt, Schwartz said. That leaves out some big groups, including teachers, for whom it\u2019s often difficult to schedule time for pumping and who are left with no legal protection, she said. Also, employers with fewer than 50 workers can apply for exemption if accommodating breast-feeding women would cause \u201cundue hardship.\u201dAt Inland Northwest Health Services, there\u2019s no formal policy on supporting nursing mothers at work, said Nicole Stewart, director of marketing and communications. But INHS maintains comfortable, private and clean rooms where mothers can pump, she said.\n\nAs a manager, Stewart said, she can see productivity gains offered by the on-site rooms, if the alternative for employees was to leave work to nurse.\n\n\u201cOverall, I think the most important thing is that as an employer you\u2019re embracing their choice and making it easier and more comfortable for them to (breast-feed),\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd ultimately that makes for a happier employee.\u201d\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act took effect, Eastern Washington University officials informed employees in 2010 it would provide breaks and space for employees to express their milk until their babies turned 1, said Caren Lincoln, EWU\u2019s human resources supervisor.\n\nThat formalized a process that workers and supervisors likely worked out on their own, she said.\n\n\u201cThe individuals that I\u2019m aware of have been thankful for having a private place to go do that,\u201d Lincoln said, \u201cand I think that will automatically translate into a morale booster.\u201d\n\nCreative solutions\n\nFor other employers, the benefits \u2013 and the path toward creating a nursing-friendly worksite \u2013 are less clear.\n\nAs the Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington reaches out to employers around the state to make them aware of the federal law, it\u2019s found supportive workplaces as well as bosses reluctant to make changes, Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest issues, frankly, is that we have a sexualized concept of the breast in this country, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is. We hear from a lot of managers that they\u2019re just uncomfortable to even talk about this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one reason to have a formal policy in place, Schwartz said. When lactation support is just another on-the-books employee benefit, the burden on managers eases: \u201cIt\u2019s just part of what you do for the wellness of your employees.\u201d\n\nFinding a space where women can express their milk is another frequent concern, she said. But while designated lactation rooms with couches and bulletin boards for babies\u2019 photos are nice, she said, they\u2019re not necessary. They might be impossible in a fast-food restaurant or a retail store.\n\nThe breastfeeding coalition works to find creative ways to create private spaces, Schwartz said. In a clothing store, a changing room will do. In spots with no closed-off spaces, employers have used pipes and drapes or cubicle walls to create makeshift rooms. Closets can be converted, managers\u2019 offices borrowed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some great work in the central area of our state with women that work in fruit-packing plants, and the rooms they\u2019ve adapted,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just taking a closet space and making it work. You don\u2019t need a big space to be able to be compliant with the law.\u201d\n\n\u2018Can we talk?\u2019\n\nEven under the best circumstances, breast-feeding can be challenging for working mothers, and quitting in favor of formula is a temptation even for those who\u2019d set a goal of breast-feeding for longer.\n\n\u201cPumping is not nearly as fun as breast-feeding a baby,\u201d said Xylina Weaver, a birth and family educator at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center who leads its weekly breast-feeding support group.\n\nWeaver, also a certified lactation consultant who has her own business, helps women prepare themselves and their babies for the transition, suggesting that babies start learning to use a bottle before their mothers return to work.\n\nTo help women who want to stick with it, peer counselors at the health district\u2019s WIC program help brainstorm ways to make breast-feeding on the job work better. Maybe a long extension cord, connecting an electrical outlet in a public place to a pump in a private place, can do the trick. Sometimes WIC can help clients get car adapters for their breast pumps, when there\u2019s nowhere else to use it, said Schamber, the program manager.\n\nSchwartz said she encourages workers to, \u201cas much as possible, be proactive about it before they go out on maternity leave \u2013 talk about it as their right. Say, \u2018I\u2019m going to come back to work, and I\u2019m going to be pumping. Can we talk about what that will look like?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Dana Stroud did, and it worked.\n\nStroud, a fisheries research biologist at EWU, knew before she was pregnant she\u2019d breast-feed her baby. Her mother and her husband\u2019s mother had nursed their babies. And Stroud didn\u2019t want to have to heat up bottles for overnight feedings.\n\n\u201cPlus, as a biologist, I knew there were a lot of reasons for my health as well as for my daughter\u2019s health, for the best possible immune system,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Stroud also knew her own mother lost her milk supply after returning to work, partly because breast pumps worked less efficiently then and partly because her mother\u2019s employer didn\u2019t provide adequate breaks or a suitable place to pump.\n\nAs she neared her third trimester of pregnancy, Stroud talked with staff at EWU\u2019s human resources department.\n\n\u201cI told them I planned on breast-feeding and I would need a place to pump that was discreet, ideally with a sink in close proximity to my workplace,\u201d Stroud said. It was in place before she left on maternity leave. Her pumping room is across a hall from her office.\n\nStroud has been working and breast-feeding since Makea was 12 weeks old, with the goal of continuing until the baby turns 1, which is on Monday.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve reached my original goal, I kind of feel like as long as it\u2019s comfortable for me and it\u2019s comfortable for her, we\u2019ll continue,\u201d she said.\n\nStroud said she feels lucky to have a flexible and encouraging employer. She urged other women to learn about how breast- feeding laws affect them.\n\n\u201cWe do have a right to breast-feed, and we have a right to pump when we\u2019re not in close proximity to our kids,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to know your rights if you want to continue breast-feeding.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breast-feeding her son, Mateo, was painful and difficult for Becky Alcala.
