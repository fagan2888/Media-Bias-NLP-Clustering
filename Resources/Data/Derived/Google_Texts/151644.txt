Calvary Christian School is hosting a live auction Thursday, March 27th. The auction will include a variety of items from furniture, all the way to cakes and paintings. With the 50th anniversary for the school being held this year, plans are to make the auction bigger than in the past.

The Chairman of the Auction Becky Vance said, "It's a well known fact that a private school cannot exist just on tuition. So we're always having one fundraiser after another."

The auction starts at 6:30 and will have an auctioneer. The auction is free to attend and they will serve heavy hors d'oeuvres. If you would like to attend the auction, their address is 3917 7th Street in Meridian.
