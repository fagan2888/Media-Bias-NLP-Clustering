A document filed in court shows the woman accused of killing four people and injuring dozens of others after driving through Oklahoma State University's homecoming parade last month had a blood-alcohol content lower the legal intoxication threshold.

The Tulsa World reports that 25-year-old Adacia Chambers was ordered to submit to a blood alcohol test at Stillwater Medical Center following the Oct. 24 crash.

A document filed Thursday in Payne County District Court by defense attorney Tony Coleman indicates her blood-alcohol content was 0.01. The legal threshold for intoxication is 0.08.

Chambers faces four counts of second-degree murder and 46 counts of assault and battery with means likely to produce death.

Prosecutors say evidence suggests it was "an intentional act."
