This is what change looks like.\u201d\n\nRelations with Congress\n\nObama has managed to score his recent diplomatic victories despite a notoriously rocky relationship with a Congress with which he has hardly been able to agree on anything.\n\nBut the changes may not be enough to seal his legacy, said Miller, who has authored a book called The End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.\n\n\u201cAn historic president?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely. An undeniably great president along the lines of Washington in the 18th (century) and Lincoln in the 19th and FDR in the 20th? No.\u201d\n\nMiller, like other analysts, wonders what space Obama will occupy in the pantheon of 43 presidents \u2013 and that will depend on more than his foreign policy legacy.\n\n\u201cRight now, that\u2019s very difficult to say,\u201d he said.\n\nHistoric\n\nDomestically, his election as the nation\u2019s first black president was historic.\n\nMany Americans credit him with steering the nation away from economic collapse after the biggest downturn since the Great Depression. And he pushed through the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, the largest health care reform law in U.S. history.\n\nMiller and other analysts said Obamacare remains a highly divisive issue among Americans, and its full effects will also not be known for some time.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Africa, Africa, foreign policy, President Barack Obama, legacy, Iran nuclear deal", "Author": "Luis Ramirez", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Many analysts wonder what space Barack Obama will occupy in pantheon of 43 presidents \u2014 and that will depend on more than his foreign policy legacy", "title": "Analysts: Obama\u2019s Africa Trip Underscores Drive for Foreign Policy Legacy", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/analysts-obamas-africa-trip-underscores-drive-for-foreign-policy-legacy/2883231.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/23C1D2CE-9AB4-47BD-AC25-B8708C6B47C6_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/23C1D2CE-9AB4-47BD-AC25-B8708C6B47C6_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Analysts: Obama\u2019s Africa Trip Underscores Drive for Foreign Policy Legacy", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
