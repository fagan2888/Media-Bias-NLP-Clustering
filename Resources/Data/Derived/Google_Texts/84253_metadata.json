They rescued the five boaters, the release states.\n\nCoast Guard officials from Charleston launched a 45-foot response boat to assist and took the rescued boaters to Remley\u2019s Point boat ramp.\n\nThey were uninjured and reported to be in \u201cgood condition.\u201d\n\nThe release states that the boaters\u2019 possession and use of the emergency radio beacon helped tremendously in narrowing down the Coast Guard\u2019s search and played a \u201cmajor factor\u201d in their rescue. The device is available at most marine supply stores, or online, and sends out a signal detected by satellites to help the Coast Guard locate mariners in distress.\n\nReach Melissa Boughton at 937-5594 or at Twitter.com/mboughton.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Coast Guard: 5 boaters rescued 62 miles east of Charleston with help of emergency radio device, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, boat rescue,capsize,rescue,U.S. Coast Guard", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Five boaters are safe after their 25-foot catamaran, Morning Brite, capsized and sunk Sunday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.", "title": "Coast Guard: 5 boaters rescued 62 miles east of Charleston with help of emergency radio device", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150614/150619634/coast-guard-5-boaters-rescued-62-miles-east-of-charleston-with-help-of-emergency-radio-device", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150614/PC16/150619634/AR/0/AR-150619634.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150614/PC16/150619634/AR/0/AR-150619634.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five boaters are safe after their 25-foot catamaran, Morning Brite, capsized and sunk Sunday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.", "title": "Coast Guard: 5 boaters rescued 62 miles east of Charleston with help of emergency radio device", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150614/PC16/150619634/AR/0/AR-150619634.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150619634}}, "keywords": "Coast Guard: 5 boaters rescued 62 miles east of Charleston with help of emergency radio device , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, boat rescue,capsize,rescue,U.S. Coast Guard", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-14T16:30:18Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-14T16:30:00Z", "author": "Melissa Boughton"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Five boaters are safe after their 25-foot catamaran, Morning Brite, capsized and sunk Sunday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd011f\"", "article_summary": "About 8:45 a.m., boaters used an Emergency Indicating Radio Beacon to issue a \u201cMayday,\u201d which helped Coast Guard officials locate them.\nCoast Guard officials from Charleston launched a 45-foot response boat to assist and took the rescued boaters to Remley\u2019s Point boat ramp.\nThe device is available at most marine supply stores, or online, and sends out a signal detected by satellites to help the Coast Guard locate mariners in distress.\nFive boaters are safe after their 25-foot catamaran, Morning Brite, capsized and sunk Sunday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\nThey were reportedly in the water about 62 miles east of Charleston, according to a Sunday media release."}
