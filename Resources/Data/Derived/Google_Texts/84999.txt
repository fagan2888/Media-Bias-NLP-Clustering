These tiny, portable files make for perfect travel companions. They don't take up space and provide hours of entertainment on the go.

By Berit Baugher for Fathom | It took the Serial phenomenon to unite Team Fathom on the awesomeness that is the podcast. Without naming names, there were a few skeptics in the bunch to balance out those of us who'd been touting their love of the medium for years. But we're all on the same page now: These tiny, portable files make for perfect travel companions. They don't take up space and provide hours of entertainment on the go. Here's what we're listening to this spring. Some new. Some old. All worth a download.
