The hospital has offered to transfer their records to the office of Dr. Howard Fisher, a solo practitioner whose office is two blocks from the hospital.\n\nAlmost all of the children receive insurance coverage through the state Medicaid program, which will continue to pay for their care at the doctor\u2019s office. The move will save the hospital an undisclosed amount of money, free up space on the \u00adhospital\u2019s main floor, and move the patients into a private-practice model of care, said Dr. Adam Jarrett, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly part of our mission to care for people who are underserved,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cWe feel very strongly that we are continuing to meet that mission.\u201d\n\nFisher is \u201crequired to take all comers,\u201d regardless of ability to pay, said Jarrett.\n\nHospitals shifting load\n\nThe change is the latest example of a hospital shifting the work of a hospital-based clinic to other operators for whom care of the poor is a financially viable business model. While hospitals lose money on their clinics, non-hospital providers often receive higher reimbursements and have lower expenses for providing the same care.\n\nHackensack University Medical Center and Englewood Hospital and Medical Center both transfered their clinics over the last seven years to North Hudson Community Action Corp., which is paid more for their care by the federal government.\n\nPediatricians have become more willing to accept Medicaid patients because of a bump in reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act, said Michael Maron, Holy Name\u2019s president and chief executive officer. The hospital, under its contract with Fisher, will be responsible for any shortfalls for the care of uninsured patients, and will continue to provide financial counseling and social services to the patients \u2014 including help enrolling in Medicaid, if they have not already done so. He will receive $125,000 per year to help with any additional support staff needed and to compensate for his on-call hours, the hospital said in a letter to state officials about the change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re mirroring the services provided here [in the clinic] at the pediatrician\u2019s office,\u201d said Sheryl Ann Syby, administrator of wom\u00aden\u2019s and children\u2019s services. Last year, the clinic averaged 18 visits a day, a spokeswoman said. Fisher said he did not expect the additional patients to affect his practice.\n\nConditional approval\n\nThe state Health Department approved the pediatric arrangement as long as Fisher \u201ccontinues to provide care to all new and existing clinic patients.\u201d If the relationship with Fisher ends, Holy Name is required to reinstate the services or arrange with another doctor to do it, with no interruption to patient care, according to a letter from a Health Department official to Catherine Yaxley, a Holy Name vice president.\n\nClosing the clinic will eliminate 4.6 full-time positions \u2014 including one doctor and several nurses \u2014 at the hospital, said Sheryl Slonim, executive vice president for patient care services. The letter to patients said that Dr. Norma Murray, the clinic\u2019s long-time pediatrician, would no longer be associated with the hospital.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s bright, many-windowed space, with examination rooms and a reception area, will be repurposed to serve as the office of Dr. Robert Rigolosi, medical director of the hospital\u2019s renal care center, and as flexible offices for surgeons and other doctors providing follow-up care at the hospital, Maron said.\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck is closing its hospital-based pediatric clinic for poor children at the end of April, and will transfer their care to a physician with a private office close to the hospital.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "title": "Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck shifting clinics off campus", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/holy-name-medical-center-in-teaneck-shifting-clinics-off-campus-1.1306731", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.1306732!/fileImage/httpImage/holyname-010313-ts-tif.jpg", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "description": "Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck is closing its hospital-based pediatric clinic for poor children at the end of April, and will transfer their care to a physician with a private office close to the hospital."}, "author": "LINDY WASHBURN", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "DC.creator": "LINDY WASHBURN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck shifting clinics off campus"}, "article_summary": "Hackensack University Medical Center and Englewood Hospital and Medical Center both transfered their clinics over the last seven years to North Hudson Community Action Corp., which is paid more for their care by the federal government.\nHoly Name Medical Center in TeaneckThe hospital is also moving its adult clinic off-site, to offices on Queen Anne Road, as of April 13.\nHoly Name Medical Center in Teaneck is closing its hospital-based pediatric clinic for poor children at the end of April, and will transfer their care to a physician with a private office close to the hospital.\nFamilies of the 990 children with medical records at the pediatric clinic have been receiving letters from the hospital explaining the change.\nThe letter to patients said that Dr. Norma Murray, the clinic\u2019s long-time pediatrician, would no longer be associated with the hospital."}
