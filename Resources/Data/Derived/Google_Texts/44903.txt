When planning your summer trip, getting the best airfares may be all about timing.

Now is the time to travel. Gas Prices are expected to be the lowest in years, and flights are expected to be slightly cheaper this summer than last.

With some strategic planning, you could get the best deals. Travel experts say Sundays are the most expensive day to fly, followed by Friday. So to get the best fares during the summer, fly on a Tuesday or Wednesday. This could save you on average $100 a ticket.

A report from CheapAir.com found buying tickets 54 days in advance yields the biggest savings.

Also, July is the most expensive month. If you fly in August, that could save you about $40.

As for certain locations. flights to many cities are expected to be on sale. On the list so far: Atlanta, Orlando, Dallas, Chicago and Seattle.
