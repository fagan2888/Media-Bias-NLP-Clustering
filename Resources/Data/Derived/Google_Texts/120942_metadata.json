Huang Lei, a marketing manager at Beijing-based Harvest Fund, told Reuters the company is also weighing the launch of a commodity product, though nothing has been set in stone. Meanwhile, a manager with Wanjia Asset said the Shanghai-based firm was preparing application materials to begin a fund that tracks a commodities futures price index, without giving more detail. \"Commodities futures markets have been very hot these days while there are very few opportunities in other markets, so mutual funds are looking into commodities,\" she said. SURGING TRADE Several commodity markets around the world have recovered this year, with Dalian iron ore futures rallying more than 35 percent since early January and oil futures climbing back near $40 a barrel after plunging below $30. For the first two months of this year, total ShFE trading volumes surged about 50 percent, with volumes on the Dalian Commodity Exchange shooting up over 85 percent. But some futures brokers warned that Chinese mutual funds would need time to understand commodity futures and to hire experienced traders. \"The trading of commodities futures is different, requiring strong risk control skills ... but it's becoming a trend for mutual funds to participate in the arena too,\" said a futures broker who speaks to funds. Others saw such diversification as inevitable. \"Taking the longer view, I ... see the development of new commodity investment funds as the continued and necessary diversification of investment products in China - a process that will continue for many more years,\" said John Browning, managing director of Hong Kong-based Bands Financial.
