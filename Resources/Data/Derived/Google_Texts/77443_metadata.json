This guy is a deranged murderer and I hope he is put away for life. It may be that we should be classifying that as domestic terrorism as well. But that has nothing to do with the truth of what is going on in Planned Parenthood. And this is a typical left-wing tactic, to try and shut down the truth by silencing people. This has happened over and over and over again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall anybody in the pro-life community celebrating this tragedy. I don\u2019t recall any of that happening,\u201d she added, accusing Mr. Cuomo of buying \u201cthe Planned Parenthood line, hook, line and sinker.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, what I\u2019m saying is,\u201d Mr. Cuomo explained, \u201cI\u2019m asking you if you feel that coming out of Colorado, it gave you any new sense of the power of rhetoric and what it can do, especially when it\u2019s playing on a sensitive issue like abortion. Because of what we just saw, as we agree, this deranged man who went out and killed in the name of saving the baby parts.\u201d\n\nMs. Fiorina responded, \u201cOK, so in other words, you would also accept that President Obama\u2019s rhetoric might incite people when he is standing in the Philippines saying that anyone who opposes any of his policies \u2014 whether it\u2019s the Iran deal or stopping Syrian refugees \u2014 when he says that some of us, like me, like other Republicans are as bad as the Iranian hard-liners shouting \u2018Death to America!\u2019 Or that we are as bad \u2014 we\u2019re giving ISIS recruitment tools. You would say that that rhetoric is a problem as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it is unconscionable,\u201d she continued, \u201cto deride people who are conservative, their rhetoric, but not to acknowledge that the left uses incendiary rhetoric all the time. It is not objective to say that the left-wing does not try and shut down conversation that they don\u2019t want to have by accusing people of inciting others. This has happened in election cycle after election cycle. Remember Sarah Palin? Sarah Palin was somehow responsible for the murder \u2014 the attack on Gabby Giffords. It turned out that wasn\u2019t true either.\u201d\n\nMs. Fiorina went on to say that she does not regret her past remarks against Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI stand by the facts. And I think Planned Parenthood has done an excellent job of pulling the wool over lots of people\u2019s eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you not acknowledge that the left-wing uses incendiary rhetoric over and over and over again to silence messages that they don\u2019t want to deal with? When Hillary Clinton stands on a debate stage and says the enemy she is most proud of are Republicans, does that help our political dialogue? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would agree with you,\u201d Mr. Cuomo responded. \u201cI think that what we have seen out of both parties is disgusting. I think it\u2019s cheapened the process, I think it\u2019s turned people off, and I think it\u2019s fed an anger that now is almost out of control. And I think that the job of all of us is to try to bring the system back into conformity with what it was supposed to be about, which is people with different ideas going at it, not scaring people, not pushing people to violence.\u201d\n\nMs. Fiorina said that\u2019s where they both can agree.\n\n\u201cAnd so what I\u2019m going to continue to do is talk about the facts, talk about the truth, talk about what\u2019s really happening, and talk about real solutions to solve what is actually happening. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina got into a heated exchange Friday morning with CNN's Chris Cuomo, after he tied her past criticism of Planned Parenthood to the recent shooting at a clinic in Colorado Springs that claimed three lives.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina got into a heated exchange Friday morning with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, after he tied her past criticism of Planned Parenthood to the recent shooting at a clinic in Colorado Springs that claimed three lives.", "title": "Carly Fiorina snaps at CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo after he ties her to Planned Parenthood shooting", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/11/carly-fiorina-snaps-at-cnns-chris-cuomo-after-he-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/11/fiorina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/11/fiorina.jpg", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina got into a heated exchange Friday morning with CNN's Chris Cuomo, after he tied her past criticism of Planned Parenthood to the recent shooting at a cli", "card": "summary", "title": "Carly Fiorina snaps at CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo after he ties her to Pl"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Carly Fiorina, Christopher Cuomo"}, "article_summary": "And I think Planned Parenthood has done an excellent job of pulling the wool over lots of people\u2019s eyes,\u201d she said.\nBut that has nothing to do with the truth of what is going on in Planned Parenthood.\nIt turned out that wasn\u2019t true either.\u201dMs. Fiorina went on to say that she does not regret her past remarks against Planned Parenthood.\nRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina got into a heated exchange Friday morning with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo after he tied her past criticism of Planned Parenthood to the recent shooting at a clinic in Colorado Springs that claimed three lives.\nI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cI would agree with you,\u201d Mr. Cuomo responded."}
