The clinic is a more effective place to treat patients with mental illnesses, who could cause more disruptions in a hospital setting, experts told KHN. It also is a medical clinic, which experts hope will serve as patients' medical home-base.\n\nAs more patients gain coverage and access to mental healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, mental health agencies and hospitals are inundated with new Medicaid patients seeking treatment. Although increased access is a positive, it strains resources at clinics like Seven Counties Services in Louisville, Kentucky, which saw an 40 percent increase in calls to the agency's access lines for new clients, Chief Operating Officer Kelley Gannon told the New York Times.\n\nSeven Counties therapist Erin Riedel saw her caseload jump from 100 to 263 between 2013 and July of this year. To cope, the organization will hire more therapists and offer group therapy, for which there is no wait, according to the article.\n\nBut not all private providers want to take on the challenges of providing care to Medicaid patients. Not only are they reimbursed less, some practices must wait for approval from managed care companies who provide benefits to Medicaid recipients, according to the article.\n\nMeanwhile, a new collaborative in New Jersey aims to close the loop for high-risk patients in the state by integrating physical, behavioral, and addiction treatments and services, FiercePracticeManagement previously reported. Not only will the collaborative offer models that other organizations can emulate throughout New Jersey, it will also provide lessons for private insurers outside of the Medicaid program.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the KHN blog post\n\n- read the Times article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nUrgent care centers more convenient, cheaper than EDs\n\nRobin Williams' suicide shines spotlight on depression, healthcare services and treatment options\n\nTrain nurses in mental health issues earlier to close care gap\n\nNew collaborative promotes coordination between physical and mental health", "article_metadata": {"description": "County health officials in California opened a\u00a0mental health\u00a0urgent care center in the South Los Angeles this week, in an effort to treat people in immediate crisis, while connecting them with ongoing care,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reported\u00a0in a blog post.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "County health officials in California opened a\u00a0mental health\u00a0urgent care center in the South Los Angeles this week, in an effort to treat people in immediate crisis, while connecting them with ongoing care,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reported\u00a0in a blog post.", "title": "Mental health barriers in hospitals lead to standalone urgent care clinics", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/mental-health-barriers-hospitals-lead-standalone-urgent-care-clinics/2014-08-28", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Care Delivery,Coordinated Care,Medicaid expansion,mental health,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19e1\"", "article_summary": "As more patients gain coverage and access to mental healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, mental health agencies and hospitals are inundated with new Medicaid patients seeking treatment.\nCounty health officials in California opened a mental health urgent care center in the South Los Angeles area this week, aiming to treat people in immediate crisis while connecting them with ongoing care, Kaiser Health News reported in a blog post.\nIt also is a medical clinic, which experts hope will serve as patients' medical home-base.\nBut not all private providers want to take on the challenges of providing care to Medicaid patients.\nTo learn more:- here's the KHN blog post- read the Times articleRelated Articles:Urgent care centers more convenient, cheaper than EDsRobin Williams' suicide shines spotlight on depression, healthcare services and treatment optionsTrain nurses in mental health issues earlier to close care gapNew collaborative promotes coordination between physical and mental health"}
