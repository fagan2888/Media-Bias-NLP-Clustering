For two years, she wrote to him, visited him and served as his spiritual adviser.\n\nPrejean was with Sonnier when he was executed by electrocution.\n\n\u201cWhen I came out of the execution chamber, I vomited,\u201d she said. \u201cI never saw anyone killed.\u201d\n\nThe experience prompted her to become an activist against the death penalty. Prejean\u2019s book, \u201cDead Man Walking,\u201d was adapted into an Academy Award-winning motion picture in 1995, in which she was portrayed by actress Susan Sarandon.\n\n\u201cMy story is a simple story,\u201d Prejean said. \u201cIt is a story of coming awake and it\u2019s a story of resistance to grace.\u201d\n\nPrejean told her story to about 90 people at the Franciscan Center in Tampa today. She challenged her audience to speak out against Florida\u2019s use of the death penalty.\n\nIn 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court determined capital punishment was unconstitutional and struck down all death penalty laws. In 1976, the court overturned its ruling and Florida executions resumed in 1979.\n\nThere now are 400 men and five women on Florida\u2019s death row, according to the state Department of Corrections.\n\nPrejean\u2019s presentation was followed by a luncheon and book-signing. Her visit to Tampa concluded several days of events at the center in honor of the Feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, the Catholic Church\u2019s patron saint of animals and the environment. The annual Blessing of the Animals event was held there Wednesday.\n\n\u201cShe was very instrumental in the national dialogue of the death penalty and helping shape the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching on the opposition of the death penalty,\u201d said Sister Anne Dougherty, the center\u2019s director. \u201cShe continues to counsel people on death row and send the message for Roman Catholics that this is part of our mission, to speak up against the death penalty.\u201d\n\nPatrick Sonnier and his brother, Eddie, were accused of murdering a teen girl and boy, after first raping the girl.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out his crime, I was so stunned by the evil,\u201d Prejean said during her presentation, which elicited tears from many in the audience. \u201cMy first visit to Pat, I was really nervous. I had never talked to anyone who had murdered somebody before.\n\n\u201c(But) there was a dignity in him. That is not all he is. We are all worth more than the worst thing we\u2019ve ever done in our life. That\u2019s why the death penalty is so morally bankrupt.\u201d\n\nPatricia Telford, a nurse practitioner who recently moved to Seminole from New York, described Prejean as a wonderful storyteller.\n\n\u201cIt was heartfelt,\u201d Telford said. \u201cI wanted to hear what she had to say. If I were ever called upon as a jury member, I couldn\u2019t go for the death penalty.\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7999\n\nTwitter: ErinKTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Oct 2013 15:30:25 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 When Sister Helen Prejean first watched the execution of a death-row inmate, it changed her life.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 When Sister Helen Prejean first watched the execution of a death-row inmate, it changed her life.", "title": "Sister Prejean tells of counseling death row inmates", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/all/sister-prejean-tells-of-counseling-death-row-inmates-20131005/", "image": {"width": 3370, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009494/AR/0/AR-131009494.jpg", "height": 2334}, "updated_time": "2013-10-05T16:09:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 When Sister Helen Prejean first watched the execution of a death-row inmate, it changed her life.", "title": "Sister Prejean tells of counseling death row inmates", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009494/AR/0/AR-131009494.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-05T15:30:25Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-05T16:09:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16bd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShe was very instrumental in the national dialogue of the death penalty and helping shape the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching on the opposition of the death penalty,\u201d said Sister Anne Dougherty, the center\u2019s director.\nIn 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court determined capital punishment was unconstitutional and struck down all death penalty laws.\n\u201cI never saw anyone killed.\u201dThe experience prompted her to become an activist against the death penalty.\nShe challenged her audience to speak out against Florida\u2019s use of the death penalty.\nThat\u2019s why the death penalty is so morally bankrupt.\u201dPatricia Telford, a nurse practitioner who recently moved to Seminole from New York, described Prejean as a wonderful storyteller."}
