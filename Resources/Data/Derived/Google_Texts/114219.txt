The man facing the death penalty for allegedly stabbing five people to death in a Denver bar is due in court this week, when attorneys will argue a slew of motions in the case.

Dexter Lewis, 24, is charged with 16 counts for his role in the attack that left five people dead at Fero’s Bar and Grill in October 2012.

The charges include first-degree murder, arson and robbery.

On Monday, attorneys will begin the first in a four-day stretch of motions hearings.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys will argue dozens of motions, including what evidence may be presented at trial, what Lewis will wear during trial and a defense effort to move the case out of Denver District Court.

A number of motions focus on whether statements made by Lewis and three others connected to the crime will be admitted at trial.

Two other men charged in the case, brothers Joseph and Lynell Hill, have accepted plea agreements and have received lengthy sentences.

A fourth man, Demarea Harris, was working as a confidential informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives when he entered the bar with the three other men.

Harris has not been arrested or charged in the case.

Attorneys will argue whether or not the varying statements the four men made — most of which contradict the others — will be presented to the jury.

Prosecutors have already indicated they will seek to present all the statements Lewis made to police and others at trial. They allege Lewis inflicted the fatal stab wound on each victim.

Lewis’ case marks the first time since 2001 that Denver prosecutors have pursued the death penalty.
