We made it through another lazy, hazy August in which there wasn\u2019t much to talk about besides the many crises that erupted at home and all over the world. Now that Labor Day is behind us and the midterm elections are a scant two months away, campaign coverage will dominate every waking moment of our existence and tip us all quite efficiently over the edge of insanity.\n\nTo get things started, the Republicans are throwing a bit of a curveball. Conventional wisdom argues that the GOP is well positioned to make significant gains in November owing to the unpopularity of the president, but a number of Republicans and conservatives are worried that anti-Obama sentiment won\u2019t carry them as far as they\u2019d expected. This, in turn, is leading Republicans to the slow, belated realization that the GOP, as a party, doesn\u2019t really have a coherent agenda.\n\nPolitico reports that GOP strategists are (privately) concerned that, despite all the factors working in their favor this cycle, Republican on the House side have not been able to put together the crushing electoral \u201ctsunami\u201d that top party officials so confidently predicted earlier this year:\n\nPOLITICO interviewed more than a dozen top strategists from both parties about their outlook for the House in the midterms, and their assessment was nearly unanimous: Republicans are on track to expand their majority by only five or six seats, or roughly half their goal. The conversations covered everything from advertising strategies to fundraising to polling.\n\nThe editors at National Review took stock of the situation and came up with an answer for why the GOP can\u2019t slam the door on the Democrats: The party isn\u2019t actually running on anything:\n\nRepublicans continue to lack any strategy for winning the November elections beyond avoiding mistakes and hoping that President Obama\u2019s unpopularity, especially in key states, delivers control of the Senate to them. It must be said that the party has executed this passive count-on-a-wave strategy fairly well, selecting presentable and sometimes admirable candidates. The strategy could even work. But it will not maximize the Republican opportunity, because it does nothing to dispel the public\u2019s justifiable doubts about whether Republican rule would be good for the country.\n\nWhat explains all this? The oversimplified answer is, in a word, Obamacare. Much of the initial talk about the Republican \u201ctsunami\u201d happened while the Affordable Care Act was stumbling through its glitch-heavy rollout. Pretty much everyone on the right fell victim to over-exuberance at just how far antipathy toward the ACA could take them, which is why conservative pundits were busily measuring drapes for long-shot candidates like Oregon Republican Monica Wehby. The candidates and strategists have realized since then that opposition to the president\u2019s health reform law isn\u2019t enough to win. They\u2019ve backed off considerably to make room for other issues, but the Republican stance on the Affordable Care Act hasn\u2019t evolved much beyond \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans slowly realize that the party doesn't have a coherent governing vision (not that it really matters)", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans slowly realize that the party doesn't have a coherent governing vision (not that it really matters)", "title": "GOP\u2019s empty agenda: Republicans (briefly) worry they have nothing to offer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/03/gops_empty_agenda_republicans_briefly_worry_they_have_nothing_to_offer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/cruz_mcconnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans slowly realize that the party doesn't have a coherent governing vision (not that it really matters)", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/cruz_mcconnell.jpg", "title": "GOP\u2019s empty agenda: Republicans (briefly) worry they have nothing to offer", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "GOP\u2019s empty agenda: Republicans (briefly) worry they have nothing to offer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, GOP, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, midterm elections, Midterms, National Review, Obamacare, Politico, Republicans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceea9\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2014 elections, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, GOP, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, midterm elections, Midterms, National Review, Obamacare, Politico, Republicans, Politics NewsCongratulations, everyone.\nMuch of the initial talk about the Republican \u201ctsunami\u201d happened while the Affordable Care Act was stumbling through its glitch-heavy rollout.\nThis, in turn, is leading Republicans to the slow, belated realization that the GOP, as a party, doesn\u2019t really have a coherent agenda.\nThey\u2019ve backed off considerably to make room for other issues, but the Republican stance on the Affordable Care Act hasn\u2019t evolved much beyond \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d\nThe candidates and strategists have realized since then that opposition to the president\u2019s health reform law isn\u2019t enough to win."}
