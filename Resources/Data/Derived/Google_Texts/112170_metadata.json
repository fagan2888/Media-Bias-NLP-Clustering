It also comes at a time when other developers are rampantly building massive apartment projects that do little to preserve the character of a neighborhood.\n\nSonneleitner took the appropriate steps to have the house he\u2019s owned for 25 years certified as non-historic so it can be demolished to make way for new homes that will vastly improve the neighborhood.\n\nWhat right does City Council member Rafael Espinoza have to prevent that?\n\nEspinoza used his position as an elected official to pressure the city\u2019s Landmark Preservation Commission to accept his application for historic status after the deadline had passed and after normal business hours \u2014 treatment that would not have been granted to a member of the general public.\n\nYes, there is anti-development sentiment throughout the city \u2014 a platform Espinoza based his campaign on. But Espinoza, who lives just a few blocks away from Sonneleitner\u2019s property, has only talked to the select few of his neighbors who are opposed to the development. What kind of representation is that?\n\nAnother issue holding up progress on the project is a dispute over an alley reconstruction that would be great for the neighborhood. As it is, the alley is a breeding ground for crime. Adams\u2019 plan to widen and reconstruct the alley will help prevent graffiti and drug deals, as well as improve access to neighboring properties and provide more parking.\n\nThough there was some initial opposition to vacating the alley, the developer and neighbors have reached an agreement that satisfies everyone; 20 neighbors have signed a petition indicating their support for the project. Yet, despite neighborhood support, a council member is delaying action on the issue.\n\nAs a community, we want to see responsible development. That can only happen with cooperation and collaboration between developers, city officials and the people who live in the neighborhoods where development is occurring. As a growing city, we must embrace change and support residential development if we want to continue to attract a strong workforce, which in turn attracts the companies that bring jobs to our region.\n\nWe must not abuse the historic designation process to ensure outcomes that benefit only a few. Taking a reasoned approach to development will ensure that Denver remains a vibrant community we all want to live in.\n\nNick Garcia is a real estate investor, landlord and agent who has owned property in the Jefferson Park neighborhood for nearly a decade.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "The case against historic designation for house in Denver\u2019s Jefferson Park", "title": "The case against historic designation for house in Denver\u2019s Jefferson Park", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/21/the-case-against-historic-designation-for-house-in-denvers-jefferson-park/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-21T10:54:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-21T10:54:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Yet, despite neighborhood support, a council member is delaying action on the issue.\nNick Garcia is a real estate investor, landlord and agent who has owned property in the Jefferson Park neighborhood for nearly a decade.\nTaking a reasoned approach to development will ensure that Denver remains a vibrant community we all want to live in.\nWhat right does City Council member Rafael Espinoza have to prevent that?\nWe must not abuse the historic designation process to ensure outcomes that benefit only a few."}
