Unlike many of his Republican peers, as a Congressman, he voted against the Patriot Act and against the Iraq war. He has voted against farm subsidies and regulating the Internet, which is in line with his interest in reducing government spending and the role of the Federal government. Paul has also expressed his opposition to the war on drugs, saying that the government's efforts have actually been a war on doctors. These and other controversial opinions have often caused tension with his Republican counterparts. Paul is the author of many books, including End The Fed, Liberty Defined and Revolution: A Manifesto. Along with a lengthy political career as a Congressman and Presidential candidate, Paul has also worked as a respected obstetrician in his home State of Texas. Since his retirement from Congress in 2013, Paul has stayed busy encouraging Americans to fight for liberty by founding the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity and his own news channel.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "Since New Year\u2019s is traditionally a time for resolutions and since the new Congress convenes this week, I thought I would suggest some New Year\u2019s resolutions for Congress.", "title": "Ron Paul: 10 New Year\u2019s resolutions for Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/01/ron-paul-10-new-years-resolutions-for-congress-personal-liberty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-05T16:26:48+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/ron-paul-10-new-years-resolutions-congress/", "video": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/E7IrzXjmLho", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 390}, "type": "video.movie"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/01/ron-paul-10-new-years-resolutions-for-congress-personal-liberty.jpg", "description": "Since New Year\u2019s is traditionally a time for resolutions and since the new Congress convenes this week, I thought I would suggest some New Year\u2019s resolutions for Congress.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ron Paul: 10 New Year\u2019s resolutions for Congress"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "article": {"section": "Hot Topics", "published_time": "2015-01-05T14:32:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T16:26:48+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Department Of Education, Transportation Security Administration, Personal Liberty Digest, New Year's Resolutions, Ron Paul, Federal Reserve, Patriot Act, Obamacare, NSA, Military, Congress", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Since New Year\u2019s is traditionally a time for resolutions and since the new Congress convenes this week, I thought I would suggest some New Year\u2019s resolutions for Congress."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe6b\"", "article_summary": "Since his retirement from Congress in 2013, Paul has stayed busy encouraging Americans to fight for liberty by founding the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity and his own news channel.\nRon PaulFormer Representative Ron Paul has maintained a steadfast consistency in speaking out against executive power, taxation and war.\nUnlike many of his Republican peers, as a Congressman, he voted against the Patriot Act and against the Iraq war.\nPaul has also expressed his opposition to the war on drugs, saying that the government's efforts have actually been a war on doctors.\nPaul is the author of many books, including End The Fed, Liberty Defined and Revolution: A Manifesto."}
