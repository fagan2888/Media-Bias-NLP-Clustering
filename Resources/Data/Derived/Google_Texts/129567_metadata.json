Simpson, Piedmont\u2019s lead physician, explained Wednesday. \u201cWe needed to figure out a way to counter that.\u201cReimbursements are flat. Expenses are going up. Capital costs are rising; we\u2019ve got equipment needs,\u201d Dr. Simpson added. \u201cNew doctors are being told, \u2018Don\u2019t join a private practice; it\u2019s too risky\u2019.\u201dFor 2-1/2 years, his six-physician practice has recruited candidates who ended up choosing to join \u201ca system down the road, just because of the security of it,\u201d he said.Dr. Simpson also cited \u201ceconomies of scale. As a small practice, we have to buy everything at full price.\u201dAt the same time, the local hospital faces increased competition, and its management wants to ensure the community has enough physicians, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Bengston said.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a longstanding relationship with Piedmont Internal Medicine and Bill. There\u2019s a level of trust there; that\u2019s the first thing,\u201d Mr. Bengston said. \u201cConsolidation in our market is acute, especially with the Haymarket hospital (Novant) opening . . . . These folks have been in Warrenton a long time and wanted to stay in Warrenton, and we wanted them to be affiliated with the hospital.\u201dSelling the practice will allow Piedmont\u2019s physicians, especially Dr. Simpson, to focus more on patient care and less on administration. The six doctors on Nov. 1 started work as Fauquier Health employees, as did their staff of 35 nurses, aides, lab technicians and office workers.The affiliation also should create buying power and efficiencies.For example, in its first year since selling to Nashville-based LifePoint Hospitals , Fauquier Health saved $1 million on drug and supply purchases, Mr. Bengston said.Affiliating with the publicly-traded corporation also made it easier for Fauquier Health \u201cto reinvest both in services we need in the community and strategic partnerships like this,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir model really contemplates reinvesting back into the community, rather than the hub-and-spoke model of other hospital companies.\u201dWith this acquisition, Fauquier Health employs 28 doctors and owns three primary care practices, including one in Bealeton and one at Lake Manassas.\u201cIt keeps primary care local and helps the health system grow,\u201d Mr. Bengston said. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Inova, Novant, Valley Health have all at different times, in different ways, come into our market.\u201cI think this is a win-win for the hospital and physicians . . . . I think the similarities between this partnership and our partnership with LifePoint are striking. A lot of the same reasons \u2014 consolidation in the industry, managed care contracting, buying power with supplies and drugs \u2014 are all common denominators in both deals.\u201dThe parties began serious discussions of a possible deal about 18 months ago.In addition to the changes in health care, Dr. Simpson and three of his partners struggled with the demands of their new building.Their real estate company, Faith/PIM LLC spent $5 million to construct the three-story building in 2006 and \u201907. They borrowed $3.7 million from The Middleburg Bank and $628,000 in private funds for construction, according to county real estate records.Then, the Great Recession began. Despite renting part of the building to Fauquier Health for its Wellness Center and space to a dermatologist, 4,000 square feet remained vacant. The bank worked with the group, extending the term of the loan, according to the documents.\u201cIt cost us $5 million to build and we sold it for $5 million,\u201d Dr. Simpson said. \u201cWe built in the boom; then the market fell out. We were \u2018under water\u2019 for a while, but we managed to hold on.\u201dThings got so tight that he, his wife and children shoveled the snow and mulched the landscaping, the physician added. \u201cAgain, we were under water, so we couldn\u2019t spend a whole lot of money hiring things out.\u201dFrom a financial standpoint, most of the business change involves LifePoint\u2019s purchase of the building.Fauquier Health paid $300,000 for equipment and furnishings.\u201cPractices in the past could sell and take advantage \u2018good will\u2019,\u201d Dr. Simpson said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get (compensated for) good will any more . . . . It\u2019s a lot of sweat equity down the drain . . . But we\u2019ve had some good years. We\u2019re not going anywhere; we\u2019ll continue to serve the community.\u201dThe 54-year-old physician, who came here in 1993 to join Barry Lupton\u2019s internal medicine practice, said he has no regrets about selling.\u201cIt\u2019s the next chapter. It\u2019s a happy time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone\u2019s sad at all . . . . Everyone seems optimistic and pleased at this point.\u201dFauquier Health has retained all 35 Piedmont employees in their same jobs, at their same pay, \u201cwith a better benefits package, which is fantastic,\u201d Dr. Simpson added.Mr. Bengston credited the physicians for \u201ctransparency\u201d in handling the transition with their staff. Dr. Simpson and his colleagues conducted a full staff meeting in June at the adjacent Holiday Inn Express to break the news of their plan to sell the practice.With the hospital\u2019s marketing support, it should get easier to attract new patients after the practice adds two physicians, Dr. Simpson said.Many people move to Fauquier but keep relationships with primary care doctors in the metro area, he explained. His practice lacked the time, budget or physician capacity to make those new residents \u201caware of the options here.\u201dThe hospital\u2019s management sees \u201ca win-win,\u201d Mr. Bengston said.Through the first 10 months of this year, Fauquier Health remains profitable and \u201cahead of budget,\u201d he said.LifePoint reported a profit of more than $1 billion for the third quarter , an increase of 29 percent from a year ago, beating analysts\u2019 projections. The company of 60, mostly-rural, hospitals has benefitted from Medicaid expansion in many states.\u201cThe biggest compliment I get is, \u2018Hey, I haven\u2019t noticed any change\u2019,\u201d since the local hospital affiliated with LifePoint last November, Mr. Bengston said. \u201cI hope the same will be true\u201d at Piedmont Internal Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Fauquier Now", "description": "Piedmont Internal Medicine, with 14,000 patients, reopened Monday as part of health system", "title": "Hospital buys largest internal medicine practice", "url": "http://www.fauquiernow.com/index.php/fauquier_news/article/fauqiuer-hospital-buys-fauquiers-largest-medical-practice-2014", "image": "http://www.fauquiernow.com/images/uploads/news/Piedmont_Internal_Medicine_doctors.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FauquierNow"}, "fb": {"admins": 1074578099, "app_id": 714947671886211}, "description": "Piedmont Internal Medicine, with 14,000 patients, reopened Monday as part of health system"}, "article_summary": "Despite renting part of the building to Fauquier Health for its Wellness Center and space to a dermatologist, 4,000 square feet remained vacant.\nCapital costs are rising; we\u2019ve got equipment needs,\u201d Dr. Simpson added.\nThere\u2019s a level of trust there; that\u2019s the first thing,\u201d Mr. Bengston said.\nNovember 5, 2014Contributed PhotoPiedmont Internal Medicine doctors (from left): William Simpson,Joseph David, Michelle Bell, Jae Lee, Kevin McCarthy and Demetrius Maoury.\nThe company of 60, mostly-rural, hospitals has benefitted from Medicaid expansion in many states.\u201cThe biggest compliment I get is, \u2018Hey, I haven\u2019t noticed any change\u2019,\u201d since the local hospital affiliated with LifePoint last November, Mr. Bengston said."}
