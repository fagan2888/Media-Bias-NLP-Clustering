Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz both took shots at ailing former president Jimmy Carter on Saturday while on the campaign trail for the 2016 Republican nomination.\n\nChristie said that we have the \u201cweakest\u201d president on foreign policy, and that, \u201c[Obama] makes Jimmy Carter look strong,\u201d while addressing an Iowa State Fair crowd from a soapbox.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz, speaking at the Koch-backed Americans For Prosperity event, Defending the Dream, in Columbus, Ohio, repeated a similar version of an attack he delivered Friday at the Iowa State Fair, when he compared the Obama and Carter administrations\u2019 \u201csame failed domestic policies, same misery, stagnation and malaise, same feckless and na\u00efve foreign policy.\u201d\n\nCarter revealed on Thursday that melanoma had spread to his brain and that he would begin radiation treatment immediately.\n\nCruz offered Carter support on Twitter prior to his Iowa comments. Christie did not. Cruz previously has apologized for attacking Vice President Joe Biden in the aftermath of his elder son\u2019s death.\n\nCarter\u2019s battle with cancer started last May when he returned home from a trip with a cold. After seeking treatment, doctors diagnosed him with cancer in his liver. He underwent surgery to remove a portion of his liver. His announcement Thursday that his cancer had spread stunned the political class and ordinary Americans alike.\n\nCarter has said that one remaining regret from his presidency was on foreign policy. \u201cI wish I had sent one more helicopter to rescue the [American] hostages [in Iran].\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe would have rescued them, and I would have been reelected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The former president revealed Thursday that his cancer had spread.", "title": "Christie, Cruz take shots at Jimmy Carter", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/christie-cruz-take-shots-at-jimmy-carter-121633.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/22/150822_chris_christie_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Chris Christie 2016,Republicans,2016 Elections,Jimmy Carter,Ted Cruz 2016,Chris Christie,Ted Cruz,Cancer", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The former president revealed Thursday that his cancer had spread.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chris Christie and Texas Sen.
