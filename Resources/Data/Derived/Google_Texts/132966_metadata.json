He maintained a licensed medical practice at Swan Lake Medical Center, 3330 S. Hualapai Way.\n\nIn court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Crane Pomerantz called Bruce\u2019s conduct \u201cegregious,\u201d alleging he worked directly with a street-level drug dealer to distribute the painkillers across the county.\n\nAccording to Pomerantz, the physician created \u201cghost files\u201d of patients, prescribed the painkillers under the phony names and then sold the prescriptions to the drug dealer, who distributed the painkillers.\n\n\u201cThere were no legitimate prescriptions leaving his practice,\u201d Pomerantz told Koppe.\n\nDefense lawyer Craig Drummond disagreed, arguing he was prepared to show that Bruce had a number of legitimate patients.\n\nPomerantz said Bruce and the drug dealer were unlawfully distributing thousands of oxycodone and other painkilling pills a week. The drug dealer, who was not identified, has been arrested on a criminal complaint, but not charged in an indictment, Pomereatnz said.\n\nSince the summer of 2012, undercover drug agents made several secretly recorded street buys in the investigation, and eventually raided Bruce\u2019s medical practice obtaining evidence of those buys, Pomerantz said.\n\nIn a statement released after Bruce\u2019s arrest, Nevada U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden said:\n\n\u201cOur office will continue working aggressively with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners to attack the growing problem of prescription drug abuse.\n\n\u201cOur federal and local law enforcement partners will continue to prioritize these unlawful prescription drug distribution cases and continue working to shut down dangerous unlawful \u2018pill mill\u2019 operations.\u201d\n\nFederal drug agents and police officers with several law enforcement agencies, including the Las Vegas, Henderson and North Las Vegas police departments, all were involved in the investigation as part of an ongoing joint task force. IRS-Criminal Investigation in Las Vegas and the Nevada Division of Investigations also participated.\n\nIf convicted, Bruce faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million.\n\nContact reporter Jeff German at jgerman@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-8135.
