Here are some current trends:\n\nCost education \u2013 Over the last three years, the Cleveland Clinic has achieved supply chain savings of $180 million, said the organization\u2019s Simrit Sandhu, executive director of supply chain management. Among the strategies the Cleveland Clinic has used to achieve this savings is a cost education program, including posting prices of surgical tools in operating rooms.\n\n[See also: Leverage buying power for better prices]\n\n\u201cThe cost education program for our caregivers spans many tactical measures including posting prices,\u201d Sandhu said. \u201cIt parallels our quality assessment process so that all product use decisions are made in the context of value. The decision to educate our stakeholders on cost was an easy one because it also allowed us to enable value-based sourcing that resulted in our overall savings.\u201d\n\nImproved collaboration \u2013 According to a recent McKinsey & Company report, more than 70 percent of senior supply chain executives in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries ranked improved collaboration across the healthcare value chain as the greatest opportunity for future savings. In its report, McKinsey said to achieve improved collaboration, relationships must move beyond being purely transactional to \"something more ambitious,\" and that the biggest barrier to improved collaboration often is one of culture rather than technical issues.\n\nSelf-distribution \u2013 As more organizations have grown in size, they\u2019ve looked to do their own distribution, said Angela Zotos, principal, advisory services at Ernst & Young. \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether or not they can do it cheaper or better, but I think that's one potential impact that you'll see to traditional distribution.\u201d\n\nAggregating data \u2013 Zotos also said supply chain managers, like other departments in the hospital, are seeking to make greater and better use of data. \u201cIt's really about aggregating your data into meaningful data,\u201d said Zotos. \u201cOrganizations that are really cutting edge are linking outcomes now with reliable data to making product choices.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/supply-chain-efficiency-trends", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "For years, hospitals have been trying to discover new strategies for getting greater efficiencies out of their supply chains.
