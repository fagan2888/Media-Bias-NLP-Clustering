CHAPA was designed to provide transparency, oversight and to ensure the acquisition is in the public interest.\n\nThe AG\u2019s office has deemed the application complete and a public hearing on the matter was held on Jan. 9 at the Boys and Girls Club where a representative of Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop read a statement endorsing the acquisition of the Medical Center by St. Barnabas Health.\n\n\n\nAfter passage of the Affordable Care Act, \u201cIt quickly became evident that in order for Jersey City Medical Center to survive, prosper and have the ability to continue to provide a robust health care service to its community a strategic partner was essential,\u201d President and CEO of Jersey City Medical Center Joseph F. Scott said.\n\nScott said \u201cIt quickly became apparent that the cultures and the mission, vision and values of our systems were aligned. The proposed transaction will further support Jersey City Medical Center and Liberty HealthCare System\u2019s mission of enhancing life.\u201d\n\nBarry H. Ostrowsky, president and CEO of Barnabas Health, said acquiring the Medical Center should strengthen healthcare delivery and enhance continued stability and growth at the Medical Center and its affiliates and have a positive impact on continued access to services in the urban communities they serve.\n\n\u201cJCMC is an outstanding regional medical center, with exceptional leadership and professional staff, and widely recognized clinical services,\u201d Ostrowsky said. \u201cThe proposed transaction should help to ensure that JCMC can continue its mission to serve the healthcare needs of its community.\u201d\n\nAlthough termed an \u201cacquisition,\u201d the Medical Center is actually \u201cjoining the St. Barnabas Health family\u201d and it is not being purchased, Rabson said. If the acquisition is approved, two members of Liberty HealthCare\u2019s board will sit on the St. Barnabas board and vice versa.\n\nThe public can still send written comments on the acquisition to the AG\u2019s office.\n\nRabson said it is hoped AG will make its final decision soon.\n\nSt. Barnabas has numerous facilities across the state.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@river','hudson-county','jersey-city'", "title": "Jersey City Medical Center closer to joining St. Barnabas Health system", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jersey City Medical Center closer to joining St. Barnabas Health system\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/01/jersey_city_medical_center_closer_to_joining_st_barnabas_health_system.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/14027160-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12055529\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-26T22:22:08Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"hudson-county\",\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/14027160-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Jersey City Medical Center has nearly completed the process of joining the St. Barnabas Health system and Medical Center officials said joining the state&#8217;s largest healthcare provider will allow the Jersey City hospital to continue growing, expanding and adding services.", "card": "summary", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, January 26, 2014,  5:24 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/jcmcjpg-9e0acc95232de93cjpg-146e2b4b30d63f2d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Hudson County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Jersey City Medical Center has nearly completed the process of joining the St. Barnabas Health system and Medical Center officials said joining the state&#8217;s largest healthcare provider will allow the Jersey City hospital to continue growing, expanding and adding services.", "title": "Jersey City Medical Center closer to joining St. Barnabas Health system", "url": "http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/01/jersey_city_medical_center_closer_to_joining_st_barnabas_health_system.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, January 26, 2014,  5:20 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Jersey City Medical Center has nearly completed the process of joining the St. Barnabas Health system and Medical Center officials said joining the state&#8217;s largest healthcare provider will allow the Jersey City hospital to continue growing, expanding and adding services."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c43\"", "article_summary": "Jersey City Medical Center has nearly completed the process of joining the St. Barnabas Health system and Medical Center officials said joining the state\u2019s largest healthcare provider will allow the Jersey City hospital to continue growing, expanding and adding services.\nAfter passage of the Affordable Care Act, \u201cIt quickly became evident that in order for Jersey City Medical Center to survive, prosper and have the ability to continue to provide a robust health care service to its community a strategic partner was essential,\u201d President and CEO of Jersey City Medical Center Joseph F.
