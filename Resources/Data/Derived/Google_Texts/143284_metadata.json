(AP) - Illinois nursing homes are at a loss for how they will deal with a roughly $65 million cut in state Medicaid funding made by Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s office as part of a budget fix for this fiscal year.\n\nPat Comstock, executive director of Health Care Council of Illinois, said managers at nursing homes might have to go without paychecks as they scramble to figure out how to cut spending without violating state mandates for staffing and level of care. Her organization represents the more than 730 nursing homes in the state.\n\n\u201cThis is so massive and so devastating that it\u2019s going to take us a while to figure out how we\u2019re going to cope,\u201d Comstock said Friday.\n\nRauner\u2019s office said Thursday that it\u2019s cutting $106 million from Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled people, as part of a deal with legislators to close a $1.6 billion gap in the fiscal year that ends in June.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office says providers of certain services will see their reimbursement rates reduced by 16.75 percent. Hospital and mental health services will be exempt from rate reductions, but hospitals will have to pay an additional assessment as part of the legislation.\n\nBesides Medicaid, services for young homeless people and victims of domestic violence and rape also will see funding reduced.\n\nThe details of how the cuts will affect various agencies came roughly a month after lawmakers approved legislation to close the budget hole. It includes $1.3 billion in transfers from special funds and a 2.25 percent across-the-board cut.\n\nThe $35.7 billion budget that the Legislature passed last spring didn\u2019t provide enough funds to pay for promised programs and services as lawmakers delayed a vote on whether to extend the state\u2019s temporary income tax increase, which expired in January. Lawmakers and Rauner spent the early months of the new year negotiating a solution to plug the hole.\n\nThe Department of Human Services will see an overall loss of $1.1 million, according to a document released by Rauner\u2019s budget office. Within that, a $419,000 cut is being made to domestic violence shelters and a $103,000 reduction to homeless youth services. A mental health program involving psychotropic drugs will be cut by $42,000. Human Services spokeswoman Veronica Vera said developmental disabilities and mental health are the only two programs that are not affected.\n\nThe state\u2019s community colleges will see a $6.37 million cut, according to data from the Illinois Community College Board. Matthew Berry, a board spokesman, said the cut will not have an immediate impact on the colleges because it occurred late in the school year, but it could affect services over the summer as schools are forced to dig into reserve funds.\n\nRauner\u2019s budget office also says the Monetary Award Program, which assists students in need of financial help with college, will face a cut. The office did not give a specific dollar amount.\n\nHospitals in Illinois negotiated with lawmakers and the Rauner administration last month to avoid a cut by accepting an increase in the tax they pay through the hospital assessment program.\n\nIllinois Hospital Association spokesman Danny Chun said hospitals will share paying an extra $27 million over the last three months of the fiscal year. He said this will avoid a loss of matching federal money that would have been cut as a result of a Medicaid funding reduction.\n\nInformation on the latest round of cuts follows a House panel\u2019s examination of the governor\u2019s suspension of $26 million in social service and public health grants on Good Friday - a move that surprised some lawmakers who thought they had handled the problem with the legislative fix.\n\nRauner budget director Tim Nuding told lawmakers early in the week that he will \u201cdo a better job communicating\u201d as the governor\u2019s office works with the Legislature on a budget for the fiscal year starting next July to fill a much larger $6 billion hole.\n\nState Sen. Dan Kotowski, one of two Senate appropriations chairs, called Thursday\u2019s move a \u201cstark contrast to the letters that were sent out on Good Friday without any notice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illinois nursing homes are at a loss for how they will deal with a roughly $65 million cut in state Medicaid funding made by Gov.
