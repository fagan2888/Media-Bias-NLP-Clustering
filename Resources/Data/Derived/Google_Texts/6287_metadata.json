But there is a possibility that they were just not doing their jobs properly.\"\n\nNone of the four have been prosecuted so far, the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe crash has called into question Egypt's drive to eradicate Islamist militancy and hurt its tourism industry, a cornerstone of the economy. Islamic State's Egypt affiliate is waging an insurgency in parts of the Sinai, although mostly far from the tourist resorts along its Red Sea coast.\n\nRussia and Western countries have long said that they believe the flight was brought down by a bomb smuggled on board. Egypt however has so far publicly said it has not found any evidence of foul play.\n\nAny formal charges or official Egyptian confirmation that a bomb brought down the Airbus A321 could potentially expose Egypt to compensation payments to the families of the victims.\n\nThe EgyptAir senior security official said state security police had investigated all workers at Sharm el-Sheikh airport without finding any evidence implicating any of them.\n\nThe official said state security traced the family connections of all the employees and they were cleared.\n\n\"Any employee who shows sympathy to militants is prevented from going to work in any airport,\" he told Reuters.\n\nAn Interior Ministry source also said no one had been arrested in connection with the crash.\n\n\"We are awaiting results of the investigation.\"\n\nIslamic State's online magazine carried a photo of a Schweppes soft drink can it said was used to make an improvised bomb that brought down the Russian airliner.\n\nThe photo showed a can of Schweppes Gold soft drink and what appeared to be a detonator and switch on a blue background, three simple components that if genuine are likely to cause concern for airline safety officials worldwide.\n\n(Editing by Peter Graff)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "So far Egypt has publicly said it has found no evidence that the MetroJet flight, whic", "title": "Exclusive: EgyptAir mechanic suspected in Russian plane crash", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/29/Exclusive-EgyptAir-mechanic-suspected-Russian-plane-crash-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/29/Exclusive-EgyptAir-mechanic-suspected-Russian-plane-crash-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "So far Egypt has publicly said it has found no evidence that the MetroJet flight, whic", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The EgyptAir senior security official said state security police had investigated all workers at Sharm el-Sheikh airport without finding any evidence implicating any of them.\nThe official said state security traced the family connections of all the employees and they were cleared.\nNone of the four have been prosecuted so far, the sources told Reuters.\nA senior security official at the airline denied that any of its employees had been arrested or were under suspicion, and an Interior Ministry official also said there had been no arrests.\n\"Any employee who shows sympathy to militants is prevented from going to work in any airport,\" he told Reuters."}
