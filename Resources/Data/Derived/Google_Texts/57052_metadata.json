And David Young, a Brooklyn lawyer once insured by Health Republic, wants to get reimbursed for the medical bills he ended up paying out of pocket.\n\nNorthwell filed suit in November seeking at least $15 million in outstanding medical bills from the health insurer, which the state closed Nov. 30 because of financial problems.\n\nRichard Loconte, a spokesman for the state Department of Financial Services, said he expected some news on how liquidation would proceed \u201crelatively soon.\u201d The state has hired the restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsell of Manhattan to handle Health Republic\u2019s liquidation process, which still has not been made public.\n\nHealth Republic, which filed a motion to dismiss the Northwell case in February, argued that the health system was the only creditor \u201cto seek to \u2018jump the line\u2019 by filing a separate litigation.\u201d\n\nBut Tim Butler, a partner in the Manhattan law firm Tibbetts Keating & Butler, which is representing Northwell, said the health system \u2014 which will be filing its response Tuesday \u2014 wants to have its claims processed.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nThe health system said in its lawsuit that Health Republic \u201chas no less than $15 million in outstanding medical bills\u201d it owes Northwell.\n\n\u201cWe are entitled to a determination of the liability that Health Republic has,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe want them to make a determination of how much is owed. That\u2019s going to have to start to take place anyway, so they might as well start and do it now.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys for Health Republic, Weil Gotshal & Manges of Manhattan, declined to comment.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the state Department of Financial Services announced that the federally backed Health Republic was going out of business by the end of the year because of its deteriorated financial condition. But a month later, the state agency said it was shutting it down Nov. 30 because its finances were \u201csubstantially worse than the company previously reported.\u201d As of June, the insurer had reported about $130 million in losses, according to state regulatory filings.\n\nIts demise left about 215,000 New Yorkers, including 16,000 Long Islanders, scrambling for new coverage, and doctors, hospitals and insurance brokers worried they wouldn\u2019t be paid an estimated $200 million they are owed. Taxpayers are also out about $265 million that Health Republic received in federal loans.\n\nMeanwhile, Young, who also practices law with his father Edward in West Babylon, filed suit in December in New York City Civil Court in Manhattan against Health Republic, seeking payment for close to $5,000 in medical bills he had to pay out of pocket. Young argued that Health Republic and the state \u201cfraudulently collected and solicited premiums\u201d when they knew the insurer was going out of business.\n\nIn January he also filed a subpoena for Health Republic to provide \u201call documents concerning the shutdown and nonpayment of claims.\u201d\n\nHealth Republic, along with the Department of Financial Services, in a court hearing in Manhattan on Thursday tried to quash the subpoena, saying it was overly broad.\n\nBut Judge Debra Rose Samuels said she \u201cempathized\u201d with Young and instead narrowed the subpoena\u2019s scope. A court date is set for June 16.\n\nYoung was elated. \u201cIt\u2019s not about $5,000,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about 200,000 other New Yorkers who don\u2019t have the capability to fight their case the way I do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 21:59:00 -0400", "sailthru.author": "Ridgely Ochs", "description": "The state\u2019s biggest regional health-care system and a lone lawyer have something in common: They\u2019re both bringing a defunct health insurer to court.Northwell Health wants", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11619679.1458957593!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "The state\u2019s biggest regional health-care system and a lone lawyer have something in common: They\u2019re both bringing a defunct health insurer to court.Northwell Health wants", "title": "Northwell Health suing defunct insurer", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/news/health/northwell-health-suing-defunct-health-republic-over-unpaid-claims-1.11619625", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11619679.1458957593!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state\u2019s biggest regional health-care system and a lone lawyer have something in common: They\u2019re both bringing a defunct health insurer to court.Northwell Health wants", "title": "Northwell Health suing defunct insurer", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11619679.1458957593!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "sailthru.title": "Northwell Health suing defunct insurer", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "Long Island,Health,NEWSDAY", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "Long Island,Health,NEWSDAY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc924\"", "article_summary": "Northwell Health wants to know precisely how much Health Republic owes it.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsdayThe health system said in its lawsuit that Health Republic \u201chas no less than $15 million in outstanding medical bills\u201d it owes Northwell.\n\u201cWe are entitled to a determination of the liability that Health Republic has,\u201d Butler said.\nThe state\u2019s biggest regional health-care system and a lone lawyer have something in common: They\u2019re both bringing a defunct health insurer to court.\nTaxpayers are also out about $265 million that Health Republic received in federal loans."}
