But both requests were rejected.\n\nA spokesman for the Shin Bet internal security agency did not have an immediate response.\n\nShtayyeh\u2019s lawyer, Itai Matt, told AFP that his client had been informed it was the Shin Bet preventing his entry, despite his having been granted such permission in the past.\n\nAccording to Matt, Israeli security services \u201cregularly bar entry to anyone wounded by the army\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey even bar entry to wounded children seeking treatment in Jerusalem, because they are worried that anyone wounded will try and take revenge after their treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nXinhua did not respond to AFP\u2019s requests for a comment on the incident.\n\nShtayyeh is one of nearly 1,000 Palestinians to be injured by Israeli forces since the start of 2015, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nIsraeli military courts rarely prosecute members of Israeli forces who cause injury or death .
