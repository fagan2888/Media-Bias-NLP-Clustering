The office can serve as a \"center of excellence to assist decentralized clinical units in outcomes and cost measurement and management, set priorities for continuous improvement projects, facilitate the creation of value-based payment models with insurers and employers, and ensure that new information technology platforms are aligned with the value agenda,\" the authors write.\n\nAlthough many hospital leaders may be hesitant to add another potential layer of bureaucracy, pressing forward with the transition without centralized leadership shepherding the process is far less cost-effective, write the authors. They cite two examples that demonstrate the success of the value management office model due to leadership involvement.\n\nHouston's MD Anderson Cancer Center, which established its Institute for Cancer Care Innovation in 2008, uses time-driven activity-based costing to monitor treatment costs for medical conditions across the care continuum.
