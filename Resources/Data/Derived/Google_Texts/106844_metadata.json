A downgrade to BB-plus would put the country in the same rating level of Russia, Indonesia and Turkey, other emerging economies prone to market volatility.\n\nThe survey results contrast with those of a similar poll in February, when 11 of 14 economists ruled out a downgrade to junk status by 2018. The worsening outlook, however, is consistent with a recent sell-off in Brazilian bonds and currency.\n\nS&P itself assumes Brazil will avoid a rating downgrade, citing the example of India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled an ambitious reform agenda.\n\nBut some of the poll respondents set a higher bar for Brazil. After lowering significantly its budget savings targets through 2017, the government would have to undertake structural reforms to cut spending and regain market confidence, they said.\n\nWhen asked what possible event or announcement would contribute the most to improve market sentiment on Brazil, responses varied widely, from an unexpected pickup in economic growth to Rousseff stepping down.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Walter Brandimarte and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil will probably lose its investment-grade status from more t", "title": "Poll: Brazil set to lose investment grade by end-2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/28/Poll-Brazil-set-lose-investment-grade-end-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/brazil-politics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/07/28/Poll-Brazil-set-lose-investment-grade-end-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/brazil-politics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil will probably lose its investment-grade status from more t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c98\"", "article_summary": "But some of the poll respondents set a higher bar for Brazil.\nMost, or 23 of them, think Brazil no longer deserves the investment-grade rating after years of profligate public spending and rising inflation.\nS&P itself assumes Brazil will avoid a rating downgrade, citing the example of India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled an ambitious reform agenda.\nThe poll was anonymous and included chief economists from some of Brazil's largest banks, foreign-exchange strategists and asset managers in Brazil and abroad.\nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil will probably lose its investment-grade status from more than one rating agency by end-2016, according to most market participants polled by Reuters after S&P revised the country's outlook to negative on Tuesday."}
