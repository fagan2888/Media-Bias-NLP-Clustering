Scott Walker, prosecutors in Wisconsin\u2019s secret John Doe investigation have taken their case to the friendlier court of mainstream media.\n\nCiting 268 pages of documents released last week, news organizations laid out the prosecution\u2019s argument that conservative organizations and others illegally coordinated political activities with Walker.\n\nLooking at the same documents, two judges have already ruled that John Doe prosecutors have no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n>>> Scott Walker on New Attacks: \u2018I Will Not Back Down\u2019\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa, who last month shut down the investigation through a preliminary injunction, described the prosecutors\u2019 claims against Walker as \u201csimply wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prosecutors\u2019 coordination conspiracy is the conspiracy to do things that are not only legal, but are absolutely protected by the U.S. Constitution,\u201d said a legal expert with knowledge of the lawsuits. The source asked not to be identified due to his proximity to the case.\n\nThe documents, selected by prosecutors for the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, provide the public\u2019s first look at the well-organized effort to unseat Walker.\n\nUnable to win in court, @GovWalker\u2019s critics have turned to the media.\n\nWalker\u2019s support for Act 10\u2014his effort to reform public worker pay and benefits\u2014produced a high-profile showdown between Walker supporters and government employee union members. In the background, Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, began carrying out a legal strategy to dismantle Walker\u2019s political support.\n\nIn October, Chisholm and other prosecutors carried out at least five predawn raids of the homes and offices of conservative and free-market activists, law-enforcement officials confiscated equipment, phone records and other communications, some of which is referred to in Thursday\u2019s document release.\n\n\u201cThe materials released [Thursday] are all ones that we asked the district court to unseal because the public has a right to know about the John Doe prosecutors\u2019 abuse of government power,\u201d said Andrew Grossman, an attorney representing conservative activist Eric O\u2019Keefe and his Wisconsin Club for Growth in a lawsuit against John Doe prosecutors.\n\n\u201cThese documents show how the John Doe prosecutors adopted a blatantly unconstitutional interpretation of Wisconsin law that they used to launch a secret criminal investigation targeting conservatives throughout Wisconsin,\u201d added Grossman, a former legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThat claim is at the heart of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s federal civil rights lawsuit.\n\n>>> The Latest Allegations in Wisconsin Are Much Ado About Nothing\n\nLike all targets of John Doe investigations, O\u2019Keefe was bound by state law to say nothing publicly of the investigation. That provision of the John Doe law, ostensibly designed to protect innocent witnesses from any implication of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the probe, increasingly has been used to allow government prosecutors to conduct opposition political research at taxpayer expense.\n\nBut O\u2019Keefe went public. In a Wall Street Journal piece and in Wisconsin Reporter articles, O\u2019Keefe surprised prosecutors by announcing he had turned the legal tables\u2014suing them for violating his constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant,\u201d said lawyer @andrewmgrossman on the John Doe case.\n\nO\u2019Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth claim the prosecutors\u2014including Chisholm, the Democrat who launched the John Doe probe in late summer 2012; two of his assistant DAs; John Doe special prosecutor Francis Schmitz; and a contracted investigator\u2014violated their rights of political speech and association through a bogus, partisan \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of an investigation.\n\nThe investigation included what sources have described as \u201cparamilitary-style\u201d predawn raids on the homes and offices of conservative targets.\n\nRanda\u2019s preliminary injunction remains in effect, although the 7th Circuit is now taking up the prosecutors\u2019 appeal.\n\n\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant, and this is a story that needs to be told to prevent more abuses and to hold the John Doe prosecutors accountable for violating the rights of Wisconsinites,\u201d Grossman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unable to take down Gov.
