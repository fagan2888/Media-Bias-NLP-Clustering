She must traverse a crumbling walkway, duck the bile and strike when close enough to the creature. Or, at another key area, she must walk along a stone path and at the right time hang onto dear life to statues as huge wind gusts attack her.\n\nHowever, those moments of gorgeous art and interesting play choices are constantly squashed by horrendous game mechanics.\n\nDuring points in the game, the action actually goes out of focus, first making me think my television was starting to go on the fritz and then realizing that this might actually be a really bad developer\u2019s choice or a glitch.\n\n\n\nMusic cuts out abruptly while a scene loads, there\u2019s an odd lag when she jumps, the Moonchild often stutters when walking, and the camera angles jerk around at the most importune moments.\n\n\n\nThe game actually froze a couple of times causing me to restart, and saves are very confusing, requiring me to replay areas I had already conquered.\n\n\n\nOverall, \u201cToren\u201d is reminscient of an ambitious high school computer science class project. With more funding and some better understanding of gaming conventions, the empowering of a Moonchild could have been a truly great, franchise-building experience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fabled warrior attempts to return nighttime to a land cursed by perpetual sunlight in a third person adventure for the PlayStation 4.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A fabled warrior attempts to return nighttime to a land cursed by perpetual sunlight in a third person adventure for the PlayStation 4.", "title": "Zadzooks: Toren review (PS4)", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/23/zadzooks-toren-review-ps4/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/23/moonchild-toren-900.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/23/moonchild-toren-900.jpg", "description": "A fabled warrior attempts to return nighttime to a land cursed by perpetual sunlight in a third person adventure for the PlayStation 4.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: Toren review (PS4)"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb34\"", "article_summary": "The game actually froze a couple of times causing me to restart, and saves are very confusing, requiring me to replay areas I had already conquered.\nThe action occurs within some beautiful artwork and poetic storytelling but never captivates due to the unfortunate, underwhelming game mechanics.\nOverall, \u201cToren\u201d is reminscient of an ambitious high school computer science class project.\nA player controls the mysterious Moonchild, from her first baby crawl and full steps to an adult wielding a large sword, during her confinement in and around a massive tower.\nA fabled warrior attempts to return nighttime to a land cursed by perpetual sunlight in the dark fantasy Toren (Versus Evil and Swordtales, rated Teen, reviewed on PlayStation 4, $9.99)."}
