The deadlines to report this information to the IRS are extended by three months past the previous Feb. 29 due date for paper filings and the March 31 date for electronic returns, the Treasury said Monday.\n\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly extended deadlines for implementation and insurance enrollment under the ACA, sometimes drawing criticism from opponents.\n\nLast year, Republicans sued the administration, saying President Obama exceeded his authority by delaying a requirement that most employers provide insurance to workers.\n\nObama said in 2013 that employers wouldn\u2019t have to comply with the requirement until 2015.

In 2011, a federal jury in Texas found that Cisco induced infringement by encouraging its customers to use Cisco products that infringe Commil\u2019s patent. The jury awarded Commil almost $63.8 million in damages. A judge subsequently added $10.3 million in interest.\n\n\u2014 Reuters\n\nAlso in Business\n\n\u2014 From news services\n\nComing Today", "article_metadata": {"description": "A roundup of business news from around the globe.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A roundup of business news from around the globe.", "title": "Business roundup: Employers get another ACA reporting deadline extension", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/businesses-get-another-aca-reporting-deadline-extension/2015/12/28/f8fb0f32-ad6c-11e5-b820-eea4d64be2a1_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/businesses-get-another-aca-reporting-deadline-extension/2015/12/28/f8fb0f32-ad6c-11e5-b820-eea4d64be2a1_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "f8fb0f32-ad6c-11e5-b820-eea4d64be2a1"}, "article_summary": "insuranceEmployers get ACA reporting extensionThe U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service said they are extending some Affordable Care Act reporting deadlines to help companies meet the requirements.\nCommil sued Cisco in 2007.\nEmployers will have two more months past Feb. 1 to give individuals forms for reporting on offers of health coverage and the coverage provided.\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly extended deadlines for implementation and insurance enrollment under the ACA, sometimes drawing criticism from opponents.\nLast year, Republicans sued the administration, saying President Obama exceeded his authority by delaying a requirement that most employers provide insurance to workers."}
