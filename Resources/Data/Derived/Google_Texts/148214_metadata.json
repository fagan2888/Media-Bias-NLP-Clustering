But Duggan has a goal to employ 8,000 young people in the summer of 2016.\n\nThis past summer Duggan said that he believes one of the reasons why the homicide rate dropped dramatically this year is a result of employing those 5,600 young people.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t prove this in the way social scientist would accept, but this is what I believe,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cWhen we put young people to work it is really difficult for them to be getting in trouble at 2 a.m. when they have to be at work at 8 a.m. I think the way to deal with violence is to put people in jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Downtown Detroit Partnership is leading the effort to engage local companies in the program and has hired Edward Duggan \u2014 son of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan \u2014 as chief recruitment officer.\n\nMayor Duggan is seeking the participation of the faith-based community in the summer youth jobs program and will match up to $850 to employ youth next summer for six weeks. He also asked to encourage the youth in their ministries to enroll in the program via the Grow Detroit\u2019s Young Talent\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about creating opportunities for the rest of their lives,\u201d Duggan said.\n\nThe mayor also shared the work of Detroit\u2019s Ryan Correctional Facility, a detention center for parole violators that offers job training during their prison sentence preparing them for job re-entry upon leaving prison. He also discussed Motor City Match, a program launched this summer for new and expanding small businesses that matches entrepreneurs with real estate, financial aid and technical assistance.\n\n\u201cWe have hard-working entrepreneurial people who may not have traditional education but they are very smart and resourceful and can succeed in business,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cSo let\u2019s give them a path to succeed. That\u2019s how you build a city that includes everybody.\u201d\n\nRobert Listenbee, administrator for the U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, was the keynote speaker for this one-conference. Listenbee addressed commercial exploitation of children; sexual violence and the trauma experienced by victims; and addressed victimized offenders.\n\nOther presenters were: Antoine M. Garibaldi, University of Detroit Mercy president; Paul Bridgewater, president and CEO of Detroit Area Agency on Aging; Pamela Moore, president and CEO of Detroit Employment Solutions Corp.; Arthur Jemison, director of City of Detroit Housing & Revitalization Department; Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, director of Detroit Health Department; Krysta Pate, Detroit Land Bank Authority disposition manager; Todd Bettison, Detroit Police commander; Brian Fountain, Detroit Police investigator; Danielle Waddell, federal project officer for the Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration.\n\nTerra DeFoe, director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Faith-Based Affairs, emphasized that Detroit residents should work closely with their respective district managers.\n\nDeFoe said Mayor Duggan has commissioned the city\u2019s seven district managers, who serve as liaisons between their respective districts and the mayor\u2019s office, with the task of not only addressing blight in neighborhoods but in alleviating other concerns.\n\n\u201cBecause the district managers meet with the mayor every week, they have access to city directors and different up-lines within the administration,\u201d DeFoe said.\n\nContact Jason Flowers at jflowers@michronicle.com or at (313) 963-5522", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_2569.jpg?w=150", "description": "Detroit\u2019s Office of Faith-Based Affairs strengthened in a one-day conference the partnership between city and faith-based organizations.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "The Michigan Chronicle", "description": "Detroit Mayor Michael Duggan and the\u00a0City of Detroit\u2019s Office of Faith-Based Affairs held a one-day conference addressing the importance of strengthening the partnership between city and faith-base\u2026", "title": "Moving Detroit forward through faith", "url": "http://michronicleonline.com/2015/12/16/moving-detroit-forward-through-faith/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_2569.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_2569.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@SingleBlkChick", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SingleBlkChick"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-16 12:13:11", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Michigan Chronicle", "sailthru.title": "Moving Detroit forward through\u00a0faith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=, affiliate-data=, app-argument=", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://michronicleonline.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/e90c789ac24e94118841fb7d3f5de4e6?s=16", "application-name": "The Michigan Chronicle", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-12-16T17:13:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T20:06:56+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "30473C9E51B1FA7645F80C5736971CF1", "google-site-verification": "0Kd706y6KY88IVdBacxEhfvF93jEEZJt2FiUAXcpHA8", "sailthru.description": "Detroit Mayor Michael Duggan and the\u00a0City of Detroit\u2019s Office of Faith-Based Affairs held a one-day conference addressing the importance of strengthening the partnership between city and faith-based organizations.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_2569.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Detroit Mayor Michael Duggan and the City of Detroit\u2019s Office of Faith-Based Affairs held a one-day conference addressing the importance of strengthening the partnership between city and faith-based organizations.\nTerra DeFoe, director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Faith-Based Affairs, emphasized that Detroit residents should work closely with their respective district managers.\nOther presenters were: Antoine M.
