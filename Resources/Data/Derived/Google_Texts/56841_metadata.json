Number one on many folks\u2019 naughty list is President Barrack Obama.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nUnfortunately, with today\u2019s environmental regulations, St. Nick might get fined by the EPA were he to try and deliver the President a lump of coal. Nevertheless, with the Christmas season in mind, here are the 12 failings of Obama:\n\nOne Unscrupulous IRS Commissioner\n\nJohn Koskinen ignored a congressional subpoena, destroyed key evidence, and erased 422 backup tapes containing as many as 24,000 emails about politically targeting conservative groups. He\u2019s violated the public trust and shown no accountability whatsoever. The best he can hope for this Christmas are some backup tapes.\n\nTwo Secretaries of State\n\nHillary Clinton and John Kerry have left the U.S. with better relations with Iran and Cuba and worse relations with allies like Israel. Hillary Clinton\u2019s gift ought to be \u201cCyber Security for Dummies\u201d and John Kerry needs a Geiger counter to detect a nuclear Iran.\n\nThree Armed Conflicts\n\nRunning on the pledge to end two wars, President Obama has the country entangled in three: Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, and that doesn\u2019t include the American\u2019s foray into Libya. Perhaps President Obama\u2019s gift should be a quad copter so he\u2019d have a less expensive and less dangerous drone.\n\nFourth Amendment in trouble\n\nUnder President Obama, federal agencies have ramped up efforts to weaken our Fourth Amendment rights For the NSA, perhaps a can and a string so they can figure out how to snoop on playground conversations, too.\n\nFive Supreme Court Justices Who Upheld Obamacare\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court upheld President Obama\u2019s overreaching mandate that forces every American to purchase health insurance or face a fine. It makes no sense how the President thinks those who can\u2019t afford insurance can afford a tax for not having it and how he doesn\u2019t understand how the mandates have cost the middle class and small business owners. The Supreme Court needs HR 2905 the SCOTUScare act passed that puts them under Obamacare.\n\nSix Countries Hell-Bent on Giving Iran a Nuclear Weapon\n\nThe President led a team of six countries in its nuclear deal with Iran. America\u2019s allies like Israel agree, Iran must never have nuclear weapons. No deal is better than a bad deal, and this is a horrible deal. A copy of Donald Trump\u2019s book \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d should also be under the White House Christmas tree.\n\nSeven Years of Stalling on Energy Independence, Job Creation\n\nA few weeks ago, President Obama killed the Keystone Pipeline after seven years of indecision on the issue. As I said at the time, it\u2019s ironic that President Obama demands greater investment in our national infrastructure but kills an $8 billion project that would create 42,000 jobs in the United States. This should earn the President an unemployment check for Christmas like all the Americans without a job.\n\n$8 Trillion More Debt\n\nWhen President Bush left office, the national debt was $10 trillion \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 shocking at the time, but now it\u2019s almost doubled to $18 trillion under Pres. Obama. Even a calculator for Christmas wouldn\u2019t help him understand how bad that is.\n\n9mm Ammo Shortage\n\nWhy is it every time there is a tragedy in the U.S., President Obama blames the gun rather than the criminal? President Obama then says he is going to force strict gun control on law-abiding Americans regardless of the Second Amendment, leading to a mad dash to buy up ammo while it\u2019s still available. A squirt gun and NRA membership should appear in the Obama stocking this year.\n\nTen Years Teaching Constitutional Law\n\n\u201cI taught constitutional law for ten years. I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we\u2019re facing right now have to do with [the President] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all, and that\u2019s what I intend to reverse when I\u2019m President of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nOf course that was Senator Obama talking about President Bush. There are various organizations that publish free copies of the Constitution. Perhaps Michelle Obama can pick one up for her husband.\n\n11 Million Illegal Aliens\n\nOne of the President\u2019s greatest failures is his unwillingness to secure the border. Instead, President Obama wielded his mighty pen to stop deportations and essentially created an executive amnesty program. A trip for the President to Texas to see what\u2019s really going on probably wouldn\u2019t even help.\n\n12 Months Until a New President\n\nExecutive power grabs need to stop \u2013 that\u2019s not just true at Christmas, but all year round. The American people\u2019s gift in 12 months will be a Republican President.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the Christmas season in mind, here are the 12 failings of Obama.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "With the Christmas season in mind, here are the 12 failings of Obama.", "title": "The 12 Failings of Obama", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 638, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/16138615951_71c69d94ec_b.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/24/rep-blake-farenthold-the-12-failings-of-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the Christmas season in mind, here are the 12 failings of Obama.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/16138615951_71c69d94ec_b.jpg", "title": "The 12 Failings of Obama", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Obama,failings of obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-12-24T16:12:25-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Instead, President Obama wielded his mighty pen to stop deportations and essentially created an executive amnesty program.\nSeven Years of Stalling on Energy Independence, Job CreationA few weeks ago, President Obama killed the Keystone Pipeline after seven years of indecision on the issue.\n9mm Ammo ShortageWhy is it every time there is a tragedy in the U.S., President Obama blames the gun rather than the criminal?\nHillary Clinton\u2019s gift ought to be \u201cCyber Security for Dummies\u201d and John Kerry needs a Geiger counter to detect a nuclear Iran.\nAs I said at the time, it\u2019s ironic that President Obama demands greater investment in our national infrastructure but kills an $8 billion project that would create 42,000 jobs in the United States."}
