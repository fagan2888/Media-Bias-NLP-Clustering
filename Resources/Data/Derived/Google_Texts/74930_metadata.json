Instead, the United States awards delegates to the party conventions on a state-by-state basis, and in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation Feb. 1 caucuses, it is Cruz who has surged to the top of the pack.\n\nAccording to the latest national polling, reports of Donald Trump\u2019s demise are greatly exaggerated. In the latest Monmouth University survey of likely Republican voters [PDF] , the real estate tycoon turned candidate has jumped to a 27-point lead over his closest competitor, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In fact, Trump\u2019s 41 percent outpolls the next six candidates combined.\n\nAnd for Cruz, the religious test embraced by Trump (along with other GOP contenders, most notably former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush), seems close at hand. Last month, Cruz said he would allow Christian refugees into the U.S., because, he said, \" There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror .\"\n\nCruz does say he wants to focus on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and has advocated a ban on immigration from areas under threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaeda. He recently tweeted that he would \u201cshut down\u201d the \u201cimmigration system that is letting jihadists into our country.\u201d\n\nCruz, campaigning in South Carolina last week, after the Trump declaration, was asked if he supported an outright prohibition on Muslims coming into the country. \u201cNo, that is not my policy,\u201d he said. But when pressed to criticize Trump, the champion of that plan, Cruz steadfastly refused.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. had grabbed headlines in the last two weeks, and has even provoked condemnation from a number of other Republican hopefuls \u2014 but Cruz was pointedly not among them .\n\nIf this primary is shaping up as a two-man race to the nomination, with Trump as the outsider\u2019s insurgent and Cruz as the insider\u2019s outsider, then what is the actual choice facing Republican voters? And is that choice rooted more in ideology or style?\n\nCruz will still be one lectern off the center at tonight\u2019s Republican debate in Las Vegas, since debate sponsor CNN\u2019s criteria for placement still has Trump in the lead. But many observers expect the other assembled candidates, Trump included, to treat Cruz as the new candidate to beat.\n\nOf the four most recent surveys of Iowa Republicans , two have Cruz solidly out in front of Trump, and the others have the two in a statistical tie. With Cruz\u2019s reportedly superior ground game in Iowa (a state where campaign infrastructure is especially important), and a strong showing in the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll , some election watchers are openly talking about the Texas conservative as the new favorite to grab the GOP\u2019s nomination.\n\nAt and outside the borders\n\nCruz says he\u2019d be less interventionist, implying he\u2019d stay out of the Syrian civil war because the U.S. has \u201c no dog in the fight .\u201d He questions the existence of so-called moderate rebels and says that the conflict represents no direct threat to national security.\n\nTrump has made a regular applause line out of his call to \u201c bomb the [expletive] out of ISIS .\u201d And Cruz has harshly criticized Rubio for siding with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, his onetime secretary of state, on the ouster of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBeyond U.S. borders, Cruz has made a point of differentiating his foreign policy from the likes of Trump and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who has also been moving up in the polls.\n\nCruz hasn\u2019t directly called for the mass deportation of 11 million migrants \u2014 as Trump famously did \u2014 but he did advocate expanding the powers of local law enforcement to actively administer federal laws against illegal immigration.\n\nOn broader immigration issues, Cruz also mirrors Trump\u2019s nativism. Both men have called for an end to birthright citizenship \u2014 in which anyone born in the U.S. is automatically a citizen of the U.S. \u2014 and Cruz has said he would introduce a constitutional amendment to end this eligibility for the children of undocumented immigrants. Cruz has also, much like Trump, called for a more highly fortified border with Mexico, with more border patrol agents, aircraft surveillance and a bigger \u201cwall.\u201d\n\nClaiming the right flank\n\nCruz most clearly distinguishes himself from Trump on domestic and social issues, where he repeatedly positions himself to the right of most of the Republican field.\n\nCruz has gone as far as any GOP candidate on the issue of abortion. He\u2019s endorsed numerous restrictions on access, advocated defunding Planned Parenthood during this year\u2019s controversy over deceptively edited videos, and recently called for Congress to extend the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause (in the 14th Amendment) to fetuses \u2014 the so-called \u201cpersonhood\u201d strategy to negate the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal across the U.S.\n\nAppearing with a conservative talk show host on Catholic network EWTN, Cruz said he agreed with the pope in protecting every life from the moment of conception. When asked if he thought that was possible with congressional action and without any ruling by the high court, Cruz said, \u201cAbsolutely yes, under the 14th Amendment.\u201d\n\nOn same-sex unions, Cruz says that only the four states whose laws have come before the Supreme Court need abide by the justices\u2019 decision to strike anti-gay-marriage laws. Every other state, says Cruz, should ignore the ruling.\n\nCruz seems more respectful of U.S. jurisprudence when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. Though Cruz has pledged to work to repeal the law should he become president, he made a big point of enrolling in the plan earlier this year.\n\n\"I believe we should follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with,\" Cruz told CNN.\n\nCruz had to opt for the congressional health exchange when he lost his coverage under his wife Heidi\u2019s plan. Mrs. Cruz had to give up her company-provided health insurance when she took a leave of absence from her job as managing director in the Houston office of Goldman Sachs, in order to focus on her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\nTrump has been hard to pin down on the Affordable Care Act, saying he\u2019d \u201crepeal and replace\u201d it with \u201csomething terrific.\u201d But when pressed in September on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, what Trump said he\u2019d replace it with would probably give many conservatives chills.\n\n\u201cI am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not,\u201d he told host Scott Pelley. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho pays for it?\u201d asked Pelley.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it,\u201d said Trump.\n\nThe two men diverge on Social Security, too. Trump noticeably stunned a New Hampshire audience in April when he said that it was \u201cunfair\u201d to cut Social Security benefits or raise the retirement age. Trump has also said his rich friends should not take retirement payouts.\n\nCruz has said he will not change the plan for retirees already drawing benefits, but he wants major changes for everyone else. Cruz does want to increase the retirement age, has called for capping cost-of-living increases to payments and, most notably, has advocated shifting younger workers into privatized retirement accounts.\n\nThose changes, taken in tandem with his plan for a 10 percent flat income tax and a national sales tax \u2014 applied both to consumers and to corporations, in lieu of a corporate income tax \u2014 makes Cruz\u2019s economic agenda dangerous to those living on limited or fixed incomes, according to advocates for retirees and the poor. And Cruz\u2019s desire to return the U.S. to the economically restrictive gold standard leaves even the conservative Wall Street Journal a little dumbfounded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysis: What happens in Vegas between Trump and Cruz will not stay in Vegas", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/15/republicans-eye-new-frontrunner-in-tuesdays-debate.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/12/15/republicans-eye-new-frontrunner-in-tuesdays-debate/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.trumpcruz_121415.1450217567455.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Analysis: What happens in Vegas between Trump and Cruz will not stay in Vegas", "title": "Republicans eye new front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s debate"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 22:13:09 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/12/15/republicans-eye-new-frontrunner-in-tuesdays-debate/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.trumpcruz_121415.1450217567455.jpg", "description": "Analysis: What happens in Vegas between Trump and Cruz will not stay in Vegas", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans eye new front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s debate"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Terrorism, Politics, Las Vegas, Social Security, Donald Trump, Republican Party, Immigration, Obamacare, Election 2016, Iowa, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But when pressed to criticize Trump, the champion of that plan, Cruz steadfastly refused.\nCruz will still be one lectern off the center at tonight\u2019s Republican debate in Las Vegas, since debate sponsor CNN\u2019s criteria for placement still has Trump in the lead.\nAnd for Cruz, the religious test embraced by Trump (along with other GOP contenders, most notably former Florida Gov.\nBut many observers expect the other assembled candidates, Trump included, to treat Cruz as the new candidate to beat.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d\u201cWho pays for it?\u201d asked Pelley."}
