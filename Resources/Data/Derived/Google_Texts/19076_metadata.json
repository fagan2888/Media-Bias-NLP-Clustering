But I do feel that, done right, networking can be a super-power for everyone.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of meeting folks in the real world. You can follow someone on Twitter, friend them on Facebook and exchange a ton of emails, but connecting in person makes a world of difference. It offers a resonance and builds a rapport that takes that relationship to a whole new level.\n\nYou see, it\u2019s not about exchanging business cards or piling up LinkedIn connections. It\u2019s about building meaningful and mutually beneficial long-term relationships. And whether you\u2019re hunting for a job, looking for a partner, searching for investors or growing your team, it can be a game-changer.\n\nSo here are a few tips to help you step up your networking game.\n\n1. Always Have Your Elevator Pitch Ready\n\n\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d Yeah, you\u2019ll be asked that a gazillion times. So you better be prepared and have your elevator pitch handy. One of my favorite stories is how entrepreneur Dave Morgan, founder of Simulmedia, ran into investor Brad Burnham, partner at Union Square Ventures, in an elevator. Brad was headed down to a cocktail party and Dave, who was in his running clothes, noticed Brad\u2019s nametag, immediately introduced himself and pitched his startup. Twelve floors later, he\u2019d secured a follow-up meeting!\n\nYou never quite know when opportunity will knock so be ready to grab it by the horns when it does. Additionally, networking is not always about going to a particular event or conference. Often seemingly random conversations with friends or family or even strangers at the supermarket can lead to something interesting!\n\n2. Learn To Listen And Be Helpful\n\nWhen engaging in conversation, it\u2019s important to listen. Your genuine interest in what they have to say will get them to talk more openly. It\u2019s the first step in being helpful. If you\u2019re looking to extract value from your connections and relationships before giving, then you\u2019re doing it all wrong. As Gary Vaynerchuk says, when you give someone value first then you have leverage for asking for something in return. Even better, I\u2019d recommend not being transactional at all. Be helpful to others without expecting anything in return.\n\n3. Leave Room For Serendipity\n\nI get a ton of invitations to events, parties and coffee meetings. I was initially hesitant at accepting if the value was not immediately apparent. But I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised how often partnerships and deals have emerged from the most random of meetings. I now try to accept as many as I can. Obviously I can\u2019t go to all of them and it\u2019s good to have some filter. But it\u2019s important to leave room for serendipity.\n\nOne of my favorite events (that breeds serendipity) is the South by South West (SxSW) Festival in Austin. It has a fun vibe and everyone is very relaxed and accessible. I\u2019ve randomly run into & had amazing conversations with prominent startup founders while literally walking down the street or waiting in line for tacos.\n\n4. Meet The Right People, Not The Most People\n\nThe goal is not to shove your business cards into as many hands as possible. Instead, focus on finding interesting people and engaging in relevant, enjoyable conversations.\n\nA few years ago, I ran into a celebrity Internet billionaire at a Hollywood Reporter party. I was a regular reader of his blog and we ended up chatting at length on many of the topics he\u2019d been writing about. I went home from that event with no business cards but one amazing conversation!\n\n5. Host Your Own Events\n\nAn awesome tip I learned from super networkers is to organize your own event.\n\nHost a small, curated dinner, invite a few friends, ask them to bring along someone else and you\u2019ll soon be hanging out with a fun, diverse crowd and expanding your network!\n\n6. Make Introductions\n\nBy letting folks tap into your network and by connecting them to others, you not only help them but your acts help leverage your network and strengthens your existing relationships. You become a valuable liaison.\n\nJust remember, as with everything else, curation is key. Avoid weak introductions as you risk diluting your network. Blogger and investor Fred Wilson makes a good case for doing a double opt-in introduction.\n\n7. ABF (a.k.a. Always Be Following-up)\n\nAnd finally, always remember to follow up! Connecting is only the first part of building meaningful and mutually beneficial long-term relationships. Following up is what takes it the next level.\n\nAs Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson says - \u201cSucceeding in business is all about making connections.\n\nHappy Networking!\n\nMr. Sharma (aka \u201cThe Guy with the Red Tie\u201d) is the founder of GarysGuide.\n\nFollow @garysguide\n\n\n\nFollow @WSJstartup\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Gary Sharma: Networking as a Super Power", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/03/19/gary-sharma-networking-as-a-super-power/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Small Business", "article.headline": "Gary Sharma: Networking as a Super Power", "article_section": "Small Business", "author": "Caitlin Huston", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "The Accelerators Blog", "page.subsection": "The Accelerators", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-03-19T14:24:51-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/03/19/gary-sharma-networking-as-a-super-power/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-232B-2492", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Small Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/03/19/gary-sharma-networking-as-a-super-power/", "type": "article", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "site_name": "WSJ", "title": "Gary Sharma: Networking as a Super Power"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Accelerators", "article.id": "BL-232B-2492", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-10T18:56:56-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5cb0\"", "article_summary": "So here are a few tips to help you step up your networking game.\nAs Gary Vaynerchuk says, when you give someone value first then you have leverage for asking for something in return.\nIf you\u2019re looking to extract value from your connections and relationships before giving, then you\u2019re doing it all wrong.\nBut I do feel that, done right, networking can be a super-power for everyone.\nMr. Sharma (aka \u201cThe Guy with the Red Tie\u201d) is the founder of GarysGuide."}
