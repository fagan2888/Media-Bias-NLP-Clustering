As the Journal-News reported:\n\nAccording to Householder, Supreme Court Justice John Roberts suggested that if states act as sovereign bodies, as outlined in the Constitution's Tenth Amendment, the federal government can't impose the ACA on them.\n\n\"Following Roberts' logic, the states must 'act sovereign' and tell the federal government the state will not participate,\" Householder said. \"Health insurance is created and regulated within a specific state. It is intrastate commerce, which means the federal government has no authority to regulate it under the Tenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. The Tenth Amendment specifically recognizes the retention by the states of what James Madison described as \u201cnumerous and indefinite\u201d powers. On the other hand, the federal government\u2019s powers are \u201cfew and defined.\u201d\n\nThe ObamaCare ruling cited by Householder is a perfect example of the situation described by Patrick Henry during the Virginia ratification convention where the states will need to thwart the federal assault on liberty:\n\nIf there be a real check intended to be left on Congress, it must be left in the state governments. There will be some check, as long as the judges are incorrupt. As long as they are upright, you may preserve your liberty. But what will the judges determine when the state and federal authority come to be contrasted? Will your liberty then be secure, when the congressional laws are declared paramount to the laws of your state, and the judges are sworn to support them?\n\nAll state legislators are obliged to follow Householder\u2019s example and through the exercise of the Tenth Amendment stop ObamaCare at the state borders by enacting state statutes nullifying the healthcare law and criminalizing state participation in carrying out the president\u2019s unconstitutional orders.\n\nHouseholder understands federalism and the role of states in \u201cerecting barriers\u201d against federal power grabs.\n\nNullification recognizes the power of states to invalidate any federal measure that a state deems unconstitutional. Nullification is founded on the fact that the sovereign states formed the union, and as creators of the compact, they define the limits of the power of the federal government.\n\nDespite the improving prospects for the Constitution in West Virginia, the news on ObamaCare nullification isn\u2019t all good, however.\n\nA report out of South Carolina contains a disturbing statement made by state senator Tom Davis, a sponsor of the Palmetto State senate\u2019s anti-ACA bill.\n\nIn a statement published on a Tea Party website, Davis said nullification was not \"an available remedy\" and then went on to misinterpret Article VI's so-called \"Supremacy Clause\" and perpetuate the myth of unquestionable judicial authority. Read my take on those egregious errors here.\n\nIsland Packet quotes Davis\u2019s denial of a state\u2019s power to nullify ObamaCare:\n\n\u201cThe conversation really has gotten off the rails a little bit,\u201d Davis said Wednesday, after holding three public hearings across the state that drew hundreds. \u201cEverybody talks about nullification. This isn\u2019t nullification. We can\u2019t nullify.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t nullify? States must nullify!\n\nAs James Madison wrote in the Virginia Resolution of 1798:\n\nIn case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.\n\nSo, someone should tell Senator Davis that not only can South Carolina nullify ObamaCare, but it is duty bound to do so.\n\nDavis believes, though, that the South Carolina legislature\u2019s only option is to delay enforcement of ObamaCare \u201cas best they can until such time as Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nNullification is growing in popularity because a quickly multiplying number of concerned citizens of every state are learning the hard way that Congress will never repeal any of the unconstitutional acts it has passed. Reluctantly, people have stopped recurring to that body of so-called representatives for aid in the war against the federal assault on liberty.\n\nThis same frustrated group of citizens also is beginning to realize the futility of filing legal complaints in the hope that the federal courts will strike down offensive measures.\n\nThey understand that while there might once have been a day when these tactics were effective, those days are gone and those responses to the federal government\u2019s abuses of power are futile.\n\nThat said, there is no reason that concerned citizens should not use every weapon in the constitutional arsenal, including working to convince Congress to repeal this offensive act.\n\nConcerned citizens refuse to wait on Washington to fix a problem Washington caused. Instead, they know they need to forcibly derail the \u201clong train of abuses and usurpations\u201d and \u201cprovide new Guards for their future security\u201d \u2014 the states and themselves.\n\nSenator Davis\u2019s opinion to the contrary, nullification is still the \u201crightful remedy.\u201d\n\nActs not authorized under the enumerated powers of the Constitution are \u201cmerely acts of usurpations\u201d and deserve to be disregarded, ignored, and denied any legal effect.\n\nMore state legislators need to learn this. Familiarity with these facts is fundamental to a reclaiming of state authority and removing the threat to liberty posed by the centralization of power in the federal government.\n\nUntil the states get over their inferiority complex, though, there will be no end of the federal government\u2019s demands and state reliance on the federal government will make their compliance compulsory.\n\nThe trajectory is easy to see and follow into the future. The federal government will \u2014 mandate by mandate, regulation by regulation, grant program by grant program \u2014 devolve into a central government after the model of the so-called European democracies.\n\nSenator Davis and any of his colleagues who are hesitant to boldly nullify every unconstitutional act, every time, without exception, should read these words from Edward Livingston of New York during the debates in Congress about the Alien and Sedition Acts, the legislation that caused Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to write the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions:\n\nWhenever our laws manifestly infringe the Constitution under which they were made, the people ought not hesitate which they should obey. If we exceed our powers, we become tyrants, and our acts have no effect.\n\nTo Delegate Householder's credit, he is no stranger to the duty of state legislators to push back against the federal onslaught. During the 2013 legislative session, he sponsored the bill prohibiting West Virginia\u2019s participation in the federal REAL ID program.\n\nThe legislative session in West Virginia just began and the year begins for South Carolina's lawmakers on January 14, so there is still time to congratulate West Virginia Delegate Eric Householder and correct South Carolina State Senator Tom Davis.\n\nJoe A.
