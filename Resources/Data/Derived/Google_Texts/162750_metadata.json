The deadline for that coverage is March 31, and so far the Obama administration is lagging behind its enrollment projections.\n\nBut while insurance companies worry about having to take on costlier patients, medical practices are worried what happens when those patients stop paying their insurers.\n\nThe AMA has been urging the Obama administration to tweak the rules so that insurers are at least required to notify doctors as soon as a patient falls behind on insurance payments. In the interim, the guidelines sent out Wednesday were meant to help doctors and hospitals \"minimize\" those risks -- by, among other things, closely tracking grace-period notifications and checking whether state laws allow insurers to deny claims during these periods.\n\nThe main concern is that insurers could be allowed to place all claims incurred during the last 60 days in a \"pending status\" -- and then deny them if coverage ultimately is canceled.\n\nBut the administration argues that the grace-period rule is limited. It only applies to people who already have paid one month's premium, and requires insurers to tell doctors \"as soon as practicable\" when a customer is falling behind.\n\n\"Grace periods are important to ensure that consumers aren't dropped from coverage, especially for those experiencing economic challenges,\" said Alicia Hartinger, spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \"It is also important to us that providers know in a timely fashion whether their patients are in a grace period or not.\"\n\nOne possible -- and controversial -- solution for hospitals is for them to help struggling patients pay their premiums. But, as the AMA guidelines noted, the Department of Health and Human Services has strongly advised against this and threatened to take action if necessary.\n\nThe AMA said doctors \"should exercise extreme caution\" before even discussing that possibility with patients.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/ECONOMY/Regulation,/FOX
