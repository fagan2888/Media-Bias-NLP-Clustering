DES MOINES, Iowa â€” The Iowa Economic Development Authority is hoping a vintage toy can help draw new business to the state.

The department sent out care packages to about 2,500 key U.S. corporate leaders. Inside is a View-master featuring about half a dozen photos of Iowa. The pictures focus on everything from the commute times to graduation rates, showing off the quality of life here in Iowa.

Department officials say each of the devices cost about $15. The money comes from the marketing budget which is funded by money allocated by the legislature.

The department also sent out Magic 8 Ball toys. An official with the department says they hope the recipients think the toys are too fun and unique to throw out and will keep them on their desks, and also keep Iowa in mind when thinking of new places to expand.
