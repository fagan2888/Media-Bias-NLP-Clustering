Its latest incarnation, however, is particularly poignant: 15 Muslim families chipped in to help rebuild it in a sign of the remarkable coexistence that exists in Albania between Christians and Muslims.\n\nPope Francis will highlight this interfaith harmony when he makes a one-day trip to the Balkan nation on Sunday, holding it up as a model for the Middle East and other parts of the world where Christians are being targeted by Islamic militants.\n\nAlbania\u2019s experience is particularly remarkable given the brutal persecution people of all faiths endured under communism, when all religious practice was banned.\n\nThe cottage-like church in Derven, known as Shen Koll in Albanian, sits next to the hilltop cemetery of the Cypi family, a large Catholic one that has lived in the region for generations.\n\nThe church was first destroyed a century ago, rebuilt and destroyed again in 1957 by the communists. The Cypi family (pronounced Tchypee) rebuilt it, and the communists used it as a storage depot until 1978, when the regime had it destroyed after learning that people still prayed there, said Pashk Cypi, the family\u2019s 70-year-old patriarch.\n\nThe family decided to rebuild it for the third time last year.\n\nRelatives managed to raise 1.7 million leks (12,000 euros; $15,000) \u2014 not enough to rebuild. But word spread among 3,500 residents of the Derven commune, which is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Tirana, the capital.\n\n\u201cEverybody came and left 1,000 leks (7 euro; $9) or more,\u201d Cypi said, standing in front of a statue of the Madonna outside the chapel. \u201cOthers brought bricks, cement, or came to work alongside us. A businessman offered assistance with tiles and money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were all Muslims, our neighbors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe renovation was completed on schedule Dec. 5, in time for thousands of Catholics and Muslims to celebrate the feast of St. Nicholas \u2014 together.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Albania visit showcases Muslim-Christian ties", "title": "Pope Albania visit showcases Muslim-Christian ties", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pope Albania visit showcases Muslim-Christian ties", "title": "Pope Albania visit showcases Muslim-Christian ties", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/pope_albania_visit_showcases_muslim_christian_ties/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/albania-interreligious-harmony.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Albania visit showcases Muslim-Christian ties", "title": "Pope Albania visit showcases Muslim-Christian ties", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/albania-interreligious-harmony.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Llazar Semini", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd362\"", "article_summary": "Albania\u2019s experience is particularly remarkable given the brutal persecution people of all faiths endured under communism, when all religious practice was banned.\nThe church was first destroyed a century ago, rebuilt and destroyed again in 1957 by the communists.\nIts latest incarnation, however, is particularly poignant: 15 Muslim families chipped in to help rebuild it in a sign of the remarkable coexistence that exists in Albania between Christians and Muslims.\nThe renovation was completed on schedule Dec. 5, in time for thousands of Catholics and Muslims to celebrate the feast of St. Nicholas \u2014 together.\nBut word spread among 3,500 residents of the Derven commune, which is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Tirana, the capital."}
