A busy day for mountain traffic continued into the evening as blowing snow and adverse weather conditions closed a stretch of U.S. 285 on Saturday afternoon.

The road was shut down in both directions from Fairplay to Kenosha Pass at 2:40 p.m. with no estimated time of reopening, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation.

After a long morning drive to the mountains along Interstate 70, there were delays for those heading back Saturday evening. CDOT started safety metering on eastbound I-70 before the Eisenhower Tunnel at about 4:30 p.m. but it ended about 90 minutes later.

Morning mountain travelers were met with a sea of brake lights along with their scenic views.

While traffic eased as the day went on, officials estimated earlier in the day that total travel time from Denver and C-470 to Eisenhower Tunnel would be just shy of two hours.

Eastbound I-70 at Vail Pass shut down for a while at mile marker 184 around 11:30 a.m. due to a safety closure but opened about an hour later. The closure caused heavy delays and nearly two-mile long backups.
