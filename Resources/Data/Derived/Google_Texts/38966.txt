To all who knew Adam "Lenny" Veenstra, the Waldstein and Veenstra families would like to express our sincerest appreciation for your acts of kindness in remembrance of our son and brother.

The outpouring of love for one person was unbelievable. Comments and condolences on Facebook.com, WausauDailyHerald.com, and Helke.com websites lit up with your tributes. The service at Highland Community Church was standing room only and we unfortunately don't have all the names or addresses of everyone who participated. His friends at Hiawatha offered a "Lenny Fest" and "Lenny's Sunday Funday" in commemoration of his smile, love and loyalty, and the toothpick that was a constant in his mouth. It is too difficult to mention everything done, but please know how much everything was appreciated.

We will miss Adam more than anyone can imagine. We must remember the light and happiness he brought to our lives and we thank you all again for your kindness.



Our sincerest thanks,



Deb and Dan Waldstein Family

Fred and Halle Veenstra Family

Kyle and Kate Veenstra Family
