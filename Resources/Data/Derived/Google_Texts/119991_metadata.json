The party has a more-than-comfortable House majority, a solid Senate edge, and it faces a lame-duck president sealed in a bubble of sour self-regard. But if you look for consensus on the ends to which this new power should be turned, you\u2019ll find ... well ... um ... repeal of the medical-device tax?\n\nThe good news for Republicans is that they\u2019re closer to having a positive agenda than they were in the backlash year of 2010. Now, unlike then, actual flesh-and-blood Republican politicians have proposed substantial policy ideas on issues as diverse as health care and transportation, higher education and taxes, the safety net and sentencing reform. The party as a whole hasn\u2019t rallied around these proposals, but they\u2019re there and waiting to be taken up.\n\nThe bad news for Republicans is that America\u2019s permanent campaign is about to shift into a higher gear, because with the midterms over You Know What is coming next. This means that policy debates in Washington will soon be swallowed up by presidential insanity \u2014 and if the next Republican primary campaign is like the last one, the conservative conversation could soon become an idea-free zone.\n\nBut there is reason to hope that this time might be different, that the 2016 primaries might feature not only actual ideas but a transformative debate. And that hope seems most likely to be realized if the primary field is winnowed early, and we end up with a contest that gives special prominence to Marco Rubio and Rand Paul.\n\nRubio and Paul are not necessarily the most qualified of the Republican contenders \u2014 they are relatively young, they lack executive experience, and their legislative records are modest. But they are both deeply engaged with the challenges that would await a Republican president in a way that most of their potential rivals currently are not.\n\nThose rivals have either been out of national politics for a while (Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee), or they have been wrestling with state-level issues that don\u2019t necessarily map onto national policy debates. There is, of course, plenty of time for Chris Christie or Scott Walker to raise his sights above pension fights and union battles. But Rubio and Paul are well ahead when it comes to thinking seriously about what a 21st-century conservatism should stand for and pursue.\n\nSeriously, and differently. Rubio has gone further than any other likely 2016 contender in embracing what\u2019s been dubbed \u201creform conservatism\u201d \u2014 a vision of domestic policy that would overhaul the tax code and safety net to support work, family and upward mobility. For the Florida senator, the details of that vision include tax reform that would expand the child tax credit, more substantial wage subsidies for childless adults, a Social Security reform that would open the program\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees to more Americans \u2014 and a reform of Obamacare (still in the planning stages) that would try to cover similar numbers with less-comprehensive coverage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPaul, meanwhile, embodies a more libertarian approach to conservative reform, in which the Republican Party would shed its \u201cparty of the rich\u201d branding and reach out to new constituencies (minority voters and millennials, especially) by focusing on issues \u2014 criminal justice reform, civil liberties, corporate welfare \u2014 where a critique of big or heavy-handed government might be unexpectedly resonant.\n\nThere is overlap between his vision and Rubio\u2019s, particularly on combating crony capitalism. But there is also a real philosophical difference between the two men on how much government should do to address social problems.\n\nOn foreign policy their contrast sharpens, because Paul casts himself as the heir to the realist tradition in Republican foreign policy, while Rubio\u2019s record and statements are more in line with the neoconservatism of the Bush era. To use specific Obama-era examples, a Paul-led G.O.P. would presumably oppose Libya-style humanitarian interventions and eschew gambits like our effort to aid Syria\u2019s rebels, while a Rubio-led G.O.P. might be willing to put American boots on the ground in both situations. These are not small differences, and they might be magnified in larger crises.\n\nThis is the point in the column when I would normally signal, subtly or clumsily, whose vision I find more attractive over all. But the reality is that I\u2019m divided. I admire Paul\u2019s outreach to minority voters, and I was very skeptical of the immigration bill Rubio shepherded through the Senate last year. But I have agreed with practically every domestic policy stance the Florida senator has taken since, and his reform agenda seems more sensible on substance and more plausible as politics than Paul\u2019s more stringent libertarianism.\n\nBut then on foreign policy my sympathies reverse. Paul\u2019s ties to his father\u2019s more paranoid worldview are problematic, but the realism and restraint he\u2019s championing seem wiser than the G.O.P.\u2019s frequent interventionist tilt. To imagine Rubio as a successful foreign policy president, I have to imagine an administration in the mold of Ronald Reagan\u2019s, where hawkish rhetoric coexists with deep caution about committing U.S. ground troops \u2014 and I think there\u2019s reason to worry we\u2019d get incaution and quagmire instead.\n\nI suspect that the Republican electorate would also have mixed sympathies ... and that is exactly why the party should want to see these men debate. Maybe that debate would end with one victorious and the other clearly vanquished; maybe it would encourage a kind of partial synthesis, perhaps offered by a savvy rival like Christie. But however the debate turned out, it would involve exactly the issues the Republicans need to work through before they\u2019re given control of the White House once again.\n\nOne potential alternative to a Paul-Rubio tilt, meanwhile, is almost too grim to mention: a campaign in which neither man gets traction precisely because they\u2019ve staked out too many positions, and instead the establishment money flows to a candidate (Jeb, Christie, even Romney redivivus) who plays it safe while Ted Cruz and Ben Carson and others have an empty scrum on the right to see who gets to finish second.\n\nSuch a campaign, in addition to being deeply tedious, would set the Republican Party\u2019s intellectual clock back to 2012, with predictable results for the party in its inevitable collision with La Hillary.\n\nWhereas to move forward, to win and govern, the G.O.P. needs to figure out exactly what kind of party it should be \u2014 and that may only happen if its brightest senatorial stars battle in the open, with a presidential nomination as the prize.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141108143011, "twitter": {"description": "The G.O.P. needs to
