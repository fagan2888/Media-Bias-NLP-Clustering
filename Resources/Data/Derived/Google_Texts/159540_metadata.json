This is winnable. A powerful movement is fighting for $15 an hour and they\u2019re winning new laws in cities and states, and forcing companies to raise wages.\n\nIf the minimum wage in 1968 had simply kept up with inflation it would be more than $10 today. If it also kept up with the added productivity of American workers since then, it would be more than $21 an hour.\n\nSome opponents say minimum wage workers are teenagers seeking some extra pocket money.\n\nWrong. Half are 35 or older, and many are key breadwinners for their families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor on the urgent need to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: How to fix the economy \u2014 step No. 1", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor on the urgent need to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: How to fix the economy \u2014 step No. 1", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/robert_reich_how_to_fix_the_economy_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor on the urgent need to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: How to fix the economy \u2014 step No. 1", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Income inequality, Middle Class, Minimum wage, RobertReich.org, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Some opponents say minimum wage workers are teenagers seeking some extra pocket money.\nOne step is to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nIf the minimum wage in 1968 had simply kept up with inflation it would be more than $10 today.\nA powerful movement is fighting for $15 an hour and they\u2019re winning new laws in cities and states, and forcing companies to raise wages.\nIf it also kept up with the added productivity of American workers since then, it would be more than $21 an hour."}
