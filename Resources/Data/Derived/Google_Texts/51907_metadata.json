This time around, he's up for re-election against Democrat challenger and U.S. Representative Mike Michaud and independent candidate Eliot Cutler, and polls are showing that the 2014 election is likely going to be another nail biter.\n\nCurrent polls show Michaud with a scant +1.7 lead, although a series of CBS/NYT/YouGov polls had LePage up by a point. If Michaud is elected, he will be the first openly gay U.S. governor.\n\nMaine is an unusual state when it comes to gubernatorial elections, and has a strong tradition of viable third-party candidates. Since 1970 there have only been two gubernatorial elections in which the victor received over 50 percent of the votes.\n\nIn 2010, Democrat candidate Libby Mitchell effectively played spoiler to left-leaning independent Cutler's bid for the Blaine House, but Cutler has failed to garner the same level of support this election cycle.\n\nThings could get very interesting as November gets nearer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anybody's game..05/26/2016 18:05:34PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Anybody's game.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Polls in Maine Gubernatorial Election Show Close Race", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/09/22/polls-in-maine-gubernatorial-election-very-close-n1895234", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/171/838a8634-88fa-4136-a880-8f2e8554cbf2.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Anybody's game.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Polls in Maine Gubernatorial Election Show Close Race", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/09/22/polls-in-maine-gubernatorial-election-very-close-n1895234", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/171/838a8634-88fa-4136-a880-8f2e8554cbf2.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Polls in Maine Gubernatorial Election Show Close Race, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Maine is an unusual state when it comes to gubernatorial elections, and has a strong tradition of viable third-party candidates.\nSince 1970 there have only been two gubernatorial elections in which the victor received over 50 percent of the votes.\nCurrent polls show Michaud with a scant +1.7 lead, although a series of CBS/NYT/YouGov polls had LePage up by a point.\nCurrent Maine Governor Paul LePage won the 2010 election on the slimmest of margins, with just 38.2 percent of the vote in a competitive three-way race.\nThis time around, he's up for re-election against Democrat challenger and U.S. Representative Mike Michaud and independent candidate Eliot Cutler, and polls are showing that the 2014 election is likely going to be another nail biter."}
