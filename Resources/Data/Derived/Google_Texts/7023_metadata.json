No specific site has yet been selected.\n\n\u201cThis is a natural evolution for us,\u201d Kaiser\u2019s CEO Bernard Tyson said in an interview. \u201cWe are very motivated in being part of the transformation of the entire health care ecosystem.\u201d\n\nKaiser says it will base physician training on \u201cstrategic pillars\u201d including providing care beyond traditional medical settings, emphasizing collaboration and teamwork, and addressing health disparities.\n\nKaiser has long been lauded by health care experts as delivering high quality care to its population of 10.2 million patients. Kaiser is known for providing coordinated care in a technology-driven environment. It was an early adopter of electronic health records and uses its system to reach patients about basic and complex medical needs.\n\n\u201cWe now want to take all of our learnings and understanding of how to care for population and individuals and teach it more upstream for the future physicians of the 21st century,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nKaiser says it is committed to attracting a diverse pool of students \u201cto better reflect the communities we serve,\u201d said Dr. Edward Ellison, executive director of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able successfully to move, not completely, to closing the care gaps in health disequities for different populations, \u2026 and we see that type of work in informing the medical students and how we educate them.\u201d\n\nIn a major analysis last year, Kaiser was cited as closing the race gap in managing heart disease and diabetes, diseases which account for much of the reason African Americans have shorter life expectancies than caucasians.\n\nThe HMO has long been involved in medical education, but at the residency level, training more than 600 residents every year.\n\nKaiser\u2019s move is unusual. The nation\u2019s 145 medical schools are mostly affiliated with universities, although the Mayo Medical School campus operates within the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThere are precedents, but this will be different,\u201d John Prescott, chief academic officer with the American Association of Medical Colleges, said of Kaiser\u2019s new school. \u201cIt\u2019s an integrated health care system that\u2019s looking at developing a medical school. I think there will be some surprises as the school unfolds.\u201d\n\nPrescott said the school will need to be accredited and that process could take several years. Twenty new medical schools have opened in the U.S. since 2002, he said, and many of them feature \u201cinnovative models,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, building a new medical school is \u201cfraught with risk,\u201d said John Deane, president of Advisory Board Consulting and Management. He said it could be a \u201chuge waste of money\u201d if Kaiser were to replicate the existing model of specialty-focused academic medical centers.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have an opportunity to do this in a new and different way that could be a form of disruptive innovation that could become a new standard for teaching doctors.\u201d\n\nTyson and Ellison both seemed focused on innovation as opposed to status quo.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be on the frontier of creating a new medical school and thinking about how do we transform a medical education to meet the transformative needs of health care in this country, today, and into the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as interested and motivated and part of the sponsorship of this 21st century new medical school if I were a physician myself,\u201d Tyson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The HMO giant plans to open the school in 2019 and enroll 40-50 students from across the country in its first class.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Kaiser Permanente to Open a Medical School in Southern California\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/17\\/kaiser-permanente-to-open-a-medical-school-in-southern-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-17 13:54:35\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-17 21:45:57\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":125242,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Kaiser\",\"Medical Education\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/GettyImages-494422479-e1449254901476.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The HMO giant plans to open the school in 2019 and enroll 40-50 students from across the country in its first class.", "title": "Kaiser Permanente to Open a Medical School in Southern California", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/17/kaiser-permanente-to-open-a-medical-school-in-southern-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/GettyImages-494422479-1440x1269.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "kaiser,medical education,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The nonprofit HMO, based in Oakland, will open the Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine in Southern California in 2019.\nThe nation\u2019s 145 medical schools are mostly affiliated with universities, although the Mayo Medical School campus operates within the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\nStill, building a new medical school is \u201cfraught with risk,\u201d said John Deane, president of Advisory Board Consulting and Management.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an integrated health care system that\u2019s looking at developing a medical school.\nKaiser says it is committed to attracting a diverse pool of students \u201cto better reflect the communities we serve,\u201d said Dr. Edward Ellison, executive director of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group."}
