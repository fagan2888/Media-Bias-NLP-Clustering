For more than a decade some of the areas best chefs have been coming together to cook for a good cause.

Saturday night was the 12th Annual Compassionate Chefs Extravaganza. The event featured 30 chefs and restaurants from around Bay County serving up samples of their best food.

The goal for the night was to raise $100,000 for the 2,400 local children in the foster care system.

Donations from Saturday night are still being tallied up, but board members from the event say this is there biggest year yet.

"Well, it shows that everybody in the community cares about our children that are in need, and they are stepping up to give back to these children so that we can give them a better life," said Veronica Kemeny, a Board Member for the Children's Home Society.

If you want to find out more about the children's home society or want to donate locally, Kemeny says you should go to their website at www.chsfl.org/donate and click on "Panama City" and all of the donations will go to the local division.
