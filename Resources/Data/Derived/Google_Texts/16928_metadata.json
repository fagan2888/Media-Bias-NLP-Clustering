But on June 24, that proclamation became an official state holiday.\n\nAssemblymember Roger Hern\u00e1ndez (D-West Covina) announced the unanimous bi-partisan vote passing Assembly Bill 1973 by the Senate Governmental Organization Committee making the switch official. California has more than 100 federally recognized tribes, with many others state recognized.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor for this bill to move one step closer in recognizing Native Americans in California,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said in a press release. \u201cAs with any recognized holiday, Californians will be able to share, celebrate and honor the contributions of Native Americans across this state. This measure recognizes the significant role of California's Native peoples by establishing an official, unpaid state holiday.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, the state established American Indian Day in 1968 to recognize the contributions of Native Americans. Thirty years later, the California Legislature passed AB 1953 changing the name to Native American Day while authorizing \u201cpublic schools to incorporate the contributions of Native American peoples in school curriculum.\u201d\n\nThe newest passing gives the day the same status as Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day \u2013 a day often ignored in Indian country for many reasons \u2013 as unpaid holidays.\n\nRELATED: Columbus Day\n\nSome cities throughout the state \u2013 Berkeley, Nevada City, Santa Cruz, and Sebastopol \u2013 recognize Indigenous People Day, recognizing the cultural contributions of Natives.\n\n\u201cThe contributions of the Native American people demonstrate our rich history and add to the diverse ethnic fabric of our great state. This holiday has been long overdue, it is time to honor those individuals who played a major part in our history,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California becomes the latest state to recognize Native American Day as a state holiday with a unanimous vote on June 24.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/25/california-latest-recognize-native-american-day-state-holiday-155469", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "type": "article", "title": "California Latest to Recognize Native American Day as State Holiday"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "California Latest to Recognize Native American Day as State Holiday"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/25/california-latest-recognize-native-american-day-state-holiday-155469", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-25T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Assemblymember Roger Hern\u00e1ndez, Senate Governmental Organization Committee, Native American Day, State Holiday, Columbus Day, Lincoln\u2019s Birthday, Assembly Bill 1973", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "California Latest to Recognize Native American Day as State Holiday"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca41c\"", "article_summary": "Native American Day has consistently been a proclamation for the state of California, recognizing the fourth Friday of September for the celebration.\nBut on June 24, that proclamation became an official state holiday.\n\u201cThe contributions of the Native American people demonstrate our rich history and add to the diverse ethnic fabric of our great state.\nThis measure recognizes the significant role of California's Native peoples by establishing an official, unpaid state holiday.\u201dAccording to the release, the state established American Indian Day in 1968 to recognize the contributions of Native Americans.\n\u201cIt is an honor for this bill to move one step closer in recognizing Native Americans in California,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said in a press release."}
