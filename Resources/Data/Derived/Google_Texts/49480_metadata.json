( Jaki Levy )\n\nListen to April Dembosky\u2019s piece about playing violin with an classical orchestra at Burning Man 2014\n\nhttp://www.kqed.org/.stream/anon/radio/tcrmag/2014/09/2014-09-05c-tcrmag.mp3\n\n\n\nThe well-established soundscape at Burning Man is an audio layer cake of dub step and techno. About 66,000 people gathered in the Nevada desert last week for the annual arts festival \u2013 and many of them spent their nights at post-apocalyptic raves, spinning fire hoola hoops, passing chapstick around the dance floor, all while swaying their hips in an inarticulate jive that vaguely mirrored the electronic beat spilling out of the speakers.\n\n\u201cEat sleep rave repeat. Eat sleep rave repeat,\u201d is the refrain of one song played all over the playa this year. It\u2019s a stereotypical, yet quintessential, sentiment at Burning Man.\n\nBut by day, a group of classical musicians are fomenting a quiet rebellion. The soft notes of Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 could be heard at concerts at Center Camp and the Temple, and during rehearsals in Silicon Village.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do that ritardando there,\u201d says Eric Yttri, standing before the group in leopard print leggings. A neuroscience researcher from DC, out here, Yttri goes by Doctor Fire Tuba \u2013 on account of the flame-throwing sousaphone he plays. He\u2019s also the conductor of the first ever string orchestra at Burning Man.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only a fun release for musicians who don\u2019t get to play much, but it also showcases that Burning Man is more than a party,\u201d he says. \u201cThis has a real soul and solace to it.\u201d\n\nThey call themselves the Playa Pops Symphony: close to 50 amateur musicians, studio musicians, members of professional orchestras, and even a couple kids. About two dozen show up for the first rehearsal on Tuesday. Dr. FireTuba marveled that it was in tune \u2014 mostly.\n\n\u201cWe were making music with a bunch of strangers who just randomly decided to go to a desert designed to kill you and play symphonic music,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m still on cloud nine and can\u2019t believe it worked.\u201d\n\nThe group has to overcome some serious distractions though. In the same neighborhood where the orchestra rehearses, gymnasts are practicing flips and splits in aerial silks, there\u2019s a spanking workshop across the street, and a zip line right behind the cello section.\n\n\u201cWhen I came out here to them practicing I went \u2018Oh wow, this is the playground. Everyone\u2019s playing and we all get to play together,\u2019\u201d says Noah Crowe, a writer from Ojai, Calif., dismounting the zip line as the orchestra begins to play Grieg\u2019s morning mood. This is Crowe\u2019s fourth year at Burning Man.\n\n\u201cMy first year I came out here, it was \u2018oonst oonst. Mmelemena melemena. Obla obla,\u2019\u201d Crowe says, doing a very convincing impression of the playa techno scene. \u201cAnd this year, we actually have a diversity of music.\u201d\n\nI have my own theories about what allowed this to converge now. The size of the event is one \u2013 Burning Man attendance has grown significantly in recent years. Maybe now there\u2019s a critical mass of classical musicians coming, enough to form an orchestra. Or, maybe it\u2019s Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs: now that folks have figured out how to survive in the desert and make it to the end of the week without starving, there\u2019s more energy to make music and expand culture.\n\nCrowe has a quick answer to the question, \u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve grown up. Because the culture is evolving. They say the most common misconception about Burning Man is that it\u2019s a festival. When really the org [the Burning Man organization] considers it a city. So as a city, or as a society, we are evolving and enculturating ourselves into having a richer, diversity of experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s gone through this evolution of adolescent angst and blowing stuff up, to teeny bopper trance rave, to crunk, to now.\u201d\n\nTo Beethoven and Grieg. These were the picks of the Playa Pops founder, Laura Kaczmerak, a.k.a. Pigtails. Back home in Encinitas, she works as a commercial pilot and plays violin with the community symphony in Carlsbad. She says the start of the Burning Man orchestra was more of an accident.\n\n\u201cI see people with string instruments and other instruments out here, but they play alone,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, you know, we need to come together.\u201d\n\nShe sent an innocent email intended for one Burning Man staffer. It then got forwarded to the entire attendee list serve.\n\n\u201cWithin 24 hours I had 200 hits in my email,\u201d says Kaczmerak. \u201cSo I was thrust into this exciting adventure.\u201d\n\nAnd at the group\u2019s debut performance, more than 200 people showed up to listen. Hundreds more came to subsequent concerts. They sat on the ground in the dust or got up and danced as they pleased.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the elite music halls of the default world, where audiences pay top dollar for tickets, dress in fancy clothes, sit politely and clap at the right time.\n\n\u201cEncore, encore, encore, encore,\u201d one audience chants after the first few pieces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only half way through the set,\u201d Dr. FireTuba explains, sending the crowd into hysterics.\n\nHere, the rules of classical music might as well have been burned down with the Man. The traditional emphasis on perfection is inappropriate out here. It\u2019s not needed for music to touch an audience. Dr. FireTuba explains to the listeners that Beethoven was kind of a burner.\n\n\u201cHe was a little crazy, he was a little drunk, he was a little rowdy,\u201d says Dr. FireTuba.\n\nDr. FireTuba says he hopes a little education like this, and the unconventional context of Burning Man might attract some unforeseen fans to keep up with the genre when they get home.\n\n\u201cIt would be wonderful to attract not only people who love classical music,\u201d he says, \u201cbut also get people who think classical music is something for the grandparents and really surprise them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A cadre of burners brought their violins, violas, and cellos to the desert this year to form the first-ever full string orchestra on the playa.
