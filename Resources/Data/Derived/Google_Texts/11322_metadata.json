The acclaimed film \u201cFort Bliss\u201d seeks to bring those struggles to the big screen, garnering praise from viewers and the Pentagon but a lackluster response from Hollywood.\n\nThe film, which opened to limited release in April, won the support of critics, viewers\u2014including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\u2014and the Department of Defense. The buzz surrounding \u201cFort Bliss\u201d hasn\u2019t spread to Hollywood, however, and the film\u2019s backers are fighting to secure theater space.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a yearning out there for what people are actually living like,\u201d John Sullivan, one of the \u201cFort Bliss\u2019\u201d producers, told The Daily Signal. \u201c[The movie] doesn\u2019t pull any punches for what it\u2019s like to be in the military. I think that [\u2018Fort Bliss\u2019] is one of those rare films where it can punch a hole right through the civilian-military divide that exists.\u201d\n\nThe movie, starring Michelle Monaghan and Ron Livingston, hardly puts the military in a glowing light. It highlights the struggles soldiers face upon returning home from war and the conflict of putting family or country first.\n\nMonaghan plays Maggie Swann, an Army medic who returns to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, after an extended tour in Afghanistan. Swann, a single, working mother, struggles to reconnect with her young son and works to rebuild the relationship she had with him before leaving for war. But Swann also finds herself grappling with issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual assault.\n\n>>> Why Can\u2019t We See This in the Cinema?\n\n\n\n\u201cFort Bliss\u201d doesn\u2019t just tackle issues that affect active-duty soldiers returning from deployments. The movie also helps paint a picture of the transition families stateside go through when loved ones return home. And viewers say the movie accurately depicts what that can look like.\n\n\u201cThe family serves, too,\u201d Besa Pinchotti, communications director for the National Military Family Association, told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe nonprofit advocates for military families and provides support for those on the homefront. The group hosted viewings of \u201cFort Bliss\u201d for military families.\n\nSpeaking about those showings, Pinchotti, whose husband was a Marine, said there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the theater.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one service member that signs up, or in a lot of cases there\u2019s two, and they make that choice,\u201d Pinchotti said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not just the ones serving. The families serve on a daily basis. They\u2019re here maintaining the homefront and making things OK so the service members can go and do their jobs.\u201d\n\n>>> Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood Open CMAs with Dig at Democrats\n\nTheaters around the country\u2014especially near military bases\u2014have started to show \u201cFort Bliss\u201d after receiving requests from potential viewers. However, the movie hasn\u2019t caught on in the same way that \u201cLone Survivor\u201d and \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic to me that Hollywood or the anti-military previous sentiment may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater on this one,\u201d Sullivan said:\n\nIt\u2019s the least action film of all of them, but one of the most resonating. It gives you a lump in your throat, and it talks about the true, shadow-side cost of war. It\u2019s not just the soldier. It\u2019s the family, the support network they live and die with.\n\nThough Tinsel Town hasn\u2019t turned its attention to \u201cFort Bliss,\u201d some have called for the film to receive the industry\u2019s top honors.\n\n\u201cThis is a performance that deserves to be noticed,\u201d Steven Rea, long-time film critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer, wrote in his review of the movie. \u201c[Monaghan] is crushingly good.\u201d\n\nScott Feinberg, an awards analyst for The Hollywood Reporter, said Monaghan\u2019s performance is \u201cworthy of serious consideration.\u201d\n\nSullivan hopes that \u201cFort Bliss\u201d will be seen by a wide audience\u2014one that isn\u2019t shy about a debate on military life.\n\n\u201cThe film has the ability to become iconic in a way and definitely has the ability to be the tipping point in ongoing conversations about issues that those who serve are facing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be a tipping point.\u201d\n\nDuring filming, military technical advisers were on set every time something Army-related was shot, and the Pentagon has been supportive of the film despite it\u2019s raw, pull-no-punches take on Army life.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to have happen is for civilians to be better educated and wake up to the everyday sacrifices of those that serve and the family members that surround them, to chip and dissolve the civilian-military divide,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a civilian-military divide. We should be in touch with what the true costs of war are.\u201d\n\n>>> This Army Veteran Shakes Off Democrat Comparing Her to Taylor Swift", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Fort Bliss, Chuck Hagel, Michelle Monaghan, Ron Livingston, John Sullivan, U.S. Army, National Military Family Association, Lone Survivor, Zero Dark Thirty, Steven Rhea", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For soldiers returning from faraway battlefields, coming home isn\u2019t always easy.
