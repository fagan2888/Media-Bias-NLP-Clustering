For many of our years together her part-time work was ideal as she took the lead in nurturing and guiding our children while I completed my doctorate and pursued a full-time career, first near Boston and now in Michigan.\n\nDuring our quarter-century together we have twice been faculty members of the same department, collaborated on research, traveled extensively for sabbatical studies, created dance and theater performances, co-taught several classes, and received numerous awards for contributions to the university. She typically teaches the same number of credit hours (nine) as most full-time faculty; holds regular office hours; attends students\u2019 exhibitions, performances, and recitals; writes many letters of recommendation; and volunteers for university working groups and committees. Students in our classes have no idea that there is any difference between our roles and responsibilities at the university.\n\nOver the years there have been many times when I have wanted to write about my life as the professor spouse of a part-time faculty member. Because of a recent e-mail that all tenure-line faculty in my department received, I finally put fingers to the keys. The e-mail informed us that the college dean and the department of information technology had approved a second computer monitor for our offices. The reasoning was that during student advising our advisees needed their own monitor. I immediately wrote back saying that I had no need for a second monitor and that if possible I would like the funds allocated for my office to be redirected to purchase used notebook computers for our dedicated part-time faculty.\n\nThe university where we both work has a program where part-time faculty can request to borrow a used notebook computer, one that has been deemed unworthy by a full-time faculty member. My wife applied for one of the used computers only to be told that in reality there were not that many available and she would have to satisfy her technology needs with the computers in the part-time faculty office. In the department where we both work there are about 15 tenure lines and approximately 50 part-time faculty members. She actually shares an office and four computers with these 50 or so faculty. I was told my suggestion to divert the funds to help part-time faculty was not an option.\n\nOver the many years of our work in higher education I have too often witnessed firsthand the frustrations of part-time faculty. I cannot tell you how many times I have asked my wife if she received an important memo that I received about issues related to our work at the university. Most of the time, she and the other approximately 700 part-time faculty did not receive the information. Once, when she inquired about including part-time faculty on university memos, she was told that not all of the information is important for this group.\n\nDuring her many years of teaching part time no one, other than me, has ever asked about or assessed the syllabus for her classes. Moreover, it seems impossible, but other than her volunteering to be part of a peer-evaluation teaching circle, no one in an official capacity has evaluated her teaching during the past 10 years.\n\nFor the past two years my wife has served as a member of a council that was established at the university to help deal with the many issues facing part-time faculty. The council also lobbied for modest raises for the part-time faculty. When my wife calculates all of the time she spends on her responsibilities at the university she now makes approximately one dollar more per hour. For this coming year she received a $27 raise for one of the classes she instructs. I suggested it might have been more meaningful to simply give her and others a Starbucks gift card. During one period when our children were younger it actually cost us more to hire a babysitter than my wife made while the children were being watched over. And of course most part-time faculty have no benefits.\n\nHer efforts on the council have recently included dealing with the number of credit hours part-time faculty can teach. It seems colleges and universities are now establishing limits to these numbers because under the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act they may be required to provide health-care coverage if the total number of hours worked is thirty or greater. At our university the limit the administration established is nine credit hours, which they calculate to be 27 working hours. The university recognizes three working hours for every credit hour taught. I cannot remember a time when my wife actually worked fewer than 30 hours per week as a part-time faculty member.\n\nWhat I find especially troubling is that too many full-time faculty simply do not recognize the plight of part-time faculty and moreover, do little to help change the status quo. Maybe because many have served as part-time faculty, they simply find it too difficult to relive their past. Two years ago at an all-college meeting that included only full-time faculty, I asked the administration of the university how it was possible that a particular part-time faculty member, who was making just $600 per credit hour, could not have received a raise in more than 10 years. Many of my full-time colleagues at this meeting seemed stunned at my asking such a question.\n\nAs a result of the part-time council and the efforts of other concerned faculty, the university has recently appointed a full-time faculty member as a university director who now oversees the 700 part-time faculty members. This is one small step that must be followed by others. These include first and foremost paying part-time faculty a fair wage for the work they do; providing a stipend for part-time faculty members to represent their interests in university governance; rethinking policies regarding the Affordable Care Act (possibly a scheme that allows part-time faculty to purchase health care on a sliding scale based on the number of credit hours taught); involving part-time faculty as integral players in departmental business (possibly providing a part-time faculty member a stipend for representing the department\u2019s part-time group at faculty meetings); and reaching out at all levels of the university to share with part-time faculty important information, memos, notices, etc.\n\nColleges and universities must respond to these and other concerns if they wish to continue employing part-time faculty to teach more and more classes each year. Without greater equity and balance, higher education, an institution that should pride itself on the aforesaid, simply cannot move forward. The part-time bubble that this professor spouse sees surrounding his wife and many others will eventually burst.\n\nJohn Kilbourne is a professor of movement science at Grand Valley State University.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.6.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9f2\"", "article_summary": "Her efforts on the council have recently included dealing with the number of credit hours part-time faculty can teach.\nOver the years there have been many times when I have wanted to write about my life as the professor spouse of a part-time faculty member.\nAs a result of the part-time council and the efforts of other concerned faculty, the university has recently appointed a full-time faculty member as a university director who now oversees the 700 part-time faculty members.\nWhat I find especially troubling is that too many full-time faculty simply do not recognize the plight of part-time faculty and moreover, do little to help change the status quo.\nMaybe because many have served as part-time faculty, they simply find it too difficult to relive their past."}
