As we\u2019ve reported, a van service drives people from Las Vegas to Mexicali monthly for medical services.\n\nThe trip, at just $30 round-trip, is subsidized by the Mexicali tourism board. Authorities have even managed to get around the long border waits that might scare people off by offering special lanes to speed medical tourists back to the U.S.\n\nMore and more Latin American countries are trying to get in on the medical tourism boom. As we recently reported, a Nicaraguan hospital is advertising to the Latino population in the U.S., hoping to lure them to the Central American country for cheaper hip replacements and artificial knees.\n\nBut these countries might soon face a new challenge in the Affordable Care Act. If it works as planned, insurance companies should cover many of these procedures for U.S. residents. If so, Latin America\u2019s plastic surgeons and others offering purely esthetic procedures may be getting the bulk of American medical tourists in the future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical tourism to Baja California has risen nearly 18 percent over the past three years, but changes might be on the horizon as the Affordable Care Act kicks in next year.", "author": "Jill Replogle", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "Medical tourism to Baja California has risen nearly 18 percent over the past three years, but changes might be on the horizon as the Affordable Care Act kicks in next year.", "title": "Medical Tourism Booming In Baja California", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/dec/16/medical-tourism-booming-baja-california/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2013/12/16/Mexicali_medicaltourism.JPG", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "133643 %##% Medical Tourism Booming In Baja California", "keywords": "News, Border, Tijuana, Health, Health Insurance, Imperial County", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe007a\"", "article_summary": "The head of Baja California\u2019s medical tourism cluster, Karim Chalita Rodr\u00edguez, told Frontera that more than 500,000 visitors have sought medical or dental care in Baja California this year.\nMedical tourism to Baja California has risen nearly 18 percent since 2010, Mexico\u2019s Frontera newspaper reports.\nMost medical tourists are from California, but Mexican border cities are making a big push to attract visitors from inland states as well.\nIf so, Latin America\u2019s plastic surgeons and others offering purely esthetic procedures may be getting the bulk of American medical tourists in the future.\nAuthorities have even managed to get around the long border waits that might scare people off by offering special lanes to speed medical tourists back to the U.S.More and more Latin American countries are trying to get in on the medical tourism boom."}
