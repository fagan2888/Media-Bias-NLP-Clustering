LISBON, Ohio (WKBN) – Small businesses got a leg up in Columbiana County on Tuesday with the county’s first ever Business and Trade Expo.

Susan Henderson has been a small business owner for most of her life. She knows what it’s all about.

“Be ready to eat, drink and sleep your business if you want to be a business owner,” Henderson said.

Henderson owns Alterations by the Clothing Surgeon, a Lisbon business that has been going strong for 25 years. She said it’s all about the customers.

“Word of mouth is the best advertisement there is. So if you please a customer, then they are going to send you more customers,” Henderson said.

But it is also important to get to know other business owners, which was one big goal of Tuesday’s Business Expo.

“It helps because they have the same challenges and they can help solve your problems or give any kind of advice at all,” Henderson said.

Audrey Null helped organize the Expo. She said that kind of networking is exactly what the event is all about.

“Sometimes small business owners are so involved in their business that this gives them the opportunity to get out and meet some people and get some new business,” Hull said.

All told, 65 businesses took part in the expo. There were also workshops led by local businesses on things like social media, innovation, cyber liability and the Affordable Care Act.
