It's Thursday evening here in Washington and we're wishing everyone a Happy St. Patrick's Day.\n\nHere's the latest.\n\nTHE BIG STORY\n\nSenate Republicans unveiled legislation Thursday to crack down on regulatory overreach.\n\nThe Separation of Powers Restoration Act would clarify the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) to state that courts, not agencies, are to interpret all questions of law, including both statutes and regulations.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Sens.

Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc. That case, creating the Chevron doctrine, said that courts should defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute as long as the statute is \"ambiguous\" and the agency's reading is \"reasonable.\"\n\nLawmakers say that deference allows agencies to rewrite laws and issue regulations as they see fit.\n\nGrassley said the practice has weakened the nation's system of checks and balances in remarks at a Heritage Foundation event to discuss the Chevron doctrine on Thursday.\n\n\"Congress delegates too much power in the first place to regulators as you know, but this undermines accountability,\" he said. \"It's not the way our founders intended our government to work under the principle of checks and balances.\"\n\nHe later added that the, \"consequences of regulatory overreach are felt by the people who foot the bill for all this: the American people.\"\n\nThe bill is part of Lee's Article I project, an initiative he's launched with lawmakers in both chambers to reassert Congress's powers under Article I of the Constitution.\n\nArticle I, he explained, says \"all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.\"\n\n\"It's time to turn back to the text of the Constitution on which we swore oath to uphold,\" Lee added. http://bit.ly/1pONh4k\n\nTOMORROW'S REGS TODAY\n\nThe Obama administration will publish 221 new regulations, proposed rules, notices and other administrative actions in Friday's edition of the Federal Register.\n\n--The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will block the use of certain \"cattle material\" in human food to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease.\n\nThe cattle materials ban will mostly affect dietary supplements and cosmetics.\n\nThe cattle materials that will be prohibited include the small intestine, \"material from nonambulatory disabled cattle, material from cattle not inspected and passed, or mechanically separated beef.\"\n\nThe FDA says it is hoping to \"minimize human exposure to certain cattle material that could potentially contain the BSE agent.\"\n\nThe new rules go into effect in 30 days. http://bit.ly/1MbzVcy\n\n--The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) will propose monitoring the survival of certain humpback whales that it does not believe are currently endangered.\n\nThe NMFS proposed listing several species of humpback whales as endangered or threatened in April 2015, but the ruling did not apply to the entire species. It is now planning to keep an eye on the remaining humpback whales through this monitor plan.\n\nThe public has 30 days to comment. http://bit.ly/21xRXr2\n\n--The Department of Transportation will develop new guidelines for automated vehicles that operate without a driver.\n\nThe Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will hold a public meeting as it develops guidelines \"for the safe deployment and operation of automated vehicles.\"\n\n\"For example, of high importance to the agency is information on the roadway scenarios and operational environments highly automated vehicles will need to address and the associated design and evaluation processes and methods needed to ensure that [automated vehicle] systems can detect and appropriately react to these scenarios such that a high level of safety is assured when these systems are deployed on U.S. roadways,\" the NHTSA writes.\n\n\"Also of interest would be input on aspects of automated vehicle technology that may not be suitable or ready for guidelines,\" it adds.\n\nThe public meeting will take place on April 8. http://bit.ly/1Rp9ZWR\n\nNEWS RIGHT NOW\n\nGOP bill seeks to roll back Obama overtime rule. http://bit.ly/1pOJCn7\n\nLabor chief pushing White House on overtime, silica rules. http://bit.ly/1XytkcH\n\nHatch: Dems acting 'holier-than-thou' on Supreme Court. http://bit.ly/1S6RNEJ\n\nGrassley: Met with 'dictator,' can meet with SCOUTS nominee. http://bit.ly/1SWxgoz\n\nCornyn: Supreme Court nominee in lame duck is 'a terrible idea.' http://bit.ly/1UDVHHp\n\nWhy Obama picked Merrick Garland. http://bit.ly/1UCzHN2\n\nEqual pay top issue for working women, survey finds. http://bit.ly/1MpI08i\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n11 percent: Women who said they work over 50 hours a week.\n\n19 percent: Women who said they hold multiple jobs\n\n59 percent: Women who said they are the primary breadwinner.\n\n(Source: A recent AFL-CIO survey.
