Health Republic had jumped on the Affordable Care Act bandwagon and signed up nearly a quarter million new subscribers, offering cut rate prices and surging to the top of the market in that area. Unfortunately, the expected cash bonanza from the government program failed to live up to expectations and the company quickly ran out of operating capital. Yesterday was the end of the line for Health Republic and they closed their doors.\n\nUnfortunately for the citizens of New York, this failure didn\u2019t just represent a blow to the company\u2019s profits and the reputation of the White House\u2019s signature legislative achievement. There have been real world consequences for the people who signed up for the plan, including running into doctors who won\u2019t even accept appointments from people using the company\u2019s services. (From The Watershed Post)\n\nThe shuttered company is no longer paying its claims, leaving doctors unsure whether they will ever be paid for seeing Health Republic patients. Some doctors have turned patients away, or are bargaining directly with patients over their medical fees\u2026 Health Republic\u2019s collapse has forced a panicked scramble among patients and doctors in upstate New York. Local doctors have worried that Health Republic will default on bills, and at least one practice, the Llobet Medical Group, has turned away patients who have Health Republic insurance. \u201cThis was one of the biggest disasters ever,\u201d said David Cordner, an administrator at Llobet Medical Group, a primary care practice with offices in Margaretville and Kingston. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why New York didn\u2019t see this a lot sooner. Nobody got paid. Where was the money going?\u201d\n\nWhere was the money going? Several New York legislators are asking exactly that question since a lot of taxpayer dollars were flushed down this rat hole before it was finally closed. Health Republic had received $265 million in federal loans to get started and that money has pretty much evaporated. Two state senators along with U.S. Congressman Chris Gibson have called for an investigation and are asking Governor Andrew Cuomo to explain where the money went and what he plans to do to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201c$265 million of taxpayer money disappeared and 215,000 New Yorkers are facing turmoil in their healthcare coverage,\u201d he told the Watershed Post. \u201cThere is no question that there needs to be an investigation to see where there was wrongdoing. This happened on Governor Cuomo\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\nSome of the personal stories which Watershed Post dug up are precisely the sort of outcome which people had feared, They talked to Candace Rudd, the owner of a hair salon, who called her doctor for an appointment and was told that her insurance was no longer accepted. They were willing to give her an appointment, but wanted a $100 cash payment to get in to see the doctor. Whether or not she\u2019s able to afford that, there are far too many families who couldn\u2019t in upstate New York\u2019s struggling economy.\n\nThis is the larger, national potential for Obamacare on a local level. More than half of the state exchanges have closed at this point and nearly all the rest of them are in financial peril. But with the law in place, what happens to all of the collapsed segments of the system? Legally the states can\u2019t simply walk away, but someone still has to pay the bills. Care to guess who that\u2019s going to be?\n\nI\u2019ll give you three tries and the first two don\u2019t count.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Take your business elsewhere please", "title": "Collapse of NY\u2019s largest Obamacare co-op has doctors refusing new patients", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/01/collapse-of-nys-largest-obamacare-co-op-has-doctors-refusing-new-patients/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Andrew Cuomo, bankruptcy, collapse, New York, ObamaCare, Obamacare co-op,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-01T17:41:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T16:27:23+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Yesterday was the end of the line for Health Republic and they closed their doors.\nSome doctors have turned patients away, or are bargaining directly with patients over their medical fees\u2026 Health Republic\u2019s collapse has forced a panicked scramble among patients and doctors in upstate New York.\n(From The Watershed Post)The shuttered company is no longer paying its claims, leaving doctors unsure whether they will ever be paid for seeing Health Republic patients.\nCollapse of NY\u2019s largest Obamacare co-op has doctors refusing new patientsposted at 12:41 pm on December 1, 2015 by Jazz ShawBack in the middle of November we covered the announcement that one of the largest New York health insurance providers under the Obamacare co-op umbrella was in trouble.\nLocal doctors have worried that Health Republic will default on bills, and at least one practice, the Llobet Medical Group, has turned away patients who have Health Republic insurance."}
