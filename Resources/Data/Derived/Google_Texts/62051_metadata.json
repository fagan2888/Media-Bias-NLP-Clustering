One of the bill\u2019s sponsors, Del. Chris Stansbury (R-Kanawha), said on the House floor Monday that opioids aren\u2019t going away, so the next best move is making them safer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another step to make sure patients have access to adequate pain control, while at the same time providing safeguards to help prevent abuse and other problems associated with these types of drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill would require one at least one abuse-deterrent drug product for each active opioid ingredient. Del. Matthew Rohrbach (R-Cabell), a medical doctor, said that unquestionably, the legislation would cause rates to rise but the drug epidemic was such that he didn\u2019t see an alternative.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies aren\u2019t going to want to do this willingly. But we\u2019ve got a huge problem in this state,\u201d Rohrbach said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t deny this: it\u2019s going to cost a few dollars more, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But you can\u2019t fail the generic, because failure equals death.\u201d\n\nDel. Tom Fast (R-Fayette) spoke against the bill because he thought it was too similar in principal to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThese policies out there are arms length transactions, and bargain for exchange, and now the federal government has just decided that we\u2019re going to take those terms and write our own policies, our own mandates and our own costs,\u201d said Fast before saying he would vote \u2018no\u2019 on the bill.\n\nDel. Denise Campbell (D-Randolph) acknowledged that people want to have freedom when it comes to their medicine, but said that safety should come first.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of us in here do not want anyone to tell us what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are responsible to protect the people of West Virginia.\u201d\n\nWhile abuse of prescription painkillers in the Mountain State is rampant, many people have legitimate reasons to have such drugs, said Del. Scott Cadle (R \u2013 Mason).\n\n\u201cWest Virginia\u2013we\u2019re hard working people. And anybody who\u2019s 50 plus years old (and) has worked for a living, most of those people have to have some kind of pain medicine to get through the day,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill aiming to prevent abuse of prescription pills passed the House overwhelmingly, 89 to 9.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Bill aiming to prevent abuse of prescription pills passed the House overwhelmingly, 89 to 9.", "title": "Bill to require abuse deterrents along with opioid prescriptions moves to House", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2016/02/15/bill-to-require-abuse-deterrents-along-with-opioid-prescriptions-moves-to-house/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/metronews/images/metronews-default-color.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-15T22:36:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-15T22:36:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The bill would require one at least one abuse-deterrent drug product for each active opioid ingredient.\nBy Matt Maccaro in News | February 15, 2016 at 5:36PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A bill that would require insurance companies to provide abuse deterrents alongside prescriptions for opioid painkillers passed the House of Delegates overwhelmingly on Monday.\nBut we\u2019ve got a huge problem in this state,\u201d Rohrbach said.\nChris Stansbury (R-Kanawha), said on the House floor Monday that opioids aren\u2019t going away, so the next best move is making them safer.\nTom Fast (R-Fayette) spoke against the bill because he thought it was too similar in principal to Obamacare."}
