For example, it costs someone with rental properties, businesses or major investments more than someone who works one job and didn\u2019t have any major life changes the year before, such as adding children or purchasing a home. Roy said fees can range from $225 to more than $1,000, but most personal income tax returns average between $225 and $500.\n\nSeveral \u201csignificant\u201d changes to tax laws and requirements have taken place in the past few years, Roy said. Among those for families and individuals filing for 2014, are new health-care- related forms for people who did not have the minimum essential health coverage required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind as well, is that several deductions and credits are lost at different levels of income. Individuals with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 and married people filing jointly with incomes of $110,000 or more for example, face a reduction or elimination of the child tax credit. In addition, Maine has a $27,950 limit for itemized deductions regardless of AGI.\n\nRoy said it\u2019s hard to say whether families or individuals save more on their taxes because of the variables involved. However, he said families typically have more exemptions and itemized deductions than individuals but there are some thresholds for married couples that are not equivalent to double the individual amounts.\n\n\u201cThis is what prompted the phrase \u2018marriage penalty,\u2019\u201d Roy said.\n\nHeaded to do your 2014 taxes? Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nChild tax credit: Parents can claim $1,000 per child up to age 17.\n\nCollege savings plan deduction: If parents have opened a 529 account or another type of state-sponsored college fund for a child, money saved in the account during 2014 can be claimed as deductions.\n\nChild-care deductions: Parents who work and pay for child-care may be able to deduct some of that expense. The total depends on a couple\u2019s income and type of day-care center.\n\nMedical expenses: If family health care costs exceed 7.5 percent of a household\u2019s AGI, they can be deducted from taxes. Expenses can include things like hospital stays, medications and physical therapy, but not insurance premiums.\n\nEducation expenses: Qualified education expenses include money paid for tuition, fees or other costs related to an eligible student. The expenses must have been paid by you or your spouse, a student claimed as a dependent or a third party like relatives or friends. Expenses include anything paid for by cash, check, credit card or with money from a loan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Benjamin Franklin once said, \u201cIn this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.\u201d Never does this seem more true than in the first few months of a new year as the Internal Revenue Service tax filing deadline of April 15 looms.
