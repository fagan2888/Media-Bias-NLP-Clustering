Some folks have had the impression that this was kind of an opportunity just for the snowbirds or just for the youth groups in the past, but we want locals to know,\" said Pastor Ric Brigman.\n\nOther classes you can sign up for include creative writing, square dancing, and sewing.\n\nYou can call Noah's Ark at (850) 234-6062.
