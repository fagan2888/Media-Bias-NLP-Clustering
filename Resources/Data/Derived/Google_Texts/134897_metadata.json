So are many part-time workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is likely that a great deal of Medicaid enrollment is the result of substitution from the private sector,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis does not necessarily increase economic activity. It may simply substitute less efficient tax-supported health spending for more efficient private health spending.\u201d\n\nFindings from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment published in 2013 suggest Medicaid coverage doesn\u2019t improve health outcomes, Gorman said. And, she added, \u201cthe additional federal dollars have to come from somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe national debt exceeds $19 trillion, but Obamacare promises federal funding for 100 percent of Medicaid expansion benefits through 2016. Starting in 2017, states will have to pay for 5 percent of benefit costs. The state share is set to increase to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nHospitals support Medicaid expansion as a way to secure additional federal money to pay for care they provide to the poor, and the Colorado Hospital Association says charity care costs dropped sharply when the Obamacare expansion took effect in 2014.\n\nFrom the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014, average charity care costs at Colorado hospitals dropped from $4.6 million to $2.9 million \u2014 a decline of more than 36 percent.\n\nPatients receiving charity care pay hospitals nothing, which makes expanded Medicaid coverage appealing for care providers despite the Medicaid program\u2019s low reimbursement rates.\n\n\u201cAs of 2013, Colorado hospitals receive $0.66 in government payments for every $1.00 spent providing services to Medicare patients, $0.80 for every $1.00 spent providing care to Medicaid patients and $1.51 for every dollar spent providing care to patients with private insurance coverage,\u201d CHA\u2019s website explains.\n\nChris Tholan, chief financial officer and vice president of financial policy at CHA, told Watchdog.org that expanding Medicaid has improved health care in Colorado.\n\nWhether it\u2019s had any effect on patient outcomes in Colorado remains to be seen. But it has improved the health of nonprofit hospitals\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nCHA members saw charity care costs drop \u201calmost instantly\u201d after Medicaid expansion took effect, Tholan said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a steady drop through 2014 in uncompensated care.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve stabilized where we\u2019re going to be now,\u201d Tholan added. \u201cWe expect that 35-40 percent lower than pre-[Affordable Care Act} level to hold going forward.\u201d\n\nObamacare expansion has increased hospitals\u2019 unreimbursed Medicaid costs \u2014 the gap between what hospitals charge and what Medicaid pays \u2014 but the previously uninsured are receiving additional services through the program.\n\n\u201cEven though the financial effect within providers may be relatively minimal, I think we\u2019re seeing a better health care system,\u201d Tholan said.\n\nColorado hospitals pay a provider fee to cover the state share of Medicaid expansion costs, and CHA expects Medicaid expansion will continue without major changes regardless of the outcome of the 2016 elections.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that risk in federal government that reimbursements will change,\u201d Tholan said. \u201cHospitals have been dealing with that since Medicare went in in 1965, and have been able to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe federal government pays for 50 percent of Colorado\u2019s traditional Medicaid benefits, a much lower match rate than the 90 percent promised for the Obamacare expansion from 2020 onward.\n\nBefore the Obamacare expansion took effect, unreimbursed Medicaid was already more of a burden than charity care for many of Colorado\u2019s hospitals.\n\nBased on a Watchdog.org review of 2012-13 financials from 19 of CHA\u2019s nonprofit members, charity care averaged 2.3 percent of total expenses and unreimbursed Medicaid averaged 5.8 percent of total expenses at Colorado nonprofit hospitals.\n\nBad debt \u2014 incurred when patients are billed but fail to pay \u2014 averaged 5.5 percent of expenses for Colorado\u2019s nonprofit hospitals.\n\nDetails about Colorado nonprofit hospital\u2019s uncompensated care costs before Medicaid expansion are included in the following table, from IRS Form 990 filings available at GuideStar.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid expansion has shifted more of Colorado hospitals' charity care costs to federal taxpayers, and advocates are pointing to the stimulating effects of new federal spending.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Medicaid expansion has shifted more of Colorado hospitals' charity care costs to federal taxpayers, and advocates are pointing to the stimulating effects of new federal spending.", "title": "Medicaid expansion supporters claim economic benefits, but some are skeptical - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/stethoscope-stockvault-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-14T14:35:58+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/259287/medicaid-expansion-supporters-claim-economic-benefits-skeptical/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Medicaid expansion has shifted more of Colorado hospitals' charity care costs to federal taxpayers, and advocates are pointing to the stimulating effects of new federal spending.", "title": "Medicaid expansion supporters claim economic benefits, but some are skeptical - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/stethoscope-stockvault-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Colorado", "published_time": "2016-03-15T04:41:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T14:35:58+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "colorado hospital association, medicaid expansion, obamacare expansion, colorado medicaid expansion, colorado obamacare expansion, independence institute, colorado charity care, colorado uncompensated care"}, "article_summary": "Colorado hospitals pay a provider fee to cover the state share of Medicaid expansion costs, and CHA expects Medicaid expansion will continue without major changes regardless of the outcome of the 2016 elections.\nCHA members saw charity care costs drop \u201calmost instantly\u201d after Medicaid expansion took effect, Tholan said.\nMedicaid expansion has shifted more of Colorado hospitals\u2019 charity care costs to federal taxpayers, and advocates are pointing to the stimulating effects of the new federal spending.\nDetails about Colorado nonprofit hospital\u2019s uncompensated care costs before Medicaid expansion are included in the following table, from IRS Form 990 filings available at GuideStar.org.\nPatients receiving charity care pay hospitals nothing, which makes expanded Medicaid coverage appealing for care providers despite the Medicaid program\u2019s low reimbursement rates."}
