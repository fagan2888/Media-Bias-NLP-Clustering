Kristin Armstrong (Twenty16), the 42-year-old winner of Stage 1, was four seconds back, along with Boulder\u2019s Mara Abbott (Amy D. Foundation).\n\nArmstrong retained the yellow jersey and takes a 31-second lead over Wiles going into Golden, a favorite haunt of Front Range cycling enthusiasts.\n\nAbbott made a break coming over the race\u2019s high point about 20 miles into Saturday\u2019s stage. The other three women chased her down the steep descent into Fort Collins, and with a kilometer left, Abbott made another move.\n\n\u201cI decided my best shot was to try and go long and see if I could surprise everyone, knowing that there were two corners going into the finish,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cI felt like that was my best chance. That ended up not working out, but it still was a really good result. I think it potentially puts me on the podium for GC.\u201d\n\nThe wild finish down two blocks of Mountain Avenue electrified the crowd in Old Town Fort Collins.\n\n\u201cI knew I was going to have to play it pretty efficient and pretty smart, since there were two Twenty16 riders,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cI was going off (Abbott\u2019s) wheel, and then Lauren Komanski went with 500 meters to go. I stuck on her wheel, and I probably went with about 400 meters go. It was a long straight drag, and I knew if I could get a jump and get a little bit of a gap, I could probably hold it.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s stage is a one-hour circuit on a 1.5-mile loop with some technical turns in downtown Golden. Armstrong is grateful to have a bit of a buffer in the GC, and to have a strong team around her.\n\n\u201cOur team wants to finish this week off with a yellow jersey,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cIt will be a historical moment for women\u2019s cycling, because this is the first year of the Women\u2019s USA Pro Challenge. That\u2019s our No. 1 goal. We have a great sprinter, Lauren Hall, and if we can keep safe all the way to the last several (kilometers), then we\u2019ll go in for her and let her try to go for the win.\n\n\u201cThe key is keep safe, keep the pace a little bit high, be in the front so we don\u2019t get in trouble.\n\nAbbott said she didn\u2019t know anything about the course in Golden but expects it to be challenging.\n\n\u201cI think it will pretty fun,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cSome of my very best friends live in Golden, so it\u2019s just going to be really amazing to go down and have a race there.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Taylor Wiles gets sprint finish win in Fort Collins at USA Pro Challenge", "title": "Taylor Wiles gets sprint finish win in Fort Collins at USA Pro Challenge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/22/taylor-wiles-gets-sprint-finish-win-in-fort-collins-at-usa-pro-challenge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150821__Kirstin-Armstrongp1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150821__Kirstin-Armstrongp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-22T17:12:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T04:22:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Armstrong retained the yellow jersey and takes a 31-second lead over Wiles going into Golden, a favorite haunt of Front Range cycling enthusiasts.\nTaylor Wiles (DNA Racing) led three women to a sprint finish and won the 58-mile stage by two seconds over Lauren Komanski (Twenty16).\n\u201cIt will be a historical moment for women\u2019s cycling, because this is the first year of the Women\u2019s USA Pro Challenge.\n\u201cI knew I was going to have to play it pretty efficient and pretty smart, since there were two Twenty16 riders,\u201d Wiles said.\n\u201cI decided my best shot was to try and go long and see if I could surprise everyone, knowing that there were two corners going into the finish,\u201d Abbott said."}
