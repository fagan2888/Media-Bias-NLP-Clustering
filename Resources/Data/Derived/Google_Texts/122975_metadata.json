He couldn\u2019t walk more than 20 feet without getting winded and feeling his heart racing.\n\nHe never made it to the Middle East. But Daniels still found himself in a fight for his life.\n\nThe Oklahoman reports that eventually Daniels, now 27, would be diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.\n\nIn the meantime, Daniels, who serves with the 219th Engineering Installation Squadron, an Oklahoma Air National Guard unit based in Tulsa, learned he can expect to be cut from the National Guard rolls later this year, meaning he\u2019ll lose his health insurance at the time he needs it most.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for special favors or special treatment because I have cancer, but a fair shot at anything would be nice,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIt just seems like a crooked deal to have health insurance, but if you get sick, they can kick you out of the military.\u201d\n\nAn Oklahoma National Guard spokesman said he empathizes with Daniels, but there is little the National Guard can do given that the airman no longer is medically fit to serve. He said Daniels will be eligible to extend his military health coverage temporarily once he leaves service, but it\u2019s only for a limited time.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s not a long-term solution for the airman, but that\u2019s how the system has been established,\u201d Guard spokesman Col. Max Moss said.\n\nBefore his unit deployed, Daniels was in school at Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology. To stay in shape for deployment, Daniels and a friend ran several times a week, sometimes up to six or eight miles a day. But after a while, Daniels noticed he was slowing down. Then, he couldn\u2019t finish a 1.5-mile run. Meanwhile, his running partner was making steady improvement.\n\n\u201cHe kept getting better and better, and I kept getting worse and worse,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nHalfway through their workouts, Daniels would need to stop and take a break. Some days, he would lie on the floor for a moment\u2019s rest and fall asleep. He knew something was wrong, he said, but he assumed it was just stress. At the time, Daniels was going to school full time, working at his church and preparing for deployment. He must have overextended himself, he thought.\n\nAfter about a month, Daniels went to a doctor. After running several tests, the doctor determined he was anemic. Soon after, a colonoscopy showed a large tumor in Daniels\u2019 colon. Doctors told him it needed to be removed immediately. Even if the surgery was successful, doctors told Daniels he had a difficult road ahead of him.\n\n\u201cThey told me it was bad, and it was going to be bad,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they were right.\u201d\n\nDaniels and his wife, Kristin, purchase health insurance through Tricare, the Defense Department\u2019s insurance provider. After Daniels got his diagnosis, he called Tricare, and a representative assured him that his treatments would be covered. Later that month, just after his 25th birthday, Daniels had surgery to have the tumor removed.\n\nIn the two years since then, Daniels has been in and out of the emergency room several times. He\u2019s had abdomen spasms that are so painful that he has to be hospitalized. Last year, doctors thought Daniels\u2019 gallbladder was inflamed. So Daniels went in for another operation, but surgeons weren\u2019t able to remove the organ because of scar tissue and other problems related to his chemotherapy.\n\nAll through his recovery, Daniels\u2019 National Guard unit didn\u2019t require him to attend monthly drill weekends. But last November, the unit\u2019s leaders started asking questions about when he thought he could come back. He didn\u2019t have an answer for them. Even when he wasn\u2019t in the hospital, Daniels was almost always in pain, and chemotherapy left him exhausted.\n\n\u201cIt felt like I was running a marathon all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nSo earlier this year, Daniels was given a choice: Either leave the military, or submit himself for an evaluation system that would determine whether he was fit to stay in the National Guard. Oklahoma National Guard officials forwarded Daniels\u2019 case to the National Guard Bureau in Washington, D.C., where the National Guard surgeon general declared him unfit for duty.\n\nMoss, the Oklahoma National Guard spokesman, said Daniels\u2019 case now will go to a U.S. Air Force evaluation board. If that board agrees that Daniels is unfit for duty, he will be allowed to appeal that decision to yet another evaluation board. If his appeal is denied, Daniels will be discharged.\n\nEven if he is discharged, Daniels wouldn\u2019t necessarily lose his health insurance immediately, Moss said. He would be eligible to continue to purchase health insurance under the Defense Department\u2019s Continued Health Care Benefit Program. But that program only would cover Daniels for 18 months after he leaves the National Guard, Moss said. After that, he would be cut off.\n\nMoss acknowledged that losing his health insurance in the middle of a major illness would leave Daniels in a difficult position and said he was sympathetic to his situation. But because Daniels\u2019 illness isn\u2019t duty-related, there isn\u2019t much the National Guard can do for him once that 18-month window closes, Moss said.\n\nRon Abrams, joint director of the nonprofit National Veterans Legal Services Program, said Daniels\u2019 situation likely leaves him with little legal recourse.\n\nIf a military service member is injured while serving on active duty, he or she is entitled to free health care through the Veterans Affairs Department. But because Daniels is a part-time National Guard airman and his illness isn\u2019t related to his service, his treatment wouldn\u2019t be covered by the VA, Abrams said.\n\nThat 18-month window would buy Daniels and his wife enough time to consider their options, but it doesn\u2019t solve their problem, he said. Daniels can\u2019t work because of his illness and medication he takes to manage his pain. Daniels\u2019 wife is a teacher in Checotah, but Daniels said the two couldn\u2019t afford to buy health insurance through the school district if they\u2019re depending only on her paycheck.\n\nDaniels looked into buying health coverage through the federal marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, but even that seems out of reach with only one income between the two of them, he said. Daniels\u2019 wife set up a GoFundMe.com account to try to raise money for his health care costs.\n\nDaniels said he\u2019s disappointed he isn\u2019t able to continue his military career, but he recognizes that he shouldn\u2019t be there if he isn\u2019t physically able to serve. But he feels like he\u2019s fallen through a crack in the system, and he\u2019s frustrated that he may lose his health insurance simply because he got sick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI\u2019ve committed no crimes, I served with honor, I did everything I was asked to do. I just got cancer.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
