This icy moon of Saturn seems speared by the immense planet’s distinctive rings in this image taken by NASA’s Cassini space probe. Tethys itself, however, is no pinprick in space. Measuring about 660 miles (1,056 kilometers) across, it is the 16th-largest moon in the solar system and more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 14. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 22 degrees. Image scale is 7 miles (11 kilometers) per pixel. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.
