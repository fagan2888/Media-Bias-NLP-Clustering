Yet, as often as strokes occur, it normally sluggish three hours to diagnose one. Thankfully, scientists have developed a technique that can cut this time down to minutes.\n\n\"Three quarters of stroke patients suffer from ischemic stroke \u2013 a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain. In those cases, time is of the essence, because there is a good drug available, but for a successful outcome it has to be given within three or four hours after the onset of symptoms,\" lead author Roy Cohen, a Research Scientist at the Baker Institute, said in a press release . \"By the time someone identifies the symptoms, gets to the hospital, and sits in the emergency room you don't have much time to obtain the full benefit of this drug.\"\n\nDoctors normally look at signs and symptoms to diagnose stroke \u2014 sagging on one side of the face, weakness on one side of the body \u2014 as well as patients\u2019 medical history, a physical exam, and test results. These tests could include anything from a brain CT scan to an MRI or carotid ultrasound, which checks for blockages in the artery that sends blood to the brain. But now, researchers at Cornell University\u2019s Baker Institute for Animal Health created a proof of principle of of a new technique that\u2019s both simple and small, and allows nurses or doctors to detect stroke-specific biomarkers in patients\u2019 blood at their bedside.\n\nTo do this, the researchers attached enzymes to nanoparticles and then sent them into both animals\u2019 and humans\u2019 bloodstreams so they could look for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) \u2014 a biomarker that appears in everything from brain injuries to lung cancer. When they did, the enzymes would light up, allowing researchers to see where NSE was and how much of it was present. The in-vitro study found that the enzymes with the nanoparticles were much more sensitive, and detected NSE much faster than when they weren\u2019t attached to nanoparticles.\n\nSpecifically, in the animal study, researchers used rat stroke models to demonstrate that the enzyme-nanoparticle technique could identify significant increases of NSE from an hour before to six hours after blockage of the of the distal middle cerebral artery \u2014 one of the most common sites of an ischemic stroke.\n\nIn their human study, meanwhile, the researchers showed how their technique matched the \u201cgold standard\u201d of biomarker detection, known as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in 20 geriatric patients. However, the major difference was their technique took only about 10 minutes while the ELISA, which identifies a substance using color changes in a solution and antibodies, takes hours.\n\nMoving forward, Cohen and his team expect to bring their technique to clinical trials. \u201cThis [technique] addresses a key challenge in developing a point-of-care test platform for time sensitive and difficult to diagnose pathologies,\u201d the researchers concluded. The technique could eventually help to detect brain conditions outside of stroke, including concussions, dementia, cancer, and even heart disease.\n\nSource: Cohen, R, et al.
