The documents show that the Obamas\u2019 income fell to just over $436,000 in 2015, the lowest since the president took office.\n\nThe couple paid nearly $81,500 in federal income taxes, according to tax returns the White House released Friday, giving them an effective tax rate of 18.7 percent.\n\nThe Obamas reported donating $64,000 to charity \u2014 about 15 percent of their income. Their largest charitable donation, $9,000, went to the Fisher House Foundation, which assists wounded military members and their families. They also donated $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, named after Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s late son, and another $5,000 to Sidwell Friends School.\n\nThey donated money to more than 30 different charities overall, with most contributions ranging from $1,000 to $2,000.\n\nThe First Family\u2019s gradual decline in income since 2012 is largely due to decreased sales of the president\u2019s books. In 2015, President Obama made an additional $56,069 after expenses from his books, adding to his salary of nearly $400,000.\n\nLike many high-earning Americans, the Obamas had to pay an additional Medicare tax, the surtax created under the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which cost them an additional $1,766.\n\nThey also had to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax, which added $7,743 to their total tax expenses.\n\nThe Obaamas also paid $16,000 in state taxes in Illinois.\n\nThe Obamas will receive a sizeable federal tax refund this year because they overpaid what they owed the IRS by about $23,000.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 3, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama released their 2015 tax returns Friday afternoon.
