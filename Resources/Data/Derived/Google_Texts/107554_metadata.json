Why they need to follow Chuck Schumer\u2019s example and take on the issue.\n\nIf you number yourself among my longer-suffering readers, you may know that one of the occasional hobbyhorses I ride for 800 words is my immense frustration that Democrats are terrified of defending government. Oh, some of them do sometimes. But mostly they defend ends, not means. That is: They defend this or that program or policy goal, but they don\u2019t defend the vehicle that provides it, the federal government.\n\nNow you are already sitting at your whetstone, sharpening your knife, ready to instruct me in all the reasons it would be preposterous for the Democrats to do this. I know the reasons already. But they\u2019re wrong. Because look, folks: The Democrats are the party of government. It\u2019s the basic reason a person is a Democrat in the first place\u2014Democrats disagree about loads of things, but the one principle they all subscribe to is a belief that the federal government can and must intervene in the economic and social spheres to even things out. And the rejection of that belief is the basic reason a person is a Republican.\n\nSo government is the fundamental dividing line. And yet, for the past 30 years, what kind of debate about this have we had? We\u2019ve had one side relentlessly attacking government as incompetent to evil, and the other side saying nothing, being too cowed to stand up and say that government is, and does, good. Elected officials don\u2019t do it, and even the progressive political professionals don\u2019t do it.\n\nThink of this: Of all the dozens of groups out there that make up what we call the liberal infrastructure, the think thanks and interest-group nonprofits and so on, there is not a single entity whose goal is the defense of government. Given this, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that such large majorities think the government is awful, because you have the government haters telling them for three decades how awful government is and the government defenders saying nothing.\n\nThat is the real importance of Chuck Schumer\u2019s speech last week. (There appears to be no full text available online, but you can watch it here). The central message has been crowded out to some extent by Schumer\u2019s comments about how the president and the party should have concentrated on middle class economic matters before pursuing health-care reform, which other Democrats have criticized him for (and which he\u2019s said before, incidentally). If all you know about the speech is that, then you might have a negative impression of it. I implore you to watch it, because it\u2019s better than that.\n\nSchumer has been careful over the years to keep his distance from his party\u2019s liberals, although he\u2019s also not a conservative; he\u2019s a straddler. And he\u2019s not an Elizabeth Warren-style populist. And the federal government is about as popular as syphilis. So it\u2019s striking to hear Schumer say: \u201cTogether, Democrats must embrace government. It\u2019s what we believe in; it\u2019s what unites our party; and, most importantly; it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to get the middle class going again. If we run away from government, downplay it, or act as if we are embarrassed by its role, people won\u2019t vote for our pale version of the Republican view; they\u2019ll vote for the real McCoy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s even more striking to hear someone like Schumer, known for relationships with Wall Street and traditionally one of the big banks\u2019 best friends among Washington Democrats, argue that defending government means not just defending programs but using government\u2019s regulatory and even prosecutorial power to check private-sector rapacity: \u201cWe must first prove that the era of big corporate influence over government is over. Big business, big banks, big oil\u2014they may be allowed a seat at the table, but right now Americans feel that big special interests are buying the whole room and renting it out for profit. When government panders to these forces, and lobbyists and lawyers carve out ridiculous loopholes that amount to taxpayer-funded kickbacks to corporations, Americans feel that government is not working for them. When government fails to prosecute those who work in financial institutions (some of which were propped up or bailed out by the government) for what seems, on its face, blatant fraud, Americans feel that government is not working for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing stuff coming from him. But it, too, like the Obamacare business, isn\u2019t really his main point. The big idea in the speech is that Democrats have to come up with ways to show the middle class how the party will put the government to work in their behalf. I agree, but I would add that there\u2019s another, prior job, which is simply to explain to middle-class people the dozens of ways in which the federal government already helps them and their communities but about which they have no idea.\n\nThis is what infuriates me, what the Democrats and the progressive political experts have done such a pathetic job at explaining to people. There are certain things that everyone knows the government takes the lead on\u2014highways probably being the most obvious. But who cleans lakes and streams and rivers and makes them fishable and swimmable again? Who reduces smog, acid rain, lead poisoning? Who cleans up toxic waste sites? Who builds (or provides a lot of the money to build) senior citizen centers and community swimming pools and all manner of recreational facilities? Who sends millions of research and other dollars to universities and colleges across the country, from Harvard to small community colleges, pumping up local economies all over America? Who helps build convention centers and adjacent hotels so cities can attract convention business? And on and on and on and on and on. Most people go through their lives taking frequent advantage of these investments and amenities but never giving a second\u2019s thought to the idea that the government made them possible. Most of them just think that lake cleaned itself somehow over the years.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that the average American doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s that no one knows the exact extent. I once got an idea to do a big article choosing three small- to medium-size American cities more or less at random, just from different parts of the country, and trying to put a number on what the presence of the federal government in their communities meant to them. I started calling around. Oh, this will be impossible, I was told. No one keeps such numbers. You\u2019d have to call every different agency of government, and even then many of them probably won\u2019t have it broken down regionally.\n\nWell, someone damn well should collect such numbers, and that someone should make damn well sure that the people of Ocala, Florida, and St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sioux Falls, Iowa, know about every dollar. This hatred of government we see in this country is sickeningly childish and hypocritical. The rot starts from the top\u2014the appalling Republican members of Congress who voted against the 2009 stimulus and then had the audacity to go cut ribbons in their districts at venues given life because of that very stimulus bill they traduced as Satan\u2019s handiwork.\n\nBut it extends down to the millions of people who accept and applaud the right-wing rhetoric even as they suck on the government tit every day of their lives in one way or another, either without knowing it or (worse) knowing it but denying that they do because they\u2019ve stuffed their own heads full of some nonsense narrative about how tough and independent they are.\n\nThis is the fight. Government\u2019s role in people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s a fight Democrats have been, for pretty much my whole adult lifetime, utterly petrified at the thought of having to take on. But they will never be the consensus-majority party again, as they were when I was born and when Chuck Schumer was a youngster, until they do take on this fight again, and win it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201412041045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Republicans profit from Americans\u2019 childish hatred of government\u2014and Democrats lose every time by staying silent.
