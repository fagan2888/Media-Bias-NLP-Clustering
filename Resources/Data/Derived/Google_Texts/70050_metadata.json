Are those federal exchanges also state exchanges for the purposes of delivering subsidies? The Obama administration said yes, and provided those subsidies.\n\nHeck no, said the plaintiffs in the case, four Virginians who didn\u2019t want to buy subsidized insurance or pay the tax penalty for those who choose to go without. Three justices agreed with them, including Antonin Scalia, who wrote in their dissent that administration\u2019s health plan is an assault on language itself: \u201cWords no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \u2018established by the State.'\u201d\n\nThe six judges who ruled in favor of the administration\u2019s health insurance plan had a different idea:\n\nPetitioners\u2019 plain-meaning arguments are strong, but\u2026Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congress\u2019s plan, and that is the reading we adopt.\n\nThat is, American courts are asked to figure out what the words mean in the context of the whole law. And within the law, it\u2019s clear the subsidies are necessary to the other mechanisms designed to improve the insurance markets\u2014a requirement to have insurance and new rules for insurance company behavior\u2014or else the whole system will collapse in an \u201ceconomic death spiral.\u201d\n\nThat death spiral, in which insurance companies must charger higher premiums to increasingly fewer customers, was the likely outcome of a victory by the plaintiffs. It may not have helped them that opponents of the law in Congress failed to develop a convincing plan to deal with that outcome.\n\nCritics of the health care law often claim that it is un-American, but the philosophy behind this case\u2014considering the outcome of a law as well as its formal meaning\u2014is as American as Apple pie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the United States'\u00a0great jurists, famously wrote that \"the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.\" That's certainly how\u00a0a\u00a0controversial decision about the US welfare state turned today.
