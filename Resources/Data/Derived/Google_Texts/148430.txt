The percentage of Obamacare customers who say they are “very satisfied” with their health insurance coverage rose after the third open enrollment period, which ended in 2016, according to a survey released today by the Commonwealth Fund.

Nearly half of the respondents (44 percent) said they were “very satisfied” with their plans, while 38 percent reported being satisfied with their 2016 coverage. The Commonwealth Fund surveyed enrollees between February and April of this year, its fourth survey tracking the health law’s progress.

While the 44 percent of respondents who said they were very satisfied was greater than the 40 percent who said so in 2015, 45 percent said they were satisfied in 2015, compared to this year’s 38 percent.

In addition to tracking coverage satisfaction, the survey also tracks the number of people who are uninsured under Obamacare, finding that 12.7 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured. More than half of the people who gained coverage under the law, either through Medicaid expansion or the exchanges, were uninsured for more than two years previously, the report says.

“The survey findings show that Affordable Care Act coverage is making it easier for millions of Americans to get the health care they need,” Sara Collins, the vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund and lead author of the report, said in a statement. “Providing timely access to care is the fundamental purpose of insurance and in this regard the law is working well for most people who are using their plans.”
