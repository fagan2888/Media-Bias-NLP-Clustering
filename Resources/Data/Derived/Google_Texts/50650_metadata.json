Our biggest ever edition of TNW Conference is fast approaching! Join 10,000 tech leaders this May in Amsterdam. Learn more\n\nBut this is not a political post; I\u2019m not here to guess \u2014 or debate Obamacare in the comments \u2014 but bear with me: Since the drafters of the law say it was not their intent to only offer tax credits for exchanges \u201cestablished by the states,\u201d why did they write it that way?\n\nMy hunch is that it was for the same reason many of us accidentally submit the wrong version of a document: Misuse of collaboration tools in the cloud.\n\nNancy Pelosi.\n\nWhen this issue surfaced, I\u2019ll bet the conversation between the law\u2019s authors sounded a lot like this:\n\nWashington D.C. \u2013 July 2014: Rep. Nancy Pelosi: Mr. President, we are so sorry about this. Pres. Obama: What the hell happened? Four stupid words\u2026 how did you miss it? Sen. Harry Reid: Yeah. It\u2019s weird. I thought we fixed that. Pelosi: Me too! I swear I had a version that said, \u201cEstablished by the Federal Government.\u201d Obama: You totally did! I remember because then I added, \u201cin case some jerk states refuse to help their own jerk people get insurance\u201d! Pelosi: Good one, Mr. President! Obama: Hey \u2014 was it funny watching those words creep across the Google Doc? Pelosi: Very funny, sir. That\u2019s the best part of Google Docs! It was like there was a magical ghost on my screen writing jokes about republicans. Obama: Legislating should be fun, right? Reid: How come I never saw that version? Pelosi: Come on Harry \u2013 did you look in your \u201cShared with Me\u201d folder? Reid: No, just in my \u201cMy Drive.\u201d Obama: Buddy! Pelosi: Dude! Reid: Sorry! So what happened to that version? Pelosi: I didn\u2019t like what Google Docs was doing to my formatting. So I cut and pasted the whole thing into the version in Dropbox. Obama: Uh oh, this might be my bad. I also made a change to the one in Dropbox. There must\u2019ve been a conflicted copy. Pelosi: Stupid Dropbox and its stupid conflicted copies! Are you telling me that even before we blew the website, we blew the cloud collaboration? Reid: I told you we shouldn\u2019t have used Dropbox to collaborate! Obama: Hey, I emailed around the final version I was okay with. Reid: Yeah, I saw that. \u201cObamacare-not-Romneycare-FINAL.\u201d Pelosi: I thought it was, \u201cObamacare-not-Romneycare-FINALFINAL.\u201d Obama: No, I made changes after that. It was Obamacare-not-Romneycare-FINALFINALPREZVERSIONUSETHISONE.\u201d Reid: This is why we totally should have done this on OneNote. Pelosi: Again with the OneNote! What do you own Microsoft stock? I told you: The House of Representatives is the people\u2019s house, and Evernote is the people\u2019s cloud! Reid: But OneNote would\u2019ve let us track revisions and \u2013 Pelosi: People\u2019s cloud! Obama: Even Microsoft 365 would\u2019ve been way better, Nancy. Reid: I thought Microsoft 365 was an Xbox thing. Pelosi: Dude! Obama: Plus, Nancy, I feel like the Evernote logo is a little\u2026 Republicaney. Pelosi: With all due respect, Mr. President, it\u2019s a totally different elephant! I had a whole Evernote Notebook and a dozen tags dedicated to this law! I had charts on health care costs, I had Romney\u2019s law from Massachusetts \u2013 God help me, I even had Hillary\u2019s Hail Mary from 1993. She emailed me an original copy from her backup in the Carbonite cloud. Reid: \u201cCarbonite cloud\u201d sounds like where Han Solo was backed up. Obama: (ironic) Good one, Harry. Baucus: No, Mr. President, I mean \u2013 it\u2019s even got, \u201ccloud\u201d in it, like the cloud city from Empire? Obama: Yeah, I got it, Harry. Reid: Hey, Nancy, did that email from Hillary come from her personal account or a state department account? Obama: It must\u2019ve been her personal account. I don\u2019t think she ever had an official account. Reid: Isn\u2019t that weird? Obama: Eh, I\u2019m sure if it ever comes up it won\u2019t be a big deal. Reid: Yeah. Pelosi: But I sent so many Evernote chat messages. Obama: Nobody reads your Evernote chat messages! Pelosi: Why!? Reid: Nobody reads any Evernote chat messages! There\u2019s sms, Whatsapp, iMessage, Google Hangouts \u2013 I still can\u2019t figure out how to turn off those annoying chat head thingies from Facebook Messenger! Why would anyone want another chat service? Obama: Except Snapchat, of course. I think we can all agree every member of Congress could use Snapchat. Reid: Anthony Weiner could\u2019ve used Snapchat! All: [murmurs of agreement] Reid: Man, oh man, at least we know our intern-porn is safe and sound up in the iCloud. In the summer of 2014, that\u2019s the safest place for personal data; the iCloud will never be hacked! Pelosi: Wait\u2026 that\u2019s where I put the latest version of Obamacare! Obama: You mean the one where you mentioned, \u201cDeath Panels\u201d? Pelosi: That was a joke!\n\nRead Next: 11 apps and services that don\u2019t exist, but (sort of) should\n\nRead next: Here's what the Apple Watch Activity app looks like on iPhone", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the furore in Washington over the future of Obamacare, TNW columnist Pep Rosenfeld asks, was it all down to Dropbox's cloud duplicate docs feature?", "author": "Pep Rosenfeld", "og": {"site_name": "The Next Web", "description": "With the furore in Washington over the future of Obamacare, TNW columnist Pep Rosenfeld asks, was it all down to Dropbox's cloud duplicate docs feature?", "title": "Obamacare Can\u2019t Fix Cloud Collaboration", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1533, "identifier": "http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/rain-cloud-gloomy.jpg", "height": 931}, "updated_time": "2015-03-13T12:44:03+02:00", "url": "http://thenextweb.com/opinion/2015/03/13/obamacare-cant-fix-cloud-collaboration/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the furore in Washington over the future of Obamacare, TNW columnist Pep Rosenfeld asks, was it all down to Dropbox's cloud duplicate docs feature?", "creator": "@thenextweb", "label1": "Author", "image": {"src": "http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/rain-cloud-gloomy.jpg", "identifier": "http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/rain-cloud-gloomy.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare Can\u2019t Fix Cloud Collaboration", "site": "@thenextweb", "data1": "Pep Rosenfeld", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 10876852}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-13T14:00:41+02:00", "bt": {"body": "Pep Rosenfeld\u00a0is co-founder of\u00a0comedy theater\u00a0Boom Chicago\u00a0and\u00a0Boom Chicago Creative\u00a0in Amsterdam.
