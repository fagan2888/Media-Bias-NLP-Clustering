Just not ready to play for whatever reason. You end an eight-game losing streak and win one game, and you go, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re okay.\u2019 No we\u2019re not. I told them don\u2019t play their record. You have to play this team hard because they compete.\u201d\n\nFor three quarters, Philadelphia not only played harder, it played better, and led 85-77.\n\nThe Sixers (1-20) were steadying to grab their second victory of the season when they took a nine-point lead with 9:35 to play.\n\nBut the Nuggets chipped away.\n\n\u201cTo our credit, in the fourth quarter we finally got our defense into the game,\u201d Malone said.\n\nThe Nuggets outscored Philadelphia 27-15 from that point on.\n\nNelson, who had more than 100 people at the game to support him, put smiles on all of their faces when he nailed a 19-foot jump shot with 1:26 left to tie the game at 102. Seconds later, Nelson drove baseline and dropped off a pass to Danilo Gallinari for a dunk with 47.9 seconds left that gave the Nuggets the lead. It was their first lead since 5:25 of the second quarter.\n\nThey never relinquished it.\n\n\u201cWe got stops,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThat was the most important thing.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia had a chance to tie when Robert Covington took a 3-point shot with 14.8 seconds to go. He missed. Foye rebounded the basketball and was fouled.\n\nHe knocked down two at the line to put the game out of reach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with my 3-ball, but if you give me some free throws? C\u2019mon, man,\u201d Foye said. \u201cI probably took that shot over a million times. I was telling myself, \u2018It\u2019s time, you can put them away.\u2019 So I put them away.\u201d\n\nIn the process, the Nuggets put away all of the frustrations from early in the road trip with consecutive victories to end it.\n\n\u201cWe were in a bad place for about two weeks,\u201d Foye said. \u201cBut we\u2019re coming out of that.\u201d\n\nGallinari led the team with 24 points and added seven rebounds. Will Barton added 16 points from the bench and a team-high nine rebounds, and the Nuggets survived 15 made 3-pointers from Philadelphia and their own inability to make free throws (23-of-38).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start very well on the road, but we finished strong.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets rally in fourth quarter to beat the 76ers in Philadelphia", "title": "Nuggets rally in fourth quarter to beat the 76ers in Philadelphia", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/nuggets-rally-in-fourth-quarter-to-beat-the-76ers-in-philadelphia/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__b4ea83f092d3b436890f6a70670085c8p1.jpg", "height": 505}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__b4ea83f092d3b436890f6a70670085c8p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T13:47:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:16:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 If you were a Nugget from Philadelphia, or played college in the Philly area, this game was for you.\nYou have to play this team hard because they compete.\u201dFor three quarters, Philadelphia not only played harder, it played better, and led 85-77.\n\u201cI ripped our guys at halftime,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone, whose team trailed 59-52 at the break, said.\n\u201cTo our credit, in the fourth quarter we finally got our defense into the game,\u201d Malone said.\nThe Nuggets outscored Philadelphia 27-15 from that point on."}
