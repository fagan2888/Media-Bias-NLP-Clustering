Taxpayers across Texas do, too.\n\nMatt Maxfield, CEO of Seton in Harker Heights, said his hospital writes off anywhere from $2 million to $2.5 million per month in \u201cwhat we call bad debt and charity, (and) those are different numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cBad debt are those patients that come that we expect they had the means to pay their bills, but didn\u2019t. Then charity are those who go through the process of providing the information to prove that they truly meet our charity guidelines.\u201d\n\nBoth the bad debt and charity care are commonly referred to as uncompensated care, and Maxfield said Texas\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d is causing the heavy burden on hospitals and taxpayers.\n\n\u201cWhich is one of the reasons in our state, the expansion of Medicaid is so critical to ever getting reductions to hospitals for the amount of indigent care and bad debt we\u2019re providing,\u201d Maxfield said.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nAccording to the Affordable Care Act, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost of each state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, tapering down to 90 percent after 10 years.\n\nThe expansion would raise the income eligibility requirement to anyone below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. This includes expanding health coverage to individuals making less than $15,000 per year or a family of four making less than $30,000, providing about 1 million Texans with health care they otherwise would not have.\n\nMetroplex, too, is writing off millions in uncompensated care for patients who are unable, or unwilling, to pay their medical bills.\n\n\u201cUncompensated care is an issue for all hospitals,\u201d said Vickie Hill, Metroplex\u2019s director of patient financial services. \u201cThis year, Metroplex wrote off more than $7 million in unpaid debt in addition to the $23 million that met charity care qualifications. There has been an increase in numbers due to changes in eligibility requirements and health plans with higher deductibles and co-insurance.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Scott & White Healthcare said they wrote off some $34 million in indigent uncompensated care. Those who did not pay their medical bills cost Scott & White some $103 million in bad debt.\n\nCost-shift\n\nPart of the reason deductibles and co-insurance is higher in Texas is the fact that hospitals who write off millions in unpaid debt \u201ccost-shift\u201d that debt on to those Texans who have insurance, making everyone\u2019s premiums and co-pays higher.\n\n\u201cNot just in Texas, but the industry; what hospitals have done for years is, in order to offset this, we do what\u2019s called cost-shifting,\u201d Maxfield said. \u201cWe charge those who have insurance more to make up for the fact that we\u2019re not collecting from this very large percentage of patients. Here in Central Texas, particularly the Killeen, Harker Heights, Copperas Cove market, we have a large number of young adults that often go uninsured, that fall into those gaps. \u2018Hey I\u2019m healthy. I don\u2019t need coverage.\u2019 So, they just choose not to. We see a lot of that.\u201d\n\nTexas has the highest number of uninsured adults and children.\n\nDriving up premiums\n\nSoon after promises from Gov. Rick Perry and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott that Texas would opt out of expanding coverage to over 1 million adults and children who fell into the coverage gap in Texas, the Texas Hospital Association lobbied legislators hard with a series of TV and radio ads after the Supreme Court decided states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion. But if the 2014 mid-term elections were any indication \u2014 more than 9 million registered Texans did not vote \u2014 their lobbying efforts fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cUncompensated care does affect the price of premiums because the health care cost of the uninsured is covered by free care provided by the hospitals and by driving up average insurance premiums by $1,800 annually,\u201d said Carlyle Walton, CEO and president of Metroplex Health System in an email.\n\nIf not expanding Medicaid in Texas is the answer to lowering uncompensated care costs, Maxfield said Texas\u2019 new governor needs to come up with an alternative solution.\n\n\u201cI think that if that\u2019s not the answer \u2026 if the Republicans believe that the answer is not expanding Medicaid, I would go back and say what is?\u201d Maxfield said. \u201cWhat is the plan? Because right now, there is no other way to get this done. There\u2019s not another product, not another program that gets this done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "When the working poor and indigent in Texas can\u2019t pay their medical bills, who covers the costs of their care?", "title": "Uncompensated care costs high in Central Texas", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/business/uncompensated-care-costs-high-in-central-texas/article_d17e83aa-88d6-11e4-8f7c-df770a1ad5f6.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/f9/2f90a7be-d881-11e2-8329-0019bb30f31a/51c10bfea6af5.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C406", "height": 406}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "When the working poor and indigent in Texas can\u2019t pay their medical bills, who covers the costs of their care?", "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "keywords": "seton medical center harker heights,metroplex hospital,scott & white,indigent care,health care,health insurance,medicaid,patient protection and affordable care act,business,top_story", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "news_keywords": "seton medical center harker heights,metroplex hospital,scott & white,indigent care,health care,health insurance,medicaid,patient protection and affordable care act,business,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcced8\"", "article_summary": "If not expanding Medicaid in Texas is the answer to lowering uncompensated care costs, Maxfield said Texas\u2019 new governor needs to come up with an alternative solution.\nWhen the working poor and indigent in Texas can\u2019t pay their medical bills, who covers the costs of their care?\nMetroplex, too, is writing off millions in uncompensated care for patients who are unable, or unwilling, to pay their medical bills.\n\u201cUncompensated care is an issue for all hospitals,\u201d said Vickie Hill, Metroplex\u2019s director of patient financial services.\n\u201cThis year, Metroplex wrote off more than $7 million in unpaid debt in addition to the $23 million that met charity care qualifications."}
