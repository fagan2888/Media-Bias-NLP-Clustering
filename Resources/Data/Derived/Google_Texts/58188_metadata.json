Says another: \u201cIt\u2019s the gentlemen\u2019s club your wife would approve of.\u201d\n\nNYU Langone and other medical institutions have long had services devoted to women, an outgrowth of the belief that the male-dominated medical establishment had not paid enough attention to their particular needs.\n\nNow men are beginning to get equal treatment as hospitals try to take advantage of an enormous untapped market: men who, studies show, avoid doctors for virtually anything short of a bullet wound.\n\nThe new clinics offer one-stop shopping for services ranging from heart monitoring to hair removal to hormone therapy, from the life-prolonging to the life-enhancing, if medically debatable.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Health Center at the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, affiliated with Brown University, opened in 2008 and was one of the first in the nation. The Curtis D. Robinson Men\u2019s Health Institute was founded in 2010 at St. Francis Care in Hartford, Connecticut. The Iris Cantor Men\u2019s Health Center at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell opened in summer 2012, and NYU Langone\u2019s center opened six months ago.\n\nDr. Martin Miner, co-director of the Miriam men\u2019s center, had to draw up several business plans before one was approved. The initial reaction, he said, was, \u201cHealth is about men, the whole world is about men, so what do we need it for?\u201d\n\nOne focus is prostate health; the Curtis D. Robinson center, named after a black businessman in Hartford who financed much of the center\u2019s startup costs, is geared toward black men, who have a higher rate of prostate cancer than the general population.\n\nPredictably, virility treatments, including for erectile dysfunction, are also a major draw. Along with a large number of urologists, NewYork-Presbyterian\u2019s center, for example, offers Botox treatments for overactive bladders and a physical therapist who works exclusively on the pelvic area to reduce stress-related pain.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Casbah,\u201d Dr. Steven A. Kaplan, the center\u2019s director, said during a tour of the glass and gray clinic, conveying a mindset somewhere between clubby exclusivity and a pull-up-the- drawbridges fortress mentality.\n\nMEETING A NEED?\n\nBut a hazard of gender-oriented health care may be that it will lead to overtesting and overtreatment, said Dr. Steven Woloshin, a professor of community and family medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.\n\nA case in point is low-testosterone, or \u201clow T,\u201d therapy, which has turned into a small industry in recent years. It is offered in small independent clinics around the country and, now, in the New York men\u2019s health centers.\n\nSome medical authorities question whether men receiving the therapy who have no underlying medical condition are being pitched a fountain of youth, and the federal Food and Drug Administration is investigating the risk of stroke, heart attack and death in men taking testosterone products.\n\nAnother example is prostate specific antigen screening, or PSA, for prostate cancer. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against it for men without symptoms because in many cases treatment may do more harm than good. The American Urological Association has since moderated its support for the testing, saying it should be considered primarily by men ages 55 to 69.\n\nWoloshin derides low-T therapy as \u201cthe mother of all disease mongering.\u201d As for the concept of same-sex health care, he said: \u201cI think in the abstract, that\u2019s a fine idea. The thing is what they\u2019re offering. If they\u2019re focusing on low T, even prostate cancer, where the evidence is limited, they\u2019re not doing men a favor, and they may be doing harm.\u201d\n\nBoth the NYU Langone and Presbyterian clinics said they did not consider their treatments unnecessary.\n\n\u201cIf somebody has low testosterone, of course we\u2019ll treat it,\u201d said Dr. Steven Lamm, medical director of the NYU Langone center. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the endocrine abnormality.\u201d\n\nPSA screening is done based on individual factors like family history and ethnicity, Lamm said.\n\nIt is an axiom of the men\u2019s health centers that sexual dysfunction is a barometer of overall health, since it may betray causes like heart disease, diabetes and obesity.\n\nIn fact, Lamm said, treatment for erectile dysfunction was \u201cnot immensely profitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t treat it in absentia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treat it as part of their overall medical issue.\u201d\n\nThe staff at the NYU Langone center includes orthopedists, dermatologists, psychiatrists, physical therapists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists and a specialist in male fertility.\n\nLamm acknowledged the risk of overtreatment, but said: \u201cAre you creating a need or are you meeting a need? I think meeting a need \u2014 based on the longevity gap and men not taking care of themselves.\u201d\n\nHANG WITH THE GUYS\n\nThe ads for the health center revel in the retrogradeness of it all: \u201cIt\u2019s not often you get to hang with the guys, and feel better the next morning,\u201d and \u201cMen have needs too.\u201d\n\nCreating a safe place is one way of combating a documented male avoidance of doctors. A 1999 paper in The Journal of Family Practice attributed this behavior to a need to project being in control, a sense of invulnerability and a reluctance to ask for help.\n\nAnd if there were any doubt that men are generally worse than women at taking care of themselves, a study at Boston Medical Center published in 2012 put it to rest, finding that men were more likely than women to go to the emergency room within a month of being discharged from the hospital, and even more so if they were unmarried or retired, which the researchers attributed to social isolation.\n\nDoctors at the health centers are overwhelmingly male. And though they do not turn away female patients, the centers\u2019 target audience is clear.\n\nOn a recent morning, Mike Kitson, 39, a project manager for a branding company, came in to the NYU Langone clinic to have a pimple on his chest checked. He had stubbornly ignored it for eight months until a relative fell sick, making him paranoid about his own health.\n\nThe receptionist registered him biometrically by scanning his palm vein pattern, appealing to his male gadget gene and hooking him instantly.\n\nAs for the pimple, his doctor gave him a cream for psoriasis and advised him on how to get more sleep.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s kind of taken care of, so for a lazy guy like me it\u2019s very, very helpful,\u201d Kitson said. He also liked the aura of exclusivity: \u201cJust the fact that they\u2019re calling it \u2018men\u2019s health\u2019 makes it a little more inviting.\u201d\n\nMost patients said the quality of the doctors mattered at least as much as the setting.\n\n\u201cIf anything, we are proponents of coed,\u201d Peter Kornman, 61, a retired lawyer and patient at NewYork-Presbyterian\u2019s clinic, said of himself and his wife. But he conceded, \u201cFor a sexual issue, I guess I\u2019d like to talk to a man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/MENS_HEALTH_CENTERS_1-e1419954226526.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcac1\"", "article_summary": "It is offered in small independent clinics around the country and, now, in the New York men\u2019s health centers.\nThe Iris Cantor Men\u2019s Health Center at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell opened in summer 2012, and NYU Langone\u2019s center opened six months ago.\nIt is an axiom of the men\u2019s health centers that sexual dysfunction is a barometer of overall health, since it may betray causes like heart disease, diabetes and obesity.\nThe Men\u2019s Health Center at the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, affiliated with Brown University, opened in 2008 and was one of the first in the nation.\nThe Curtis D.
