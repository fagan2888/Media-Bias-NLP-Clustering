They then developed action plans and submitted them to their boards of trustees.\n\nIn 2013, the American Hospital Association (AHA) released a guide to forming meaningful partnerships between hospitals and community organizations, with particular emphasis on small and rural facilities, FierceHealthcare previously reported.
