He is wearing a burgundy scarf and a navy sweater with a red-stripe accent rather than the traditional dark suit and white shirt of the Japanese businessman.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like renting,\u201d he wrote in the website\u2019s introduction. \u201cRenting is so strict that it isn\u2019t fun. There is no blank canvas for expressing one\u2019s own personality.\u201d\n\nIt was this kind of frustration that led Mr. Aoki, now 39, to take over his father\u2019s company, Maison Aoki, in 2011 and to build one of Tokyo\u2019s most unusual rental properties, Aomame House. Construction began in spring 2013, and it officially opened to residents in March 2014.\n\nPassersby immediately notice Aomame House, which is located in a quiet residential neighborhood in western Tokyo, a 30-minute subway ride from the buzz of the city center. First they see a large community garden, which is owned by the city, and the development\u2019s own communal patio space. Behind is the eight-unit development itself, its four decorative columns rising and intertwining like magic beanstalks. (In fact, Mr. Aoki said he took inspiration for the design from beanstalks, and aomame means blue bean in Japanese.)\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan in 2011 prompted the project.\n\n\u201cAfter the earthquake, I started thinking about how it can be difficult to live alone,\u201d Mr. Aoki said. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun and convenient to live together with others. You can help each other out, and you enjoy life more that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe decided that he wanted to build the modern version of a row-house neighborhood, and to do it in Japanese cypress and cedar, rather than the more common concrete, so he could change the internal layout in the future without much difficulty.\n\nWorking with Yoshihiko Oshima, an architect with the firm Blue Studio, he eventually settled on a plan that featured a central staircase leading up from the ground floor to a plaza-style space. The apartment entrances open onto this space, so residents see one another come and go, often crossing paths when leaving for work in the morning and returning home in the evening. It has even become a popular hangout when the weather is nice.\n\nDownstairs is another communal space. Built into the patio is a long table with stools and, before moving into the building, the residents all helped to build an outdoor brick pizza oven, which they use for parties. They also planted tomatoes, herbs, blueberry bushes and other edible and ornamental plants in the space along the patio\u2019s perimeter. They work together to care for the plants, which do not belong to any one person or family.\n\n\u201cI wanted to cultivate a community,\u201d Mr. Aoki said, adding that he had been motivated by the work of Le Corbusier. \u201cThis is the smallest-sized community, but if the residents enjoy it, their happiness will spread and the entire town will improve.\u201d\n\nEach one-bedroom apartment totals about 60 square meters, or 646 square feet, spread across three floors, and the design is such that the apartments are interlocking, rather than stacks or blocks of space. For example, one family\u2019s kitchen may be directly below another\u2019s bedroom. The units\u2019 large windows look out onto the central staircase and the building\u2019s ground-level entrance. Each unit also has two balconies.\n\nMonthly rents range from 159,000 to 174,000 yen, or about $1,350 to $1,480, rates considered quite reasonable by Tokyo standards.\n\n\u201cWhen we first moved in, I would feel embarrassed because our neighbors could see into our apartment, so I was always closing the curtains,\u201d said Kenichi Okada, 34, who lives in Aomame House with his partner, Kunie Hiyamizu, 32. \u201cBut now that I know everyone I don\u2019t mind if they see me in my pajamas.\u201d\n\nMr. Okada and Ms. Hiyamizu run a business together, specializing in design and photography, and before finding Aomame House \u2014 which is now both their home and their office \u2014 they had been looking for a studio space that they could share with others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to share a house, but we wanted a shared space,\u201d Mr. Okada said. \u201cWe wanted to have a connection with the people around us.\u201d\n\nMr. Aoki, who moved into the development himself with his family, has organized events to cultivate such connections. Before construction started, he held a public festival at the site to mark its groundbreaking, with food, games and other activities.\n\nOnce construction began and all the apartments had been spoken for, he had another event for the future residents to choose the finishings for their apartments. They even painted the walls and put up wallpaper together, a concept Mr. Aoki also used at one of his other buildings, Royal Annex, which opened in 2008. Finally, just as residents were beginning to move in, they organized a market, selling food and handicrafts to 350 visitors.\n\n\u201cI always wanted this kind of life but I wasn\u2019t able to have it before,\u201d said Yukie Haguri, 36, another resident. \u201cI have become even better friends with my neighbors than I expected to. It\u2019s a big positive in my life.\u201d\n\nJust as Ms. Haguri finished speaking, Mr. Aoki\u2019s 7-year-old son, Taiga, walked past her living room window on his way home from school. It wasn\u2019t long after hearing him bound up the stairs that he burst into her apartment \u2014 the door was unlocked \u2014 with a huge smile on his face, exclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d Mr. Aoki said. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of place this is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20150129050218, "twitter": {"description": "Inspired by the country's recent natural disasters, Aomame House has common spaces designed to bring dwellers together.", "title": "Interlocking Connections in a Tokyo Rental Property", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/interlocking-connections-in-a-tokyo-rental-property.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003479655"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/30retokyo-slide-6NUW/30retokyo-slide-6NUW-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/interlocking-connections-in-a-tokyo-rental-property.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003479655", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/interlocking-connections-in-a-tokyo-rental-property.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "realestate/greathomesanddestinations", "hdl_p": "Interlocking Connections in a Tokyo Rental Property", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/greathomesanddestinations/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 29, 2015", "edt": "Global", "keywords": "Real Estate and Housing (Residential),Tokyo (Japan)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Kelly Wetherille", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/30retokyo-slide-6NUW/30retokyo-slide-6NUW-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KELLY WETHERILLE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Inspired by the country's recent natural disasters, Aomame House has common spaces designed to bring dwellers together.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/30retokyo-slide-6NUW/30retokyo-slide-6NUW-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Inspired by the country's recent natural disasters, Aomame House has common spaces designed to bring dwellers together.", "CG": "greathomesanddestinations", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 29, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/great-homes-and-destinations/index.html", "section": "Great Homes & Destinations", "modified": "2015-01-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/greathomesanddestinations/index.jsonp", "tag": "Tokyo (Japan)", "published": "2015-01-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "6DC8A6FA-BCD6-4A01-AC94-FA9BB65AC0E9"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Tokyo (Japan)", "slug": "30iht-retokyo30", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150130022622, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/interlocking-connections-in-a-tokyo-rental-property.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/30/greathomesanddestinations/30retokyo-slide-6NUW/30retokyo-slide-6NUW-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Inspired by the country's recent natural disasters, Aomame House has common spaces designed to bring dwellers together.", "title": "Interlocking Connections in a Tokyo Rental Property"}, "pdate": 20150129, "des": "Real Estate and Housing (Residential)", "articleid": 100000003479655, "cre": "International New York Times", "hdl": "Interlocking Connections in a Tokyo Rental Property", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5f5\"", "article_summary": "Passersby immediately notice Aomame House, which is located in a quiet residential neighborhood in western Tokyo, a 30-minute subway ride from the buzz of the city center.\n\u201cAfter the earthquake, I started thinking about how it can be difficult to live alone,\u201d Mr. Aoki said.\n(In fact, Mr. Aoki said he took inspiration for the design from beanstalks, and aomame means blue bean in Japanese.)\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to share a house, but we wanted a shared space,\u201d Mr. Okada said.\nThey even painted the walls and put up wallpaper together, a concept Mr. Aoki also used at one of his other buildings, Royal Annex, which opened in 2008."}
