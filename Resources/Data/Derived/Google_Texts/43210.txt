It's easier to push a pill down a cat's throat than it is to make Gov. Bentley swallow his pride and accept the financial benefits of Medicaid expansion.





Right, David Bronner?





Dr. Bronner, head of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, has been trying to shake some sense into Dr. Bentley, head of the Anti-Obamacare Systems of Alabama Politics.





Heck, several of Bentley's other defiant GOP anti-government governor brothers, including Texas' Rick Perry , are now quietly lining up to get their Medicaid money shots.





I know. That don't make it right. We should trust Gov. Bentley. He's a doctor. We're paying him big (zero) bucks to make these decisions for us.





So far he's been worth every penny.
