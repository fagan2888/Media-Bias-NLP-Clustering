Scott Walker is a likely pro-life candidate for the Republican nomination for president and he burnished those pro-life credentials today by issuing a letter saying he would sign a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks.\n\n\u201cAs the Wisconsin legislature moves forward in the coming session, further protections for mother and child are likely to come to my desk in the form of a bill to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks. I will sign that bill when it gets to my desk and support similar legislation on the federal level. I was raised to believe in the sanctity of life and I will always fight to protect it.\u201d\n\nThe position is not a new one as Walker co-sponsored legislation in 1998 while he was a member of the Wisconsin state legislature to ban abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nThe letter adds:\n\nLife is a value I learned from my parents, and it\u2019s a value I have cherished every day, predating my time in politics. My policies throughout my career have earned a 100% rating with pro-life groups in Wisconsin. Just in my first term I signed numerous pieces of pro-life legislation and I will continue working for every life. In my past four years as governor, we have made substantial progress in the fight for our pro-life values in Wisconsin. We defunded Planned Parenthood. We prohibited abortion from being covered by health plans in a health exchange. We passed legislation assuring the women and their unborn child are better protected under law \u2013 through placing stringent requirements on medical professionals and requiring the provision of thorough and vital information to the mother. I was raised to believe in the sanctity of life and I will always fight to protect it.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\n\n\nPro-life groups were delighted by Walker\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cWisconsin Right to Life is very happy to hear that Governor Walker intends to sign a bill that would protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain,\u201d stated Heather Weininger, Executive Director of Wisconsin Right to Life. \u201cIn light of this excellent news, we urge the Wisconsin State Legislature to pass a bill to protect pain-capable unborn children as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Gov. Walker signed an ultrasound bill (Senate Bill 206, also known as Sonya\u2019s Law) that ensures that women seeking abortions are given the opportunity to see their unborn children through ultrasound. The legislation also requires abortionists to have admitting privileges within thirty miles of their facility. This is the kind of pro-woman, pro-life bill that not only has proven to save the lives of unborn babies, but it has closed down abortion clinics that can\u2019t comply with basic health and safety requirements. Sure enough, abortion centers in Wisconsin closed down after Walker signed the bill into law.\n\nIn an ad during his re-election campaign, Walker put forward a clear cut pro-life message showing compassion for women and unborn children: \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind the decision of whether or not to end a pregnancy is an agonizing one. That\u2019s why I support legislation to increase safety and to provide more information for a woman considering her options.\u201d\n\nWalker has been a tireless advocate for women and unborn children, and when the bill passed, Wisconsin Right to Life applauded his efforts to protect citizens in their state.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nThe former legislative director of Wisconsin Right to Life, Susan Armacost, said \u201cWe thank Governor Walker for signing this important piece of legislation into law. Sonya\u2019s Law will empower women to make truly informed decisions regarding how they will proceed with their pregnancies and will protect the lives of women who experience complications after their abortions.\u201d\n\nSince the ultrasound bill helps protect women and provides them with more information, you would think groups like Planned Parenthood and Emily\u2019s List would support it. But instead, they oppose it and say it causes undue burden for women seeking abortions. This is because abortion businesses lose money when women change their mind about abortion. And since 78% of women who see an ultrasound of their unborn baby refuse abortion, its really bad for business.\n\nSince Governor Walker took office in January 2011, the pro-life movement in Wisconsin has made monumental gains. Walker signed into law a state budget that included a provision to prohibit the UW Hospital Authority from being involved in performing abortions and from using taxpayer dollars to pay medical students to learn how to perform abortions. Walker steered Wisconsin Well Woman funds to local counties instead of Planned Parenthood.\n\nGovernor Walker also signed bills that allow Wisconsin to opt out of abortion funding under Obamacare, to protect pregnant women from coerced abortions and to prohibit RU486 chemical web cam abortions.\n\nUltimately, Walker and his record will appeal to pro-life Republicans looking for a replacement for Obama, who has been called the Abortion President.\n\nAs Armacost said: \u201cGovernor Walker\u2019s deep belief in the sanctity of all human life is evident in the courageous actions he has taken to build a culture of life in Wisconsin. His concern for the most vulnerable members of the human family is reflected in the common sense and compassionate laws he has signed into law. Those initiatives will greatly benefit unborn children, women who are considering abortion and taxpayers of our state.\u201d\n\nPro-life voters can also be assured that Governor Walker is an effective pro-life governor \u2014 after all, abortion activists wished he were dead. But he and his prospects for 2016 are very much alive.\n\nWisconsin Right to Life provided LifeNews with a lengthy dossier on Walker\u2019s pro-life record, including votes while he was a member of the state legislature:\n\nAbortion Funding: As an Assembly Representative, Walker voted against taxpayer funding of abortions for public employees.
