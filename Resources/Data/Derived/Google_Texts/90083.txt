A Panama City Beach man is in critical condition after a car accident Sunday afternoon.

According to Florida Highway Patrol reports, 60-year-old Michael Barrow was driving his 2012 Honda Accord southbound on State Road 79 Sunday afternoon when officials say he traveled onto the center median.

Barrow then traveled 1,100 feet before crossing the northbound lanes and onto the east shoulder of State Road 79.

The driver then traveled south on the east shoulder and struck a culvert, and then began hitting a guy-wire.

The front of the car struck a tree, and then overturned.

Barrow was taken to Bay Medical Center.
