Maybe so, Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said on Monday.\n\n\u201cEspecially with Nate (Robinson) out and Randy (Foye) out, we don\u2019t have another guy to get us into our offense and run things for us,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s something as an organization that we\u2019re going to have to think about \u2013 having another point guard or adding another point guard or something to our roster where, because if anything happens to Ty (Lawson), we\u2019re in trouble. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nThere is little-to-no playmaking when Lawson hits the bench, and that has increasingly been a problem for the Nuggets, who haven\u2019t been able to maintain offensive efficiency when Lawson rests.\n\nThe situation isn\u2019t as dire as last season during the suspension of then-Nuggets reserve guard Andre Miller. While Miller was out, Lawson got injured and the Nuggets, who didn\u2019t have a third point guard on the roster, had no one to turn to.\n\nThere are other ball-handlers, but the Nuggets\u2019 two main reserve ball-handlers, Foye and Robinson, are out with injuries. That has left Shaw with basically two options off the bench to run the show when Lawson sits: rookies Gary Harris and Erick Green.\n\nAnd, well, they\u2019re rookies. Up-and-down play is to be expected.\n\nFoye is not due back for at least another week, if not two, and Robinson took a knee to the back so hard that it bruised his spine. He\u2019s day-to-day, but it\u2019s not an easy injury to work through.\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 issues at backup guard would be given a respite with the return of those two veterans. But until then?\n\n\u201cI have to hold my breath a lot of times when I take (Lawson) out of the games,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cHe has to get some rest at some point. I think (on Sunday) when I took him out, whatever we were down, I think the lead doubled almost during the time that I was able to get him out of the game and get some rest for him.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brian Shaw wonders if Nuggets need to add another point guard", "title": "Brian Shaw wonders if Nuggets need to add another point guard", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/08/brian-shaw-wonders-if-nuggets-need-to-add-another-point-guard/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141208__10b9004a75a9252f670f6a7067006482p1.jpg", "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141208__10b9004a75a9252f670f6a7067006482p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-08T17:32:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:48:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TORONTO \u2014 Do the Nuggets need help at reserve point guard?\nThe situation isn\u2019t as dire as last season during the suspension of then-Nuggets reserve guard Andre Miller.\nWhile Miller was out, Lawson got injured and the Nuggets, who didn\u2019t have a third point guard on the roster, had no one to turn to.\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s something as an organization that we\u2019re going to have to think about \u2013 having another point guard or adding another point guard or something to our roster where, because if anything happens to Ty (Lawson), we\u2019re in trouble.\nFoye is not due back for at least another week, if not two, and Robinson took a knee to the back so hard that it bruised his spine."}
