(Photography by Jeffrey MacMillan, drawings by Julian MacMillan/For Capital Business)\n\nThe regional economic recovery continued its crawl forward in 2013 in the face of some serious challenges, as automatic federal spending cuts created a broad sense of uncertainty that made many local employers think twice about adding workers or chasing new opportunities.\n\nWill 2014 be any different?\n\nCapital Business asked more than a dozen local leaders and thinkers \u2014 economists, executives, a college president and others \u2014 to look into their crystal balls and predict how the Washington area economy will look by the end of this year.\n\nThe forecasters brought a variety of perspectives to the table, but most came to a similar big-picture conclusion: 2014 is not likely to be a blockbuster year for growth, but it is likely to be a sunnier year than 2013.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be good, but it will be better,\u201d said James Dinegar, chief executive of the Greater Washington Board of Trade.\n\nMany of the analysts pointed to recent action on Capitol Hill as a key development for boosting the local economy. Congress has reached a deal that would fund the federal government through 2015 and would prevent another round of across-the-board sequestration cuts from going into effect. \u00b6 As a result of that deal, \u201cthe constraints that have held the economy back in \u201913 are going to be neutralized,\u201d said Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University.\n\nEach forecaster was asked to give us a reading on where they thought several key economic indicators would end up later this year. They also offered up their insights for the sectors, policymakers and trends to watch as we try to make sense of how the economic recovery is faring.\n\nAnirban Basu\n\nChief executive, Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore economic consulting firm\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +24,400 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C. (October 2014): 8.2%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md. (October 2014): 6.3%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va. (October 2014): 5.1%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 2.4%.\n\nMedian home price in D.C. metro area: $423,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,860.\n\nWhen it comes to shaping the health of both the regional and national economies next year, Basu will have a close eye on the policymakers at the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the most important person in 2014 is Janet Yellen,\u201d Basu said, referring to President Obama\u2019s nominee to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as the central bank\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe Fed recently decided to scale back its multibillion-dollar stimulus program, which aimed to drive down long-term interest rates. But the Fed did not offer any concrete timeline or pace for its drawdown. Basu said this uncertainty could cause lenders to be skittish about offering low interest rates.\n\n\u201cHigher interest rates would also impact the housing sector, the auto sector and the stock market. And all three of those things have been major drivers of America\u2019s recent economic resurgence,\u201d Basu said.\n\nJames Bohnaker\n\nEconomist, Moody\u2019s Analytics, a credit and economic research firm\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +50,000 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.2%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.0%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.2%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 3.2%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $405,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,820.\n\nWhile government contractors are likely to see the most direct benefit from recent agreement around the federal budget, Bohnaker predicts this climate will also give a boost to other sectors. He is especially optimistic about growth at small and mid-size firms in the region\u2019s technology industry.\n\n\u201cMore of those businesses will be either comfortable starting up or expanding,\u201d Bohnaker said.\n\nKathleen Walsh Carr\n\nPresident, Cardinal Bank\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +20,000 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.4%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.4%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.6%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 2.0%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $380,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,750.\n\nCarr said she\u2019s heard from many investment managers that the stock market might see a bit of a course correction this year after rocketing upward in 2013.\n\nAs for what that means to local investors, Carr said,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to be a market timer. But what you do find, looking at this market, you\u2019re better off to be invested than not invested, even with a market correction.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, Carr said, \u201cIn the long run, the fundamentals of the businesses are very, very good,\u201d Carr said.\n\nCarr is upbeat about the regional economy in 2014, though she expects it will be challenging to bring down the stubbornly high unemployment rate in the urban core.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a structural problem in the District,\u201d Carr said.\n\nJames C. Dinegar\n\nChief executive, Greater Washington Board of Trade\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +37,500 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 7.8%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.0%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 4.9%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 3.6%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $395,000.\n\nS&P 500: 2,000.\n\nTo explain the current mind-set of Washington area consumers, Dinegar recalls the lessons of a book called \u201cAnimal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism\u201d by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller.\n\n\u201cIt was all about the emotion and the feeling, \u2018Are we in a recovery?\u2019 And I think people are beginning to feel like we\u2019re in the recovery,\u201d Dinegar said.\n\nThat psychological boost, he said, could translate into greater business growth and increased consumer spending.\n\nDinegar said that the opening of the Silver Line holds enormous economic promise for Northern Virginia this year.\n\n\u201cTysons will be even more of a boomtown than it has been,\u201d Dinegar said.\n\nStephen Fuller\n\nDirector, Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +58,500 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.1%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.0%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va. (October 2014): 5.2%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 2.65%.\n\nMedian home price for metro area: $391,000.\n\nS&P 500: 2,055.\n\nFuller predicts that one industry will give the region\u2019s job growth a major lift in 2014.\n\n\u201cHomebuilding is going to be the principle difference,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nHe expects between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs will be added in the construction sector next year. He forecasts those jobs will come as local builders continue the burst of multifamily properties that the region has seen in recent years. But Fuller also predicts there will be a renewed strength in single-family home construction that could help fuel job growth in this industry.\n\nHis not-so-good news for the local labor market?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any big spurts other than in construction,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nBarbara Krumsiek\n\nPresident and chief ex ecutive, Calvert Investments, which provides mutual funds that invest in socially and environmentally responsible companies.\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +25,000 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.7%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.5%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.6%.\n\nGross regional product growth for the year: 2.5%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $432,000.\n\nS&P 500: 2,000.\n\n\u201cThe small investor finally came back in strong numbers in 2013,\u201d Krumsiek said. \u201cAnd I think looking at these returns, as long as we can keep a fairly steady growth, I think investors will stay committed to the stock market.\u201d\n\nKrumsiek predicts energy and industrial stocks, especially, will fare well in 2014.\n\nIn the bond market, however, Krumsiek said the tenor could be different. She said she already sees skittishness among investors, a development that likely reflects the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to begin pulling back on its stimulus program.\n\nBarbara Lang\n\nChief executive, D.C. Chamber of Commerce\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +24,000.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 9.1%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.4%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.3%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 3.0%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $425,000.\n\nS&P 500: NA.\n\nLang forecasts that the District\u2019s unemployment rate will shoot back up over 9 percent, a prediction that she has made based on the D.C. Council\u2019s recent approval of a minimum wage hike.\n\n\u201cI think this will hurt the city very badly,\u201d Lang said.\n\nLang agrees the wage floor should be increased, but believes the $11.50 per hour level the council settled on is too high. She worries that the increase will prompt more Virginia and Maryland residents to look for work in the city in 2014, thereby making the job market more competitive for District residents.\n\nIf that happens, \u201cthey start to hurt the very population they tried to help,\u201d Lang said.\n\nGregory H. Leisch\n\nChief executive, Delta Associates, a real estate analysis firm\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +42,000.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.5%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.5%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.5%.\n\nGross regional product growth for the year: 2.6%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $420,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,920.\n\nLeisch predicts the Washington area housing market will continue to improve in 2014, with prices rising modestly.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of pent-up demand, especially on the condo side, where we\u2019ve had a dramatic underproduction,\u201d Leisch said.\n\nLeisch also said local renters are likely to see lower prices this year.\n\n\u201cIn terms of production, it\u2019s no secret that the apartment market is overbuilt. We have way too much in the pipeline,\u201d Leisch said.\n\nLeisch said he expects developers to complete 12,000 to 18,000 apartment units in 2014, but said the market only has appetite for about 7,500 units.\n\nCatherine Meloy\n\nChief executive, Goodwill of Greater Washington, a nonprofit focused on education and employment\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +23,000 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.4%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.2%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.4%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 2.37%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $410,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,900.\n\nEven as she predicts the region will see modest job growth, Meloy worries the labor market will still look bleak to many Washingtonians, especially low-wage workers.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the people who will be without jobs are those people who do not have the skill set currently to get entry-level positions,\u201d Meloy said.\n\nOver the next 15 to 18 months, Meloy expects some of the greatest employment opportunities for these people will be in the leisure and hospitality sector, and accordingly, her organization is especially focused on providing job training for this industry.\n\nMark Muro\n\nDirector of policy for the Metropolitan Policy Program at the think tank Brookings Institution\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +26,000 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.5%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.3%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.4%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 2.6%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $400,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,700.\n\nMuro forecasted that the region will see some of its most exciting economic developments in its urban core, as the District develops what he called an \u201cauthentic start-up culture.\u201d A prime example of this, Muro said, is the 1776 incubator in downtown Washington.\n\n\u201cWashington\u2019s emerging as a more urban economic center. So it\u2019s not just going to be the Tysons Corner, Montgomery County, Route 270 biotech story. I would predict we\u2019ll see at least a couple large-size IPOs that stand up nationally and generate attention, and they will likely be city-based companies.\u201d\n\nRobert Peck\n\nDirector of Consulting for the Southeast Region at the architecture firm Gensler\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +40,000 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.4%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.5%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.1%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 3.1%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $420,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,550.\n\nPeck does not expect 2014 to be a booming year for the local commercial real estate industry. The District and Northern Virginia, in particular, he said, face less demand for office space.\n\nIn an era of telecommuting and hotel-style work set-ups, \u201ceven if the economy expands by 3.1 percent, what\u2019s happening is people are not taking more space,\u201d Peck said.\n\nInstead, Peck expects many companies will look to reposition the real estate they already have, renovating or redesigning it to meet the needs of their workforce.\n\nDeRionne P. Pollard\n\nPresident, Montgomery College, a community college with campuses in Germantown, Rockville and Takoma Park.\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +21,300 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.3%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.2%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.1%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: under 3%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $430,000.\n\nS&P 500: 2,000.\n\nPollard will be watching this year to see how the economy feels at a hyper-local level.\n\n\u201cAs someone who lives in Montgomery County, I\u2019m very concerned about two Montgomeries that may start to emerge,\u201d Pollard said.\n\nWhile the county is home to some of the richest ZIP codes in the nation, Pollard says that is masking some of the county\u2019s poverty issues. Pollard said some students at Montgomery College are homeless, and many are eating at the school\u2019s on-campus food pantries.\n\nFrom a legislative perspective, Pollard doesn\u2019t expect to see any major initiatives in 2014 that would affect the local economy.\n\nBecause it is an election year, \u201cMany of our elected officials will not want to rock the boat too much,\u201d Pollard said.\n\nPaul Villella\n\nChief executive of HireStrategy, a Reston-based staffing firm\n\nYear-over-year metro area job growth: +17,500 jobs.\n\nUnemployment rate for D.C.: 8.7%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Md.: 6.2%.\n\nUnemployment rate for Va.: 5.5%.\n\nGross regional\n\nproduct growth for the year: 3.5%.\n\nMedian home price for D.C. metro area: $420,000.\n\nS&P 500: 1,850.\n\nAmong his clients, Villella said he already has seen a bit of a jump in compensation for highly-skilled workers in the second half of 2013.\n\n\u201cOn average, I do think we\u2019ll see that sort of wage pressure increase in 2014,\u201d Villella said, as the competition for top talent further heats up.\n\nVillella also has an eye on the Affordable Care Act and how it might affect businesses this year. If their health care costs increase, Villella says it could cause some employers to rethink their benefits offerings and pass off more costs to employees.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "capbizhero, dc economy in 2014, economic predictions 2014, dc area economy 2014, washington area economy, washington area economy forecasts, dc area economy forecasts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "One thing local business leaders and thinkers agree on?
