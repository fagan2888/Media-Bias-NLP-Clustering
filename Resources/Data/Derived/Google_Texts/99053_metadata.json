Gay-straight alliances (GSAs) in some Canadian schools could be going a step further, though, by promoting tolerance and creating bonds that ultimately lead to safer school environments and a reduced number of suicide attempts. The best part: A new study shows that they work.\n\nLed entirely by students, GSAs encourage anyone who identifies as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) heterosexual, or questioning to join. Their goal is to make schools a safe environment for everyone. About one in four students say that they\u2019ve been bullied at school and even fewer have been cyberbullied, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). LGBTQ youth, however, are at a heightened risk for any type of bullying, and about 55.2 percent say that they have been bullied online.\n\n\u201cWe know that LGBTQ students are at a higher risk for suicide, in part because they are more often targeted for bullying and discrimination,\u201d said Elizabeth Saewyc, lead author of the study and professor at the University of British Columbia School of Nursing, in a press release. \u201cBut heterosexual students can also be the target of homophobic bullying. When policies and supportive programs like GSAs are in place long enough to change the environment of the school, it\u2019s better for students\u2019 mental health, no matter what their orientation.\u201d\n\nThe study looked at more than 21,000 students in grades eight through 12, and involved students who went to schools that had instituted anti-homophobic bullying policies, GSA\u2019s, or neither. In schools with GSAs, discrimination toward LGBTQ students fell by more than half. Heterosexual students also experienced less discrimination, and boys were half as likely to attempt suicide. Schools with anti-bullying policies in place also saw a reduction in suicide thoughts and attempts \u2014 more than 70 percent for boys and about 66 percent for girls.\n\nThe findings, which were published in the International Journal of Child, Youth, and Family Studies, offer a potential solution to LGBTQ discrimination, especially as it continues to capture attention in the U.S. Despite bullying legislation in 49 states, 70.6 percent of students and 70.4 percent of school staff report that they\u2019ve seen someone being bullied, according to the HHS. Current prevention strategies look to parents, school staff, and the community to encourage acceptance, tolerance, and respect.\n\nChildren who are bullied must overcome challenges beyond suicidal thoughts. A recent report found that about 90,000 children visit the emergency room each year due to bullying injuries. Aside from that, studies have also found that they\u2019re more likely to smoke, develop psychiatric disorders, or become physically ill. But putting an end to bullying isn't only about helping the victims. Studies have also shown that bullies themselves are three times more likely to suffer depression and anxiety. Therefore, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to instill respect, acceptance, and tolerance.\n\nSource: Saewyc E, Konishi C, Rose H, Homma Y.
