They\u2019ll soon be asked, too, whether religious nonprofits have to provide contraception in employee health plans, a follow-up to last spring\u2019s Hobby Lobby case.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd there is a third, very long-shot issue in the wings: whether the health care legislation was a tax bill that under the Constitution had to start in the House of Representatives instead of the Senate.\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\nThe cases are merely the top of a pile of Obamacare-related litigation in courts around the country. The legal fights just keep growing, more than four years after the law was passed, more than two years after the Supreme Court issued its landmark June 2012 decision upholding the unpopular individual mandate and more than a year after millions of Americans started signing up for the health benefits.\n\nMost of the lawsuits stand little chance of seriously damaging the health law, let alone killing it.\n\nThe exception \u2014 the challenges over the subsidies, or tax credits \u2014 could strike at a core tool for expanding insurance coverage to millions of people who got subsidized coverage through HealthCare.gov when their governors would not or could not run a state exchange. That set of cases is often referred to as \u201cHalbig,\u201d after one of the plaintiffs. The legal argument was once seen as a fringe issue, a last gasp of opposition. But now, if the Supreme Court takes up the issue, it would represent a serious legal challenge to President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic legislation.\n\n( PHOTOS: Hobby Lobby protests)\n\nOther cases now working their way through the courts take on everything from the employer mandate to a Medicare spending board to deciding who is responsible for Oregon\u2019s failed exchange.\n\nOn the subsidies case, the challengers say that the exact wording of two parts of the law makes clear that subsidies are only allowed to go to residents of states with state-based exchanges. Obamacare backers say a thorough reading of the entire law makes clear that anyone can get subsidies, even if they live in a state that is using the federal exchange.\n\nLower courts have split, with two circuit courts memorably ruling opposite ways on the issue within a few hours. That kind of circuit split is typically a lock for getting strong consideration by the justices. But one of the courts \u2014 the D.C. Circuit, which ruled against the Obama administration \u2014 recently agreed to hear the case again in a rare en banc hearing.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: White House loses Obamacare ruling)\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that the second hearing, which includes all of the court\u2019s judges, not just the three who heard the case originally, will go for the Obama administration.\n\nBut the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t have to wait for the en banc hearing in December and a decision likely months later. The plaintiffs that lost in the other case, which went through the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, have already asked the justices to weigh in.\n\nMichael Carvin, the attorney representing the challengers, says he doubts that four Supreme Court justices will care what the D.C. Circuit \u2014 which is packed with Obama-appointed judges, he says \u2014 thinks about the case.\n\n\u201cI think the calculus among the justices up there will be if the D.C. Circuit, particularly along strictly partisan lines, agrees with the Obama administration, is that really going to affect our view of the underlying issue? If we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true, we might as well take the 4th Circuit case now and decide it,\u201d Carvin said last week at a Supreme Court event hosted by The Heritage Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Justices are asked to weigh in on whether subsidies can go to any American.", "title": "Obamacare and SCOTUS, the sequel?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/obamacare-supreme-court-111536.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/30/140630_scotus_decision_runner_js_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Supreme Court,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Justices are asked to weigh in on whether subsidies can go to any American.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bee\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. Supreme Court will begin its new term Monday and, once again, Obamacare could be on the docket.\nMichael Carvin, the attorney representing the challengers, says he doubts that four Supreme Court justices will care what the D.C.\n| John Shinkle/POLITICO Obamacare and SCOTUS, the sequel?\nBut the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t have to wait for the en banc hearing in December and a decision likely months later.\nLower courts have split, with two circuit courts memorably ruling opposite ways on the issue within a few hours."}
