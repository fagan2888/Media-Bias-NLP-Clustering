Maggie Hassan\u2019s signature legislative achievements.\n\nClick to watch News 9's report.\n\n\n\nMedicaid expansion is on the chopping block, potentially cutting access to health care for 39,000 residents.\n\nRepublicans are looking to cut approximately $240 million from the governor\u2019s proposed budget. They said $180 million of that would come out of the Department of Health and Human Services. A number of big cuts are being made in addition to allowing Medicaid expansion, known as the New Hampshire Health Protection Program, to expire.\n\nRepublicans voted in committee to allow the expansion to lapse at the end of 2016.\n\n\u201cIt will not be in the House budget. The people of New Hampshire do not like the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. We were elected to represent that position, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not going to be in there,\u201d said Rep. Neal Kurk, R-Weare.\n\n\u201cThat means about 39,000 people will lose health insurance, and that will be devastating to those families,\u201d said Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, D-Concord.\n\nDemocrats are decrying a number of proposed reductions in the HHS budget: Meals on Wheels, the Sununu Youth Services Center and homeless shelters.\n\nAlthough they helped elect the current speaker of the House, Democrats said the cuts are being tailored to win the support of conservatives still smarting from that defeat.\n\n\u201cI think part of the issue is how do the Republicans get their budget pass?\u201d said Rep. Sharon Nordgren, D-Hanover.\n\nRepublicans said it\u2019s purely about the money.\n\n\u201cThe governor had unrealistic and excessive revenue estimates,\u201d said Dan McGuire, R-Epsom.\n\nHassan disputed that claim, saying revenues are on track and Medicaid expansion should stay in the budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the rate of uninsured at our hospitals and our health care providers go down. We\u2019ve seen increased access to preventative and primary care, a healthier workforce, a creation of jobs and a strengthening of our economy,\u201d Hassan said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 23:28:23 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Adam Sexton", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "New Hampshire House Republicans are taking steps to dismantle one of Gov.
