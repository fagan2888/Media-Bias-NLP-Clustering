(Photo: Kimley-Horn and Associates )\n\nAfter years of planning, Spring Hill officials on Friday will break ground on Port Royal Park and Fire Station No. 2, two of the city\u2019s biggest construction projects in years.\n\nPort Royal Park, to be the city\u2019s largest park, will be built on 31 acres in the southeast part of the city, adjacent to the Deerfield subdivision. The $4.7 million project will be done in two phases. It will include football and soccer fields, a splash pad, a greenway path, sidewalks, playground, pavilions, basketball and tennis courts and a building for concessions and restrooms. On the grounds of the new park, Fire Station No. 2 will be built after years in which firefighters have worked out of a renovated house at 4237 Port Royal Road. The project is estimated to cost $2,025,000.\n\nThe public is invited to the ground-breaking ceremony, hosted by the Spring Hill Parks and Recreation Commission and the Spring Hill Fire Department, at 5 p.m. on the park site.\n\nReach Jamie Page at 615-771-5460 and on Twitter @JamiePage101.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1mHn6Vw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Port Royal Park and Fire Station No. 2 ar among city\u2019s major construction projects", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Port Royal Park and Fire Station No. 2 ar among city\u2019s major construction projects", "title": "Spring Hill set to break ground on fire station, park", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/spring-hill/2014/06/01/spring-hill-break-ground-park-fire-station/9852569/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Port Royal Park and Fire Station No. 2 ar among city\u2019s major construction projects", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07f3d9f8abb30a8286a2449b8cb82580a7c16dbd/c=0-214-1360-1574&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg", "title": "Spring Hill set to break ground on fire station, park", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/williamson/spring-hill", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09b8692a150d89d2a79aebee55525a9f7ac229de/c=10-0-1350-1787/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a3c200a74d78c9d8b79a8278bedb90f59fd8db1/c=0-214-1360-1574/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e2030d7367d785dc4aeb5b2df43835792088ea9/c=0-384-1360-1404/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b1dfc5d40634c33adfd9c9a5374fa84882bbc81/c=0-511-1360-1276&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-01T20:47:27-05:00", "shorthed": "Spring Hill to start two projects", "articleid": 9852569, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b65e3efeee7e4d9f468bf86eab4219c04e59c4a3/c=0-511-1360-1276/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/012d10295cba1feb4679d2de4b7b0e26a6cffbf8/c=178-0-1183-1787/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/06/01/portroyalpark.jpg"}, "author": "Jamie Page", "title": "Spring Hill set to break ground on fire station, park", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "port royal park, fire station, groundbreaking, spring hill, break, ground, construction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9745\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Kimley-Horn and Associates )After years of planning, Spring Hill officials on Friday will break ground on Port Royal Park and Fire Station No.\nThe public is invited to the ground-breaking ceremony, hosted by the Spring Hill Parks and Recreation Commission and the Spring Hill Fire Department, at 5 p.m. on the park site.\nPort Royal Park, to be the city\u2019s largest park, will be built on 31 acres in the southeast part of the city, adjacent to the Deerfield subdivision.\nA concept drawing from the Port Royal Park master plan shows sports fields, a splash pad, basketball courts, walking paths, concessions/restroom building and a fire station.\n2 will be built after years in which firefighters have worked out of a renovated house at 4237 Port Royal Road."}
