If the question of how the Affordable Care Act will affect your personal healthcare situation worries you, Arcadian Telepsychiatry and Connect2Docs have an answer. Together, both companies offer a service to assist businesses, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and individuals.

Connect2Docs is a compliment to health insurance and is designed to make healthcare more affordable, efficient, and on-demand. They offer telemedicine services to members 24 hours, 7 days a week with licensed physicians and board-certified specialists. Connect2Docs also offers a proprietary discount drug card program, annual health and wellness test and medical negotiations and much more.

Arcadian Telepsychiatry's service allows mental health providers to reach under-served areas, reduce travel times and expenses, and improve collaboration between providers, families and the patient. Via video conferencing, the mental health provider can diagnose and assess the patient, prescribe and monitor medication, provide individual, group and family therapy and additional mental health services.

"Trained clinicians are a scarce resource, especially in emergency, rural, and under-served settings. This partnership will allow more patients access to critical mental health services when they need them. Many community mental health clinics cannot afford to hire a full-time psychiatrist. However, they still have a need for on-demand, psychiatric service and that is where we can help," states Robert Plotkin, President and CEO of Arcadian Telepsychiatry.

Chuck Hockett co-founder of Connect2Docs stated "We have agents throughout the U.S. and we were getting requests from hospitals, assisted living centers, prison systems and various institutions for telepsychiatry services. After an extensive search we pleased to announce our partnership with Arcadian Telepsychiatry Service. This partnership with Arcadian fits well with the Connect2Docs core value of providing quality, convenient, affordable access to healthcare because Arcadian has demonstrated those values".
