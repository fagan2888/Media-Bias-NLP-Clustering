It was 100 percent contained just before 4 p.m., according to the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nRight after the early afternoon crash, lanes of the interstate were intermittently closed as crews battled the fire. A photo from the scene, taken by the State Patrol, showed the grass fire creeping up to the roadway\u2019s edge.\n\nHelicopter drops on the fire were halted after firefighters gained an upper hand.\n\nA response crew transferred fuel from the damaged tanker to a replacement tanker. All lanes but one reopened in the area at about 3:30 p.m., according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The final lane reopened about 6:40 p.m.\n\nAuthorities had encouraged motorists traveling between Denver and Colorado Springs to seek alternate routes.\n\nThe State Patrol said the tanker melted in half. The driver was able to escape unharmed, troopers said.\n\nThe Tri-Lake Fire Department in Monument fought the blaze and called in air support. South Metro Fire Rescue Authority assisted Tri-Lake fire with the incident.\n\n\u201c(The) tanker did not roll over, but (it) looks to have had a mechanical failure,\u201d the State Patrol\u2019s Castle Rock office said in a tweet.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tanker fire south of Castle Rock ignites 250-acre grass blaze; I-25 reopen after delays", "title": "Tanker fire south of Castle Rock ignites 250-acre grass blaze; I-25 reopen after delays", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/26/tanker-fire-south-of-castle-rock-ignites-250-acre-grass-blaze-i-25-reopen-after-delays/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150826_013644_twitter.com-CNW1esCUsAAP1H0.jpg", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150826_013644_twitter.com-CNW1esCUsAAP1H0.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-26T13:36:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:17:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0977\"", "article_summary": "A photo from the scene, taken by the State Patrol, showed the grass fire creeping up to the roadway\u2019s edge.\nIt was 100 percent contained just before 4 p.m., according to the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nThe State Patrol said the tanker melted in half.\nAll lanes but one reopened in the area at about 3:30 p.m., according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\u201c(The) tanker did not roll over, but (it) looks to have had a mechanical failure,\u201d the State Patrol\u2019s Castle Rock office said in a tweet."}
