If Crowe were a character in his own film, the fiasco of \u201cAloha,\u201d and nearly all of his post-\u201cAlmost Famous\u201d movies, would provide the perfect intro.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cAloha\u201d is not part of some larger redemption narrative for Crowe (at least not yet). It\u2019s just another fascinating mess from an earnest and occasionally excellent filmmaker who can\u2019t seem to recreate the enveloping magic and charm of his earlier films. It\u2019s an unfair standard for anyone, but it\u2019s hard not to hope for the best from Crowe, even if his past few films have taught us otherwise.\n\n\u201cAloha\u201d was cut off at its knees from the start as one of the unwitting victims of criticism from sharp-toothed executives in last year\u2019s Sony hack, leaving Crowe fans wondering just how bad the film could be. After all, he had a charming, of-the-moment cast, a compelling-on-paper story about a man reconnecting with a longtime ex while also falling for a pretty young thing and an idyllic location to work with.\n\nAnd yet in execution, \u201cAloha\u201d is a meandering, needlessly confusing cacophony of story, performance, and spiritual blather. Not only does it feel inauthentic, it\u2019s often downright alien.\n\nThe story, briefly, is about the once idealistic Brian (Bradley Cooper) who sold his soul to a military contractor (a nearly comatose Bill Murray) and has returned to Hawaii for a job. There, he\u2019s forced to revisit his failed relationship with Tracy (Rachel McAdams), who\u2019s since had two kids and married a man of few words (John Krasinski). He\u2019s also been tethered to the bizarre Air Force pilot/potential love interest Allison Ng (Emma Stone).\n\nHow something that straightforward goes astray is a bit of a mystery. Crowe packs every moment with so many words, but very little coherent information. The discomfort of not knowing what\u2019s going on rots the overall experience, especially when the odd satellite defense subplot takes over. It sometimes feels like half the movie is missing.\n\nAt one point, probably 30 minutes in, Brian and Ng are together, going somewhere. The two characters talk and bicker at rapid speed. But they\u2019re not really talking to each other, at least in the way that any human might understand conversation to work with another human. It\u2019s all cute turns of phrase and non-sequiturs. By the time they get to their destination - a settlement of native Hawaiians who want sovereignty - you\u2019ve fully forgotten, or perhaps never understood, why exactly they are there. And it only gets more jumbled.\n\nPart of the problem is Ng. Crowe has a knack for writing good female characters - Tracy comes pretty close - but the childlike Ng is not a person who has or will ever exist. The usually wonderful Stone, in a rare misstep, is lost here as the one-quarter Hawaiian F-22 pilot who calls Brian \u201csir\u201d even after they\u2019ve started to fall for each other. She speaks in a clipped, grating staccato that\u2019s only ever softened when waxing poetic about her Hawaiian heritage and the spirituality of a clear sky. Her quirks are meant to charm. Unfortunately they have the opposite effect.\n\nThere are some lovely moments of humor and depth that do succeed - including a long-lead joke that is used to brilliant effect in one of the final scenes. McAdams and Cooper also have wonderful chemistry and a deeply felt wistfulness over their romantic past. Their scenes together are the film\u2019s rare bright spot and a reminder of Crowe\u2019s unique strength as an idiosyncratic voice.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough, though. \u201cAloha\u201d either needed more focus or more time to say what it wanted to say. But perhaps this is the earnest failure Crowe needs to get back in gear.\n\n\u201cAloha,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201csome language including suggestive comments.\u201d Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.
