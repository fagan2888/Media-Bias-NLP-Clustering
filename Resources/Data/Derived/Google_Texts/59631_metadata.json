I do believe that,' she said in an interview with The Times Magazine.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nJune and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as Pistorius could be out in 10 months\n\n'I wasn't happy with the sentence at all. I don't think that was justice for Reeva at all.'\n\nThey have a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot.\n\n'Both of us are haunted by the same nightmare. The vision of Reeva suffering this terrible trauma. Her terror and helplessness. Her yells for help piercing the silent night air,' said Mrs Steenkamp.\n\nHer husband imagines her begging for her life. 'He agonises over what was going through her mind: 'Where is anyone? Who is going to save me?' '\n\nMrs Steenkamp said she he did not believe Oscar Pistorius' story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed he shot Reeva (left) thinking she was an intruder\n\nPistorius told the court they were planning a life together, but Mrs Steenkamp thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility'.\n\n'She had confided to me that she hadn't slept with him. They'd shared a bed, but she was scared to take the relationship to that level \u2026 She wouldn't want to sleep with Oscar if she wasn't sure,' she said.\n\n'I believe their relationship was coming to an end. In her heart of hearts, she didn't think it was making either of them happy.'\n\nIn her book, titled Reeva: A Mother's Story, Mrs Steenkamp describes Pistorius, 27, as a 'pathetic figure'.\n\nHer parents have a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot, pictured as a toddler (left) and during a family Christmas\n\nThe extract focuses on the athlete's public apology during the televised trial.\n\n'It was an extraordinary moment. You could cut the atmosphere in the courtroom with a knife: silence, but for the sound of journalists tapping on their screens. It put me in an awkward position.\n\n'Why decide to say sorry to me in a televised trial in front of the whole world? I was unmoved by his apology. I felt if I appeared to be sorry for him at this stage of his trial on the charge of premeditated murder, it would in the eyes of others lessen the awfulness of what he had done.\n\n'He was in the box trying to save his own skin after he had killed my daughter and I was sitting in that courtroom wanting to hear the factual truth.'\n\nThe model (centre) with her brother Adam and mother June (right) who has written about her daughter's death in her book titled: Reeva: A Mother's Story\n\nPistorius told the court they were planning a life together, but Mrs Steenkamp thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility'\n\nMiss Steenkamp's parents said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth\n\nThe five-year sentence given to the double amputee athlete has been criticised by some as too lenient.\n\nBut Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge'.\n\nThey said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth.\n\nJudge Thokozile Masipa ruled the state had failed to prove Pistorius knew it was Reeva when he opened fire through the locked toilet door of his apartment in Pretoria.\n\nThroughout the trial, he said he mistook his girlfriend of three months for an intruder.\n\n'He said pulling the trigger was 'an accident'. What? Four times an accident?' Mrs Steenkamp said in her book.\n\n'He said Reeva did not scream, but she would definitely have screamed. I know my daughter and she was very vocal.'\n\nPistorius, who the court heard has no income and no property after selling it during the trial, was driven away in a police van with barred windows after his sentencing on Tuesday.\n\nHe is expected to be held in the hospital section of a prison in Pretoria.\n\nMrs Steenkamp's book is to be published on November 6.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "It,Reeva,s,bad,luck,met,sooner,later,killed,Reeva,Steenkamp,s,parents,attack,gun,toting,trigger,happy,Oscar,Pistorius,killing,daughter", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2807448/It-Reeva-s-bad-luck-met-sooner-later-killed-Reeva-Steenkamp-s-parents-attack-gun-toting-trigger-happy-Oscar-Pistorius-killing-daughter.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "June and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as Oscar Pistorius, known as the 'Blade Runner', could be out in 10 months.", "title": "Reeva Steenkamp's parents attack 'trigger-happy' Pistorius", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2807448/It-Reeva-s-bad-luck-met-sooner-later-killed-Reeva-Steenkamp-s-parents-attack-gun-toting-trigger-happy-Oscar-Pistorius-killing-daughter.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/25/1414223311287_wps_2_Reeva_Steenkamp_PREVIEW_j.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2807448/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2807448/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2807448, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "It,Reeva,s,bad,luck,met,sooner,later,killed,Reeva,Steenkamp,s,parents,attack,gun,toting,trigger,happy,Oscar,Pistorius,killing,daughter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-10-25T08:14:06.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Jenny+Awford+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-10-26T09:21:37.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "It Reeva s bad luck met sooner later killed Reeva Steenkamp s parents attack gun toting trigger happy Oscar Pistorius killing daughter"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "June and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as Oscar Pistorius, known as the 'Blade Runner', could be out in 10 months.", "title": "Reeva Steenkamp's parents attack 'trigger-happy' Pistorius", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2807448/It-Reeva-s-bad-luck-met-sooner-later-killed-Reeva-Steenkamp-s-parents-attack-gun-toting-trigger-happy-Oscar-Pistorius-killing-daughter.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/25/1414223311287_wps_2_Reeva_Steenkamp_PREVIEW_j.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/10/1418450360_3852231073001_8976425428e87717c77c37fdf0fd304e.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "June and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as Oscar Pistorius, known as the 'Blade Runner', could be out in 10 months."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbab\"", "article_summary": "The parents of the model shot dead by Oscar Pistorius have attacked the 'volatile' and 'trigger-happy' athlete saying 'sooner or later he would have killed someone'.\nIn her book, titled Reeva: A Mother's Story, Mrs Steenkamp describes Pistorius, 27, as a 'pathetic figure'.\nHer yells for help piercing the silent night air,' said Mrs Steenkamp.\nMrs Steenkamp, 68, said she did not believe the athlete's story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed he shot Reeva thinking she was an intruder.\nScroll down for videoJune and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as Pistorius could be out in 10 months'I wasn't happy with the sentence at all."}
