The Vermont senator defeated Hillary Clinton in the Wyoming Democratic primary on Saturday, making it his eighth victory in the last nine contests.\n\nSanders gained 56 percent of the vote in Wyoming with 87 percent precincts reported.\n\nReacting to the results on CNN, Democratic strategist Maria Cardona congratulated Sanders on his well deserved win, but noted that, moving forward, he faces a difficult road.\n\n\"In the Democratic primary, a winning streak is not what wins you the primary,\" she explained. \"It's the delegates.\"\n\nPlaced in that lens, Clinton is by far the long-term victor. Her super delegate lead, for instance, far surpasses Sanders.\n\nYet, there's no doubting Sanders is the one with the momentum right now.\n\nEarlier Saturday the media was already reporting all-time high voter turnout in Wyoming and that it was a \"good day\" for Sanders.\n\nDoes Clinton think he's \"qualified\" yet?\n\nUpdate (5:42): Bernie Sanders addressed reporters in Long Island, NY after his Wyoming win.\n\n\"We are in this race to win,\" Sanders said.\n\nHe noted his campaign is having \u201ca very strong second half. We are closing very fast.\u201d\n\nIf his campaign has proven everything, it's that young people are not apathetic about the political process, he suggested.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders keeps Hillary on her heels..05/26/2016 9:59:01AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Sanders keeps Hillary on her heels.", "title": "Sanders Wins Wyoming, Makes it Eight Out of the Last Nine", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/09/sanders-wins-wyoming-makes-it-eight-out-of-the-last-nine-n2145901", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/99/2016-04-08T213335Z_1_LYNXNPEC3719S_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-SANDERS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Sanders keeps Hillary on her heels.", "title": "Sanders Wins Wyoming, Makes it Eight Out of the Last Nine", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/09/sanders-wins-wyoming-makes-it-eight-out-of-the-last-nine-n2145901", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/99/2016-04-08T213335Z_1_LYNXNPEC3719S_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-SANDERS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Sanders Wins Wyoming, Makes it Eight Out of the Last Nine, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b32\"", "article_summary": "\"In the Democratic primary, a winning streak is not what wins you the primary,\" she explained.\nUpdate (5:42): Bernie Sanders addressed reporters in Long Island, NY after his Wyoming win.\nThe Vermont senator defeated Hillary Clinton in the Wyoming Democratic primary on Saturday, making it his eighth victory in the last nine contests.\n\"We are in this race to win,\" Sanders said.\nSanders gained 56 percent of the vote in Wyoming with 87 percent precincts reported."}
