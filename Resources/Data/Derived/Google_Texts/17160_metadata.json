A concert starts at seven at the bar, and the entertainment is Scott Helmer. In 2008, he lost all his money after the market crashed. He decided to focus his energy to performing concerts benefiting non-profit organizations.\n\n\"As soon as I put the word out about the tour with the goal to raise one million for Wounded Warriors, I got contacted by all sorts of different charities all across America. Historic theaters as well because they're non-profits and they need to fundraise. They said, 'Hey when you're done with this tour will you help us out or will you mix us in the tour,' and I say you know what, let's make it for charities all over America,\" Helmer said.\n\nHis current tour has raised more than $326,000. It wraps up in December. His next goal is to break the world record for live concerts in different cities over 24 hours.\n\nFor more information you can visit his website.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
