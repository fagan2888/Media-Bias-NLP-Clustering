The assemblyman, who represents Bayonne and a large portion of Jersey City, said he hopes others will donate and challenge their friends to do the same.\n\nSo far more than 100 people have contributed and Mainor's office has stacks of food all over it.\n\nMainor was one of 11 New Jersey lawmakers and three dozen community leaders who took the Food Stamp Challenge in September and lived on $4.20 of food per day for a week.\n\n\"The greatest part of this is it is proof the community can come together for a common cause at a grassroots level,\" Mainor said, adding that the challenge will continue through the end of the year. \"I'm really looking forward to seeing the faces of people picking up food. It give you a good feeling that what you are doing is helping somebody immediately.\"\n\nThe Jersey City Community Charter School is also holding a food drive and items collected there will be turned over to Mainor. Food donations can be dropped off at Mainor's office at 2324 Kennedy Blvd. in Jersey City.\n\nTo arrange to pick up a food package, call 201-536 -7851.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bayonne", "title": "Assemblyman Mainor wants to keep building on success of 'Food Pantry Challenge'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Assemblyman Mainor wants to keep building on success of \\u0027Food Pantry Challenge\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/10/assemblyman_mainor_wants_to_ke.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/10/10/16052092-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14159024\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-11T07:00:25Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"bayonne\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/10/10/16052092-small.jpg", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal", "description": "In just under two weeks, state Assemblyman Charles Mainor's \"Food Pantry Challenge\" has resulted in the donation of thousands of food items.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, October 11, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/10/10/16052092-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "In just under two weeks, state Assemblyman Charles Mainor's \"Food Pantry Challenge\" has resulted in the donation of thousands of food items.", "title": "Assemblyman Mainor wants to keep building on success of 'Food Pantry Challenge'", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/10/assemblyman_mainor_wants_to_ke.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, October 11, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "In just under two weeks, state Assemblyman Charles Mainor's \"Food Pantry Challenge\" has resulted in the donation of thousands of food items."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2949\"", "article_summary": "In just under two weeks, state Assemblyman Charles Mainor's \"Food Pantry Challenge\" has resulted in the donation of thousands of food items.\nThe Jersey City Community Charter School is also holding a food drive and items collected there will be turned over to Mainor.\nin Jersey City.\nThe assemblyman, who represents Bayonne and a large portion of Jersey City, said he hopes others will donate and challenge their friends to do the same.\nFrom canned vegetables, tuna and ravioli to cereal, tomato sauces, pasta, beverages and more, Mainor is looking to help feed members of the Jersey City and Bayonne communities."}
