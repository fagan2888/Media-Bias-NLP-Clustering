Maybe you are feeling comfortably full from Thanksgiving and chatting enthusiastically with your family about the time you\u2019ll get to spend together during the upcoming winter holidays. Or maybe you are silently fuming while waiting for your cousin to drop you off at the train already because you just spent the last 24 hours listening to your Uncle Carl talk about \u201cObama\u2019s America\u201d and the \u201cdeath of family values\u201d now that women don\u2019t have to pay extra for basic health care.\n\nLike it or not, if you live anywhere near your family, you\u2019re probably going to have to gear up for round two come December. So if you\u2019re fixing for a conversation with Uncle Carl about how best to support families in this country, here are five pro-family policies that conservatives should get behind that have nothing to do with abortion or birth control.\n\n(But I also encourage you to talk to your Uncle Carl about reproductive freedom because we\u2019ve all got to put in the work and Bodily Autonomy and Self-Determination Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, you know?)\n\nThe list is pretty universally applicable, but if you happen to be related to Rand Paul, John Boehner or Mitch McConnell, it might be especially useful. Here we go, you guys.\n\nPaid family leave.\n\nDo you know what is really pro-family? Being able to take care of your family without being afraid of losing your job or losing your income. And in terms of table-friendly conversation, there\u2019s very little risk involved with bringing up paid family leave. Pretty much everyone loves it. (Except for business tycoon types who probably wear monocles or whatever. If you are dining with a monocle-wearing business tycoon type, maybe leave the table and go steal his boat or something.)\n\nAccording to a 2012 poll commissioned by the National Partnership for Women and Families, 86 percent of Americans support paid leave. It\u2019s also pretty popular across party lines \u2014 the poll found that 96 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Republicans are for it.\n\nIn 2013, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro introduced the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act, which would have taken 0.2 percent of employee wages to be paid to the Social Security Administration in order to provide workers with up to 12 months of paid time off at 66 percent of their current wages. It wasn\u2019t perfect (66 percent of your wages isn\u2019t 100 percent), but it was certainly a start since less than 40 percent of American workers have access to medical leave.\n\nBut the measure stalled in the House and hasn\u2019t been heard from since, though lots of Democrats ran on the issue of paid leave during the midterms. And that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s a winner with most voters.\n\nI\u2019m from a very large, wonderful, baby-obsessed family. At any given moment, it seems I have at least one pregnant cousin. If this also describes your family, maybe try making meaningful eye contact with your expecting relative and her partner and start talking about the challenges of balancing work and family in this darned modern era.\n\nOr maybe talk about it with your brother who is a major hypochondriac. Let him know that the proposed law would also apply to time off spent caring for sick relatives.\n\nOr maybe bring it up with a joke. \u201cPaid family leave? You mean someone will pay me to make my family leave?\u201d It will be the best joke, and it will make everyone laugh and hug you.\n\nRaising the minimum wage.\n\nLike paid family leave, raising the minimum wage is kind of the most popular thing ever. Probably because so many people are minimum-wage workers or know minimum-wage workers and understand that a bump would dramatically improve their lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Have a cantankerous uncle going on about the \"death of family values\"?
