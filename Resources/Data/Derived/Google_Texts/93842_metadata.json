King, the Premier chief medical officer, and the medical team are arranging the free services. Health resources, body fat measurements, blood pressure screenings and sexual health screenings are planned. Limited slots are available for PAP tests.\n\nParticipants can call for the free well-woman exam at the health fair. To register or for more information, call Zenaida at (727) 645-4185, ext. 9505.\n\nHealth fair supporting sponsors are Pinot\u2019s Palette and the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network. Partners include the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation and the Florida Department of Health in Pasco County.\n\nPremier operates eight sites in Dade City, Zephyrhills, Lacoochee, Hudson and Trinity. The Hudson clinic, the newest addition, opened in August to offer family medicine and pediatric health services.\n\nPollock has said Premier wants to be a \u201csafety net.\u201d Census data indicates about 170,000 Pasco residents fall at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, she noted.\n\nLast year, about 36 percent of Premier patients had no medical insurance, while 42 percent fell under Medicaid coverage, Pollock said. Premier also accepts people with private insurance or Medicare.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people that are still uninsured,\u201d Pollock said, even after the federal Affordable Care Act passed.\n\nA \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d developed after Florida lawmakers did not expand Medicaid here and refused additional federal funding. Some people who earn about $16,000 annually, or 100 percent of the poverty level, still don\u2019t qualify for help through ACA.\n\n\u201cWe just knew this was a commitment we needed to fill,\u201d Pollock said of the long-delayed Hudson clinic, which was scheduled to open in 2009.\n\nThe demand at the Hudson site should emulate the clinic in New Port Richey that served 2,589 patients its first year, Premier officials expect. The patient schedule was full at the Hudson clinic even before it officially opened Aug. 31.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 29 Dec 2015 12:42:33 -0400", "Description": "HUDSON \u2014 Premier Community HealthCare  says the free Women\u2019s Health Fair next month will help women achieve a goal to have a healthy mind, body and spirit.", "og": {"description": "HUDSON \u2014 Premier Community HealthCare  says the free Women\u2019s Health Fair next month will help women achieve a goal to have a healthy mind, body and spirit.", "title": "Premier offering free Women\u2019s Health Fair on Jan. 9", "url": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/su/list/news-pasco/premier-offering-free-womens-health-fair-on-jan-9-20151229/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/storyimage/SU/20151229/ARTICLE/151229961/EP/1/2/EP-151229961.jpg", "height": 1500}, "updated_time": "2015-12-29T12:42:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "suncoastnews.com", "description": "HUDSON \u2014 Premier Community HealthCare  says the free Women\u2019s Health Fair next month will help women achieve a goal to have a healthy mind, body and spirit.", "image": "http://www.suncoastnews.com/storyimage/SU/20151229/ARTICLE/151229961/AR/0/AR-151229961.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Premier offering free Women\u2019s Health Fair on Jan. 9"}, "fb": {"app_id": 437550169655494}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-12-29T12:42:33Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-12-29T12:42:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Health resources, body fat measurements, blood pressure screenings and sexual health screenings are planned.\nPremier Community HealthCare says the free Women\u2019s Health Fair next month will help women achieve a goal to have a healthy mind, body and spirit.\nHealth fair supporting sponsors are Pinot\u2019s Palette and the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network.\nParticipants can call for the free well-woman exam at the health fair.\nObstetrician-gynecologist Joseph W.
