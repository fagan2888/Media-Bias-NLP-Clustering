That would be almost 3 million in Georgia, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens. Kendrick said he could not provide specific numbers but said there is no sign anyone has actually suffered from the attacks. He added that the company was \u201cvery aggressive and very transparent and very quick\u201d to announce it and offer two years of credit protection to those who might be affected, which includes himself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Kendrick said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m affected as a consumer as well, my family. But at the same point in time, it\u2019s unfortunately a part of the world we\u2019re living in.\u201d\n\nIn fact, dealing with the FBI as they investigate this breach has opened his eyes to the serious and pervasive nature of cyberattacks on businesses now.\n\n\u201cReally, they describe two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that don\u2019t know they\u2019ve been hacked,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cThis was a very well-orchestrated, well-financed operation.\u201d\n\nThe company is also still trying to amend contracts and rates with physicians that has riled many of them and led the Medical Association of Georgia to complain to Hudgens\u2019 office last year. The commissioner required the company to immediately rescind those proposed amendments and submit new ones, which it has done and are being reviewed.\n\nWhat perturbed physicians was the contract amendment appeared to require physician practices to get approval from the company to make major changes, such as adding new partners, or risk being dropped from their network, said Dr. Phillip Kennedy, president of Primary Care Association, which represents 90 primary care physicians in the Augusta and Statesboro areas. It also appeared to require them to give up certain rights to appeal, he said. Worse, the company\u2019s sample new rates appeared to increase in some areas but a reading of the actual proposed rates showed to be a decrease, Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cSo the sample was just a lie, it was just made up,\u201d he said. Even after being verbally promised an increase, the actual reading of the codes showed a decrease, Kennedy said.\n\nKendrick strongly denied that the sample was misleading, saying it was an \u201cexact\u201d copy of the proposed new codes and blamed part of the problem on \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Some payments for certain services were going to increase and others would decrease \u201cbut in aggregate the increase was a 2 percent increase in what we were paying people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company was going to increase some payments for things related to preventive services, for instance, but as it simplified from three contracts to one those increases \u201cdidn\u2019t go in,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cSo, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t raise the rates like we had intended to because our intent by this was to move to a simpler contract.\u201d Still, he said, 70 percent of the physicians would have been paid more under the new rates, he said.\n\nAs for the language changes, the new proposed contracts \u201cwere not materially different at all,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cThere might be some wording differences and things of that nature. And I think that\u2019s where the communication of those facts could have been better.\u201d\n\nThe physician group MAG has still not seen the new contracts, but the company has formed a physician advisory group to work with them and that could be seen as a positive step, said Executive Director and CEO Donald Palmisano Jr. But physicians still have concerns over how the company handled the new contracts, he said.\n\n\u201cI think we are too early to tell if some of those bad blood issues have been resolved,\u201d Palmisano said.\n\nIt is also too soon to tell how Blue Cross did in its second year in the Marketplace but early indicators show it is likely to meet its projections and top what it did last year, in part because of an overall 11 percent reduction in rates over the previous year, Kendrick said.\n\n\u201cI do expect it to be more than last year simply because our price point was more competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went into year one and learned a lot. I feel good about it. I really do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Latest News, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "It has been a tumultuous year for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, from an improving performance in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to a massive security breach.", "title": "GA BCBS president talks breach, physician contracts, ACA", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/latest-news/2015-02-19/ga-bcbs-president-talks-breach-physician-contracts-aca", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd932b\"", "article_summary": "As for the language changes, the new proposed contracts \u201cwere not materially different at all,\u201d Kendrick said.\nBut BCBS Georgia President Morgan Kendrick addressed these issues head-on Thursday.\nWorse, the company\u2019s sample new rates appeared to increase in some areas but a reading of the actual proposed rates showed to be a decrease, Kennedy said.\nThat would be almost 3 million in Georgia, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens.\nKendrick said he could not provide specific numbers but said there is no sign anyone has actually suffered from the attacks."}
