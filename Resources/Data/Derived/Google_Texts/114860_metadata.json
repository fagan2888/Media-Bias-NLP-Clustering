However, with few obvious signs of infection, many are left untreated and are spread to others. Having an STD also increases the risk of contracting HIV.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and inconsistent condom use continue to be the most common risk behaviors reported, but those reporting meeting sex partners online has edged into the top 10 risk behaviors over the past five years.\n\nAlthough surveys aren\u2019t done with those testing positive for the most common STDs \u2014 chlamydia and gonorrhea \u2014 the results would likely be similar and are what\u2019s fueling STD increases across rural and suburban Ohio.\n\nDr. Jose Bazan, an infectious disease expert at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center, said the use of mobile apps and social media to find casual sex partners is very likely contributing to increases everywhere, not just in rural and suburban areas.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a phone ... and with the explosion of social media, meeting sex partners is much easier,\u201d he said.\n\nThe highest rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia in Ohio continue to be found in metropolitan areas, but those rates are typically stable or have been steadily declining. However, they\u2019re climbing in places such as Marion County where cases of gonorrhea were nearly six times higher in 2014 than 2010 and Knox County where cases of chlamydia tripled during the same five years, according to Ohio Department of Health data.\n\nOhio\u2019s rate of chlamydia and gonorrhea surpassed national rates in 2013 \u2014 461 chlamydia infections per 100,000 people compared to 447 nationally and 144 gonorrhea cases per 100,000 people versus 106 nationally.\n\nMedicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act may play a part in increases since more people have access to healthcare and may be getting tested. But just how much increased medical access is a factor is unknown, said Ohio Department of Health Medical Director Mary DiOrio.\n\nThe state offers guidelines on how local health departments should work to decrease STD rates, but for the most part, all 122 health departments are left to determine its community\u2019s needs and how to best address them. Sometimes, that leaves departments weighing approaches against community perception.\n\nFor example, although the females age 15 to 24 are the highest risk, high schools are \u201cvery difficult\u201d to get into to educate students, Fisher said. However, they do target students at the local colleges and especially the younger clients stopping into the office for free condoms.\n\n\u201cIf they seem fairly young, we bring them back and talk to them and try to educate them,\u201d she said, adding they also try to educate people when they come in for HIV tests.\n\nThe influx of people abusing heroin and painkillers also can contribute to increases, Bazan said. Use can lower inhibitions and lead to riskier sexual behavior including prostitution, he said.\n\nChillicothe is among several rural communities that have seen an uptick in prostitution in recent years. When the Ross County Health District moved into a downtown office, it was an issue they no longer could deny because they were seeing it right across the street, said Rami Yoakum, district spokesman.\n\nNo specific actions have been taken, in part due to concerns the public will view harm-reduction methods, such as providing condoms to those prostituting, as enabling or encouraging the activity, Yoakum said. Although such moves could decrease the outbreak of disease and improve public health, they have to balance efforts against public opinion due to reliance on levies passing.\n\nAs such, Yoakum said their discussions have centered more on low-key approaches.\n\n\u201cOur new location on East Second Street puts us in close proximity to the prostitution activities, and if we can subtly remind people that STDs are a real risk and a real danger, then maybe we can discourage some of the illegal activity,\u201d Yoakum said.\n\nRaising community awareness of the need for protection from STDs as well as screening and treatment options is the only way to make a dent in the numbers, Bazan said. He suggests the best approach is to use the same thing folks are using to find each other \u2014 social media.\n\njison@gannett.com\n\nTwitter: @JonaIson\n\nFairfield County cases of sexually transmitted diseases\n\nSTD 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Chlamydia 325 332 373 373 390 Gonorrhea 52 43 39 48 72 Syphilis 5 0 7 3 10\n\nSource: Ohio Department of Health\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RHEpJr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Beware, that Internet hookup may come with more than an evening of no-strings-attached fun.", "og": {"site_name": "Lancaster Eagle Gazette", "description": "Beware, that Internet hookup may come with more than an evening of no-strings-attached fun.", "title": "Online hookups boosting rural Ohio STD rates", "url": "http://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/story/news/local/2016/01/24/online-hookups-boosting-rural-ohio-std-rates/79282096/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lancastereaglegazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beware, that Internet hookup may come with more than an evening of no-strings-attached fun.", "title": "Online hookups boosting rural Ohio STD rates", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lancastereaglegazette.png", "creator": "@EagleGazette", "site": "@EagleGazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=896380990", "fb": {"app_id": 169844466384377}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a55\"", "article_summary": "The highest rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia in Ohio continue to be found in metropolitan areas, but those rates are typically stable or have been steadily declining.\n\u201cI think a lot of people have an \u2018it\u2019s not going to happen to me\u2019 attitude,\u201d said Betty Fisher, a nurse and disease intervention specialist at the Zanesville-Muskingum County Health Department.\nBut just how much increased medical access is a factor is unknown, said Ohio Department of Health Medical Director Mary DiOrio.\nHaving an STD also increases the risk of contracting HIV.\nAlthough surveys aren\u2019t done with those testing positive for the most common STDs \u2014 chlamydia and gonorrhea \u2014 the results would likely be similar and are what\u2019s fueling STD increases across rural and suburban Ohio."}
