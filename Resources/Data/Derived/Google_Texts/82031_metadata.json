Looks like it could happen anyway, thanks to the law\u2019s tax complications.\n\nFully 40% of taxpayers who received ObamaCare subsidies last year haven\u2019t filed their taxes yet and are at risk of losing their subsidies for next year, according to the American Action Forum.\n\nAn update on ObamaCare that the IRS recently sent to Congress said that out of the 4.5 million taxpayers who got ObamaCare\u2019s \u201cadvance payment\u201d subsidies last year, only 2.7 million had filed the required tax forms as of the end of this May.\n\nThe rest filed for an extension (360,000), haven\u2019t filed at all (710,000) or didn\u2019t submit the new ObamaCare form \u2014 Form 8962 \u2014 that\u2019s required to make sure they got the right subsidy amount (760,000).\n\nThese 1.8 million taxpayers actually represent 2.8 million individuals, according to the IRS, since one taxpayer can file on behalf of his spouse and children.\n\nIn a separate document, the IRS notes that if these taxpayers don\u2019t file and if they try to sign up for a plan for 2016, they won\u2019t be eligible for ObamaCare subsidies. And they might have to \u201cpay back some or all of the 2014 advance payments of the premium tax credit.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest evidence of just how wildly complex ObamaCare\u2019s subsidy scheme is. When enrollees sign up for coverage, they have to forecast what their income will be next year, because it determines their subsidy amount.\n\nGuessing correctly has proved nearly impossible.\n\nThe IRS says that only 10% predicted their income correctly. About 40% made less than they thought they would and so were eligible for an average $600 in additional subsidies. But half made more than they predicted and had to pay some of their ObamaCare subsidies back. The average repayment was $800.\n\nThe report also shows that 7.5 million taxpayers ponied up $1.5 billion in mandate penalties because they weren\u2019t insured in 2014, and 12 million taxpayers claimed an exemption from the ObamaCare mandate. About 300,000 low-income taxpayers paid the penalty even though they didn\u2019t owe it.\n\nBrittany La Couture, a health policy expert at the American Action Forum, noted, \u201cThe legislative marriage of two of life\u2019s most baffling necessities \u2014 taxes and health insurance \u2014 has naturally resulted in some confusion.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a bit of an understatement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: Remember the hue and cry when it looked like the Supreme Court could deny ObamaCare subsidies to millions of people?
