But then, I never bought a pet rock or a mood ring, either.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency, and the controversy over who created it has served a great purpose to whomever created it, as the perhaps-solved question has completely subsumed the more important mystery: Why would anyone take Bitcoin seriously or invest actual currency in it?\n\nThe premise behind Bitcoin is that it allows people to transfer money (make that \u201cmoney\u201d) over the Internet without going through the trouble and expense of dealing with banks. That\u2019s understandable \u2013 it\u2019s always irritating to pay a fee for merely exchanging your dollars for euros or yen. But then, why would banks provide the service without getting a little something for their trouble? I never understood, during the 1990s, why middle-aged Albanian men would sell local leks on the black market, on the main square in Tirana right near actual banks, but offer the same rate. How did they make any money? And aside from avoiding the trouble of standing in line, what was the incentive for the buyer?\n\n[Read blogger Pat Garofalo on regulating bitcoin.]\n\nLeks were not hard currency, and this weren\u2019t at all valuable outside of Albania. But at least it was an actual currency. Bitcoin is completely made up; it\u2019s not grounded in anything, let alone a cache of gold at Ft. Knox. It\u2019s only valuable if enough people give it value by buying and trading it \u2013 and even then, it\u2019s only worthwhile to the circle of people who have decided it\u2019s something of worth. It has no objective value. It\u2019s reminiscent of the scene in \"Gone With the Wind\" where Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s father announces, post-Civil War, that Tara is safe because he has lot of cash. Unfortunately, it was all Confederate money.\n\nWho would try to start a new currency, given the potential pratfalls? Bitcoin is not attached to a particular country or community (the cyberspace community hardly counts), and so is not backed by a government or central bank. It would actually be easier to start one\u2019s own country than one\u2019s own currency \u2013 at least, with a new country, you have actual land and living, breathing people to give it legitimacy.\n\nNewsweek believes it has found the creator of Bitcoin in the form of Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese-American engineer. He denied it (sort of), fearing reprisals, according to Newsweek. Then, when other journalists pursued him, he asked them to buy him lunch, then declared after downing some sushi that he was not, in fact, the creator of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the virtual currency has been attacked by hackers. \u201cMt. Gox,\u201d as it was known, went bankrupt after trading Bitcoins, having lost some $400 million from theft. A Canada-based trader also went bankrupt, and the apparent suicide of an American businessman in Singapore is being investigated for connections to Bitcoin.\n\nMoney troubles are aggravating enough when a legitimate currency is involved. Why take on the added risk of trading in something that only exists in code?\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto and Mt.
