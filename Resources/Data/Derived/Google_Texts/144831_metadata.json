Elson (1931-2009) was no faith-basher but an intellectually inquisitive Catholic who worshiped regularly at Manhattan\u2019s St. Ignatius Church. This uber-talented religion writer was largely unheralded in that era when Time barred bylines. Later, he was a senior editor or A.M.E. who often supervised the Guy during 19 years as the news magazine\u2019s religion writer.\n\nThe God article raised a classic journalistic issue as pertinent as the latest Trump outburst: Does media sensationalism distort reality and harm the culture? After all, only a handful of \u201cmainline\u201d Protestant theologians were the \u201cChristian atheists\u201d of 1966. But Elson captured a cultural moment other media were pondering. Weeks beforehand, John Lennon had remarked that \u201cChristianity will go\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re more popular than Jesus now.\u201d Another Elson cover story later that year profiled the Episcopal Church\u2019s doubt-drenched Bishop James Pike.\n\nGod didn\u2019t die. Neither did \u201cmainline\u201d Protestantism, but after a 1966 historical high point, cumulative membership would undergo unprecedented decline. These moderate to liberal, ecumenically aligned, and predominantly white U.S. denominations treated the debunkers in their midst with bemused tolerance as old beliefs began to erode.\n\nNeil Young recently wrote for The Christian Century that the \u201cGod is dead\u201d hubbub \u201chardened evangelical identity and theology\u201d as \u201ca counter-force to the nation\u2019s secularizing culture, and a conservative alternative to the mainline Protestantism that still dominated American religious life.\u201d Subsequent Time covers included the self-satirical \u201cIs God Coming Back to Life?\u201d (1969), followed by \u201cThe Jesus Revolution\u201d (1971), \u201cThe Evangelicals\u201d (1977), \u201cFundamentalism\u201d (1985) and \u201cGospel TV\u201d (1986). (The Religion Guy was a correspondent filing for the first two articles and wrote the last three.)\n\nFurther history: Time founder Henry Luce (1898-1967) was a Presbyterian Missionary\u2019s Kid, and his magazine pioneered in religion coverage, including cover stories on popes, cardinals, and the likes of C.S. Lewis (1947), Reinhold Niebuhr and Bromley Oxnam (1948), Albert Schweitzer (1949), Otto Dibelius (1953), Henry van Dusen, Geoffrey Fisher, and Billy Graham (1954), Martin Luther King (1957, Man of the Year for 1963), Franklin Clark Fry (1958), Paul Tillich (1959), Eugene Carson Blake and W.A. Visser \u2018t Hooft (1961), Karl Barth (1962), Michael Ramsey (1963), and Gerald Kennedy (1964).\n\nAfter prosperous times these same 50 years brought decline and death for many forms of print news media. One Time staffer stated at a colleague\u2019s memorial service, \u201cThere was a time in this land when print was king, and he was a prince in the kingdom.\u201d\n\nBoth Time and Newsweek were hotly competitive and most weeks their religion sections went toe to toe. Two full-time staffers were assigned to religion and could obtain field coverage from a large global corps of crack correspondents. U.S. News and World Report also upped its religion game in that era.\n\nNow, among the big three only 93-year-old Time survives in widely circulated print form, with a much-reduced staff, iffy finances, and only occasional religion features. Daily newspapers face similar market woes, often with fading religion coverage to match. The Economist, Britain\u2019s newsweekly with substantial U.S. circulation, makes only the occasional stab at faith. As the New Yorker\u2019s Wolcott Gibbs concluded a 1936 profile of Luce that parodied Time style, \u201cWhere it all will end, knows God!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In olden times the major U.S. news magazines often ran major religion \r\ntakeouts at Easter time.
