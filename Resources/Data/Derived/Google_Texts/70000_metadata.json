Still, even if the ballot initiative passes, none say they\u2019ll abandon Austin, despite the city\u2019s largely left-leaning politics and local ordinances that drive some conservatives batty, like bans on plastic grocery store bags.\n\nThe ballot initiative already was approved by two-thirds of the Texas House and Senate, sending it to voters. Its sponsor, Republican state Sen. Donna Campbell, said it wasn\u2019t about escaping Austin, but rather acknowledging that modern technology means elected officials no longer need to be anchored to the capital city - as they had to be back in 1876 when the Texas Constitution was adopted.\n\n\u201cAustin\u2019s great ,\u201d said Campbell who lives in New Braunfels, about 50 miles from the capital and commutes back and forth during the legislative session. \u201cBut to mandate that someone must have a residency there - and if you don\u2019t have the dollars, you have to sell your home and if you have a family you have to uproot your children - it\u2019s an unfair burden.\u201d\n\nOpponents worried the ballot question would allow elected officials to reside in friendly counties, and therefore face lenient prosecutors should they be accused of wrongdoing.\n\nBut the Legislature approved this past session moving investigations of officeholders out of the longtime jurisdiction of an Austin-based anti-corruption unit. A new law allows the Texas Rangers to investigate, then turn cases over to prosecutors in the official\u2019s home county.\n\nPhillip Martin, deputy director of the liberal advocacy group Progress Texas, said that law could one day be repealed - but restoring the constitutional residency requirement will be far tougher should it be scrapped in November.\n\n\u201cAustin is the seat of government and I don\u2019t want a computer in that seat,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe first priority should be what\u2019s convenient for the people of Texas, not for the elected servants who have some of the greatest jobs in the world.\u201d\n\nGov. Greg Abbott, who lives in the Greek Revival-style Governor\u2019s Mansion a stone\u2019s throw from the sand-colored state Capitol building, has no interest in leaving Austin.\n\n\u201cThe answer would be no,\u201d said John Wittman, an Abbott spokesman.\n\nIt turns out the governor won\u2019t have that choice regardless of whether the ballot initiative passes. The proposed change doesn\u2019t affect constitutional language mandating that the governor reside \u201cat the seat of Government.\u201d\n\nThe amendment also wouldn\u2019t alter constitutional passages pertaining to the lieutenant governor. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is from Houston and already often spends time there when the Legislature isn\u2019t in session.\n\nSimilarly unaffected are Texas Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals justices. But that still means the agriculture and land commissioners, the comptroller, attorney general and railroad commissioners could hightail it out of Austin.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton \u201chas no plans to\u201d move away, said Cynthia Meyer, a spokeswoman for his office. Paxton hails from McKinney and has been indicted there on federal securities fraud charges.\n\nThough he\u2019s from Fort Worth, Land Commissioner George P. Bush now owns an Austin home with his family and won\u2019t move either, said Brittany Eck, a commissioner\u2019s office spokeswoman.\n\nComptroller Glenn Hegar, meanwhile, \u201csplits time between Austin and his hometown of Katy and will continue to do so,\u201d said Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for his office.\n\nAgricultural Commissioner Sid Miller said the referendum \u201cwill have no effect on me\u201d since he lives in Austin, though he does sometimes head back to his hometown of Stephenville to check on livestock and attend church.\n\n\u201cHe has a ranch, cattle and he\u2019s a nine-time world champion calf roper,\u201d noted Todd Smith, Miller\u2019s longtime political consultant. \u201cSo he has to go and check on his horses now and again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Top Republicans sometimes grouse about having to live in liberal-leaning Austin, the capital of America's largest conservative state but something of a blue hole to much of the rest of Texas' red doughnut.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/27/referendum-would-let-top-texas-officials-live-outs/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Top Republicans sometimes grouse about having to live in liberal-leaning Austin, the capital of America\u2019s largest conservative state but something of a blue hole to much of the rest of Texas\u2019 red doughnut.", "title": "Referendum would let top Texas officials live outside Austin"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Top Republicans sometimes grouse about having to live in liberal-leaning Austin, the capital of America's largest conservative state but something of a blue hole to much of the rest of Texas' red doug", "card": "summary", "title": "Referendum would let top Texas officials live outside Austin"}, "Author": "WILL WEISSERT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "A Democrat hasn\u2019t won statewide office in Texas since 1994 - the nation\u2019s longest single-party losing streak - meaning all top state officials are Republicans.\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Top Republicans sometimes grouse about having to live in liberal-leaning Austin, the capital of America\u2019s largest conservative state but something of a blue hole to much of the rest of Texas\u2019 red doughnut.\nThe ballot initiative already was approved by two-thirds of the Texas House and Senate, sending it to voters.\nA new law allows the Texas Rangers to investigate, then turn cases over to prosecutors in the official\u2019s home county.\nIt turns out the governor won\u2019t have that choice regardless of whether the ballot initiative passes."}
