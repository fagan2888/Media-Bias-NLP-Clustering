Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated on Tuesday. \u201cIt turns out that those ironclad promises made by the President himself are absolutely untrue.\u201d\n\nSmith was among numerous pro-life advocates who voiced sharp criticism following a new government accountability report finding abortion coverage in many subsidized health plans in the state exchanges, in violation of promises made by Obama.\n\nCurrent U.S. laws such as the Hyde Amendment prevent the federal funding of abortion for many government programs. However, the amendment does not apply to the Affordable Care Act, which has its own sources of funding, rather than seeking funding through the annual appropriations bills.\n\nDebates over abortion funding in the 2010 health care law threatened to prevent its passage, as a group of pro-life Democrats said they would only support the legislation if abortion funding were excluded.\n\nIn response, President Obama promised an executive order to ban this funding. At the time, numerous pro-life groups warned that the order was legally unenforceable and would have no actual impact on the legislation.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) now shows that the executive order has in fact not been followed in more than 1,000 health plans across the country.\n\nThe report, released Monday night by the independent, nonpartisan agency, reveals the qualified health plans offered on the state exchanges that cover \u201cnon-excepted abortion services,\u201d those that do not involve rape, incest or a potential threat to the life of the mother.\n\nIn five states \u2013 Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont \u2013 all taxpayer-funded health plans offered cover abortions.\n\nIn other states, nearly all qualified health plans offered cover abortions. In Massachusetts, for example, 109 out of the 111 plans offered cover abortions. In New York, 405 out of the 426 plans offered cover abortions. In California, 86 out of the 90 plans offered do so.\n\nThe report added that 15 health plan issuers questioned by the GAO affirmed that abortion benefits in their health plans were not subject to restriction.\n\nEnrollees were supposed to be billed separately for their abortion coverage, but the GAO found that this was not always carried out in practice.\n\n\u201cFifteen issuers and the Washington Health Benefit Exchange,\u201d the report stated, \u201cdid not itemize the premium amount associated with non-excepted abortion services coverage on enrollees\u2019 bills nor indicate that they send a separate bill for that premium amount.\u201d\n\nNumerous pro-life advocates voiced their outrage over the GAO\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report is confirmation that ObamaCare is a massive expansion of abortion on demand, paid for by the taxpayers,\u201d stated Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.\n\nKnights of Columbus head Carl Anderson said the report indicates a \u201cbroken promise\u201d on the part of the administration.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama offered assurances that abortion would not be funded as a result of his health care legislation,\u201d he stated, pointing to Obama\u2019s 2009 statement to a joint session of Congress: \u201cunder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.\u201d\n\nAnderson also charged that \u201cthe American people are overwhelmingly opposed to taxpayer funding of abortion,\u201d as indicated by the group\u2019s poll this year which found 58-37 percent opposition.\n\n\u201cObamacare only had the votes to become law because promises were made that federal funds would not be used to perform these procedures,\u201d Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) stated.\n\n\u201cNow the GAO has proven that the government has failed to ensure that the insurance issuers are not billing the abortion surcharge separately as required by the law,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question remains, what will the Administration now do to ensure compliance? This must be fixed.\u201d\n\nLegal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom insisted that \u201cthis report exposes what we\u2019ve known all along: that Obamacare was designed to force Americans to pay for abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cFederal law protects Americans from paying for others\u2019 abortions, but Obamacare architects built a purposely deceptive accounting scheme into the massive law that makes people in all 50 states fund abortion,\u201d the group said.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) called for support of legislation that would explicitly block federal funding of abortions in the health care law.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year the House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, on a bipartisan basis to prohibit federal funding for such purpose under ObamaCare,\u201d he stated. \u201cThis GAO report underscores the need for the Senate to do its job and pass this common-sense legislation.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic News Agency", "description": "Pro-life groups have responded forcefully to a new report finding that despite promises from President Barack Obama, more than 1,000 health care plans under the Affordable Care Act cover abortion.", "title": "Deluge of criticism after abortion funding revealed in health care law", "url": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/deluge-of-criticism-after-abortion-funding-revealed-in-health-care-law-60333/", "image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/President_Barack_Obama_CNA_3_13_12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pro-life groups have responded forcefully to a new report finding that despite promises from President Barack Obama, more than 1,000 health care plans under the Affordable Care Act cover abortion.", "title": "Deluge of criticism after abortion funding revealed in health care law", "image": {"src": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/President_Barack_Obama_CNA_3_13_12.jpg"}, "creator": "@cnalive", "site": "@cnalive", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 32422915}, "fb": {"app_id": 1502824986641800}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d5b\"", "article_summary": "Debates over abortion funding in the 2010 health care law threatened to prevent its passage, as a group of pro-life Democrats said they would only support the legislation if abortion funding were excluded.\nIn five states \u2013 Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont \u2013 all taxpayer-funded health plans offered cover abortions.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) called for support of legislation that would explicitly block federal funding of abortions in the health care law.\nIn other states, nearly all qualified health plans offered cover abortions.\n.- Pro-life groups have responded forcefully to a new report finding that despite promises from President Barack Obama, more than 1,000 health care plans under the Affordable Care Act cover abortion."}
