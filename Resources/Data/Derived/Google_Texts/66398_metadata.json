The students were way ahead of me. Most of them had seen \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d\n\nWith satellite technology and the Internet, the circulation of culture and news \u2014 particularly bad news \u2014 is accelerated exponentially. By telling ourselves that Trump\u2019s comments are extreme and that their global impact can be countered by public disavowals, as many Americans believe, we are deluding ourselves.\n\nTo young Moroccans \u2014 whose country is 99 percent Muslim and long friendly to the United States \u2014 Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim comments were the latest sign that American culture has become increasingly hateful toward them. The global effects of speech such as Mr. Trump\u2019s are profound here and will be long-lasting.\n\nI was in Morocco talking about my new book, \u201cAfter the American Century,\u201d which examines how American culture travels through the Middle East and North Africa in the digital age, and what it means to politics.\n\nFez is a sophisticated city: the home to the world\u2019s oldest, continually operating university (the Qarawiyyin, which dates to the mid-9th century) and a city where many of the great philosophers and scholars of both the medieval and modern period were educated or born, including Ibn Khaldun (the historian considered the founding father of sociology), the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, and the great feminist thinker Fatima Mernissi, who died earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI have a question,\u201d one female student asked me. \u201cWhy Islam? Why are Muslims considered the worst by Americans?\u201d This is a question that matters here. The student wore a black hijab. Her face was open and friendly. She looked personally wounded.\n\nAnother student followed with a related point: \u201cMost people in the U.S. have guns. Here in Morocco we don\u2019t have guns. We are peaceful.\u201d The students nodded and seemed distressed that they might be thought otherwise.\n\nThe exceptional reach and uncontrolled speed with which the worst of our cultural products spread means that the ideas by which America was attractive during the last century are no longer reflective of the present one.\n\nIn the past decade and a half, there has been a seismic change in the way people in Muslim majority countries of the Middle East and North Africa understand American culture. Perceptions of the U.S. as a fair political broker in the region have plummeted since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the long occupation punctuated by public relations disasters like Abu Ghraib and drone attacks gone wrong.\n\nAdd to that how such news is amplified in the digital age. The profound changes in the way people access information and popular culture has accelerated the movement of all forms of popular culture, and altered the context for what has been called America\u2019s soft power.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The brilliant young students America needs to reach around the world are being lost to us by Donald Trump's hatred", "title": "\u201cWhy Islam?
