You realize no amount of brushing, flossing, or mouthwash the night before seems to mask the overwhelming odor from your mouth when you wake up. Getting out of bed with bad breath, halitosis, in the morning is fairly common as our mouth goes into a \u201crest and digest\u201d mode overnight.\n\nMorning Breath And Saliva\n\nUp to 80 million people, according to the Academy of General Dentistry, suffer from bad breath that is ever-present, while millions of Americans suffer from bad breath in limited situations such as in the morning or after eating pungent food. People who suffer from dry mouth often due to taking certain medications or mouth breathers are more prone to morning breath. Those with poor oral hygiene will also suffer from bad breath more readily than those with good oral hygiene, of course.\n\nBad breath in the morning is mostly attributed to a lack of saliva. \u201cDuring the day, your mouth produces a significant amount of saliva, but while you sleep, saliva production goes down,\u201d Dr. Hugh Flax, a cosmetic dentist and past president of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry in Atlanta, Ga., told Medical Daily in an email.\n\nMorning Breath And The Foul Smell\n\nSaliva is critical for sweeping away the food particles that would otherwise linger and collect bacteria. A decrease in saliva production increases the likelihood of dry mouth. \u201c[This] allows bacteria to grow and produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which is what smells bad,\u201d Dr. Matthew Nejad and Dr. Kyle Stanley, dentists at Helm | Nejad | Stanley \u2014 Dentistry in Beverly Hills, Calif., told Medical Daily in an email. Bacteria munches on compounds, proteins, amino acids, and leftover foods that are stuck in your mouth and teeth to produce these VSCs, which causes the bad odor.\n\nMorning Breath And How You Sleep\n\nThe way you sleep can also affect the intensity and frequency of morning breath. Snoring or breathing through the mouth at night can increase the likelihood of bad breath. Most mouth breathers sleep with their mouth open, causing their mouth to get dryer and therefore letting breath-causing bacteria flourish. Basically, \u201cany time you reduce saliva in the mouth, you reduce the mouth\u2019s ability to fight the bacteria that causes the bad breath,\u201d Flax said.\n\nMorning Breath And Your Health\n\nWhile bad breath has nothing to do with age, the bacteria that causes bad breath may have several health implications. These implications are secondary to dental health complications. Typically, according to Nejad and Stanley, the first cause of bad breath is periodontal issues such as gingivitis and periodontitis, which have been proven to be involved with heart disease and stroke.\n\nThis suggests your oral health is strongly connected to other health conditions, also known as the mouth-body connection or the oral-systemic link. \u201cThe toxins from oral bacterial are released into your blood stream and can possibly inflict mayhem on other parts of your body,\u201d Flax said. This has been linked to serious health risks including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, oral cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nMorning Breath Prevention\n\nAlthough there is no outright, foolproof prevention for morning breath, there are things you can do to reduce its affect. Brushing, flossing, and scraping your tongue before bed helps clean out the mouth and get rid of food particles so the bacteria have less \u201cfood\u201d to munch on.\n\nThe Tongue Test\n\nThe first step to evaluating if you have bad breath is to see if you have it. Flax recommends doing a visual test by using a mirror to view the back of your tongue. \u201cA pink shiny tongue indicates fresh breath, but if your tongue has a thick white film, it is likely that you have bad breath,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother method is to lick your (clean) wrist. Let it dry for a few seconds, and then smell your wrist. If you detect an odor, according to Flax, it is an indicator that you have bad breath.\n\nA simple and commonly employed method is to use a soft bristle toothbrush, tongue scraper, or the edge of a spoon to gently clean your tongue. This is to prevent your tongue from being a hotbed of bacteria. It is less likely the bacteria will harbor in your mouth.\n\nThe above methods are not meant to replace a dentist visit. You can request your dentist to perform a quick, easy, and painless test of the bacteria in your mouth to determine if you have bad breath. Until then, stay fresh and keep smiling.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "what causes bad breath, morning breath, shut your pie hole, potty mouth, foul mouth, breath stinks, oral hygiene, oral health, oral care, dental care, teeth, bacteria, volatile sulfur compounds, vscs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The mouth\u2019s \u201crest and digest\u201d mode throughout the night onsets the run-of-the-mill bad breath in the morning.", "title": "Why You Have Stinky Morning Breath When You Wake Up", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/your-morning-breath-explained-what-causes-it-and-how-you-can-treat-it-312046", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/24/young-woman-covering-her-mouth-shopping-center.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The mouth\u2019s \u201crest and digest\u201d mode throughout the night onsets the run-of-the-mill bad breath in the morning.", "title": "Why You Have Stinky Morning Breath When You Wake Up", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/your-morning-breath-explained-what-causes-it-and-how-you-can-treat-it-312046", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/24/young-woman-covering-her-mouth-shopping-center.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/24/young-woman-covering-her-mouth-shopping-center.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-28T09:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-28T09:00:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The mouth\u2019s \u201crest and digest\u201d mode throughout the night onsets the run-of-the-mill bad breath in the morning."}, "article_summary": "Morning Breath And How You SleepThe way you sleep can also affect the intensity and frequency of morning breath.\nMorning Breath PreventionAlthough there is no outright, foolproof prevention for morning breath, there are things you can do to reduce its affect.\nMorning Breath And Your HealthWhile bad breath has nothing to do with age, the bacteria that causes bad breath may have several health implications.\nBasically, \u201cany time you reduce saliva in the mouth, you reduce the mouth\u2019s ability to fight the bacteria that causes the bad breath,\u201d Flax said.\nThis suggests your oral health is strongly connected to other health conditions, also known as the mouth-body connection or the oral-systemic link."}
