She says the location will provide information in person.\n\n\u201cFolks can take a look at the plans they have currently, analyze what they have, what they\u2019re looking for, their unique needs, and if they deem appropriate for 1/1/16,\u201d says Smith.\n\nAnn Marie Cook, CEO of LifeSpan, says it\u2019s good for people to have another place to go. She says her organization takes questions from more than 5,000 older adults each year.\n\n\u201cA couple of questions that come up all the time are: \u201cAre my doctors [going to] accept this insurance? And what about prescription drugs?\u201d It\u2019s the big thing. \u201cWill this plan cover all my prescription drugs?\u201d So, we go through with people, make the whole list, and then make sure they understand the costs,\u201d says Cook.\n\nIn Monroe, Ontario, and Wayne Counties, the average premium for 2016 Medicare Advantage plans is $74 dollars, about a 10 percent increase over last year. This year, consumers will find more plans without premiums.\n\nFollowing the trend for the area, Excellus premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are up this year. Their 2016 plan premiums range from having no premium to an Optimum plan with a $214 monthly premium.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Older adults in our area have a new place to go to get questions answered about Medicare Advantage plans.
