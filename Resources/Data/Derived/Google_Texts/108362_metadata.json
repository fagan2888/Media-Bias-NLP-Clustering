We have long been opponents to gaming expansion in Colorado, and so have voters who in 2003 resoundingly defeated a similar proposal to add gambling terminals to five Front Range racetracks.\n\nNevertheless, a Rhode Island company is trying again with the needy K-12 education fund as one benefactor. Two ballot initiatives would ask voters to approve gambling\u2019s expansion into Arapahoe, Pueblo and Mesa counties with mega-sized casinos.\n\nThe initiatives would add slots, table games and video lottery terminals at the Aurora racetrack and \u201ctwo future horse racetracks\u201d in Pueblo and Mesa counties, according to an article in The Gazette.\n\nThe casinos, at a minimum, would have 2,500 slot machines. The state\u2019s largest casino in Black Hawk now has 1,500 slots.\n\nTo entice voters, 34 percent of the casinos\u2019 profits and a one-time payment of $25 million would go to K-12 education. Also, host communities would get a one-time payment of $10 million and 2 percent of annual profits.\n\nColorado doesn\u2019t need any more gaming.\n\nCasinos on the Front Range would effectively kill the mountain towns where casinos were approved by voters in the 1990s.\n\nAlso lost would be gaming tax revenues from those casinos \u2014 which in 20 years have provided $1.3 billion for programs ranging from historic preservation to the state\u2019s general fund, and more recently to community colleges as well, which get proceeds from gaming thanks to Amendment 50 passed by voters in 2008.\n\nBut the downsides of expanded gambling would be greater than any monetary benefit, even if it were for such a worthy cause as our children\u2019s education.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado doesn\u2019t need new casinos", "title": "Colorado doesn\u2019t need new casinos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/14/colorado-doesnt-need-new-casinos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__20140317_A13_OP17E_GAMBLINGp1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__20140317_A13_OP17E_GAMBLINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-14T17:45:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:00:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9d4\"", "article_summary": "Nevertheless, a Rhode Island company is trying again with the needy K-12 education fund as one benefactor.\nCasinos on the Front Range would effectively kill the mountain towns where casinos were approved by voters in the 1990s.\nTo entice voters, 34 percent of the casinos\u2019 profits and a one-time payment of $25 million would go to K-12 education.\nTwo ballot initiatives would ask voters to approve gambling\u2019s expansion into Arapahoe, Pueblo and Mesa counties with mega-sized casinos.\nFirst, legalized marijuana sweetened the pot for school construction, and now comes two proposed ballot initiatives to expand gaming and pour millions into K-12 education."}
