Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Brian Maynard has filed a lawsuit against CGI Technologies and Solutions Inc. in an effort to understand why the now defunct Kentucky Health Cooperative managed to fail financially.

In a press release Maynard says CGI was hired to process and pay claims for the Co-op, but the suit states that CGI was “grossly negligent” in carrying out their duties and was in breach of contract.

The Co-op was created in 2012 under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. After suffering severe financial losses, the Co-op was placed in rehabilitation in 2015 and placed into liquidation early this year when it was determined that the Co-op would never recover from its deep deficit.
