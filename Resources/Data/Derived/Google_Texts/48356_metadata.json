John McCain is calling for the end of sequestration.\n\nMcCain, R-Ariz, was joined by military experts at The Heritage Foundation Wednesday to discuss the future of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which outlines the budget expenditures for the Department of Defense.\n\nThe NDAA for fiscal year 2016 is being negotiated between the House and the Senate, and a final version is expected to pass in the next few weeks.\n\nThis authorization bill determines where military funding will be spent, but an appropriations bill must also be passed in order to authorize the government to actually spend that money.\n\n\u201cWe need new ideas,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe must champion the cause of defense reform.\u201d\n\nMcCain said sequestration must be repealed because he says it is preventing military personnel from performing at optimum capacity.\n\nThe term sequestration refers to automatic defense budget cuts.\n\n\u201cMy friends, we can\u2019t abide by a system that puts the men and women who are serving this nation at a greater risk,\u201d McCain said.\n\nThe White House has threatened to veto the defense bill once it reaches the president\u2019s desk.\n\nThe bill would authorize boosting the defense budget by adding money to a war fund that is not subject to budget caps, known as sequestration, which President Obama opposes.\n\nMcCain said he is \u201cconcerned\u201d the president will veto the bill.\n\nBut experts think that choice would not be in the White House\u2019s best interests.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a big mistake for the commander-in-chief to veto this bill,\u201d said John Bonsell, a former minority staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nTypically, the bill receives bipartisan support, although the number of amendments to this year\u2019s bill has stimulated increased debate in the Senate.\n\nThe White House is opposed to some amendments, including those related to Guantanamo Bay and ones that would decrease federal spending.\n\nAmong Congress, the majority of the disagreements are not regarding reduced defense spending.\n\n\u201cThis disagreement is about the non-defense part of the bill,\u201d Todd Harrison said. \u201cThis is not about the defense budget. The fight is about non-defense.\u201d\n\nAccording to Roger Zakheim, visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former deputy staff director of the House Armed Services Committee, every year there is a \u201csquirrel\u201d in the NDAA bill\u2014some unforeseen issue that suddenly arises and must be solved before the legislation is passed.\n\nIt is uncertain what the \u201csquirrel\u201d will be for the 2016 NDAA bill.\n\nThe legislation has been passed for 53 consecutive years. The House passed its version of the bill in May and the Senate passed its legislation in June, but the bills must now be reconciled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Congress debates the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Sen.
