They didn\u2019t ask the government to go steal it from somebody and give it to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the lawsuit, Latter Day Deliverance Center claims that it uses this land for ministry activities such as setting up youth centers, food pantries and providing education assistance to the community.\n\nThe Houston Housing Authority, however, saw an opportunity to use that \u201cundeveloped\u201d property for a greater public good.\n\nGunsolley maintains that public good isn\u2019t a for-profit medical center, but rather an affordable housing project.\n\nYet Gunsolley did acknowledge that the idea to build a medical center on the church property was featured in a proposal drawn up by the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation.\n\nThe Houston Housing Authority works with this organization, he said, but the housing agency \u201chad nothing to do with that other than we were there at a table as people were talking about it.\u201d\n\nTo obtain this property, the Houston Housing Authority began the eminent domain process in March, after it became clear that Latter Day Deliverance Revival Center was refusing to leave.\n\nGunsolley says the Housing Authority has pursued only lots located \u201cacross the street\u201d from the physical church building, but not the church itself. He said the city can\u2019t move forward with the renewal project without securing this \u201cstrip\u201d of land.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t work around the Latter Day Deliverance Revival Center church alley strip down the center of the parcel, and that\u2019s why we had to use eminent domain,\u201d he said.\n\nGunsolley insists that the Housing Authority has not yet started the eminent domain process on the second church, Christian Fellowship Missionary Church, which is on the same city block as Latter Day.\n\nIn fact, until this week, Gunsolley was under the impression that the owner of Christian Fellowship Missionary wanted to sell.\n\n\u201cIt was a shock to see the videos and the narratives out there,\u201d he said of the allegations that have come about as a result of the lawsuit. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken any steps toward them to take their church.\u201d\n\nSasser, who is in close communication with the church leaders, accused the city of \u201ctrying to bully the elderly\u201d in negotiating deals with Christian Fellowship\u2019s 73-year-old pastor \u201cwhile he was having bad health.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s distasteful,\u201d Sasser said. \u201cYou would think if they\u2019re being so fair and it\u2019s such a great thing for the community, that they wouldn\u2019t have to go around making side deals.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, Sasser argues that the city\u2019s plans to use eminent domain on the churches\u2019 properties violate their rights as defined by the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Texas Constitution.\n\nUnder eminent domain, the government can seize property for economic development so long as it\u2019s for a \u201cpublic use.\u201d\n\nBy appealing to the state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Sasser raises the bar for the Houston Housing Authority to justify taking the churches\u2019 property.\n\nThe Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act ensures that \u201ca government agency may not substantially burden a person\u2019s free exercise of religion [unless it] demonstrates that the application of the burden to the person \u2026 is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest [and] is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to meet the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] standard and there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to meet it,\u201d Sasser said.\n\nIf the court accepts this argument and the city is unable to meet the Religious Freedom Restoration Act standards, the Houston Housing Authority could be forced to withdraw from the restoration project completely.\n\nGunsolley explains:\n\nThe sad thing is, if the outcome is, they win, then I think that block is going to stay decrepit for the foreseeable future. [The churches] haven\u2019t made any progress on executing a vision on redeveloping that block. Most of the houses are in extreme disrepair. It needs help and it needs investment, and we are trying to invest in that community.\n\nSasser sees it differently, and he believes that the churches have had an extraordinary impact on the community.\n\nThey\u2019re very proud of their neighborhood, they\u2019re very proud of their efforts, and they should be. They\u2019ve done a great job of turning things around. They did such a great job in turning things around that the city of Houston is coming along and saying, \u2018Gee, we\u2019ll take it from here. Thank you so much for cleaning this area up. It does look quite valuable. Thank you so much for doing the hard work for us even though we weren\u2019t going to lift a finger one bit to help you along the way beforehand.\u2019\n\nBoth sides will appear before a hearing in two weeks, where a court will decide if the Houston Housing Authority will be allowed to move forward and take control of the churches\u2019 property.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Under eminent domain, the city of Houston threatens to bulldoze the property of two historic black churches.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Under eminent domain, the city of Houston threatens to bulldoze the property of two historic black churches.", "title": "Churches Sue Houston for Trying to Take Property", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ChurchLawsuit-COVER.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-06T09:31:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gaCs7L"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Under eminent domain, the city of Houston threatens to bulldoze the property of two historic black churches.", "title": "Churches Sue Houston for Trying to Take Property", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ChurchLawsuit-COVER.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "constitution", "published_time": "2015-08-06T03:01:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T09:31:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "houston churches, Houston Housing Authority, eminent domain, liberty institute, black churches, houston, texas churches"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201dThe Houston Housing Authority disputes Sasser\u2019s account, stating the agency never attempted to \u201csteal\u201d these churches in the first place.\nThe Houston Housing Authority, however, saw an opportunity to use that \u201cundeveloped\u201d property for a greater public good.\n\u201c[The Houston Housing Authority] wants to steal these churches, bulldoze them and use them for a parking lot for a doctor\u2019s office,\u201d said Hiram Sasser, a Texas attorney for the Liberty Institute representing the churches.\nThe Houston Housing Authority found itself in the middle of a sticky lawsuit this week when the agency tried to use eminent domain to \u201csteal\u201d two historic churches\u2019 property as part of an urban renewal project.\n\u201cWe had not begun any eminent domain process against any church building,\u201d Tory Gunsolley, president and CEO of the Houston Housing Authority, told The Daily Signal."}
