Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the rules a \u201cdagger in the heart of the American middle class, and to representative democracy itself,\u201d while Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt promised to \u201cfight President Obama every step of the way to stop this unprecedented power grab.\u201d Of course, as a rule issued under established powers for the EPA, this is the opposite of a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nIf Republicans are outraged by the announcement, they only have themselves to blame. It is true that in recent months, the administration has been vocal\u2014even strident\u2014about the danger of climate change. In February, for example, Secretary of State John Kerry derided global warming deniers as members of the \u201cFlat Earth Society\u201d who are \u201cburying their heads in the sand.\u201d At the same time, the White House didn\u2019t begin with a regulatory approach.\n\nIn 2009, President Obama threw his support behind climate legislation in the House, and the following year, a group of Senate Democrats\u2014including Kerry\u2014began work with Republicans to craft a bipartisan climate bill. The process fell apart, a victim of bad management from the White House, election year politics, an embattled and fearful Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2014the South Carolina senator at the center of the negotiations\u2014and the growing tide of Republican anti-Obama sentiment, which would culminate that fall with a huge GOP victory in the House of Representatives.*\n\nRepublican obstructionism is leading to larger and more liberal outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not that EPA action wasn\u2019t possible, but that the administration wanted legislation and would make key concessions to get it. In the absence of a law, however, the White House was prepared to act alone. \u201cIf Republicans didn\u2019t respond to the proposed deals,\u201d wrote The New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza, \u201cthe White House could push them to the table by making a threat through the Environmental Protection Agency, which had recently been granted power to regulate carbon, just as it regulates many other air pollutants.\u201d\n\nWith a little cooperation, Republicans could have won a better outcome for their priorities. They could have exempted coal from more stringent spectrum of regulations, enriched their constituencies with new subsidies and benefits, and diluted a key Democratic priority. Instead, they\u2019ll now pay a steep substantive price for their obstruction, in the form of rules that are tougher\u2014and more liberal\u2014than anything that could have passed Congress.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time Republicans have sabotaged themselves. The entire story of Obamacare is a case study in the self-defeating futility of GOP obstruction.\n\nAt various points in 2009 and 2010, Republicans could have transformed the Affordable Care Act. During the \u201cGang of Six\u201d negotiations, when Sen. Max Baucus worked for months to win support from his GOP colleagues on the Finance Committee, Republicans could have won major concessions in exchange for their votes. That was true again after Scott Brown\u2019s win in the Massachusetts special election for the Senate. By beating Martha Coakley, Brown had cracked the party\u2019s filibuster-proof majority, giving leverage to Republicans and leaving Democrats shook from surprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is vital that we restore the respect of the American people in our system of government and in our leaders. To that end, I believe it would only be fair and prudent that we suspend further votes on health care legislation until Senator-elect Brown is seated,\u201d said then-Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, calling for Democrats to hold off on further action. Likewise, conservative Democrats like Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska called on President Obama to restart the whole enterprise and look for broad, bipartisan solutions.\n\nWith a single fig leaf of cooperation, Sen. McConnell could have broken the Democratic coalition for a comprehensive reform bill and dismantled the existing proposal. Had he and any other Republican been willing to play ball, they could have built a modest reform plan that left even more of the current system intact, forcing Democrats\u2014and liberals in particular\u2014to take less than half a loaf.\n\nInstead, the party doubled-down on its opposition. It refused to budge, and in doing so, gave Democrats time to regroup and recover their nerve. Which is what happened. And less than two months after Sen. Scott Brown \u201cdoomed\u201d health care reform, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, creating a new wing of the American welfare state.\n\nMoreover, with its new taxes, new subsidies, and generous Medicaid expansion, it was larger and more liberal than it would have been in a world where Republicans\u2014and not conservative Democrats\u2014formed the right-most pole of debate and negotiation. Indeed, this dynamic\u2014Republican obstruction leading to more liberal outcomes\u2014has continued with the implementation of Obamacare. The law was designed with some decentralization in mind. Rather than a single national exchange for health insurance, lawmakers went with 50 individual exchanges, that states could run as they wanted. But, as Politico reports, a combination of technical problems and Republican obstruction have left us with the emergence of a de facto national system:\n\nThe federal option was supposed to be a limited and temporary fallback. But a shift to a bigger, more permanent Washington-controlled system is instead underway\u2014without preparation, funding or even public discussion about what a national exchange covering millions of Americans means for the future of U.S. health care. It\u2019s coming about because intransigent Republicans shunned state exchanges, and ambitious Democrats bungled them.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine a future 20 years hence where a Democratic president is signing the law that brings a \u201cpublic option\u201d to the national health exchanges that grew out of this development. Or, put another way, after five years of relentless obstruction in the name of small government, Republicans may have helped set the stage for a world where government is much bigger\u2014and expansive\u2014than it is now. And if it happens, we should remember to thank Republicans for helping to make it possible.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Republican Party\u2019s self-defeating efforts are
