Clodfelter, an attorney at the firm of Moore and Van Allen (which is, ironically enough, Governor McCrory\u2019s old employer) offered a lengthy and detailed presentation in which he explained the history of the Asheville system and the almost comically ham-fisted efforts of conservative legislators to remove the system from city control as part of a longstanding partisan battle.\n\nManning, one of the state\u2019s most experienced and respected jurists, clearly grasped the legal (and political) realities of the case from the outset of the hearing.\n\nAt one point, after Clodfelter had explained in great detail how clear it was that the bill had been designed only to target Asheville (a fact that would likely make it unconstitutional given that the state constitution bars the legislature from passing local bills dealing with health and sanitation) Manning remarked that the only thing that would have made the legislature\u2019s intent to target Asheville more obvious would have been a provision spelling out that the affected area would \u201chave to have the Grove Park Inn.\u201d\n\nAt another, Manning also brought up (and analogized to) the General Assembly\u2019s equally controversial efforts to seize Charlotte Douglas International Airport from the city of Charlotte.\n\nManning did not indicate how or when he would rule on the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint or the city\u2019s request to have the temporary restraining order previously issued in the case converted into a preliminary injunction while the matter proceeds to trial.\n\nFor more detailed information on the long saga of the Asheville water system, check out the stories of reporter Mark Barrett in the Asheville Citizen-Times (his most recent one can be found here), David Forbes\u2019 stories at the Mountain Xpress and the website Save Our Water WNC.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6e4\"", "article_summary": "For more detailed information on the long saga of the Asheville water system, check out the stories of reporter Mark Barrett in the Asheville Citizen-Times (his most recent one can be found here), David Forbes\u2019 stories at the Mountain Xpress and the website Save Our Water WNC.\nManning, one of the state\u2019s most experienced and respected jurists, clearly grasped the legal (and political) realities of the case from the outset of the hearing.\nThough the hearing featured a great deal of give and take between the judge and the lawyers, the argument was clearly dominated by Asheville\u2019s lawyer, Mecklenburg County Senator Dan Clodfelter.\nClodfelter, an attorney at the firm of Moore and Van Allen (which is, ironically enough, Governor McCrory\u2019s old employer) offered a lengthy and detailed presentation in which he explained the history of the Asheville system and the almost comically ham-fisted efforts of conservative legislators to remove the system from city control as part of a longstanding partisan battle.\nManning did not indicate how or when he would rule on the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint or the city\u2019s request to have the temporary restraining order previously issued in the case converted into a preliminary injunction while the matter proceeds to trial."}
