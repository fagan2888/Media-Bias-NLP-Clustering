If his policy positions on issues like climate change and energy policy are any clue \u2014 not to mention sexual identity and marriage equality \u2014 we can expect a lot of detached-from-reality quibbling.\n\nDespite Carson\u2019s profession, which requires some level of respect for science, he rejects the science on climate change, a stance that not only puts him at odds with 97 percent of scientists globally, but also 88 percent of African-American physicians. That\u2019s pretty terrifying, considering that the National Draft Ben Carson for President PAC out-raised the popular Ready for Hillary PAC last year.\n\nApparently there are a lot of people out there who know Carson is performing malpractice with the facts on climate change, and will still pay a whole lot of money to see him in the White House \u2014 an affirmative action move that a lot of those same people would not tolerate under any other conditions.\n\nBelow are seven more reasons to be terrified of Carson\u2019s candidacy \u2014 quotes from Carson explaining his positions on a range of issues, from climate change and energy policy to Obamacare and jobs:\n\nCarson on not accepting climate change science: \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be either cooling or warming going on. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s irrelevant. What is relevant is that we have an obligation and a responsibility to protect our environment.\u201d\n\nYes! There are cool days and warm days. And days that are neither, according to Stringer Bell\u2019s 40-degree day theory. But to protect the environment responsibly you need to know the difference between hot and cold, and the planet is warming, unequivocally. This shouldn\u2019t be brain surgery, Dr. Carson. This is what rapid warming over decades looks like:\n\nCarson on data: \u201cThe wonderful thing about medicine \u2014 when you show data, it changes people\u2019s minds. That doesn\u2019t happen in politics.\u201d\n\nBut all those scientists and black physicians showed you the data on climate change, and it hasn\u2019t changed your mind? Bye, Felicia.\n\nCarson on the EPA: \u201cOur Environmental Protection Agency should be told to work in conjunction with business, industry, and universities to find the most eco-friendly ways of developing our energy resources.\u201d\n\nThe EPA is already doing this! Take the agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan for addressing greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 there are over 2 million public comments on that thing. You know who submitted them? Businesses! Industry trade groups! Universities! The EPA\u2019s environmental justice collaborative problem-solving model begs industries and universities to work with the agency and communities \u2014 even in communities who don\u2019t want to be anywhere near those industries!\n\nCarson on the Keystone XL tar-sands pipeline: \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly safe, so I can\u2019t really see a good reason not to do it.\u201d\n\nDude, you\u2019re a doctor. Since when do you talk with that kind of certainty about anything? If you wouldn\u2019t use those words to describe brain surgery to your patients (and I hope you wouldn\u2019t) then you probably shouldn\u2019t use them to describe Keystone XL, which could add as much as 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon equivalent to the atmosphere. The U.S. Department of State doesn\u2019t even say that the pipeline is perfectly safe.\n\nCarson on Obamacare: \u201cI think [it\u2019s] the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nI can think of a few worse things have happened to this nation since slavery: the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings, Gone With the Wind, Jim Crow, Elvis Presley, Taco Bell, Cuba Gooding Jr., Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Ben Carson in a movie, oh \u2026 and climate change!\n\n\n\nCarson on jobs: \u201cWe need to understand the connection between dynamic economic growth and the general welfare of the people. For anyone who does not understand: Robust economic growth creates plenty of jobs and opportunities for everyone and decreases the need for government dependency.\u201d\n\nI could go in on how Carson needs to understand the connection between climate change and the general welfare of the people, but if the data can\u2019t do it, I have no hope. As for jobs, Here\u2019s James Baldwin addressing a similar point for Esquire in 1968:\n\nWhat [this country is] afraid of is that when the Negro comes into the factory, into the union, when he comes, in fact, into the American institution, he will change these institutions because no Negro in this country really lives by American middle-class standards. That\u2019s why they pick up half-dozen Negroes here and there, and polish them up, polish them off, and put them in some ass-hole college someplace, and expect those cats to be able to go back to the streets and cool the other cats. They can\u2019t. The price in this country to survive at all still is to become a white man. More and more people are refusing to become a white man. That\u2019s the bottom of what they mean by on-the-job training. They mean they want to fit you in. And furthermore, let\u2019s tell it like it is: The American white man does not really want to have [an] autonomous Negro male anywhere near him.\n\nI\u2019ll let Baldwin go in some more on this:\n\nAnd by the way, while we\u2019re on this subject, one of the things we should do is cease protecting all those Texas oil millionaires who are one of the greatest menaces any civilization has ever seen. They have absolutely no brains, and a fantastic amount of money, fantastic amount of power, incredible power. And there\u2019s nothing more dangerous than that kind of power in the hands of such ignorant men. And this is done with consent of the federal government.\n\nA bunch of those Texas millionaires want Carson for president. Or Ted Cruz, another climate denier. Baldwin be knowing.\n\nCarson on America: \u201cRemember when I said at the National Prayer Breakfast, in order for an eagle to fly high and straight, it needs two wings, a left wing and a right wing? \u2026 If you do everything in a lopsided way, my way or the highway, you\u2019re going to crash.\u201d\n\nDood, you do understand that America is not actually an eagle, right? But even if we entertain your metaphor, you know what else causes crashes? Broken wings. And birds end up with broken wings when they don\u2019t pay attention to their environment, and when they can\u2019t tell the difference between hot and cold.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ben-carson.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Brentin Mock", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "The Republican presidential hopeful spouts off on science, the economy, and other things he doesn\u2019t understand.", "title": "It doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to tell Ben Carson is clueless on climate", "url": "http://grist.org/politics/it-doesnt-take-a-brain-surgeon-to-tell-ben-carson-is-clueless-on-climate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ben-carson.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ben-carson.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "grist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-04 19:17:37", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "It doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to tell Ben Carson is clueless on climate", "msapplication-tooltip": "We're an online news organization that uses humor to interpret green issues & inspire environmental action.", "p": {"domain_verify": "c293daabda398bd8ceee45abea0b3201"}, "fb": {"app_id": 548917378618963}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grist.org/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/330e84b0272aae748d059cd70e3f8f8d?s=16", "application-name": "Grist", "sailthru.tags": "article, climate-energy, politics, science, brentin-mock", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grist.org", "published_time": "2015-05-04T23:17:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T22:55:51+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "The Republican presidential hopeful spouts off on science, the economy, and other things he doesn\u2019t understand.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ben-carson.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Republican presidential hopeful spouts off on science, the economy, and other things he doesn\u2019t understand."}, "article_summary": "That doesn\u2019t happen in politics.\u201dBut all those scientists and black physicians showed you the data on climate change, and it hasn\u2019t changed your mind?\nWhat can we expect from the GOP\u2019s latest Black Hope, Dr. Ben Carson, the Baltimore brain surgeon who finally declared his candidacy to be the next African-American president?\nThat\u2019s pretty terrifying, considering that the National Draft Ben Carson for President PAC out-raised the popular Ready for Hillary PAC last year.\nBelow are seven more reasons to be terrified of Carson\u2019s candidacy \u2014 quotes from Carson explaining his positions on a range of issues, from climate change and energy policy to Obamacare and jobs:Carson on not accepting climate change science: \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be either cooling or warming going on.\nThey have absolutely no brains, and a fantastic amount of money, fantastic amount of power, incredible power."}
