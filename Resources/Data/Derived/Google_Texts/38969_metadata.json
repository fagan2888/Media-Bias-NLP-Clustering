Most leaks tend to look like they were taken with a camera built last century. A couple of extra Nintendo NX photos popped up on Reddit today, and they look a lot like the one leaked last week.\n\nHere\u2019s the photo from last week.\n\nAnd the photos from today.\n\nFirst things first, the photos do line up with a touchscreen controller patent from Nintendo. These could be the real thing, or someone is taking the patent sketches and having some fun with the internet. Seems a bit in-depth for a prank, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past some folks.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for one second these are the real deal. Here\u2019s how Reddit user perkele37 (who posted them) describes the controller.\n\n\u2013 Only the upper \u2018nubs\u2019 of the sticks move. The bottom part is static (kind of like the circle pad, but it moves along the bottom \u2018sphere.\u2019\n\n-The rollers on the top feel and look pretty much identical to a mouse scroll-wheel. Though I do don\u2019t believe this will be the final design.[sic] (Note: I assume the user meant \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d)\n\n\u2013 Haptic feedback is feels like Apple\u2019s \u2018taptic\u2019 engine.[sic] Not like regular rumble.\n\n\u2013 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom\n\nThe rumors surrounding Nintendo\u2019s next hardware point to a system that blends a traditional video game console with a portable. Are we looking at the portable part? That\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. I just don\u2019t see how Nintendo could use this kind of controller as the main input device for a home console.\n\nYou think third-party developers shunned Nintendo before? Imagine if the main controller doesn\u2019t have face buttons. I\u2019m sorry, but how the hell are you going to play \u2018regular\u2019 games without them? Then again, this is Nintendo. Thinking outside the box is what they do.\n\nI know one thing. I haven\u2019t been this pumped for E3 in a while. I can\u2019t wait to see what Nintendo has to offer. At the very least, it won\u2019t be boring.\n\nAnd if you feel like going deeper into the rabbit hole, check out the exploding NeoGAF thread. Internet detectives are quick and scary.\n\nDo you think the photos are the real deal? What do you want to see from Nintendo\u2019s next console?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "nintendo, nintendo nx, nintendo nx controller", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "News Ledge", "description": "A couple of extra Nintendo NX photos popped up on Reddit today, and they look a lot like the one leaked last week.", "title": "Rumored Nintendo NX Controller Photos Leak and They Were Taken With a Decent Camera", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1400, "identifier": "https://www.newsledge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nintendo-nx-controller-rumor.jpg", "height": 600}, "url": "https://www.newsledge.com/rumored-nintendo-nx-controller-photos-leak/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.newsledge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nintendo-nx-controller-rumor.jpg", "description": "A couple of extra Nintendo NX photos popped up on Reddit today, and they look a lot like the one leaked last week.", "site": "@news_ledge", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rumored Nintendo NX Controller Photos Leak and They Were Taken With a Decent Camera"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-23T13:50:19-05:00", "fb": {"pages": 1408397179407881, "app_id": 777948519003893}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.newsledge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-nl-new-twitter-300x300.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNewsLedge", "section": "Gaming", "tag": "Nintendo NX", "published_time": "2016-03-23T13:50:19-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A couple of extra Nintendo NX photos popped up on Reddit today, and they look a lot like the one leaked last week."}, "article_summary": "These could be the real thing, or someone is taking the patent sketches and having some fun with the internet.\nA couple of extra Nintendo NX photos popped up on Reddit today, and they look a lot like the one leaked last week.\nFirst things first, the photos do line up with a touchscreen controller patent from Nintendo.\nI just don\u2019t see how Nintendo could use this kind of controller as the main input device for a home console.\nMost leaks tend to look like they were taken with a camera built last century."}
