We have many great boutiques in town to choose from, but at Younique Boutique, you are guaranteed to find amazing customer service and sizes for all women and ages.\n\n\u201cMy sister-in-law, Tammie Hudson, and myself started real small selling jewelry and clothing in what we call trunk shows,\u201d said co-owner Gidgett Overton. \u201cThen last April my sister was getting married and we came here to try on dresses, and Ashley who owned Just For Looks, told me she was going out of business.\u201d\n\nAt first, Overton was unsure that she and her partner were ready to open their own store, but after some deliberation they decided to go for it.\n\n\u201cOne morning I just decided to call and ask some questions,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I called Mr. Kraft [the building\u2019s owner], and he was wonderful. I told him what we were wanting to do and it all sort of fell into place. So we started here in June.\u201d\n\nOverton and Hudson quadrupled their inventory over the past few months and continue to fill the store with even more. You can purchase your favorite mineral way makeup at their store. They are also carrying inventory of wedding gowns and prom dresses from Just For Looks, which are marked down to unthinkably low prices.\n\n\u201cAshley has made all of the wedding dresses $100, $200 or $500,\u201d said Overton. \u201cThere\u2019s not a dress over there priced over $500. All of her prom and pageant dresses are half priced also. We\u2019re just trying to help her get this inventory out.\u201d\n\nThe store is one of the cutest shops you will see. Its large windows are lavishly decorated with fun and colorful d\u00e9cor and display some of their beautiful clothes. The clothes in the store are all boutique style clothing ranging in price from approximately $25 and up. Beautiful dresses, shirts, pants and accessories cover the store. Another great thing about the lines of clothing they choose is that the clothes are made for women with curves as well.\n\n\u201cThe clothing that we are trying to stay with is missy sizing for women,\u201d Overton said. \u201cThe sizing goes all the way from small to 3x. We are trying to stay with vendors that carry those sizes, and I think that makes us a little different. We are hoping to stay unique.\u201d\n\nOverall business has been steady for the two owners, and they are more than happy with their location.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about here is that it\u2019s visual,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great windows, the space, and the parking is great. There is a steady stream of traffic. It\u2019s a great spot. We have been doing well and hope to generate more buzz from word of mouth.\u201d\n\nYounique Boutique has something for everyone with their large inventory and even offer layaway to make shopping more affordable for everyone. If you are looking for sincere and warm customer service, you need look no further.\n\n\u201cI really love helping people feel good about themselves,\u201d Overton said. \u201cWhen I help someone find the perfect outfit or piece of jewelry that helps them feel good and makes them smile, that is what I love. It\u2019s not just about the sale. I want them to leave feeling great about what they bought. For me, that is what is rewarding.\u201d\n\nYounique Boutique is located at 105 2nd Ave SE, Cullman AL, 35055.
