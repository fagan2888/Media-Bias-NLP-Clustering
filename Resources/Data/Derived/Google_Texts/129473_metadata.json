They drive from both the east and west on both major highways, getting material on both sides of the road. The crew gets in about 4 a.m. and they are out before the tourists are out and about. And it has worked really well from our perspective,\u201d Lynn York, for Waste Management, said.\n\nWhen visitors check out of their rental Saturday morning, their trash from all week sits there until Monday or Tuesday.\n\nBoth county officials and waste management say adding an extra day will help.\n\n\"To alleviate the amounts of trash that are there as our tourist are entering and leaving our area, as well as making it safer for the families down there, and not having to deal with trash on the side of the road,\u201d Louis Svehla, Public Information Officer for Walton County, said.\n\nRight now this is just a pilot program, but Commissioners would like to implement it, full time, if it is successful.\n\n\"One of the things that came up is we know we are doing this now, and we had to find the money, so let\u2019s make sure next year if it is a successful program, that it is actually in the budget to provide that service,\u201d Svehla said.\n\nTwo Waste Management trucks are out on the roads Sunday mornings.\n\nIf Commissioners decide to budget this program out for next year, they say they also want to add Sunday trash routes during Spring Break.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walton County Commissioners and Waste Management have put together a trash pilot program that will go from now until Labor Day Weekend.", "language": "english", "author": "Cristina Pfeffer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Walton-County-adds-Sunday-Trash-Route-to-South-Walton-266897211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/logo-WasteManagement.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Walton County Commissioners and Waste Management have put together a trash pilot program that will go from now until Labor Day Weekend.", "title": "Walton County Adds Sunday Trash Route to South Walton"}, "twitter": {"description": "Walton County Commissioners and Waste Management have put together a trash pilot program that will go from now until Labor Day Weekend.", "title": "Walton County Adds Sunday Trash Route to South Walton", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Walton-County-adds-Sunday-Trash-Route-to-South-Walton-266897211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/logo-WasteManagement.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Walton County Adds Sunday Trash Route to South Walton", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Walton County Adds Sunday Trash"}, "article_summary": "This pilot program is a joint project between the Walton County Commissioners and Waste Management.\nTwo Waste Management trucks are out on the roads Sunday mornings.\nBoth county officials and waste management say adding an extra day will help.\nAnd it has worked really well from our perspective,\u201d Lynn York, for Waste Management, said.\nIf Commissioners decide to budget this program out for next year, they say they also want to add Sunday trash routes during Spring Break."}
