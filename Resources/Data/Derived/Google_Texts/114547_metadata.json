REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo\n\n(Reuters Health) \u2013 - People who suffer traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more likely to lose or change their private health insurance coverage just when they need it most, according to a recent U.S. analysis.\n\nExamining a three-year period, researchers also found that the more severe the brain injury, the quicker people lost or saw changes in their health coverage.\n\nMost subjects received health insurance through their jobs, so any change in coverage was likely due to changes in their employment, say the authors of the research letter in JAMA Surgery.\n\n\u201cIndividuals who were the primary policy holder might have lost coverage because they were unable to continue in their job and became unemployed/uninsured,\u201d co- author Eric Schneider of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston told Reuters Health by email.\n\nTraumatic brain injuries account for 2.5 million emergency room visits and 280,000 hospitalizations each year in the U.S., the study team writes. Around 40 percent of traumatic brain injury survivors develop a disability, which can disrupt their ability to work, the researchers note.\n\nSchneider and his colleagues analyzed data from MarketScan, a national commercial database of people with private health insurance and their insurance claims. The team looked at the period between January 2010 and December 2012, comparing 13,558 people under age 65 and treated for traumatic brain injury to similar individuals who did not experience TBI during that period.\n\nThe researchers found that 30.7 percent of people who suffered TBI had changes in their insurance coverage, compared to 27.6 percent of their counterparts without TBI.\n\nThe data included diagnostic information about the degree of injury, and the study team found that people with the most severe brain injuries had the shortest time between getting hurt and an experiencing an insurance change, at just under five months. People without TBI averaged about 8.5 months before a shift in their coverage.\n\nFor traumatic brain injury patients, continuing healthcare is important, since treatment often continues long after the injury occurs, said neurosurgeon Dr. Kimon Bekelis, an instructor at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cSome of these patients receive prolonged rehabilitation, whereas others require frequent hospitalizations and multiple re-operations,\u201d said Bekelis, who was not involved in the study.\n\nMany patients may experience seizures and are prescribed costly long-term medications, Bekelis said by email. \u201cA potential interruption of insurance coverage for these patients and their dependents can have catastrophic consequences.\u201d\n\nFor patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries, longer-term treatment can make a big difference in their long-term recovery, Schneider said.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that having continuous coverage may be most important to patients with the most severe injuries; however, in our study, these are the severely injured individuals who were the quickest to change (or lose) their pre-injury coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe data did not include an explanation of why people changed coverage status. It\u2019s possible that health coverage could change for a variety of reasons, including becoming eligible for different insurance programs based on disability, Schneider said.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that for some people, brain injuries may not be serious, he noted. \u201cFor others, TBI can be a life-changing experience with substantial long-term consequences that affect the individual\u2019s ability to work and function in their family and society for the remainder of their lives. Continuous care can be very important for individuals with TBI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese findings should alert policy makers, payers, physicians, and patients for this unrecognized and potentially dangerous source of inefficient healthcare delivery,\u201d Bekelis said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1R7P80t JAMA Surgery, online March 2, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brain, injury, health, insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who suffer traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more likely to lose or change their private health insurance coverage just when they need it most, according to a recent U.S. analysis.", "title": "Brain Injury Linked To Increased Risk Of Losing Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-injury-linked-losing-health-insurance-377519", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/2016-03-10t164448z1lynxnpec29155rtroptp3hungary.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who suffer traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more likely to lose or change their private health insurance coverage just when they need it most, according to a recent U.S. analysis.", "title": "Brain Injury Linked To Increased Risk Of Losing Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-injury-linked-losing-health-insurance-377519", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/2016-03-10t164448z1lynxnpec29155rtroptp3hungary.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/2016-03-10t164448z1lynxnpec29155rtroptp3hungary.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2016-03-11T10:56:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-11T10:56:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who suffer traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more likely to lose or change their private health insurance coverage just when they need it most, according to a recent U.S. analysis."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b5d\"", "article_summary": "Schneider and his colleagues analyzed data from MarketScan, a national commercial database of people with private health insurance and their insurance claims.\nAround 40 percent of traumatic brain injury survivors develop a disability, which can disrupt their ability to work, the researchers note.\nTraumatic brain injuries account for 2.5 million emergency room visits and 280,000 hospitalizations each year in the U.S., the study team writes.\nExamining a three-year period, researchers also found that the more severe the brain injury, the quicker people lost or saw changes in their health coverage.\nREUTERS/Bernadett Szabo(Reuters Health) \u2013 - People who suffer traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more likely to lose or change their private health insurance coverage just when they need it most, according to a recent U.S. analysis."}
