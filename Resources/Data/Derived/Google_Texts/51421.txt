Mark Levin: Boehner is the biggest spending, biggest borrowing, most profligate Speaker in American history (TRT: 28)

LEVIN: The entire summer, while he was leading these reelection efforts, so forth and so on, he was working a backroom deal with Obama to pass to biggest spending bill in American history, and to fund every penny of ObamaCare. Do you know what the Boehner legacy is, Sean, in the last four years? Heâ€™s been the biggest spending, biggest borrowing, most profligate Speaker in American history and that includes Nancy Pelosi.
