The human cost of the war on drugs is the subject of ReasonTV's new documentary, America’s Longest War. A 2013 Anthem Film Festival grand prize winner, America's Longest War uses archival footage and personal stories to demonstrate how the war on drugs has eviscerated civil liberties, strained the prison system to its breaking point, saddled Americans with billions in debt, and left more than 60,000 Mexicans dead. With your support, we hope America’s Longest War will help spur change in America’s misguided drug laws.

The Cato Institue will be hosting a screening of the film on Thursday, September 19 at 4 p.m. ET in the Hayek Auditorium. The screening will be followed by a panel discussion featuring ReasonTV's Paul Feine, who directed and produced America's Longest War, American Enterprise Institute Fellow Michael Barone, and Laura W. Murphy, Director of the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office. Please register for this event.

Reason will be hosting a screening at the French Institute in New York City on Tuesday, September 24, starting at 6:30 p.m. The screening will be followed by a panel discussion featuring Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, John Tierney of the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal's Mary O'Grady, New York City Councilmember Melissa Mark-Viverito, and America's Longest War Director Paul Feine.
