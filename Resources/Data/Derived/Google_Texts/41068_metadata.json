The fine chain from which the cross dangled wound once around her wrist, trailing across a white baptism shawl trimmed in fringe. The necklace was a family heirloom handed down from the baby\u2019s namesake\u2014her long-departed great-grandmother. Before we left for the church, the godmother draped the chain around the baby\u2019s neck and closed the clasp.\n\nMuch has been made of the Francis Effect \u2014 the magnetic, humanitarian charm of His Holiness \u2014 drawing back parishioners who had given up on the church, but it also extends to those of us who might have never been drawn to Catholicism in the first place. When the Francis Effect landed at our doorstep, it inspired me to entrust the Catholic Church with no less than my daughter\u2019s spiritual heart.\n\nMy husband and I, 10 years into our marriage, discussed having a child. There was much to consider. Could we afford it? Did we have the energy? Then, a question that took me quite by surprise: Would you, he asked, be willing to raise the baby Catholic? As a former punk rock kid recently returned to my liberal Presbyterian roots, his request gave me pause.\n\nMy introduction to Catholicism was inauspicious. In 2003, my husband and I, still newlyweds, arrived at an Army post to which he had been assigned. At the newcomers fair, we stopped to chat with the priest from the post\u2019s Catholic chapel. My husband explained that we\u2019d had a hasty legal marriage before he deployed, but we were interested in a church ceremony.\n\n\u201cIt might be a little complicated\u201d my husband said. \u201cYou see, I\u2019m divorced\u2026\u201d The priest winced. \u201cAnd the marriage wasn\u2019t annulled.\u201d A prickling, uneasy heat traveled up my legs. \u201cAnd my wife isn\u2019t Catholic\u2026\u201d The priest winced again.\n\nWe waited for the priest to say something about helping us plan, or at least invite us to his parish office for further discussion.\n\n\u201cMike, to be honest, I\u2019m worried about your mortal soul.\u201d\n\nMy husband looked like he\u2019d been gut-shot.\n\nI was speechless. Who says that? Who thinks that?\n\nOver a decade later, I agreed, after much deliberation, to a Catholic upbringing for our daughter, born last spring. Why? The cheeky answer would be that marriage involves compromise, even if I only make it a biannual event. In seriousness, credit is due, in no small part, to His Holiness. In his view, our interfaith union is a blessing, not an abomination. He has said that any Christian marriage is a \u201creal vocation, just like priesthood and religious life\u2026\u201d If he held a scorched-earth view like that Army priest, I wouldn\u2019t have considered it, but Francis carries the marks of a social reformer, on this issue and several others. Where I once saw intimidation, I now saw promise. That the pontiff once worked as a bouncer only added to his credibility.\n\nI worried that anti-religion or atheist friends would assume that willingness to have my daughter baptized represented a drift toward the fanatical on my part. But baptism, I found, can bring out a softness even in the most cynical. Maybe because there is a child involved. Maybe there\u2019s something about innocence that reaches us where intellect cannot.\n\nA baptism can turn into a ritual done by rote, the purpose obscured by the busywork of shopping for the white dress, ordering invitations, planning the lunch. Hostess anxiety kicked in. Did I want to serve chicken marsala or orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage? The wrong dress was delivered, a stiff organza festooned with iridescent sequins that resembled an elaborate lampshade. The bakery promised a cake with a cross of pink frosting roses \u2014 I pictured the blush of a new petal, ballet slippers. Instead, I opened the box to find a shade that could best be described as Vegas Bordello, or possibly Flamingo Explosion.\n\nIntention returned to the fore when we sat down with Sister Kathy for the pre-Baptism interview. Gentle and kind, she saw no issue with ours being an interfaith marriage, and the fate of our mortal souls was not brought into question. At the conclusion, she asked, What do you like about the Catholic Church, and what would you like to see change?\n\nMy husband felt that priests should be allowed to marry and have families, and that divorced parishioners and non-Catholics should not be forbidden from taking communion. I wanted to see women in governing roles, as well as significant advancement on gay and transgender issues.\n\nWhat about Catholicism appealed to me? Despite not feeling the call to conversion, there was much that I loved. The prominence of Mary and the saints, and the sensory richness of Mass, the colors and the Latin recitations, the heady incense as the censer swings by. I admired the rituals woven into everyday life. Crossing yourself in a moment of duress or gratitude, or appealing to Saint Anthony when you\u2019ve misplaced something. Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony, please come down. What was lost must now be found. Around the robust Christian comedy circuit, Presbyterians are referred to as \u201cThe Chosen Frozen,\u201d and that buttoned-up austerity has its limits. For whatever reservations I had about Catholicism, there\u2019s something right up-front about it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I once saw the church as intimidating, but now I saw promise.
