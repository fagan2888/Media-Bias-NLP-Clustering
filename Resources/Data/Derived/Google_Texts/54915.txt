“Rand Paul is the strongest defender of liberty and the Constitution in the United States Senate,” Amash said in a statement. “Every day, Senator Paul stands up to the Washington machine and puts regular Americans first.

“With his focus on individual rights, economic freedom, and limited government, Rand Paul is connecting with people of all ages and backgrounds, including people who normally do not vote Republican,” he added.

Amash previously endorsed Paul's father, then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), when he ran for president in 2012.

Amash has taken libertarian stances on issues including criminal justice reform and broken with other Republicans on normalizing relations with Cuba.

His frequent clashes with House GOP leadership have made him a target of some Republican groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce backed his last primary opponent. Amash, though, won some financial support from the Club for Growth and was able to draw from his own personal wealth as he beat back the challenge.

Amash is the sixth lawmaker to throw his support behind Paul, according to The Hill's list of 2016 endorsements.
