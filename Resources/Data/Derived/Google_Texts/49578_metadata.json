That brought up Gonzalez, and Counsell countered by calling on Smith, who quickly got ahead in the count, 0-2.\n\nOn his fourth offering, Smith hung a slider enough for Gonzalez to reach out and golf it just over the wall in right to give the Dodgers their first lead of the day at 4-3.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good hitter,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to walk him there. I just gave it up. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSaid Counsell: \u201cWe had the matchups we wanted late in the game. It worked as good as we could have hoped. We had our guys pitching to who we wanted them to pitch to. A good hitter, a good pitcher.\n\n\u201cIt was just a slider that Will left in the zone, 0-2. He threw two good ones to get to 0-2, and he just left a slider in the zone.\u201d\n\nSmith (4-1) came into the day with a 1.62 ERA in 41 appearances and had posted an ERA of 0.87 over his previous 22 appearances. He hadn\u2019t surrendered a homer since Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cYou feel good about your first half, but that\u2019s in the past. Once the day\u2019s over, the day\u2019s over,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get the job done that day, and I didn\u2019t do it today.\u201d\n\nJonathan Broxton relieved Smith and finished the inning, but Kenley Jansen pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to close the Brewers out for his 16th save.\n\nThe Brewers managed just one base runner over the final five innings \u2014 a fifth-inning single by Jonathan Lucroy.\n\nMilwaukee got onto the board quickly in the first, with Braun celebrating his sixth selection to the All-Star Game earlier in the day by hitting a booming homer to right-center.\n\nThe Dodgers got the run back quickly against Kyle Lohse, as Jimmy Rollins led off the bottom of the first with a double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on a single back through the box by Justin Turner.\n\nThe Brewers got another homer in the third inning to grab the lead back, this time from an unlikely source \u2014 Hernan Perez, whose shot to left was the first of his career.\n\nThe homers also came against an unlikely pitcher, as Dodgers left-hander Brett Anderson entered the game having allowed just seven all season and only one other time surrendering two in a game.\n\nAnderson also led the majors with a 68.2% ground-ball rate.\n\n\u201cHe works really fast,\u201d said Braun of Anderson. \u201cA lot of movement, especially for a lefty. I can see why he gets as many ground balls as he does \u2014 it\u2019s really difficult to hit the ball in the air against him. There\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s been as successful as he has.\u201d\n\nThree consecutive singles to open the fourth by Adam Lind, Aramis Ramirez and Jean Segura kept the pressure on Anderson.\n\nPerez upped the Brewers\u2019 lead to 3-1 with an RBI groundout, but Ramirez was easily thrown out at home on a bunt back to Anderson by Lohse, and Khris Davis grounded out as well to leave Milwaukee to settle for the lone run.\n\nLohse, meanwhile, settled in after the first. He retired nine of 10 after Turner\u2019s first-inning single.\n\nA.J. Ellis \u2014 an off-season resident of Franklin, Wis. \u2014 led off the Dodgers\u2019 fifth with a homer to center to cut the Brewers\u2019 lead to 3-2.\n\nLohse finished out the inning and then departed in favor of Michael Blazek, who combined with Neal Cotts to keep Los Angeles scoreless in the sixth. Lohse allowed four hits and two runs (earned) while striking out six in an 81-pitch outing.\n\nAs for the Brewers (38-52), there\u2019s plenty to improve upon heading into the second half. Being in position to sweep the Dodgers on the road for the second consecutive season, then losing the series, was a tough way to finish up.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tough games, man,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a bunch of tough games lately. But that\u2019s the game \u2014 you put one of your best pitchers against one of their best guys, and you watch the matchup.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Brewers enter all-star break on sour note", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/brewers-at-dodgers-b99536233z1-314012831.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/gonzo1.jpg", "height": 1280}, "type": "article", "description": "Brewers pitcher Will Smith surrendered a two-run home run in the eighth inning to Adrian Gonzalez and that proved to be the difference in a 4-3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.", "title": "Brewers enter all-star break on sour note"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/gonzo1.jpg", "description": "Brewers pitcher Will Smith surrendered a two-run home run in the eighth inning to Adrian Gonzalez and that proved to be the difference in a 4-3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brewers enter all-star break on sour note"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4ec\"", "article_summary": "By of theLos Angeles \u2014 Will Smith ended a great personal first half on a tough note on Sunday afternoon.\nEllis \u2014 an off-season resident of Franklin, Wis. \u2014 led off the Dodgers\u2019 fifth with a homer to center to cut the Brewers\u2019 lead to 3-2.\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d said Smith after the Brewers dropped to 30-1 when leading after seven innings.\nAs for the Brewers (38-52), there\u2019s plenty to improve upon heading into the second half.\nThe Brewers managed just one base runner over the final five innings \u2014 a fifth-inning single by Jonathan Lucroy."}
