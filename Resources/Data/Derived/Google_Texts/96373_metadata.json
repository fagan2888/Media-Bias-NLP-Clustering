(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s problems with his signature legislation are multiplying. Here are the biggest:\n\n1. The media stopped believing him and taking him seriously. His remarks Tuesday were nothing he hadn\u2019t said before. He said Obamacare wouldn\u2019t be \u201crepealed\u201d on his watch; but the question is whether it will simply cease to function. Pumping up his supporters and saying everything will work out didn\u2019t even pep up the MSNBC commenters who asked plaintively, \u201cDo you think that the bully pulpit though has lost some of its power at this point?\u201d Howard Fineman complained that he hadn\u2019t expected Obama to launch \u201ca form of another political campaign today.\u201d If he can\u2019t spin the true believers, will ordinary Americans take him serious? The spotty information doled out by the administration is only serving to annoy the media even more, leading to stormy briefing room face-offs.\n\n2. Young people are unlikely to bail him out. The president said it himself when Obamacare first launched: It depends on getting a whole bunch of young people into the program. So far scattered reports suggest those who have enrolled tend to be older and sicker. The Post reports Obamacare won\u2019t be sustainable if less than 40 percent of exchange participants are young, healthy people: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t help the president that young people seem to be the least attuned to the new law. What\u2019s more, early problems with the federal health-care exchange Web site didn\u2019t make it an easier for the administration to woo the young people it badly needs to sign up for coverage. It\u2019s too early to say whether the administration will meet its mark when it comes to signing up the young and healthy. In populous California, where officials have released age-based data, almost a quarter of enrollees were 18-34 during October, a number officials say they expect to see climb in the coming months. But if it doesn\u2019t, that will not bode well for Obamacare.\u201d\n\n3. People don\u2019t know whether they have insurance or not. Insurers don\u2019t know who is covered. Mass confusion may reign in January as customers and insurers try to figure out who to bill and who to enroll. One can easily imagine seriously ill people for whom the insurance carrier has no record. The sickest people will be the ones fighting hardest to establish their coverage, yet another source of adverse selection.\n\n4. Concerns remain about security. Right now the threat of identity theft is abstract, albeit understandable. However, if and when an actual victim steps forward it will in all likelihood get wide coverage and create a huge disincentive for others to sign up.\n\n5. Democrats at risk will see their poll numbers slide. As one columnist put it, \u201cThe possibility of the Senate flipping to Republican control is growing, and dissatisfaction with ObamaCare \u2014 fueled by perceptions of incompetence and weakness \u2014 is cited, along with the less-than-robust economic recovery \u2014 as a big reason.\u201d That in turn will increase the clamoring for delay or other \u201cfixes\u201d as vulnerable Democrats twist and turn in an effort to escape the Obamacare undertow.\n\n6. Obama\u2019s poll numbers continue to slide. On Tuesday he fell below 40 percent in the RealClearPolitics average. There is no guarantee it won\u2019t go lower. For an administration exquisitely sensitive to the president\u2019s image, this is crippling. Unlike, President George W. Bush who was at ease doing what he thought best (rescuing the Iraq War effort) despite popular opposition, this president views most everything through a partisan lens. He may find it debilitating to lose the last excuse standing \u2014 people like him! Maybe not so much.\n\n7. Republicans don\u2019t seem ready to bail him out by doing something stupid. Talk of another shutdown is nonexistent. Instead, a budget mini-deal seems likely. Republicans so far have not overplayed their hand. If they keep the focus on Obamacare\u2019s victims they won\u2019t allow Obama to get back on offense.\n\n8. Obamacare is inescapable. Sure, the president for the zillionth time can \u201cpivot\u201d to jobs, but in fact he has little to offer on that front. (Given the dozens of times he has already \u201cpivoted\u201d with no discernible shift or addition in policy, that term has become something of a punch line on the right.) His agenda at this point is stalled except for the potential for immigration reform. Even that, however, now rests with the GOP and his involvement is only likely to diminish the chances for success. The problem with having a signature piece of legislation, which bears your name, is that it is virtually impossible to do much else while it is failing.\n\n9. Math. The number of those dropped from individual insurance or from small-business coverage is going to exceed the number of enrollees in the exchanges for some time. It\u2019s hard to sell a law based on extending affordable coverage when you\u2019ve de-insured millions and delivered sticker shock to millions more.\n\nSome argue that the problem is one of balancing conflicting demands. Ron Fournier writes, \u201cPresident Obama is striking a dangerous balance. Starting today, he must simultaneously refocus Americans on the potential benefits of Obamacare without shredding his credibility further by minimizing its flaws.\u201d Perhaps. But arguably the problem is that Obama has lost credibility to sell his own product. That happened at a critical time in the Iraq War. President Bush\u2019s solution was to make Gen. David Petraeus, one of the nation\u2019s most respected national security figures, the face of the surge. It worked. Who could Obama dig up? It\u2019s not clear he has someone to devote all his time to salvaging the law, nor is it clear that Obama has Bush\u2019s self-awareness to know when to step out of the limelight. Come to think of it, that is #10: Lacks self-awareness to know that he is now one of the biggest problems with his health-care law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's problems with his signature legislation are multiplying.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "President Obama's problems with his signature legislation are multiplying.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s biggest problems", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/12/04/obamacares-biggest-problems/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/files/2013/07/10_110_20_103.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/12/04/obamacares-biggest-problems/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare problems, obamacare security issues, obamacare young people, obamacare self-selection,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare problems, obamacare security issues, obamacare young people, obamacare self-selection,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1129\"", "article_summary": "President Obama.\nCome to think of it, that is #10: Lacks self-awareness to know that he is now one of the biggest problems with his health-care law.\nIf they keep the focus on Obamacare\u2019s victims they won\u2019t allow Obama to get back on offense.\nRon Fournier writes, \u201cPresident Obama is striking a dangerous balance.\nThe president said it himself when Obamacare first launched: It depends on getting a whole bunch of young people into the program."}
