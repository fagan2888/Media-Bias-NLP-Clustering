REUTERS/Steve Parsons/Pool\n\n4390753\n\nSecuring volume discounts from vendors and passing the savings on to health care providers is supposed to keep costs down, but purchasers may have an incentive to inflate prices.\n\nThey are funded by administrative fees based on a percentage of the costs of products purchased. Those fees would ordinarily be prohibited by the \u201canti-kickback\u201d provision of the Social Security Act, but are allowed under a \u201csafe harbor\u201d exemption enacted by Congress in 1986, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office.\n\nGAO examined the five largest group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and found that \u201cadministrative fees collected from vendors accounted for about 92 percent of their revenue in 2012, ranging from a low of 83 percent to a high of 98 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver more than a decade,\u201d the report says, \u201cmembers of Congress and others have raised questions about certain GPO contracting practices and the funding structure that includes vendor-paid fees.\u201d (RELATED: Researchers Blame Misguided Government Incentives for Rising Health Care Costs)\n\nAmong the practices that have been called into question are sole-source contracting, in which GPOs contract with only one vendor per product; product bundling, a requirement that providers purchase a specific bundle of products in order to receive discounts on certain purchases; and long-term contracts, which lock in pricing arrangements for five years or more.\n\nThe GPO\u2019s counter that they only engage in those practices \u201cwhen it is advantageous to their customers\u201d\u2014for instance, when doing so would allow them to achieve a steeper discount than would otherwise be offered by the vendor. (RELATED: Health Care Cost Growth to Spike Again in 2015)\n\nAnother source of concern is potentially lax oversight by the Federal Trade Commission. Although FTC officials told the GAO \u201cthat they continue to receive and review complaints each year about GPO contracting practices\u2026 the FTC has not initiated any enforcement actions directed at GPO conduct\u201d since 2004.\n\nExperts interviewed by the GAO are divided over whether GPOs are effective, with some claiming that they discourage innovation and fail to achieve significant discounts, while others contend that competitive pressure (there are over 600 GPO\u2019s nationally) obviates those risks.\n\nCritics claim that the fee-based funding structure of GPO\u2019s \u201ccreates misaligned incentives for GPOs to negotiate higher prices for medical products in order to increase the amount of vendor fees that they receive,\u201d and that vendors who rely on GPO contracts are unlikely to develop innovative products unless they are confident that GPO\u2019s will purchase them. (RELATED: Obamacare Hiked Health Care Costs for Young Adults)\n\nSupporters, however, point out that GPO\u2019s use a competitive bidding process that \u201cconsiders the \u2018total value\u2019 of a product or service for their customers, not necessarily solely the price.\u201d In addition to \u201cminimum levels of product quality, durability, and cost-effectiveness,\u201d GPO\u2019s consider a vendor\u2019s product capabilities, and frequently include clauses in their contracts allowing them to \u201cadd additional vendors of the same product if the other vendor has innovative packaging.\u201d\n\nGAO concludes that, \u201cthere is little empirical evidence to definitively assess the impact of the vendor-fee-based funding structure protected under the safe harbor\u201d because such data are not always properly reported.\n\nThe report recommends that the government \u201ctake steps to address any under-reporting that may be found,\u201d but cautions that outright repeal of the safe harbor provision could cause \u201cdisruption while hospitals and vendors transitioned to new arrangements.\u201d\n\nFollow Peter Fricke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
