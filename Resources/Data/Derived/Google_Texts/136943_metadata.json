There's no way he's going to jail over some home improvements and a swimming pool,\" he said backstage.\n\nMAD REALITY\n\nWhile much of South Africa's humor inevitably plays on the racial divides that remain two decades after apartheid - particularly between blacks and whites - the ruling ANC party and its leaders, past and present, are also frequent targets.\n\nNor are there any sacred cows.\n\nIn one Lehoko skit mocking the broken manner in which Zuma reads out large numbers in English, he and Mandela are sitting round a fire smoking marijuana, when the anti-apartheid leader accuses Zuma of hogging the joint.\n\n\"Come on, Comrade Jacob, you know the rules - two puffs and pass it on,\" Mandela says.\n\n\"But I've only had one...,\" Zuma protests. \"Thousand, seven hundred and twenty eight.\"\n\nZuma's reputation for gaffes - in January his office had to correct his assertion Africa was bigger than all the other continents put together - is even starting to make waves internationally.\n\nSouth African host of the Daily Show, Trevor Noah, explained to U.S. audiences this week how Zuma was elected in 2009 without ever being formally cleared by a court of hundreds of corruption charges.\n\n\"I know, I know, that should have been a red flag to South Africans but ever since apartheid we've strived to be color blind, so all we saw was a flag,\" Noah said.\n\nOthers have taken the view that the politics of the self-styled 'Rainbow Nation' have become so bizarre that satire is unable to compete with the real thing.\n\n\"April Fools' Day 2016 canceled till further notice,\" the Daily Maverick, a respected online political magazine, wrote on April 1. \"We couldn't come up with anything half as mad as SA reality today. Sorry.\"\n\n(Editing by James Macharia and Raissa Kasolowsky)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - With their economy flatlining, currency on the ropes and poli", "title": "South Africans try to see funny side of Zuma crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/South-Africans-try-see-funny-side-Zuma-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/safrica-zuma_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/South-Africans-try-see-funny-side-Zuma-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/safrica-zuma_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - With their economy flatlining, currency on the ropes and poli", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "There's no way he's going to jail over some home improvements and a swimming pool,\" he said backstage.\nHowever, no episode has surpassed the six-year imbroglio over the \"security upgrades\" to his sprawling Nkandla private residence that included an amphitheatre, swimming pool, cattle enclosure and chicken run.\nSouth African host of the Daily Show, Trevor Noah, explained to U.S. audiences this week how Zuma was elected in 2009 without ever being formally cleared by a court of hundreds of corruption charges.\n\"I know, I know, that should have been a red flag to South Africans but ever since apartheid we've strived to be color blind, so all we saw was a flag,\" Noah said.\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - With their economy flatlining, currency on the ropes and politics in turmoil, many South Africans are turning to humor for relief, mainly at the expense of President Jacob Zuma and his $16-million home improvements."}
