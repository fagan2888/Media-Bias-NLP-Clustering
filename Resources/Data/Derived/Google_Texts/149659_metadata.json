He studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and emerged as an artist in the early 1960s as leader of a new school called the Chicago Imagists. His work is known for its bright, almost phosphorescent colors.\n\nVesna Stelcer, chair of the Ed Paschke Foundation, said Paschke was a visionary and forward-thinking. His art is \u201cvisceral and it\u2019s shocking and it speaks to you and if you look closer there\u2019s more layers,\u201d she said.\n\nOrganizers of the art center, which will open Sunday, say Paschke once said people either loved or hated his work, but rarely were indifferent about it.\n\nPaschke died a decade ago, in 2004, and would have been 75 on Sunday. He was one of the city\u2019s best-known artists during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nIn addition to his prolific painting career, Paschke also taught art for more than 30 years at such schools as Barat College, the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College and Northwestern University. Jeff Koons, considered one of the most influential living contemporary artists, got his start in Chicago working under Paschke.\n\nThe storefront Ed Paschke Art Center will have between 30 and 40 of his works, a recreation of his studio and a place for guest artists.\n\nSharon Paschke said her father would be honored to have a namesake art center.\n\n\u201cHe was a hard-working regular guy despite what people may guess a famous artist would be like,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a Chicagoan who loved the pulse of the city and the diversity of its people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIF YOU GO:\n\nEd Paschke Art Center: 5415 W.
