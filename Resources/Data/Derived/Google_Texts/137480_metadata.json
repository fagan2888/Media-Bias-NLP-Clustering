But where are they now?\n\nAn army of 15 million voters under 30 swept Obama past Hillary Clinton and John McCain and to the presidency in 2008. More than 12 million helped him return in 2012. But now his presidency is on the line \u2014 and the Obama youth are abandoning him in his hour of need.\n\nThe administration announced last week that only 1.08 million people ages 18 to 34 had signed up for Obamacare by the end of February, or about 25 percent of total enrollees. If the proportion doesn\u2019t improve significantly, the result likely will be fatal for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president.

Overall enrollment is also below target. But the alarming shortcoming is the number of young participants, which would make the insured population older and sicker and the program too expensive.\n\nThis week saw the release of Obama\u2019s sit-down with comedian Zach Galifianakis, of \u201cThe Hangover\u201d fame, to encourage the young to join the Obamacare exchanges. It was good comedy (the host, in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, rolled up his sleeve to show Obama his \u201cspider bites\u201d), and according to the White House it had the desired result: a boost in traffic to HealthCare.gov. Yet the fact that Obama sought Galifianakis\u2019s help was an indication of how much the president\u2019s standing has slipped among young Americans. Six years earlier, he had been a demigod among that demographic.\n\nWhat went wrong? The president and his aides failed to keep his youth movement engaged. But part of the problem also is the inability of the millennial generation to remain attached to a cause. The generation that brought Obama to power is connected online but has no loyalty to institutions \u2014 including, it turns out, the Obama White House.\n\nIn 2008, \u201cthe level of innovation and engagement in the election, especially the primaries, was amazing, but then the level of engaging them during the administration was extremely disappointing,\u201d says Peter Levine, a Tufts University professor who specializes in youth civic involvement. \u201cHe had a potential army for legislative success and implementation, but the Obama administration did not do that. At a critical moment in the first term, they did not turn to them. . . . They got rapid youth demobilization.\u201d\n\nYoung voters, after playing a big role in the campaign, became little more than an e-mail list for the White House and Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action group. Then came health-care reform. The millennials, very liberal overall, saw Obama\u2019s plan as too timid; they were disillusioned by his failure to fight for the \u201cpublic option\u201d of government-run health plans.\n\nThis cost Obama the young activists he would need to rally enrollment in Obamacare. Polling by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that, while the generation looks more favorably on big-government solutions than do older generations, the millennials disapprove of Obamacare in the same proportion as the rest of the population.\n\nEven if Obama had worked harder to keep his youth army engaged, it\u2019s not entirely clear that the effort would have succeeded. As a group, the generation\u2019s attachment is fickle.\n\nA Pew survey of the generation, released earlier this month, found the 18-to-33 crowd less attached than older generations to organized politics and religion, less patriotic, less eager to marry and less trusting of people. Only 49 percent say the phrase \u201ca patriotic person\u201d describes them very well, compared to percentages ranging from 64 percent to 81 percent for older generations.\n\nThe millennials are at least as passionate as earlier generations and more entrepreneurial, but they lack ties to institutions \u2014 unions, political parties, churches \u2014 because of their online existence. \u201cThe organizational structure they\u2019re growing up in is so weak,\u201d Tufts\u2019 Levine tells me. As a result, \u201cthere aren\u2019t very many durable institutions that can capitalize on their enthusiasm. They\u2019re being asked to do it themselves, online, and it\u2019s a tall order.\u201d\n\nAsking them to pay money to join a health-care exchange, it seems, is too tall an order \u2014 even though the presidency they created depends on it.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The millennials who propelled him to the presidency have abandoned him.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The millennials who propelled him to the presidency have abandoned him.", "title": "Dana Milbank: Obama has a problem connecting to young on health care", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-obama-has-a-problem-connecting-to-young-on-health-care/2014/03/14/1e6c5f40-ab95-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/06/20/Outlook/Images/DEMOCRATS_HEL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-obama-has-a-problem-connecting-to-young-on-health-care/2014/03/14/1e6c5f40-ab95-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, health care reform, obamacare, affordable care act, youth voters, young voters, millennials, obama millennials, obama 2008 campaign, obama invincibles, invincibles health care, invincibles obamacare, millennial generation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1e6c5f40-ab95-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, health care reform, obamacare, affordable care act, youth voters, young voters, millennials, obama millennials, obama 2008 campaign, obama invincibles, invincibles health care, invincibles obamacare, millennial generation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5660\"", "article_summary": "But now his presidency is on the line \u2014 and the Obama youth are abandoning him in his hour of need.\nThe generation that brought Obama to power is connected online but has no loyalty to institutions \u2014 including, it turns out, the Obama White House.\nOnly 49 percent say the phrase \u201ca patriotic person\u201d describes them very well, compared to percentages ranging from 64 percent to 81 percent for older generations.\nThis cost Obama the young activists he would need to rally enrollment in Obamacare.\nAn army of 15 million voters under 30 swept Obama past Hillary Clinton and John McCain and to the presidency in 2008."}
