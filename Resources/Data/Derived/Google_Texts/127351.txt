Theodore N. “Ted” Oglesby was honored with a resolution in the Georgia State Senate chamber on Friday.

Sen. Butch Miller, R-Gainesville, commended Oglesby’s life accomplishments.

“I am proud to honor a great Gainesville citizen who has so positively impacted our community,” Miller said in a statement. “He truly is a man of many talents, and he has shaped the lives of many individuals in our great state. I am proud to call Ted both a mentor and my friend.”

Oglesby was instrumental in the creation of several business advisory programs throughout Georgia, has been a longtime mentor to several current elected officials and is the former owner of the Gainesville Tribune, a one-time competitor to The Times.

One of Oglesby’s most notable accomplishments was his role in the implementation of Georgia’s second 911 service, which set a model standard for other states. Oglesby also assisted in the creation of several multimillion dollar cost-saving programs within the Small Business Advisory Council. He served for 20 years on the SBAC, including seven years as a Georgia chairman, and was the longest-serving member from any state.

Oglesby is also a well-known leader in the Georgia Republican Party and has mentored individuals such as Gov. Nathan Deal, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson.

In addition to his work in the political sphere and owning the Gainesville Tribune, Oglesby was an editorial editor for the Gainesville Daily Times, and an adjunct college journalism professor.

A retired Air Force colonel, Oglesby is the recipient of the Bronze Star and Meritorious Service Medal, and also spent time as an instructor in the National War College.

Oglesby has been married to his wife, Betty, for 62 years. They have two children and three grandchildren.
