Each new show introduces a twist on Tchaikovsky's classic \"The Nutcracker\" ballet, and this year that twist works in story lines from \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" by Dr. Seuss.\n\nThe format invites young dancers to explore the dramatic and comedic while preparing for two performances on Dec. 13 at Vance Brand Civic Auditorium in Longmont.\n\nMore than that, it gives them an opportunity to celebrate the gift exchange that happens year round across the performing arts when dancers, actors and musicians take the choreography, the script, or the score to another level through artistic interpretation, said Lee Smoot, director of The St. Vrain Singers youth choir and the music ministry director at CENTRALongmont, formerly Central Presbyterian Church.\n\n\"There is always a story to tell (in the arts). The talent is in learning to tell it well, which allows young and old to give something to themselves while giving something of themselves,\" she said.\n\nKaitlyn Jessee, 17, dances during rehearsal for the 10th annual \"Nutty Nutcracker.\" (Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nThe stillness at the center\n\nKaitlyn Jessee, 17, of Longmont, wore green fingernail polish and gaudy green eye shadow to get in the mood to play the Grinch during a late November Nutty Nutcracker rehearsal.\n\nAlthough, finding her place in ballet is not hard, especially when everything else is.\n\nShe started dancing at age 2. By age 7, when her parents divorced, she understood dance as doorway.\n\n\"Dance allowed me to leave darkness in life behind, to be that normal kid,\" she said. \"...When I walk through the (studio) doors, they are like an eraser. And I am a completely different person when I dance then when I am at home or at school because I am completely myself.\"\n\nFrom that still center, the willowy Kaitlyn brings a certain synergy to dance \u2014 a sense of internal connection with herself and the work, her team, and the audience.\n\nFellow dancer Kiley Winkelhake, 15, of Longmont, plays Clara Lou Who in this year's Nutty Nutcracker. She, too, views the art of dancing as \"a process of integration\" \u2014 an artistic way of bringing body, soul and mind together despite flubbed steps, missed cues and a lower back injury.\n\nPressing on to perform well rewards a dancer, especially after a sparkling performance, Kaitlyn added.\n\n\"The sweet spot is thinking it's not going to happen, and then it's there,\" she said. \"And the bigger I make things (for the audience), the bigger they make things, and then the bigger I want to make things for them.\"\n\nHigh hopes for holiday audiences\n\nLike her counterparts in the local young dance scene, Annabelle Butcher, 12, of Longmont, called her place in the performing arts as a first soprano \"home.\"\n\n\"I like how it sounds, how it paints a picture in my head,\" she said. \"And singing lets me let go of drama in my life. ... For every dramatic thing that happens at school, which happens every week, I'm make up a different song to sing about it.\"\n\nBesides singing alone about school drama or singing pop tunes with her friends or singing anything that comes to mind as she walks to pick her sisters up after school, Annabelle sings in five different choirs. Her choir membership includes a spot with the St. Vrain Singers, which will perform in holiday concerts at LifeBridge Church with the Longmont Chorale on Dec. 7 and Central Presbyterian Church on Dec. 22.\n\nAlready she looks forward to the holiday performances because of what the audience brings in the door: applause, post concert compliments, and even vows to sing more themselves.\n\n\"When a little girl comes up to me afterward and says, 'I want to sing like you when I grow up,' that's really awesome. I love it when my singing gets someone else singing,\" Annabelle said.\n\nThen there are the young actors.\n\nMany have performed in the annual \"Scrooge\" production that debuted at Jesters Dinner Theatre in 1987, said co-owner Scott Moore.\n\nFor the past four years, Tanner McGarr, 10, of Loveland, has played Tiny Tim.\n\n\"It's pretty easy,\" he said. \"You go on stage, act like you have a broken leg and look cute.\"\n\nNevertheless, staying in character comes with its challenges.\n\nOnce, he felt nauseated on stage and quietly got sick behind a table there.\n\n\"For some reason, my pants survived. I did have to get rid of the scarf and the shirt and clean my shoes. But I was back out on stage after the intermission,\" he said.\n\nSince Tiny Tim's lines are limited, Tanner relies mostly on physical expressions to connect with audiences.\n\n\"I just have a passion for entertaining people,\" he said. \"And since I am not the first one on stage, I can tell that if they laugh at little things, they will crack up at big things. ... Probably my favorite thing is to improvise.\"\n\nEven Holli, the shy Nutty Nutcracker dancer playing the Sugar Plum Fairy this year, has high hopes for holiday audiences.\n\n\"When I dance, I force my smile a lot. But when there's applause, I just feel so happy that it just naturally happens,\" she said. \"It's nice to go out and put your absolute best into it and feel it coming back to you.\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or at 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-features/ci_27021033/holiday-shows-connect-longmont-area-children-audiences", "modificationDate": "2014-11-29T20:09:57-0700", "sailthru.section": "Community Features", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "Holiday performances give dancer Holli Towers her ticket to a part of herself that feels like another country when compared to the rest of her life.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27021033:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-29T19:28:11-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-features/ci_27021033/holiday-shows-connect-longmont-area-children-audiences", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1126/20141126__30TCCLIFw~3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Holiday performances give dancer Holli Towers her ticket to a part of herself that feels like another country when compared to the rest of her life.", "title": "Holiday shows connect Longmont area children, audiences"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Holiday performances give dancer Holli Towers her ticket to a part of herself that feels like another country when compared to the rest of her life.", "title": "Holiday shows connect Longmont area children, audiences", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-features/ci_27021033/holiday-shows-connect-longmont-area-children-audiences", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1126/20141126__30TCCLIFw~3.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-29T19:28:11-0700", "endDate": "2024-11-26T19:13:47-0700", "sailthru.title": "Holiday shows connect Longmont area children, audiences", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-11-29T19:38:59-0700"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd088a\"", "article_summary": "Even Holli, the shy Nutty Nutcracker dancer playing the Sugar Plum Fairy this year, has high hopes for holiday audiences.\nFellow dancer Kiley Winkelhake, 15, of Longmont, plays Clara Lou Who in this year's Nutty Nutcracker.\nKaitlyn Jessee, 17, dances during rehearsal for the 10th annual \"Nutty Nutcracker.\"\n\"Once the (Nutcracker) overture starts, mentally I am just transported to some place different, some place very emotional,\" Towers, 16, of Longmont, said.\n(Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call)The stillness at the centerKaitlyn Jessee, 17, of Longmont, wore green fingernail polish and gaudy green eye shadow to get in the mood to play the Grinch during a late November Nutty Nutcracker rehearsal."}
