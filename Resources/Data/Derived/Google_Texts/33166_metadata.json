But looking at how we actually start having sex, the binary of virginity does an embarrassingly bad job describing how young people come to embody their sexual selves. The whole virginity concept \u2014 a switch that gets flipped with or without our intention \u2014 is at odds with the idea of consent in sex. Can we have both virginity and consent? And if not, which one are we prepared to let go?\n\nIt\u2019s nice to think that we\u2019ve largely talked ourselves out of the corrosive history of virginity that associated literal monetary value with women\u2019s bodies (not so long ago, an engagement ring was compensation to a woman for giving up her chastity). But if you thought that chapter of history was over, you might be disappointed. Therese Shechter\u2019s new documentary, \u201cHow To Lose Your Virginity,\u201d walks us through the fascinating past and present of virginity: from the Roman Vestal Virgins choosing celibacy to carve out a modicum of autonomy in a world where they had no control, to radically morphing definitions of virginity over Christian history, to \u201cvirginity kits\u201d and online virginity auctions. Shechter\u2019s movie, with breezy, watchable, funny delivery, walks us through the simple argument that baked into the very term virginity \u2014 one that we still use freely \u2014 is an idea of a woman\u2019s body as an object for transaction.\n\nWomen\u2019s virginity is protected by a father and then \u201cgiven\u201d to a husband, words we use to this day. Shechter draws on colorful characters and leading experts to retell the story of virginity, an ancient-sounding history that bleeds, quite disturbingly and no pun intended, into the present. While Shechter isn\u2019t anti-virginity per se, she is adamantly in favor of women being able to define their experiences for themselves, without the interference of institutions with bad track records of recognizing women\u2019s personhood.\n\nWhen I had high school sex ed, the educators were already over the word \u201cvirginity.\u201d The \u201990s gold standard, instead, was \u201creadiness.\u201d We were encouraged to \u201cbecome sexually active\u201d only when we were \u201cready.\u201d It\u2019s hard to write without scare quotes because these same educators, apparently terrified to be talking about sex, were at a loss to define their terms. There were consequences to becoming sexually active, they told us, things like pregnancy and exposure to sexually transmitted infections. This readiness was a vector that went in only one direction, eventually toward sex. It was a choice you made once and couldn\u2019t unmake. Soon we would switch off our youthful unreadiness and join the ranks of the \u201csexually active.\u201d How often? With whom? And are you still \u201csexually active\u201d every moment after having sex? What about at those moments of the day when you\u2019re not actually having sex?\n\nOnce that switch is flipped, a person is apparently game for anything, and irreversibly. The concept of becoming sexually active is certainly more progressive than that of virginity. For one, it acknowledges that teenagers have sexuality and choices (although \u201cbecome\u201d is not such an active verb). But it\u2019s missing a lot of things. It\u2019s missing the sexuality that people have on their own since childhood. When it\u2019s acting as shorthand for virginity \u2014 often considered penis-in-vagina penetration \u2014 it dismisses all sexual activity between people other than heterosexual couples. And \u201cbecoming sexually active\u201d whitewashes the complicated course to sexual maturity that rape and sexual abuse survivors go through. Though it does gesture toward the right not to venture into sex at too early a moment in one\u2019s development, \u201cbecoming sexually active\u201d is also missing consent: the ability to choose the sex that you want \u2014 or don\u2019t want \u2014 at a given time, without pressure or expectation.\n\nI first got confused by the concept of \u201cbeing sexually active\u201d when doctors started asking me about my status in college. While I\u2019d had sex in the past, I wasn\u2019t having it then, and I didn\u2019t feel particularly comfortable talking to them about it. I think what they meant to ask was, \u201cShould I screen you for sexually transmitted infections?\u201d That\u2019s a question with a very different answer. How was I supposed to respond? What about my friends (men and women) who were survivors of rape or childhood sexual abuse, people who might very well have been exposed to STIs, though they weren\u2019t sexually active in any meaningful sense? How were they supposed to answer? The language left much to be desired.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t really understand the deep mismatch between the concept of becoming sexually active and the way that women actually live their lives until I began talking to women about their sex histories for \u201cSubjectified,\u201d an oral history project about the sex lives of young women around the U.S. One by one, I encountered stories that dismantled the image of the freight train barreling unstoppably in the direction of sexual activity. I heard stories of fits and starts.\n\nOne woman told me about losing her virginity at age 13 in a trusting, respectful relationship and then not having sex for a while after that ended. Eventually, she \u201cstarted from the beginning\u201d with new partners, with no expectation of sex or \u201cbeing sexually active.\u201d\n\nOne woman told me about exploring sexuality with female friends at a young age, in a safe environment, followed by years of dysfunctional, non-consensual encounters with men.\n\nAnd another woman described early, non-consensual hookups that led her to feel it would be better to \u201cchoose\u201d sex (even if she didn\u2019t really want to) than to have it chosen for her against her will.\n\nNone of these processes of becoming sexually active were one moment or one choice. The choices grew and developed, were influenced over time by real life, and adapted to the very different environments that the individuals grew up in.\n\nBut whether we call it virginity or becoming sexually active, we assume that the arrow only goes in one direction. In Shechter\u2019s words, \u201cthere are the deeply ingrained transformative ideas about women \u2018losing\u2019 their virginity, instantly transforming from innocent to experienced, clean to dirty and valuable/value-less. Aside from the sexism and commodification, the idea that your body and soul can change from one moment to the next by the application of a penis to your vagina (but not your anus) is ludicrous.\u201d Shechter interviews doctors about women\u2019s anatomy, demonstrating that there is no real physical proof of a lost virginity. If physical proof is surprisingly illusory, spiritual proof is even harder to come by. \u201cI understand the need to mark the moment of becoming sexual,\u201d Shechter tells me. \u201cThe problem is, sex just doesn\u2019t work like that, in a moment. It\u2019s a process.\u201d\n\nLast year, I started crowdsourcing anonymous sex stories for an oral history project called \u201cDo Tell.\u201d Many of the stories involve first times. But another trend quietly emerged. Some women decided not to have sex ever again, and this was the significant transition that they wanted to talk about. For some, it was due to age or lack of a partner or just lack of interest. For others, the choice of celibacy came out of past traumas. For them, maybe the most empowering position was exercising the choice not to be sexual with other people. And other women discovered a real desire for sex for the first time at age 40 or 60, or after a divorce.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our limited concept of \"losing your virginity\" ignores the importance of consent", "title": "The trouble with virginity: What America\u2019s sexual language leaves out", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Our limited concept of \"losing your virginity\" ignores the importance of consent", "title": "The trouble with virginity: What America\u2019s sexual language leaves out", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/the_trouble_with_virginity_what_americas_sexual_language_leaves_out/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/unmade_bed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our limited concept of \"losing your virginity\" ignores the importance of consent", "title": "The trouble with virginity: What America\u2019s sexual language leaves out", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/unmade_bed.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Melissa T.
