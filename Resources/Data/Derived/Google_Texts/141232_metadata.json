It's an incredible success story that isn't just wrecking havoc across the lives of middle class people who had health insurance before ObamaCare wrecked theirs, it's also trashing socialized medicine everywhere.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, Uncle Sam will cut more than $800 million in payments to the city\u2019s Health and Hospitals Corp, by Fiscal Year 2019. The president\u2019s signature law slashes federal payments that long helped out hospitals serving lots of patients who lack insurance. The idea was that the law would boost coverage so dramatically the aid would be unnecessary. Except that illegal immigrants don\u2019t qualify for ObamaCare coverage \u2014 and they make up a big chunk of the city\u2019s uninsured population.\n\nOne more reason Obama needs to urgently legalize and ObamaCareize illegal aliens. And if this is happening here, you know it's happening in every major city with a big illegal population.\n\nIn ObamaCare\u2019s first full year, New York was supposed to see its ranks of uninsured drop 7.2 percent. Oops: It only fell 1.3 percent. But the federal subsidies are dropping anyway. So the Health and Hospitals Corp. faces huge shortfalls that will leave it with just $44 million in cash reserves in FY 2019, down from $1 billion this year. In short, the city\u2019s entire public-hospital system is headed to fiscal collapse, even with new taxpayer subsidies.\n\nObamaCare. It really, really works (at destroying things).", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "One more reason Obama needs to urgently legalize and ObamaCareize illegal aliens.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "One more reason Obama needs to urgently legalize and ObamaCareize illegal aliens.", "title": "ObamaCare Might Just Wipe Out New York City's Public Hospitals", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/257111/obamacare-might-just-wipe-out-new-york-citys-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:41:03-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/257111/obamacare-might-just-wipe-out-new-york-citys-daniel-greenfield", "description": "One more reason Obama needs to urgently legalize and ObamaCareize illegal aliens.", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare Might Just Wipe Out New York City's Public Hospitals"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T05:40:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:41:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It really, really works (at destroying things).\nExcept that illegal immigrants don\u2019t qualify for ObamaCare coverage \u2014 and they make up a big chunk of the city\u2019s uninsured population.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, Uncle Sam will cut more than $800 million in payments to the city\u2019s Health and Hospitals Corp, by Fiscal Year 2019.\nThe president\u2019s signature law slashes federal payments that long helped out hospitals serving lots of patients who lack insurance.\nIn short, the city\u2019s entire public-hospital system is headed to fiscal collapse, even with new taxpayer subsidies."}
