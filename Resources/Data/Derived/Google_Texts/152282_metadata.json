Sherrod Brown wrote in a June 18 campaign email. \u201cAnd on average, that number is 77 cents to every dollar.\u201d\n\nAccording to Brown and other Democrats \u2014 including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a federal law is necessary to fix the gender wage gap.\n\nBut the \u201c77 cents\u201d figure used by Democrats and feminists is misleading, Carrie Lukas, managing director of the free-market Independent Women\u2019s Forum, said in an email to Watchdog.org.\n\nA 2009 U.S. Department of Labor study controlling for profession and education found a gender wage gap of less than 10 percent and concluded \u201cthe raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action.\u201d\n\nTo the extent a wage gap even exists, Lukas said it\u2019s a reflection of \u201cdifferent choices men and women make when it comes to work.\u201d Men are more likely to work longer hours, and in more dangerous, physically demanding conditions.\n\nThis seems to be the case in President Obama\u2019s White House, where men were still paid more than women five years after Obama signed a law meant to fix the wage disparity between the sexes.\n\n\u201cIf there was a policy solution to the wage gap, why wouldn\u2019t it have been implemented already? Democrats were in full control of Congress when Obama took office,\u201d Lukas said.\n\nIWF has worked to refute the \u201c77 cents to every dollar\u201d myth for several years. Lukas penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed on the topic in 2011, and IWF released a video summarizing its economists\u2019 findings in 2013.\n\nExperts come to varying conclusions about the gender wage gap, but even prominent left-of-center news outlets recognize the \u201c77 cents\u201d figure has been discredited.\n\nIn 2012, PolitiFact.com rated as \u201cMostly False\u201d a claim from the president that women are \u201cpaid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president must begin to acknowledge that \u201977 cents\u2019 does not begin to capture what is actually happening in the work force and society,\u201d Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote in April 2014.\n\nSo why do Brown and so many others keep pushing for federal action using a debunked talking point?\n\n\u201cDemocrats clearly are very vested in convincing women that American workplaces are riddled with sexism,\u201d Lukas told Watchdog.org.\n\nBased on Brown\u2019s campaign email, Democrats are intent on resurrecting the \u201cWar on Women\u201d narrative that served Obama so well in the 2012 election; the email directed supporters to a petition accusing Republicans of \u201cholding women back.\u201d\n\nBrown and Wasserman Schultz both failed to respond to requests for comment on the pay statistics included in the Friends of Sherrod Brown email last week.\n\nDemocrats, Lukas said, \u201ckeep promoting and passing bills under the guise of \u2018equal pay\u2019 that do nothing to advance equal pay or close the wage gap \u2014 they just create more red tape for businesses and enrich lawyers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women aren't really paid 23 percent less than men for the same work, but Democrats keep repeating the debunked statistic anyway.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Women aren't really paid 23 percent less than men for the same work, but Democrats keep repeating the debunked statistic anyway.", "title": "Democrats keep campaigning on debunked gender pay gap - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/sherrod-brown-us-senate-2015.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-23T14:57:33+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/224999/democrats-gender-gap/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Women aren't really paid 23 percent less than men for the same work, but Democrats keep repeating the debunked statistic anyway.", "title": "Democrats keep campaigning on debunked gender pay gap - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/sherrod-brown-us-senate-2015.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "published_time": "2015-06-24T04:00:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-23T14:57:33+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "sherrod brown, debbie wasserman schultz, wage gap, female wage gap, gender pay gap, pay gap, iwf, independent women's forum, carrie lukas"}, "article_summary": "Experts come to varying conclusions about the gender wage gap, but even prominent left-of-center news outlets recognize the \u201c77 cents\u201d figure has been discredited.\n\u201cIf there was a policy solution to the wage gap, why wouldn\u2019t it have been implemented already?\nDemocrats, Lukas said, \u201ckeep promoting and passing bills under the guise of \u2018equal pay\u2019 that do nothing to advance equal pay or close the wage gap \u2014 they just create more red tape for businesses and enrich lawyers.\u201d\nIWF has worked to refute the \u201c77 cents to every dollar\u201d myth for several years.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgWomen aren\u2019t really paid 23 percent less than men for the same work, but Democrats keep repeating the debunked statistic anyway."}
