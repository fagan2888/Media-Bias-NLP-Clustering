That prevents Seattle Public Schools officials from proceeding with plans to demolish the school so a new school can be built in its place.\n\nWilson-Pacific School was built over a spring that was important to the Duwamish people. The school was the longtime home of American Indian Heritage Early College High School, which at one time boasted a 100 percent graduation and college attendance rate. The school was a longtime venue for cultural events, such as powwows, and Native organizations still meet there regularly. Exterior walls feature Native-themed murals by Haida/Apache artist Andrew Morrison.\n\nThe school was led from 1989-1996 by the late Robert Eaglestaff, Minneconjou Lakota. Supporters of saving the school want it renamed in his honor, saying that under his leadership the school was \u201ca model for all urban intertribal alternative schools\u201d and \u201cbalanced academic success with the cultural, traditional, and socio-historical uniqueness of tribal learners.\u201d\n\nIronically, the school was nominated for landmark status by the very agency that wanted to demolish it. Under the state Environmental Policy Act, the school district was required to make an assessment of the school\u2019s cultural and historical importance and present it to the landmarks board.\n\nErin Doherty, Landmarks Preservation Board coordinator, said the school met two of six criteria for landmark designation: it is \u201cassociated in a significant way with the life of a person important in the history of the City\u201d (Eaglestaff); it is \u201cassociated in a significant way with a significant aspect of the cultural, political, or economic heritage of the community.\u201d\n\nNext, landmarks board staff and the school district will negotiate a controls and incentives agreement for landmarks board consideration. \u201cControls define those features of the landmark to be preserved and outline the Certificate of Approval process for changes to those features,\u201d the board website states. \u201cIncentives may include, but are not limited to, zoning variances, building code exceptions, and financial incentives.\u201d\n\nMahlum Architects designed a new school site plan that would keep the walls with Native murals. But Doherty said that\u2019s not enough. \u201cThe School District explained their plan to retain and relocate [the] murals as part of their new school building proposal,\u201d Doherty wrote in an email. \u201cThis was provided to the board for informational purposes only\u2026 During a designation meeting, the Board must consider the property in its current state, and not base its decision on what may be proposed in the future.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt is rare to demolish a landmark.\u201d\n\nFor the Native community, the school\u2019s present status is, in Morrison\u2019s words, \u201ca 360-degree turn\u201d from a year ago, when the school district\u2019s plans to dismantle the Indian Heritage School program and tear the school down seemed cemented. Morrison ultimately won an agreement to save the murals, but the district moved the Indian Heritage program to a classroom in a nearby mall, and later merged it with another program with plans for both to return to the Wilson-Pacific School site when the new school is finished.\n\nTrena Harmon, Colville, was certain the school could be saved if its story could be told. \u201cIndian Heritage School has been a part of my life for 20 years. I never lost faith,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBoard members wanted to know more about the culture and history, they wanted to know more about Robert Eaglestaff, they wanted to tour the school and get a feel for the area.\u201d\n\nHarmon, secretary of the Urban Native Education Alliance, led board members on a tour and provided them with a 20-minute version of a documentary on Eaglestaff a week before the designation hearing.\n\nThe UNEA continues to operate programs at the shuttered school: the Clear Sky Native Youth Council, the Native Warriors Basketball Program. Board members saw the young people\u2019s artwork, drums, journals, and posters used at rallies to save the school.\n\n\u201cThey realized the impact the school has on the Native community,\u201d Harmon said.\n\nUNEA members, its youth council members, and possibly some landmarks board members will attend Indigenous Cultures Day on August 16 at Seattle Center\u2014within view of a memorial pole raised in honor of Nitinaht First Nations carver John T. Williams, who was killed by a Seattle police officer in 2010. The day\u2019s events will include a viewing of the Robert Eaglestaff documentary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plans to demolish a public school with strong ties to Seattle\u2019s Native community have been sent back to the drawing board.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/11/seattle-landmarks-board-votes-save-indian-heritage-school-156324", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/andrew-morrison-mural-jose-21.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Seattle Landmarks Board Votes to Save Indian Heritage School"}, "abstract": "Plans to demolish a public school with strong ties to Seattle\u2019s Native community have been sent back to the drawing board.", "dc": {"title": "Seattle Landmarks Board Votes to Save Indian Heritage School"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/11/seattle-landmarks-board-votes-save-indian-heritage-school-156324", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Andrew Morrison, Chief Joseph, Chief Seattle, Mural, Seattle, Indian Heritage School", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-11T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Seattle Landmarks Board Votes to Save Indian Heritage School"}, "article_summary": "The Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board voted 7-1 on July 16 to designate Wilson-Pacific School a city landmark.\n\u201cIndian Heritage School has been a part of my life for 20 years.\nBoard members saw the young people\u2019s artwork, drums, journals, and posters used at rallies to save the school.\nThat prevents Seattle Public Schools officials from proceeding with plans to demolish the school so a new school can be built in its place.\nThe school was the longtime home of American Indian Heritage Early College High School, which at one time boasted a 100 percent graduation and college attendance rate."}
