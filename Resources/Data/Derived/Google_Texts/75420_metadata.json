The Nationals and the Phillies were playing!\n\nThen I was off to Yale University, my alma mater of long ago, to speak to four business school classes. Whenever I visit, I have the same insecurities as way back when.\n\nBut I\u2019ve found my voice and my self-confidence in the years since. As I said on Facebook, it was game on.\n\nThe reality is that my life is pretty much amazing from one day to the next, sometimes doing things that I never imagined in my younger years. This year alone I\u2019ve spoken at gatherings for Melanie Campbell\u2019s Black Women\u2019s Roundtable, Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network and a women\u2019s empowerment conference where Bishop T.D. Jakes spoke. I also attended the NAACP Image Awards and participated in an AARP Life Reimagined event at a Women of Faith conference in Houston, just to name a few.\n\nI have to say that although most of this is work, it\u2019s been a balance of these kinds of fun-filled and challenging experiences that have pushed me beyond my comfort level, causing me to grow in my confidence and outlook on life. Often as adults, we get to a point where we plateau and assume that either we\u2019ve done it all or are simply too busy or set in our ways to try new and exciting things.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not also mention that on Jan. 15 this year, our beloved mother and grandmother, Hattie Kane, passed away. Pressing through the grief was difficult and we\u2019re still taking it one day at a time. But there\u2019s much ahead and I\u2019m reinvigorated.\n\n>> Visit AARP Black Community\n\nAuthor, civil rights leader and theologian Howard Thurman once said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.\u201d\n\nBased on Thurman\u2019s sound advice and my experiences, I challenge you to challenge yourself. It\u2019s spring.
