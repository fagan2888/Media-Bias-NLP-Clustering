For another, a presidency\u2019s seventh year is less the time for groundbreaking initiatives than for extending and defending its principal prior policies.\n\nIndeed, Obama\u2019s main purpose Tuesday night was much broader: to define the landscape both for the next two years of dealing with the newly installed Republican congressional majority and for the 2016 debate leading to the election of his successor.\n\nHe set an optimistic tone \u2014 perhaps unduly so \u2014 in describing events both domestic and international, arguing that the \u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d underlying his presidency have enabled \u201cthe shadow of crisis\u201d to pass, at a time when statistics and polls both reflect growing acceptance of that. He castigated Republicans as still refighting an agenda of \u201ctaking away \u2026 health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration,\u201d while assuming an economically hurting country still yearns for their trickle-down prescriptions.\n\nIndeed, soon after Obama finished, this year\u2019s designated Republican respondent, freshman Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, confirmed his portrayal by decrying \u201cstagnant wages and lost jobs\u201d and declaring that, among other things, Republicans would \u201crepeal and replace a health care law that\u2019s hurt so many hardworking families.\u201d\n\nMost Obama domestic proposals, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy to finance needed infrastructure improvements or raising the minimum wage, are as unlikely to pass as Republican bills repealing Obamacare. Legislation to spur trade agreements has a better chance.\n\nBut the president was able, as is usually the case with these annual addresses, to make his case to a national audience that almost certainly is more sympathetic to his agenda than Washington\u2019s partisan battles would have one believe.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because his aggressive post-election policy initiatives have not only spurred a modest uptick in his personal job approval but have focused on areas where he and the Democrats have the upper hand, both politically and substantively.\n\nOne obvious example is immigration reform, where the Republican-controlled House last week enacted a package of mean-spirited measures aimed at curbing the benefits Obama unilaterally gave millions of undocumented workers, including young people brought here illegally by their parents. Obama humanized his argument by inviting to the speech a young \u201cDreamer\u201d from Dallas, Ana Zamora, promptly derided by GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa as \u201ca deportable.\u201d\n\nA second area was his surprise initiative to restore U.S. relations with Cuba, which Republicans still oppose though polls show the country agrees with Obama that, \u201cwhen what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work for 50 years, it\u2019s time to try something new.\u201d A third was the joint effort with China on climate change.\n\nObama might even have defined this year\u2019s political debate on his least popular but most far-reaching achievement, the Affordable Care Act, noting that Republicans want to \u201cput the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance\u201d at a time millions are getting insured and polls show Americans would rather fix than repeal it.\n\nOn virtually every one of these issues, the political divisions in Congress were exemplified by Vice President Joe Biden leading enthusiastic response from his fellow Democrats while House Speaker John Boehner and the GOP majority sat uncomfortably silent.\n\nThe most graphic evidence came when Obama launched an appeal for bipartisan cooperation by declaring, \u201cI have no more campaigns to run,\u201d prompting a loud burst of applause from Republicans. \u201cI know, \u2019cause I won both of them,\u201d the president ad-libbed, drawing laughter and applause from fellow Democrats.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s battle lines will recur repeatedly as Obama and his critics maneuver to sway the public on whether the current Congress and the next administration should revise and extend his agenda or repeal and replace it.\n\nCarl P.
