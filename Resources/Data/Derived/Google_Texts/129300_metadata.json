But it\u2019s all a stunt, and it won\u2019t succeed.\n\nSuddenly, Republicans like birth control. Or at least that\u2019s the conclusion they would like you to draw based on a recent spate of GOP candidates announcing their support for making birth control pills available over the counter. But the truth is Republicans remain as committed as ever to restricting the reproductive freedom of poor and middle-class women while advancing the freedom of corporations.\n\nIn recent elections, Republican political candidates have of course been hurt by their own extremist stances on opposing the contraception mandate in Obamacare, restricting abortion, and generally perpetuating the war on women. The rhetoric of recent candidates like Todd Akin hasn\u2019t exactly helped, either.\n\nBut now, a few GOPers have advanced a clever counter-narrative. Recently, four Republican candidates in tough Senate races\u2014Cory Garner in Colorado, Ed Gillespie in Virginia, Mike McFadden in Minnesota, and Thom Tillis in North Carolina\u2014in effect tried to declare to voters, \u201cWe support birth control so much we want women to be able to get it over-the-counter!\u201d Sounds great. Especially coming from Republicans. If only it were true.\n\n\n\nReproductive health advocates agree that making birth control available over the counter is a good idea if paired with other essential reforms such as ensuring that insurance plans will cover birth control without a prescription. Without these reforms, say advocates, the reality is that access to contraception wouldn\u2019t really expand and in fact would likely be reduced.\n\n\n\nInstead, these and other Republicans are pursuing the sort of de-forms and policy reversals that will make birth control less accessible to millions of American women if offered solely over-the-counter. After all, health insurance companies rarely cover the cost of over-the-counter medicines. Over-the-counter contraception would only expand access if it were still covered by insurance as part of a strategy to expand women\u2019s contraceptive choices. But Republicans are trying to roll back or repeal Obamacare, including the law\u2019s mandate that the cost of birth control be covered by employer-provided insurance.\n\nPlus instead of expanding access for younger women, Republicans are attacking (and insulting) women who use contraception as unable to control their libidos. That\u2019s in addition to all the policies Republicans in general and these four Senate candidates specifically support to cut women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive health care options.\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the Hobby Lobby ruling, Republicans claimed that women who want birth control can and should simply pay for it themselves. Conservatives don\u2019t make this same argument when it comes to open-heart surgery or blood pressure medication or even Viagra, but they expect women to foot the bill for their basic reproductive health care. That broad offense aside, the fact is that for many women these costs are prohibitive. Upwards of $600 a year for oral contraception, let alone $1,000 for an IUD or $50 for emergency contraception, both of which are also jeopardized by attacks on Obamacare, is a lot of money to hardworking American families, many of whom rely on a rock-bottom minimum wage that Republicans refuse to raise.\n\nThe same disparity is sadly true of abortion. Wealthy women in America will almost assuredly always be able to access abortion care, in spite of extremist restrictions. Even if Roe v. Wade is repealed someday, a number of states will likely legalize abortion within their borders, and wealthy women will simply be able to travel to those states.\n\nHowever, prohibiting public funding for reproductive freedom and shutting down abortion clinics has disproportionately affected low- and middle-income women who simply can\u2019t afford the time off work and the gas money to drive hundreds of miles to the nearest clinic, let alone the often-significant cost of procedures. Before Roe v. Wade, of the thousands of women who died because of illegal abortions, a disproportionate percentage were low-income women of color.\n\n\n\nYet while there is clearly no upside for low-income and middle-class women in any Republican positions on reproductive health, there is an upside for one group: corporations. After all, if Republicans get oral contraception provided over-the-counter, even the insurance companies that were covering contraceptive costs before the Obamacare mandate will have a new excuse to stop doing so\u2014reducing their bottom line by arguing that contraception is now like aspirin and insurance customarily doesn\u2019t cover either. In turn, always happy to save money, corporate America will no doubt reward Republicans with loads of campaign cash.\n\nBecause much as the Hobby Lobby company was happily providing contraception coverage before it decided to object to the Obamacare mandate and file suit, no doubt many other companies have been providing contraceptive coverage for years and have only just recently started to resent it. And if Republicans can\u2019t serve the interests of resentful corporations, well, who can they serve?\n\nIn the middle of this are women voters. Well, not exactly in the middle\u2014women voters are decisively on the side of the party that respects their reproductive health, not to mention the party that stands up for equal wages, takes action to end violence against women, helps make college more affordable for families, and more. Women like these things.
