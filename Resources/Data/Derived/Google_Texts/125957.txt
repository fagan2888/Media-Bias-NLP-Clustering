Re: “Trump doesn’t have what it takes to make America great” (Rabble Rouser, Aug. 31)

As long as we have people like the writer whining about making changes and telling it like it is, we’ll have another four years of doing nothing.

If Donald Trump did only one thing of all his promises, he’ll do more than President Barack Obama did in seven years!

We don’t need another fancy talker in the White House; that has done nothing except set race relations back 20 years.

There is nobody running for president on the GOP side that can do any worse than Obama has done. By the way, the only thing he’s done in seven years is Obamacare and that is a disaster, because there are millions of people who lost their insurance and millions more whose deductibles have doubled and they can’t afford to go to the doctor.

The writer wants everything to be political correct! Baloney, it doesn’t work. He says a hat that says “Make America Great Again” is silly.

If Trump does nothing else but build that wall in four years, that’s good enough for me.

Anyone who doesn’t think Trump would be a better negotiator has their heads in the sand and doesn’t want to face reality.

Retired generals have stated in no uncertain terms that we can win the war against ISIS, but people like this writer don’t want to listen.

The writer wants another four years of Obama. Help! I’d take four or eight years of an outsider: Donald Trump, Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina.
