He is joined by another former Bentley staffer, Marquita Davis, who was Alabama State Finance Director during Bentley\u2019s first term. Cooper is now legal counsel for the University of Alabama System and Davis is Executive Director of the Jefferson County Committee for Economic Opportunity (JCCEO) in Birmingham.\n\nThe group\u2019s formation documents say it was organized to \u201cpromote the common good and general welfare of the people of the State of Alabama\u201d by promoting, among other things, \u201cpolicies that foster an environment to create more jobs\u201d and make \u201cliving in Alabama more affordable for families.\u201d They also plan to \u201cpromote legislation to implement such public policies.\u201d\n\nShattuck told Yellowhammer on Thursday that the group was launched after extensive conversations with the governor, who he says serves as the group\u2019s honorary chairman, although he does not hold an official position.\n\n\u201cIn conversations with the governor we realized there was a need to help him get his message and agenda out there in a way where it is most effective and reaches the most people,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, having been in the administration \u2014 seeing it, living it, experiencing it \u2014 it\u2019s clear that state government really needs some help. Having worked for the governor and gained an appreciation for his genuineness and fresh approach, I welcome the opportunity for other people to hear it, see it and understand it.\u201d\n\nShattuck said the group will advance the governor\u2019s agenda through a combination of earned media and paid advertising. And although the tax increase proposal is the first issue they\u2019re working on, there will be more to come, including healthcare reform.\n\nIn his State of the State address earlier this year, Gov. Bentley said that he would not allow the \u201cflaws\u201d of ObamaCare to keep the state from expanding taxpayer-funded healthcare for the \u201cpoorest and most vulnerable.\u201d He also said that some hospitals are \u201cdependent on Medicaid to survive,\u201d further signaling that some form of expansion of the program may be imminent.\n\n\u201cWe are not just a one issue group. It\u2019s really about supporting all of the governor\u2019s issues and agenda items,\u201d Cooper said of ACEGov\u2019s plans. \u201cThe tax one is one we know and are experiencing, but he has some ideas and goals for healthcare, for example, that we haven\u2019t seen or heard a lot of yet, other than in the State of the State, but they\u2019re coming. There are lots of issues to address. The governor is excited about his second term. The tax issue is the first one up, but there will be more to come.\u201d\n\nShattuck said his personal involvement in the group was a no-brainer, and hopes their efforts are able to help Alabamians gain a better understanding of the challenges their state government is facing.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was an opportunity to help,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople always say, \u2018Well, can\u2019t we just cut this or that?\u2019 I believed that too until I saw it first-hand. There\u2019s nothing left to cut! We have a real crisis on our hands and it\u2019s going to take some bold moves to fix it.\u201d\n\nLike this article?
