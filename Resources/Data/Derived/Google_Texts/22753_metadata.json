Terry McAuliffe is reviewing the role of Alcoholic Beverage Control agents after public outcry arose over the forceful arrest of a 20-year-old student at the University of Virginia, who was pushed into the sidewalk and suffered a gash on his head. The panel is tasked \u2014 among other things \u2014 with recommending whether or not ABC agents should retain their law enforcement authority.\n\nContrary to public speculation, all ABC agents are certified police officers with many hours of classroom and field training. Nearly 80 percent of recent arrests were for liquor law violations and drunkenness, and nearly half of arrestees were ages 10 through 20. But Harrisonburg Mayor Christopher Jones said that while the training may have been adequate in the past, he wonders what would give rise to using force in a student misdemeanor arrest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the actual in-office culture that is going to determine the application of the actual use of force,\" Jones says. \"In the incident that happened, somewhere in the back, back, back, back of those officers\u2019 mind, there was a part of them that thought: 'This is OK, to some degree.'\"\n\nThere\u2019s now just one agent for every 211 retail licensees. Alcohol-related public safety investigations take only 30 percent of the agents\u2019 time.\n\nRadford Police Chief Don Goodman offered another perspective: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the hazard and tragedy of unchecked alcohol in and amongst people that aren\u2019t prepared to experience it. So I see ABC as a partner with me in helping to maintain a safe community.\u201d\n\nSome members added that the use of plain clothes agents is counterproductive.\n\nThe agency is already planning re-training sessions, which will include responses to active resistance and use of force, cultural diversity, and communication with youth and young adults. The panel will hold additional meetings before making its final recommendations.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Anne Marie Morgan, Virginia Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "A panel appointed by Gov.
