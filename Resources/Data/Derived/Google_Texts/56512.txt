The campaign on Tuesday reported that Clinton, former first lady under President Bill Clinton and secretary of state under President Barack Obama, would attend the planned services in California for Reagan, who died on Sunday of congestive heart failure.

(This version of the story corrects the day of Reagan's death from Monday to Sunday in the paragraph two.)
