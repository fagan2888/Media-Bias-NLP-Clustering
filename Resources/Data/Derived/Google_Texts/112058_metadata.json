CNSI , headquartered in Maryland, has a history of work of questionable quality, overrun project budgets, delays, and litigation in several other states.\n\nDocuments procured by OpenTheBooks.com, a national transparency organization based in Illinois but involved in all 50 states, have raised questions about the close relationship between Illinois state officials and CNSI . Several whistleblowers tipped off OpenTheBooks.com about what records to request, and National Review spoke to some of them. These sources within the Illinois government allege unethical and potentially unlawful behavior.\n\nIt looks like pure Chicago politics, but taxpayers both in Illinois and across the United States may end up footing the bill, since the federal government will pay for 90 percent of Illinois\u2019s system upgrade. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) has approved an upgrade costing as much as $190 million, though the state claims that because it is partnering with Michigan on the project, it will cost only $85 million.\n\n* * *\n\nIn late August 2012, private- and public-sector workers gathered in Boston from across the United States to attend the Medicaid Enterprise Systems Conference, an annual event focused on the IT systems that support Medicaid.\n\nThey found time for fun. According to sources within the Illinois government, CNSI rented a two-story boat to cruise Boston Harbor for a private party. The 50 or so guests included several officials from Michigan, as well as employees of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS). CNSI outsources some work to India, and that night, Indian as well as American food was served. Liquor flowed freely from an open bar, and CNSI staff clinked glasses with Illinois HFS employees with whom they hoped to work, a whistleblower says, alleging that \u201cthe only people on that boat were people who were being solicited by CNSI .\u201d\n\nIn addition to the boat party, CNSI hosted a bigger event in the ballroom of the conference hotel, also attended by Illinois officials. That party, too, had an open bar and buffet tables, as well as Bollywood performers for the guests\u2019 entertainment, according to a source close to the project.\n\nAnother source within the government claims that CNSI also hosted a private party in a hotel suite that night, inviting only people it wanted to do business with, including Illinois officials. HFS spokeswoman Kelly Jakubek denies that allegation.\n\nThat entertaining may have violated the Illinois State Officials and Employee Ethics Act, which forbids officials to accept refreshments or gifts worth more than $75 per person. National Review was not able to confirm which boat company provided the cruise. But Boston Harbor Cruises reports that its fee for boat rental alone for 50 people is $1,000 for three hours; a buffet costs around $80 per person, and an open bar costs an additional $42.67 per person. Other companies offering cruises would not quote a specific price, or had not returned calls.\n\nIllinois HFS responded to an information request by government-accountability blog Edgar County Watchdogs, confirming that at least six state employees, several of whom were positioned to make key decisions regarding the upgrade contract, were on a boat in the Boston harbor with CNSI representatives, though \u201cHFS does not know who paid for the boat trip.\u201d (1)\n\nHFS\u2019s Jakubek says CNSI did not solicit Illinois government employees on the boat. In an e-mail, she told National Review that ten HFS employees were at the conference, and \u201cthey attended various events/activities that were offered to all attendees as part of the conference and they complied with all state ethics rules.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower says that after OpenTheBooks.com and Edgar County Watchdogs broke the story about Illinois officials\u2019 partying in the Boston Harbor, several of those officials removed photos of the event from their Facebook pages and office desks.\n\n* * *\n\nTo prevent fraud and abuse, the federal government requires states to send specific data about Medicaid payments and beneficiaries to CMS . The amount of information required was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStates should already have this information on hand in their Medicaid databases, but Illinois\u2019s system, which processes $14 billion in annual payments, (2) was created in 1982 and had continued to run through a series of patchwork fixes, which had become increasingly cumbersome.\n\nAbout five months before the boat party, Michigan had approached Illinois to discuss the possibility of sharing a Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), a complex program that stores data about beneficiaries and providers and processes claims and payments. Michigan\u2019s own system had been built by CNSI . The contract was awarded in 2006 at $51.5 million but has grown to a current aggregate value of over $227 million.\n\nIllinois would normally go through a highly competitive procurement process to find a vendor for a project such as the MMIS upgrade. That process typically includes soliciting and evaluating multiple bids, vetting possible contractors for compliance with Illinois state law, and negotiating a contract. For a project as big as this one, procurement could take between 18 months and two years, Matt Brown, Illinois\u2019s chief procurement officer, said in an interview with National Review.\n\nBut contracts between governments are exempt from the Illinois procurement code,(3) and in December 2012, Illinois signed an intergovernmental agreement to enter formal planning discussions to share Michigan\u2019s Medicaid IT system. (4) Under the agreement, Illinois will write a check to the state of Michigan, and then Michigan will collaborate with CNSI to deliver the system, paying the company and managing its work.\n\nBrown says the intergovernmental agreement was \u201cwhere a lot of the state\u2019s policies start to be tested: What does it mean to access resources through the state of Michigan? Was that a no-bid contract with the state of Michigan\u2019s contractor? Well, no, because we don\u2019t contract with the state of Michigan\u2019s contractor. We contract with the state of Michigan.\u201d He adds that after reviewing the transaction thoroughly, he \u201cdid not find any circumventing of competitive practice,\u201d and that \u201cthe state of Michigan and the state of Illinois both have something to gain in this partnership.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Andrzejewski, founder of OpentheBooks.com, says via e-mail that \u201cIllinois has now set a precedent to purchase anything it wants without a competitive bid process as long as they can find a state to resell the product or service to Illinois.\u201d\n\nJakubek says the intergovernmental agreement is \u201cfully consistent with Illinois law. The purpose of the Procurement Code is to enable the state to get the best possible price while ensuring integrity and ethical conduct. We have worked diligently with the state\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer from the beginning to ensure full compliance with Illinois\u2019 procurement laws.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the whistleblowers tells National Review that Illinois \u201cdid not have to go this route.\u201d It \u201ccould have easily procured this the right way and put it out for a bid, but the time frame and the excuse they were looking for was Obamacare\u2019s October deadline,\u201d even though enhanced federal funding would have extended beyond October 1. Jakubek says the upgrade project is \u201cnot related to the Oct. 1 launch of the Health Insurance Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSince the intergovernmental agreement was signed, CNSI has hosted a lavish dinner party in Michigan for Illinois officials, according to a source close to the Illinois government. Furthermore, a whistleblower says that CNSI sent bottles of wine and a box of Cuban cigars to HFS officials who would be working on the upgrade.\n\nEdgar County Watchdogs sent a public-information request about these allegations to HFS, asking for information about gifts given to its employees. \u201cWe assume you mean gifts given by CNSI ,\u201d responded Kiran Mehta, the Freedom of Information officer. The agency confirmed that one employee, who was close to the upgrade, had \u201creceived two cigars, although she does not know what kind of cigars they were.\u201d A whistleblower says that more than one employee received gifts, and that the gifts were well in excess of two cigars.\n\nNational Review asked Jakubek whether CNSI had sent bottles of wine and a box of Cuban cigars to employees who would be working on the MMIS upgrade. \u201cNo,\u201d she wrote back in an e-mail. \u201cTo be clear, your allegations listed above are false.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nNational Review\u2019s interviews with whistleblowers also raise questions about the working relationship between Illinois officials and CNSI . A source close to the upgrade project says the HFS\u2019s chief information officer, Stephen DePooter, and others on the team have corresponded copiously with CNSI , sometimes sharing information that would give the company an unfair advantage. The whistleblower said DePooter was one of the key people gunning for the collaboration with Michigan and CNSI . And e-mails obtained through a public-records request appear to show that DePooter coached CNSI on how to respond to CMS , which must sign off on the project at the federal level. HFS says the project did not receive federal CMS approval until May 2013.\n\nOn January 28, 2013, DePooter e-mailed Sharif Hussein, a senior vice president at CNSI who, sources say, worked closely with Illinois officials and hosted parties for them. Copying two Illinois state employees and a Michigan counterpart, DePooter told Hussein that \u201cwe need to be sure to mold the new story into one that includes benefits both [sic] for both states so it appeals to both state specific audiences as well as the Feds.\u201d DePooter also told Hussein that a presentation by Netlogx, a company that had earlier presented to CMS on cloud-based Medicaid systems, \u201ccould lend value to the final presentation.\u201d In addition, he sent along internal decision memos and an annual report, \u201cin case any verbiage there may be useful.\u201d\n\nNicholas Taylor, a partner at Netlogx, tells National Review that the presentation referred to in the e-mails was not confidential.\n\nHussein later replied to DePooter, copying Karen Parker, the director of the Bureau of Medicaid Financial Management & Administrative Services at the Michigan Department of Community Health. He asked them \u201cto extract the salient points that have already been presented to CMS .\u201d\n\nOn February 22, 2013, James Gorman, the senior technical adviser at the Data and Systems Group for CMS , e-mailed DePooter, telling him that \u201cwe want to take a look\u201d at an alternative option for an MMIS claims-processing system that \u201cis billed by the contractor as a faster, better, cheaper solution.\u201d\n\nDePooter promptly forwarded the e-mail to Parker and asked her to discuss it with Hussein, who immediately responded that \u201cour solution is a proven and certified solution, theirs is not yet implemented and it is just a claim they are making that it would be faster and cheaper. We are ready to engage in these discussions at any time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that for a quick response?\u201d Parker wrote to DePooter.\n\n\u201cChuckle . . . I would expect nothing less! ;),\u201d DePooter replied.\n\nA whistleblower says that more than 3,900 e-mails were traded between CNSI and Illinois officials. Edgar County Watchdogs and OpenTheBooks.com sent a Freedom of Information Act request for this correspondence, but fewer than a quarter of the e-mails were released, they say.\n\nDePooter could not be reached for comment. Jakubek denies that DePooter ever shared information with CNSI or gave the company advice that would help it make a better presentation or gain the approval of CMS .\n\n\u201cIllinois has an intergovernmental agreement with the state of Michigan and CNSI is one of Michigan\u2019s vendors,\u201d Jakubek wrote in an e-mail. \u201cCommunication with MI and the entire project team is ethical and necessary to work on this project.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the whistleblowers, at least two state employees working on the upgrade have already interviewed for jobs at CNSI , raising concerns about a revolving door. National Review directly confirmed that at least one employee has interviewed with CNSI , and a whistleblower says at least two have.\n\nJakubek said HFS was aware of no employees who had interviewed for jobs with CNSI .\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time questions have been raised about the appropriateness of communications between CNSI and state officials.\n\nLouisiana canceled its contract with CNSI on March 21, and a week later, Secretary of Health and Hospitals Bruce Greenstein resigned amid allegations that he had abused his position to secure the MMIS contract for CNSI , where he had worked as a vice president in 1995\u201396. The governor\u2019s office confirmed in April that Greenstein had exchanged \u201chundreds of phone calls\u201d and \u201cthousands of text messages\u201d with CNSI as it competed for the contract. Earlier, Greenstein had testified under oath that he had \u201climited involvement with a contract and the companies vying to win it,\u201d the Times-Picayune reported. CNSI is now under federal and state criminal investigation for its dealings in Louisiana.\n\n* * *\n\nShady dealings are only one concern; taxpayer expense is another. In several states where CNSI had done similar work, the company had bid low, only to see costs grow significantly after the contract had been awarded to it (although some of these cost increases have been attributable to ongoing maintenance and system enhancements). Furthermore, according to sources in some of the states, there were problems with the quality of the product CNSI delivered.\n\nIn Louisiana, CNSI submitted a bid for $185 million and received the contract but then a few months later asked for $40 million extra, \u201cwhich would have placed CNSI \u2019s bid in the ballpark of competitors,\u201d the Chicago Tribune recently reported. ACS State Healthcare Services, a competitor for the Louisiana contract, alleged in 2011 that \u201c CNSI \u2019s proposal constitutes a gross underestimate of what a prudent fiscal intermediary would incur to fulfill its obligations. . . . CNSI \u2019s numerous incomplete, ignored and flat incorrect submissions as a proposal [sic], nonetheless enabled it to \u2018game the system,\u2019 in contravention of the Procurement code.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, South Dakota gave the company a $62.7 million contract, and the communications director told National Review that was the final amount, although a 2011 local news report had said the system was \u201cexpected to cost far in excess of $80 million.\u201d And state representative Susan Wismer (D., Britton), tells National Review the contract with CNSI was \u201ca disaster for several years.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Washington State awarded CNSI a $77.2 million contract to design, develop, and implement a new MMIS. But the final bill came in at $105.8 million, and a new operation and maintenance agreement awarded to CNSI puts the current aggregate value of the contract at $467.1 million, according to Cindy Davidson, Washington\u2019s MMIS federal liaison.\n\nAnd in Michigan, as noted earlier, CNSI was awarded the contract in 2006 for $51.5 million, which has since more than quadrupled, to an aggregate value of more than $227 million.\n\nAnd then there is CNSI \u2019s foray into Maine, which is a cautionary tale of epic proportions. The company\u2019s first bid for a Medicaid processing system, in 2001, was $15 million, half the bid by the competing vendor. After substantial delays, the system was launched in January 2005 but then crashed, suspending more than 600,000 Medicaid claims, the Chicago Tribune reported recently.\n\nCIO magazine reported in April 2006 that hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients with unpaid bills \u201cwere turned away from their doctor\u2019s offices. . . . Several dentists and therapists were forced to close their doors, and some physicians had to take out loans to stay afloat. With the Medicaid program accounting for one-third of the entire state budget, Maine\u2019s finances were in shambles, threatening the state\u2019s financial stability and its credit rating.\u201d\n\nEventually, Maine was forced to issue more than $500 million in temporary payments, and so problematic was CNSI \u2019s product that CMS eventually halted federal cost-sharing. Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, a former official with the Maine Health and Human Services Department said that the cost of implementing the system had, at that point, grown to \u201cwell over tenfold of what the . . . contract was at the beginning.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nNational Review asked Jakubek why Illinois is partnering with Michigan to buy a CNSI product, given the company\u2019s criminal investigation in Louisiana and the increased costs and quality problems in other states.\n\nShe responded by e-mail that the partnership met Illinois\u2019s three primary goals: \u201cto save taxpayer money, mitigate risk and reduce the time it will take to modernize Illinois\u2019 30-year-old antiquated system.\u201d Jakubek added that \u201cbased on Michigan\u2019s successful implementation of its MMIS system and the fact that they already have federal certification, the Illinois-Michigan partnership represents the best technological solution at an optimal, cost-effective pricing structure. Illinois and Michigan are utilizing a system already implemented, thereby drastically reducing risk.\u201d\n\nBut given CNSI \u2019s long and troubled history in other states, Illinois taxpayers should cringe: The state is indirectly awarding it a multimillion-dollar contract, which could potentially grow much larger, using an anticompetitive process that is subject to little sunshine. And because the federal government will cover 90 percent of the cost, the contract is of concern to taxpayers across the United States. Ultimately, it boils down to a question of trust. And, unfortunately, the reputations both of Illinois politics and of CNSI precede them.\n\n\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior is a Thomas L.

CNSI outsources some work to India, and that night, Indian as well as American food was served.

National Review was not able to confirm which boat company provided the cruise. But Boston Harbor Cruises reports that its fee for boat rental alone for 50 people is $1,000 for three hours; a buffet costs around $80 per person, and an open bar costs an additional $42.67 per person.

Jakubek denies that DePooter ever shared information with CNSI or gave the company advice that would help it make a better presentation or gain the approval of CMS.\n\n\u201cIllinois has an intergovernmental agreement with the state of Michigan and CNSI is one of Michigan\u2019s vendors,\u201d Jakubek wrote in an e-mail. \u201cCommunication with MI and the entire project team is ethical and necessary to work on this project.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the whistleblowers, at least two state employees working on the upgrade have already interviewed for jobs at CNSI, raising concerns about a revolving door.\u00a0National Review directly confirmed that at least one employee has interviewed with CNSI, and a whistleblower says at least two have.\n\nJakubek said HFS was aware of no employees who had interviewed for jobs with CNSI.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time questions have been raised about the appropriateness of communications between CNSI and state officials.\n\nLouisiana canceled its contract with CNSI on March 21, and a week later, Secretary of Health and Hospitals Bruce Greenstein resigned amid allegations that he had abused his position to secure the MMIS contract for CNSI, where he had worked as a vice president in 1995\u201396. The governor\u2019s office confirmed in April that Greenstein had exchanged \u201chundreds of phone calls\u201d and \u201cthousands of text messages\u201d with CNSI as it competed for the contract. Earlier, Greenstein had testified under oath that he had \u201climited involvement with a contract and the companies vying to win it,\u201d the Times-Picayune reported. CNSI is now under federal and state criminal investigation for its dealings in Louisiana.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nShady dealings are only one concern; taxpayer expense is another. In several states where CNSI had done similar work, the company had bid low, only to see costs grow significantly after the contract had been awarded to it (although some of these cost increases have been attributable to ongoing maintenance and system enhancements). Furthermore, according to sources in some of the states, there were problems with the quality of the product CNSI delivered.\n\nIn Louisiana, CNSI submitted a bid for $185 million and received the contract but then a few months later asked for $40 million extra, \u201cwhich would have placed CNSI\u2019s bid in the ballpark of competitors,\u201d the Chicago Tribune recently reported. ACS State Healthcare Services, a competitor for the Louisiana contract, alleged in 2011 that \u201cCNSI\u2019s proposal constitutes a gross underestimate of what a prudent fiscal intermediary would incur to fulfill its obligations. . . . CNSI\u2019s numerous incomplete, ignored and flat incorrect submissions as a proposal [sic], nonetheless enabled it to \u2018game the system,\u2019 in contravention of the Procurement code.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, South Dakota gave the company a $62.7 million contract, and the communications director told National Review that was the final amount, although a 2011 local news report had said the system was \u201cexpected to cost far in excess of $80 million.\u201d And state representative Susan Wismer (D., Britton), tells National Review the contract with CNSI was \u201ca disaster for several years.\u201d\u00a0\n\n#page#In 2005, Washington State awarded CNSI a $77.2 million contract to design, develop, and implement a new MMIS. But the final bill came in at $105.8 million, and a new operation and maintenance agreement awarded to CNSI puts the current aggregate value of the contract at $467.1 million, according to Cindy Davidson, Washington\u2019s MMIS federal liaison.\n\nAnd in Michigan, as noted earlier, CNSI was awarded the contract in 2006 for $51.5 million, which has since more than quadrupled, to an aggregate value of more than $227 million. \u00a0\n\nAnd then there is CNSI\u2019s foray into Maine, which is a cautionary tale of epic proportions. The company\u2019s first bid for a Medicaid processing system, in 2001, was $15 million, half the bid by the competing vendor. After substantial delays, the system was launched in January 2005 but then crashed, suspending more than 600,000 Medicaid claims, the Chicago Tribune reported recently.\n\n#ad#CIO magazine reported in April 2006 that hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients with unpaid bills \u201cwere turned away from their doctor\u2019s offices.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0Several dentists and therapists were forced to close their doors, and some physicians had to take out loans to stay afloat. With the Medicaid program accounting for one-third of the entire state budget, Maine\u2019s finances were in shambles, threatening the state\u2019s financial stability and its credit rating.\u201d\n\nEventually, Maine was forced to issue more than $500 million in temporary payments, and so problematic was CNSI\u2019s product that CMS eventually halted federal cost-sharing. Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, a former official with the Maine Health and Human Services Department said that the cost of implementing the system had, at that point, grown to \u201cwell over tenfold of what the . . . contract was at the beginning.\u201d\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nNational Review asked Jakubek why Illinois is partnering with Michigan to buy a CNSI product, given the company\u2019s criminal investigation in Louisiana and the increased costs and quality problems in other states.\n\nShe responded by e-mail that the partnership met Illinois\u2019s three primary goals: \u201cto save taxpayer money, mitigate risk and reduce the time it will take to modernize Illinois\u2019 30-year-old antiquated system.\u201d Jakubek added that \u201cbased on Michigan\u2019s successful implementation of its MMIS system and the fact that they already have federal certification, the Illinois-Michigan partnership represents the best technological solution at an optimal, cost-effective pricing structure. Illinois and Michigan are utilizing a system already implemented, thereby drastically reducing risk.\u201d\n\nBut given CNSI\u2019s long and troubled history in other states, Illinois taxpayers should cringe: The state is indirectly awarding it a multimillion-dollar contract, which could potentially grow much larger, using an anticompetitive process that is subject to little sunshine. And because the federal government will cover 90 percent of the cost, the contract is of concern to taxpayers across the United States. Ultimately, it boils down to a question of trust. And, unfortunately, the reputations both of Illinois politics and of CNSI precede them.\n\n\u00a0\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior is a Thomas L.

These sources within the Illinois government allege unethical and potentially unlawful behavior.\n\n#ad#It looks like pure Chicago politics, but taxpayers both in Illinois and across the United States may end up footing the bill, since the federal government will pay for 90 percent of Illinois\u2019s system upgrade. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has approved an upgrade costing as much as $190 million, though the state claims that because it is partnering with Michigan on the project, it will cost only $85 million.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nIn late August 2012, private- and public-sector workers gathered in Boston from across the United States to attend the Medicaid Enterprise Systems Conference, an annual event focused on the IT systems that support Medicaid.\n\nThey found time for fun. According to sources within the Illinois government, CNSI rented a two-story boat to cruise Boston Harbor for a private party. The 50 or so guests included several officials from Michigan, as well as employees of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS). CNSI outsources some work to India, and that night, Indian as well as American food was served. Liquor flowed freely from an open bar, and CNSI staff clinked glasses with Illinois HFS employees with whom they hoped to work, a whistleblower says, alleging that \u201cthe only people on that boat were people who were being solicited by CNSI.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the boat party, CNSI hosted a bigger event in the ballroom of the conference hotel, also attended by Illinois officials. That party, too, had an open bar and buffet tables, as well as Bollywood performers for the guests\u2019 entertainment, according to a source close to the project.\n\nAnother source within the government claims that CNSI also hosted a private party in a hotel suite that night, inviting only people it wanted to do business with, including Illinois officials. HFS spokeswoman Kelly Jakubek denies that allegation.\n\nThat entertaining may have violated the Illinois State Officials and Employee Ethics Act, which forbids officials to accept refreshments or gifts worth more than $75 per person. National Review was not able to confirm which boat company provided the cruise. But Boston Harbor Cruises reports that its fee for boat rental alone for 50 people is $1,000 for three hours; a buffet costs around $80 per person, and an open bar costs an additional $42.67 per person. Other companies offering cruises would not quote a specific price, or had not returned calls.\u00a0\n\nIllinois HFS responded to an information request by government-accountability blog Edgar County Watchdogs, confirming that at least six state employees, several of whom were positioned to make key decisions regarding the upgrade contract, were on a boat in the Boston harbor with CNSI representatives, though \u201cHFS does not know who paid for the boat trip.\u201d (1)\n\nHFS\u2019s Jakubek says CNSI did not solicit Illinois government employees on the boat. In an e-mail, she told National Review that ten HFS employees were at the conference, and \u201cthey attended various events/activities that were offered to all attendees as part of the conference and they complied with all state ethics rules.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower says that after OpenTheBooks.com and Edgar County Watchdogs broke the story about Illinois officials\u2019 partying in the Boston Harbor, several of those officials removed photos of the event from their Facebook pages and office desks.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nTo prevent fraud and abuse, the federal government requires states to send specific data about Medicaid payments and beneficiaries to CMS. The amount of information required was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n#page#States should already have this information on hand in their Medicaid databases, but Illinois\u2019s system, which processes $14 billion in annual payments, (2) was created in 1982 and had continued to run through a series of patchwork fixes, which had become increasingly cumbersome.\n\nAbout five months before the boat party, Michigan had approached Illinois to discuss the possibility of sharing a Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), a complex program that stores data about beneficiaries and providers and processes claims and payments. Michigan\u2019s own system had been built by CNSI. The contract was awarded in 2006 at $51.5 million but has grown to a current aggregate value of over $227 million.\u00a0\n\n#ad#Illinois would normally go through a highly competitive procurement process to find a vendor for a project such as the MMIS upgrade. That process typically includes soliciting and evaluating multiple bids, vetting possible contractors for compliance with Illinois state law, and negotiating a contract.\u00a0 For a project as big as this one, procurement could take between 18 months and two years, Matt Brown, Illinois\u2019s chief procurement officer, said in an interview with National Review.\n\nBut contracts between governments are exempt from the Illinois procurement code,(3) and in December 2012, Illinois signed an intergovernmental agreement to enter formal planning discussions to share Michigan\u2019s Medicaid IT system. (4) Under the agreement, Illinois will write a check to the state of Michigan, and then Michigan will collaborate with CNSI to deliver the system, paying the company and managing its work.\n\nBrown says the intergovernmental agreement was \u201cwhere a lot of the state\u2019s policies start to be tested: What does it mean to access resources through the state of Michigan? Was that a no-bid contract with the state of Michigan\u2019s contractor? Well, no, because we don\u2019t contract with the state of Michigan\u2019s contractor. We contract with the state of Michigan.\u201d He adds that after reviewing the transaction thoroughly, he \u201cdid not find any circumventing of competitive practice,\u201d and that \u201cthe state of Michigan and the state of Illinois both have something to gain in this partnership.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Andrzejewski, founder of OpentheBooks.com, says via e-mail that \u201cIllinois has now set a precedent to purchase anything it wants without a competitive bid process as long as they can find a state to resell the product or service to Illinois.\u201d\n\nJakubek says the intergovernmental agreement is \u201cfully consistent with Illinois law. The purpose of the Procurement Code is to enable the state to get the best possible price while ensuring integrity and ethical conduct. We have worked diligently with the state\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer from the beginning to ensure full compliance with Illinois\u2019 procurement laws.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the whistleblowers tells National Review that Illinois \u201cdid not have to go this route.\u201d It \u201ccould have easily procured this the right way and put it out for a bid, but the time frame and the excuse they were looking for was Obamacare\u2019s October deadline,\u201d even though enhanced federal funding would have extended beyond October 1. Jakubek says the upgrade project is \u201cnot related to the Oct. 1 launch of the Health Insurance Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSince the intergovernmental agreement was signed, CNSI has hosted a lavish dinner party in Michigan for Illinois officials, according to a source close to the Illinois government. Furthermore, a whistleblower says that CNSI sent bottles of wine and a box of Cuban cigars to HFS officials who would be working on the upgrade.\n\nEdgar County Watchdogs sent a public-information request about these allegations to HFS, asking for information about gifts given to its employees. \u201cWe assume you mean gifts given by CNSI,\u201d responded Kiran Mehta, the Freedom of Information officer. The agency confirmed that one employee, who was close to the upgrade, had \u201creceived two cigars, although she does not know what kind of cigars they were.\u201d A whistleblower says that more than one employee received gifts, and that the gifts were well in excess of two cigars.\n\nNational Review asked Jakubek whether CNSI had sent bottles of wine and a box of Cuban cigars to employees who would be working on the MMIS upgrade. \u201cNo,\u201d she wrote back in an e-mail. \u201cTo be clear, your allegations listed above are false.\u201d\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nNational Review\u2019s interviews with whistleblowers also raise questions about the working relationship between Illinois officials and CNSI. A source close to the upgrade project says the HFS\u2019s chief information officer, Stephen DePooter, and others on the team have corresponded copiously with CNSI, sometimes sharing information that would give the company an unfair advantage. The whistleblower said DePooter was one of the key people gunning for the collaboration with Michigan and CNSI. And e-mails obtained through a public-records request appear to show that DePooter coached CNSI on how to respond to CMS, which must sign off on the project at the federal level. HFS says the project did not receive federal CMS approval until May 2013.\n\n#page#On January 28, 2013, DePooter e-mailed Sharif Hussein, a senior vice president at CNSI who, sources say, worked closely with Illinois officials and hosted parties for them. Copying two Illinois state employees and a Michigan counterpart, DePooter told Hussein that \u201cwe need to be sure to mold the new story into one that includes benefits both [sic] for both states so it appeals to both state specific audiences as well as the Feds.\u201d DePooter also told Hussein that a presentation by Netlogx, a company that had earlier presented to CMS on cloud-based Medicaid systems, \u201ccould lend value to the final presentation.\u201d In addition, he sent along internal decision memos and an annual report, \u201cin case any verbiage there may be useful.\u201d\n\nNicholas Taylor, a partner at Netlogx, tells National Review that the presentation referred to in the e-mails was not confidential.\n\n#ad#Hussein later replied to DePooter, copying Karen Parker, the director of the Bureau of Medicaid Financial Management & Administrative Services at the Michigan Department of Community Health. He asked them \u201cto extract the salient points that have already been presented to CMS.\u201d\n\nOn February 22, 2013, James Gorman, the senior technical adviser at the Data and Systems Group for CMS, e-mailed DePooter, telling him that \u201cwe want to take a look\u201d at an alternative option for an MMIS claims-processing system that \u201cis billed by the contractor as a faster, better, cheaper solution.\u201d\n\nDePooter promptly forwarded the e-mail to Parker and asked her to discuss it with Hussein, who immediately responded that \u201cour solution is a proven and certified solution, theirs is not yet implemented and it is just a claim they are making that it would be faster and cheaper. We are ready to engage in these discussions at any time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that for a quick response?\u201d Parker wrote to DePooter.\n\n\u201cChuckle . . .

But Boston Harbor Cruises reports that its fee for boat rental alone for 50 people is $1,000 for three hours; a buffet costs around $80 per person, and an open bar costs an additional $42.67 per person. Other companies offering cruises would not quote a specific price, or had not returned calls.\u00a0\n\nIllinois HFS responded to an information request by government-accountability blog Edgar County Watchdogs, confirming that at least six state employees, several of whom were positioned to make key decisions regarding the upgrade contract, were on a boat in the Boston harbor with CNSI representatives, though \u201cHFS does not know who paid for the boat trip.\u201d (1)\n\nHFS\u2019s Jakubek says CNSI did not solicit Illinois government employees on the boat. In an e-mail, she told National Review that ten HFS employees were at the conference, and \u201cthey attended various events/activities that were offered to all attendees as part of the conference and they complied with all state ethics rules.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower says that after OpenTheBooks.com and Edgar County Watchdogs broke the story about Illinois officials\u2019 partying in the Boston Harbor, several of those officials removed photos of the event from their Facebook pages and office desks.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nTo prevent fraud and abuse, the federal government requires states to send specific data about Medicaid payments and beneficiaries to CMS. The amount of information required was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n#page#States should already have this information on hand in their Medicaid databases, but Illinois\u2019s system, which processes $14 billion in annual payments, (2) was created in 1982 and had continued to run through a series of patchwork fixes, which had become increasingly cumbersome.\n\nAbout five months before the boat party, Michigan had approached Illinois to discuss the possibility of sharing a Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), a complex program that stores data about beneficiaries and providers and processes claims and payments. Michigan\u2019s own system had been built by CNSI. The contract was awarded in 2006 at $51.5 million but has grown to a current aggregate value of over $227 million.\u00a0\n\n#ad#Illinois would normally go through a highly competitive procurement process to find a vendor for a project such as the MMIS upgrade. That process typically includes soliciting and evaluating multiple bids, vetting possible contractors for compliance with Illinois state law, and negotiating a contract.\u00a0 For a project as big as this one, procurement could take between 18 months and two years, Matt Brown, Illinois\u2019s chief procurement officer, said in an interview with National Review.\n\nBut contracts between governments are exempt from the Illinois procurement code,(3) and in December 2012, Illinois signed an intergovernmental agreement to enter formal planning discussions to share Michigan\u2019s Medicaid IT system. (4) Under the agreement, Illinois will write a check to the state of Michigan, and then Michigan will collaborate with CNSI to deliver the system, paying the company and managing its work.\n\nBrown says the intergovernmental agreement was \u201cwhere a lot of the state\u2019s policies start to be tested: What does it mean to access resources through the state of Michigan? Was that a no-bid contract with the state of Michigan\u2019s contractor? Well, no, because we don\u2019t contract with the state of Michigan\u2019s contractor. We contract with the state of Michigan.\u201d He adds that after reviewing the transaction thoroughly, he \u201cdid not find any circumventing of competitive practice,\u201d and that \u201cthe state of Michigan and the state of Illinois both have something to gain in this partnership.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Andrzejewski, founder of OpentheBooks.com, says via e-mail that \u201cIllinois has now set a precedent to purchase anything it wants without a competitive bid process as long as they can find a state to resell the product or service to Illinois.\u201d\n\nJakubek says the intergovernmental agreement is \u201cfully consistent with Illinois law. The purpose of the Procurement Code is to enable the state to get the best possible price while ensuring integrity and ethical conduct. We have worked diligently with the state\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer from the beginning to ensure full compliance with Illinois\u2019 procurement laws.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the whistleblowers tells National Review that Illinois \u201cdid not have to go this route.\u201d It \u201ccould have easily procured this the right way and put it out for a bid, but the time frame and the excuse they were looking for was Obamacare\u2019s October deadline,\u201d even though enhanced federal funding would have extended beyond October 1. Jakubek says the upgrade project is \u201cnot related to the Oct. 1 launch of the Health Insurance Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSince the intergovernmental agreement was signed, CNSI has hosted a lavish dinner party in Michigan for Illinois officials, according to a source close to the Illinois government. Furthermore, a whistleblower says that CNSI sent bottles of wine and a box of Cuban cigars to HFS officials who would be working on the upgrade.\n\nEdgar County Watchdogs sent a public-information request about these allegations to HFS, asking for information about gifts given to its employees. \u201cWe assume you mean gifts given by CNSI,\u201d responded Kiran Mehta, the Freedom of Information officer. The agency confirmed that one employee, who was close to the upgrade, had \u201creceived two cigars, although she does not know what kind of cigars they were.\u201d A whistleblower says that more than one employee received gifts, and that the gifts were well in excess of two cigars.\n\nNational Review asked Jakubek whether CNSI had sent bottles of wine and a box of Cuban cigars to employees who would be working on the MMIS upgrade. \u201cNo,\u201d she wrote back in an e-mail. \u201cTo be clear, your allegations listed above are false.\u201d\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nNational Review\u2019s interviews with whistleblowers also raise questions about the working relationship between Illinois officials and CNSI. A source close to the upgrade project says the HFS\u2019s chief information officer, Stephen DePooter, and others on the team have corresponded copiously with CNSI, sometimes sharing information that would give the company an unfair advantage. The whistleblower said DePooter was one of the key people gunning for the collaboration with Michigan and CNSI. And e-mails obtained through a public-records request appear to show that DePooter coached CNSI on how to respond to CMS, which must sign off on the project at the federal level. HFS says the project did not receive federal CMS approval until May 2013.\n\n#page#On January 28, 2013, DePooter e-mailed Sharif Hussein, a senior vice president at CNSI who, sources say, worked closely with Illinois officials and hosted parties for them. Copying two Illinois state employees and a Michigan counterpart, DePooter told Hussein that \u201cwe need to be sure to mold the new story into one that includes benefits both [sic] for both states so it appeals to both state specific audiences as well as the Feds.\u201d DePooter also told Hussein that a presentation by Netlogx, a company that had earlier presented to CMS on cloud-based Medicaid systems, \u201ccould lend value to the final presentation.\u201d In addition, he sent along internal decision memos and an annual report, \u201cin case any verbiage there may be useful.\u201d\n\nNicholas Taylor, a partner at Netlogx, tells National Review that the presentation referred to in the e-mails was not confidential.\n\n#ad#Hussein later replied to DePooter, copying Karen Parker, the director of the Bureau of Medicaid Financial Management & Administrative Services at the Michigan Department of Community Health. He asked them \u201cto extract the salient points that have already been presented to CMS.\u201d\n\nOn February 22, 2013, James Gorman, the senior technical adviser at the Data and Systems Group for CMS, e-mailed DePooter, telling him that \u201cwe want to take a look\u201d at an alternative option for an MMIS claims-processing system that \u201cis billed by the contractor as a faster, better, cheaper solution.\u201d\n\nDePooter promptly forwarded the e-mail to Parker and asked her to discuss it with Hussein, who immediately responded that \u201cour solution is a proven and certified solution, theirs is not yet implemented and it is just a claim they are making that it would be faster and cheaper. We are ready to engage in these discussions at any time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that for a quick response?\u201d Parker wrote to DePooter.\n\n\u201cChuckle . . . I would expect nothing less! ;),\u201d DePooter replied.\n\nA whistleblower says that more than 3,900 e-mails were traded between CNSI and Illinois officials. Edgar County Watchdogs and OpenTheBooks.com sent a Freedom of Information Act request for this correspondence, but fewer than a quarter of the e-mails were released, they say.\n\nDePooter could not be reached for comment. Jakubek denies that DePooter ever shared information with CNSI or gave the company advice that would help it make a better presentation or gain the approval of CMS.\n\n\u201cIllinois has an intergovernmental agreement with the state of Michigan and CNSI is one of Michigan\u2019s vendors,\u201d Jakubek wrote in an e-mail. \u201cCommunication with MI and the entire project team is ethical and necessary to work on this project.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the whistleblowers, at least two state employees working on the upgrade have already interviewed for jobs at CNSI, raising concerns about a revolving door.\u00a0National Review directly confirmed that at least one employee has interviewed with CNSI, and a whistleblower says at least two have.\n\nJakubek said HFS was aware of no employees who had interviewed for jobs with CNSI.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time questions have been raised about the appropriateness of communications between CNSI and state officials.\n\nLouisiana canceled its contract with CNSI on March 21, and a week later, Secretary of Health and Hospitals Bruce Greenstein resigned amid allegations that he had abused his position to secure the MMIS contract for CNSI, where he had worked as a vice president in 1995\u201396. The governor\u2019s office confirmed in April that Greenstein had exchanged \u201chundreds of phone calls\u201d and \u201cthousands of text messages\u201d with CNSI as it competed for the contract. Earlier, Greenstein had testified under oath that he had \u201climited involvement with a contract and the companies vying to win it,\u201d the Times-Picayune reported. CNSI is now under federal and state criminal investigation for its dealings in Louisiana.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nShady dealings are only one concern; taxpayer expense is another. In several states where CNSI had done similar work, the company had bid low, only to see costs grow significantly after the contract had been awarded to it (although some of these cost increases have been attributable to ongoing maintenance and system enhancements). Furthermore, according to sources in some of the states, there were problems with the quality of the product CNSI delivered.\n\nIn Louisiana, CNSI submitted a bid for $185 million and received the contract but then a few months later asked for $40 million extra, \u201cwhich would have placed CNSI\u2019s bid in the ballpark of competitors,\u201d the Chicago Tribune recently reported. ACS State Healthcare Services, a competitor for the Louisiana contract, alleged in 2011 that \u201cCNSI\u2019s proposal constitutes a gross underestimate of what a prudent fiscal intermediary would incur to fulfill its obligations. . . . CNSI\u2019s numerous incomplete, ignored and flat incorrect submissions as a proposal [sic], nonetheless enabled it to \u2018game the system,\u2019 in contravention of the Procurement code.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, South Dakota gave the company a $62.7 million contract, and the communications director told National Review that was the final amount, although a 2011 local news report had said the system was \u201cexpected to cost far in excess of $80 million.\u201d And state representative Susan Wismer (D., Britton), tells National Review the contract with CNSI was \u201ca disaster for several years.\u201d\u00a0\n\n#page#In 2005, Washington State awarded CNSI a $77.2 million contract to design, develop, and implement a new MMIS. But the final bill came in at $105.8 million, and a new operation and maintenance agreement awarded to CNSI puts the current aggregate value of the contract at $467.1 million, according to Cindy Davidson, Washington\u2019s MMIS federal liaison.\n\nAnd in Michigan, as noted earlier, CNSI was awarded the contract in 2006 for $51.5 million, which has since more than quadrupled, to an aggregate value of more than $227 million. \u00a0\n\nAnd then there is CNSI\u2019s foray into Maine, which is a cautionary tale of epic proportions. The company\u2019s first bid for a Medicaid processing system, in 2001, was $15 million, half the bid by the competing vendor. After substantial delays, the system was launched in January 2005 but then crashed, suspending more than 600,000 Medicaid claims, the Chicago Tribune reported recently.\n\n#ad#CIO magazine reported in April 2006 that hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients with unpaid bills \u201cwere turned away from their doctor\u2019s offices.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0Several dentists and therapists were forced to close their doors, and some physicians had to take out loans to stay afloat. With the Medicaid program accounting for one-third of the entire state budget, Maine\u2019s finances were in shambles, threatening the state\u2019s financial stability and its credit rating.\u201d\n\nEventually, Maine was forced to issue more than $500 million in temporary payments, and so problematic was CNSI\u2019s product that CMS eventually halted federal cost-sharing. Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, a former official with the Maine Health and Human Services Department said that the cost of implementing the system had, at that point, grown to \u201cwell over tenfold of what the . . . contract was at the beginning.\u201d\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nNational Review asked Jakubek why Illinois is partnering with Michigan to buy a CNSI product, given the company\u2019s criminal investigation in Louisiana and the increased costs and quality problems in other states.\n\nShe responded by e-mail that the partnership met Illinois\u2019s three primary goals: \u201cto save taxpayer money, mitigate risk and reduce the time it will take to modernize Illinois\u2019 30-year-old antiquated system.\u201d Jakubek added that \u201cbased on Michigan\u2019s successful implementation of its MMIS system and the fact that they already have federal certification, the Illinois-Michigan partnership represents the best technological solution at an optimal, cost-effective pricing structure. Illinois and Michigan are utilizing a system already implemented, thereby drastically reducing risk.\u201d\n\nBut given CNSI\u2019s long and troubled history in other states, Illinois taxpayers should cringe: The state is indirectly awarding it a multimillion-dollar contract, which could potentially grow much larger, using an anticompetitive process that is subject to little sunshine. And because the federal government will cover 90 percent of the cost, the contract is of concern to taxpayers across the United States. Ultimately, it boils down to a question of trust. And, unfortunately, the reputations both of Illinois politics and of CNSI precede them.\n\n\u00a0\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior is a Thomas L.
