After all, the president\u2019s health law is persistently unpopular, leading many Republicans to conclude that there\u2019s more risk than reward in telling voters what they\u2019d do differently. The \u201cprevent defense\u201d will probably work this time, but it won\u2019t work forever.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2016 there will be 34 million U.S. residents on Obamacare-sponsored health insurance: 22 million on the law\u2019s health insurance exchanges, and 12 million enrolled in its expansion of Medicaid. It\u2019s certainly possible that the CBO\u2019s estimates are too high. And not all of those 34 million people will have been previously uninsured. But the 2016 election is shaping up ominously for the GOP.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nImagine this scenario: The Republican presidential contenders spend 2015 and 2016 competing with each other to see who can denounce Obamacare\u2014and pledge to repeal it\u2014in the most full-throated terms. If you thought Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cself-deportation\u201d comment was bad in 2012, wait until Hillary runs ads aimed at the tens of millions of voters whose health coverage would be disrupted by repeal.\n\nRepublicans aren\u2019t stupid. They know that repealing Obamacare will be a tough political sell outside the conservative base. But they\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place. Failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they believe, doesn\u2019t just mean they\u2019ll run afoul of the Tea Party. It means that they will have accepted the permanence of Big Government, of European-style welfare statism.\n\nIt turns out that this isn\u2019t true. Conservatives don\u2019t have to repeal Obamacare in order to advance their principles. Indeed, it\u2019s actually possible to take advantage of one of the law\u2019s core provisions\u2014its tax credits for the purchase of private coverage\u2014to reform America\u2019s entire health-entitlement behemoth, and to finally put the country on a fiscally stable trajectory.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan\u2019s proposal to reform Medicare\u2014giving future retirees \u201cpremium support\u201d subsidies to shop for private health insurance\u2014is, in fact, quite similar to Obamacare\u2019s usage of \u201cpremium assistance\u201d tax credits to offer coverage to the uninsured. So what if we used Obamacare to reform Medicaid and Medicare, by gradually migrating future retirees and Medicaid recipients onto a reformed version of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges?\n\nI ran the numbers. In a new white paper published by the Manhattan Institute, we estimate that, by 2023, this approach could reduce the deficit by more than $8 trillion over three decades, while also reducing taxes. That\u2019s more than enough in savings to make the Medicare trust fund permanently solvent. Not solvent for another six or eight or 12 years\u2014but forever.\n\nOther reforms in the plan would allow insurers to offer less costly coverage on the exchanges, making health insurance more affordable for the tens of millions of Americans who will remain uninsured under Obamacare. Indeed, we estimate that under the plan, by 2023, 12 million more Americans would have health coverage than under the unreformed Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: It's a conservative strategy that\u2019s good policy \u2014 and good politics, too.", "title": "Don\u2019t Repeal Obamacare, Transcend It", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/dont-repeal-obamacare-transcend-it-109981.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/08/13/140813_roy_boehner2_gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,2014 Elections,Healthcare,GOP,In The Arena", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: It's a conservative strategy that\u2019s good policy \u2014 and good politics, too.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf8a\"", "article_summary": "In The Arena Don\u2019t Repeal Obamacare, Transcend It A conservative strategy that\u2019s good policy\u2014and good politics, too.\nConservatives don\u2019t have to repeal Obamacare in order to advance their principles.\nSo what if we used Obamacare to reform Medicaid and Medicare, by gradually migrating future retirees and Medicaid recipients onto a reformed version of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges?\nFailing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they believe, doesn\u2019t just mean they\u2019ll run afoul of the Tea Party.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2016 there will be 34 million U.S. residents on Obamacare-sponsored health insurance: 22 million on the law\u2019s health insurance exchanges, and 12 million enrolled in its expansion of Medicaid."}
