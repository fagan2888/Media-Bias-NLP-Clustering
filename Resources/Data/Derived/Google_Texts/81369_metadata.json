Bohannon of Ancient Ocean.\n\nIt seems somehow fitting that J.R. Bohannon started writing the track \u201cAbsolution\u201d in a church: the leader of the Brooklyn drone act Ancient Ocean says the idea for the track came from \u201can internal struggle\u201d over the notion of absolution from sin. The song premieres today on Speakeasy.\n\nThe hypnotic 11-minute instrumental track builds slowly from distant, shuddering atmospherics to an imposing sound that is at once monolithic and spacious. \u201cAbsolution\u201d is based on a two-chord guitar progression that he wrote during a sound check in an old church before a gig. \u201cIt transformed over the course of a year in a live and studio setting,\u201d he says by email.\n\nThe setting certainly ties in with the theme that Bohannon had in mind while writing the tune, which is on Ancient Ocean\u2019s upcoming debut LP, \u201cBlood Moon.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Absolution\u2019 came from an internal struggle over the idea that one can be absolved from all their sins in one fell swoop,\u201d Bohannon says. \u201cThe idea that one\u2019s moral dilemma can be defined by a religious establishment, then ultimately relinquished, was something that left me pondering over the true value of the act of absolution. It always seemed like a double-edged sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood Moon\u201d is due June 30 on Beyond Beyond Is Beyond Records. What do you think of the track?
