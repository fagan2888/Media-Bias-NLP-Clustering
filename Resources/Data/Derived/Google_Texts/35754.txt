If you are part of the class of 2014, be thankful that “Late Night” host Seth Meyers was not your commencement speaker this year. Because he has his own show, though, Meyers got to rain on your parade anyway, with a demotivational speech that declares, “Your whole life is ahead of you. Not the fun part — that part’s over — but the other part.”

“Let’s be honest — if you’re gay, it gets better. If you’re anyone else, it gets worse,” Meyers said, before he uttered a bunch of platitudes that are really just short sentences. Eh, maybe you’ll appreciate this speech more when you’re a little older, living in a van down by the river.
