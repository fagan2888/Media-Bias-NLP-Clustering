Everybody was wrong about Donald Trump, Republican candidate for president of the United States.\n\nAll the fancy-pants pundits missed the boiling anger and resentment driving Trump\u2019s Republican primary voters. Economic woes, job insecurity, debts, taxes, foreign competition; life is so bad in America that any fool will do for president.\n\nThe crazy thing, beyond the essential madness that is a Trump candidacy, is that America won\u2019t be safer with him as president, especially if he fulfills his many promises.\n\nIn fact President Trump could be the best thing ever for America\u2019s enemies. By destabilizing a great and stable country, he will achieve changes the terrorists and dictators could only dream of.\n\nConsider what he\u2019s already done.\n\nTrump has upended the Republican Party and humiliated its leadership.\n\nGranted, the party that brought you Bush, Cheney, 15 years of war and a global economic collapse deserved shame and mortification, if not prison.\n\nBut if your goal is to undermine American democracy, then wrecking a Grand Old Party is useful. If you\u2019re ISIS or Vladimir Putin and democracy is your enemy, Trump is your friend. He\u2019s wrecking one of two legitimate American parties.\n\nTrump will further undermine democracy by stifling free speech and the independent press by making libel suits easier to prosecute and by installing judges who agree with him.\n\nTrump says he\u2019ll encourage Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, almost certainly setting off an arms race in Asia. That won\u2019t make Americans safer.\n\nTrump says he\u2019ll use the U.S. military to impose America\u2019s will on the world. He doesn\u2019t realize that Washington\u2019s been trying that for years, and failing.\n\nPresident Trump will alienate America\u2019s traditional partners by trying to impose his priorities on friends as well as enemies. Even the mighty U.S.A. needs friends and that\u2019s no way to keep them.\n\nFurther, by withdrawing into Trump\u2019s fearful isolation, the few allies America has in the Middle East and Southwest Asia could be driven into the arms of ISIS and its loathsome accomplices.\n\nThen by fulfilling his promise to mistreat American Muslims, he\u2019ll deliver propaganda ammunition to radical Islamists around the world. You can\u2019t buy that kind of publicity. President Trump might turn out to be the best friend the terrorists ever had.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise to repudiate trade agreements will destabilize world markets and create vast economic uncertainty.\n\nUnfortunately for Canada and other countries, America isn\u2019t too big to fail. It\u2019s just too big to fail alone.\n\nMeanwhile Trump will sharpen racial tensions in the U.S., which are already acute. African Americans see him as the white man\u2019s candidate and that\u2019s never good.\n\nNo doubt there\u2019s a big gap between what Trump promises and what he will do if elected. Republican primary voters believe he\u2019ll keep his promises, making him unique among politicians. I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nThe same people who think they\u2019re insightful by making inane statements like \u201cthey\u2019re all the same\u201d (except Trump) will find out that global affairs are complicated and that mistakes have consequences.\n\nTrump won\u2019t keep a higher percentage of his promises than other presidents. But he might keep enough of them to provoke joy among the dark forces wishing harm upon the United States.\n\nThe New York Times reported, after extensively interviewing Trump, that his immediate priorities are to tighten up immigration and to intimidate corporations shifting jobs overseas.\n\nWithin 100 days of a Trump presidency, the promised wall with Mexico will be designed, an immigration ban on Muslims will be in place, an audit of the Federal Reserve will be started as well as a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare.\n\nBy then, America\u2019s global foes will be scheming to exploit opportunities the election has wrought and the creeping mass confusion of a superpower become suddenly vulnerable.\n\nDan Leger is a freelance journalist in Halifax.", "article_metadata": {"category": "opinion", "dcterms.description": "So it turns out the pollsters were wrong, the Republican leadership was wrong, the experts were wrong, the media was wrong.
