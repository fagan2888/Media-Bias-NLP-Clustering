He also insisted that the Senate was not in play in 2014, a conviction that his fellow panelists did not share.\n\n\n\nDiscussing the proposal by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), who has backed a plan that would allow those who are losing their health care plans to keep them through next year, Tour\u00e9 said that this was a reflex by Democrats who believe they may be vulnerable.\n\n\u201cDemocrats remain extremely supportive of the ACA,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cWe see red state Democrats who are dealing with the challenge of living and governing in a gerrymandered world, where sometimes they have to deal with what the folks on the right \u2013 very low support on the Republican side of this \u2013 but the folks on the right want.\u201d\n\nRELATED: NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd: Democratic \u2018Wave\u2019 in 2014 \u2018More Possible Than Some People\u2019 Think\n\nTour\u00e9 added that Landrieu is an \u201coutlier\u201d who often \u201cbucks her party.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying Democrats aren\u2019t at all concerned about Obamacare controlling the narrative for the coming election?\u201d Abby Huntsman asked.\n\nTour\u00e9 said that he was not seeing blue state Democrats supporting Landrieu\u2019s proposal, indicating that they are not concerned about the ACA.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re the only ones who have a tough election,\u201d Krystal Ball said of the jumpy red state Democrats. She added that Democrats are not well served unless they can vote on a proposal to fix the ACA. Having to campaign on the message of \u201cyou\u2019ve got to trust the president\u201d is problematic for vulnerable Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe president may care about certain individuals,\u201d Tour\u00e9 said. \u201cBut he understands, in the meta narrative, the House is not in play. The Senate is not in play.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the Senate is in play,\u201d Ball protested.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Tour\u00e9 insisted. \u201cIt will continue to be blue. There\u2019s no chance. Post-shutdown?\u201d\n\nThe panel exploded after Tour\u00e9 suggested this, with virtually every panel guest insisting he is incorrect.\n\nWatch the clip below via MSNBC:\n\n[Photo via screen grab ]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "MSNBC host Tour\u00e9 dismissed the concerns of his fellow hosts of The Cycle on Thursday when he insisted that the red state Democrats supporting proposals to scale", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The-Cycle.jpg", "title": "The Cycle Explodes When Tour\u00e9 Insists Obama Knows the Senate Is Not in Play in 2014"}, "twitter": {"description": "MSNBC host Tour\u00e9 dismissed the concerns of his fellow hosts of The Cycle on Thursday when he insisted that the red state Democrats supporting proposals to scale back the Affordable Care Act represent a broader shift in the party away from supporting the ACA.
