But they have proved to be unpopular with investors and highlighted Nigeria's dependence on crude oil exports, which account for more than half of state revenues.\n\nThe IMF head, who said she was not in Nigeria to negotiate a loan, backed what she called Buhari's \"very important\" fight against corruption and said the president's reform push could have a positive impact across West Africa.\n\n\"His determination to bring about transparency and accountability at all levels of the economy were very important agenda items,\" Lagarde told reporters at the presidential villa in the capital Abuja.\n\nBuhari was elected in March after campaigning on a promise to clamp down on the endemic corruption that has left many in Africa's biggest economy mired in poverty despite its enormous energy wealth.\n\nIn December he announced a record budget for 2016, forecasting a doubling of the deficit to 2.2 trillion naira ($11 billion) and a tripling of capital expenditure intended to help the country adjust to the downturn in oil, which has lost around two-thirds of its value since mid-2014.\n\nFALLING OIL PRICE\n\nLagarde, who said a team of IMF economists would visit Nigeria next week to assess whether its borrowing costs were sustainable, told reporters she and Buhari discussed the challenges posed by the falling oil price and the need for fiscal discipline.\n\n\"The short-term fiscal situation ... requires that revenue sources be identified in order to compensate the shortfall resulting from the oil price decline,\" the IMF head added.\n\nBuhari's spokesman, Femi Adesina, later said the president's administration would \"enforce regulations to stop financial leakages\" and \"adopt global best practices in generating more revenue\" to mitigate the effects of dwindling oil prices.\n\n\"President Buhari said the federal government will welcome the technical support and expertise of the IMF for its plans to diversify the Nigerian economy and further unleash its growth potentials,\" said Adesina.\n\nLagarde also urged more flexibility in monetary policy to allow the country to use its foreign reserves to support the population as the oil price sags.\n\n\"Clearly the authorities should not deplete the reserves of the country simply because of rules that would be exceedingly rigid,\" she said.\n\nThe central bank spent billions of dollars last year defending the naira, failing to halt its slide against the dollar as plunging oil prices weighed on the currency and the broader economy.\n\nRazia Khan, head of Africa research for Standard Chartered bank, said Lagarde's comments on the naira regime echoed remarks by Buhari last month, and market players were now anticipating a change, potentially at the bank's next monetary policy committee meeting.\n\nA research note from brokerage Exotix predicted a devaluation of the naira by around 25 percent was imminent.\n\n(Additional reporting by Felix Onuah; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram and James Macharia; Editing by Richard Balmforth)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ABUJA (Reuters) - The head of the International Monetary Fund endorsed Nigeria's effor", "title": "IMF chief welcomes Nigeria anti-corruption drive, urges flexible naira", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/05/IMF-chief-welcomes-Nigeria-anti-corruption-drive-urges-flexible-naira", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nigeria-imf_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/05/IMF-chief-welcomes-Nigeria-anti-corruption-drive-urges-flexible-naira", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nigeria-imf_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ABUJA (Reuters) - The head of the International Monetary Fund endorsed Nigeria's effor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"The short-term fiscal situation ... requires that revenue sources be identified in order to compensate the shortfall resulting from the oil price decline,\" the IMF head added.\nAfter meeting President Muhammadu Buhari, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde also called for greater flexibility in Nigeria's exchange rate regime, fuelling speculation that a devaluation of the naira may be imminent.\nThe IMF head, who said she was not in Nigeria to negotiate a loan, backed what she called Buhari's \"very important\" fight against corruption and said the president's reform push could have a positive impact across West Africa.\nLagarde also urged more flexibility in monetary policy to allow the country to use its foreign reserves to support the population as the oil price sags.\nA research note from brokerage Exotix predicted a devaluation of the naira by around 25 percent was imminent."}
