Lest there be any doubt about Harris-Perry\u2019s mindset on race, Nolte noted last month that during a racial rant, she asserted that \u201cwealthy white men\u201d created the term \u201cObamacare,\u201d which she regards as a racist act.\n\nThis mindset, shared by all too many liberals, is that Republicans and conservatives, solely by virtue of their party identification and ideological leanings, are racists. Black Republicans are even worse in their eyes. They are traitors to their race and, as such, are fairly subject to condemnation and ridicule from white liberals and black liberals alike. Thus, it is fair play for white liberals to mock and belittle black conservatives, just as they did to Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas and others, long before Kieran Romney.\n\nFor all the talk about diversity from the left, there is no such thing. Diversity of ideas and thoughts is absolutely forbidden. March in lock step with leftist thinking, or else. It wouldn\u2019t matter if we had a black Republican president and most of his Cabinet and other appointees were black or if we also had a majority of black Republicans in Congress. As long as they remained Republican, they wouldn\u2019t be regarded by the left as authentic blacks, and the GOP\u2019s presumed racism wouldn\u2019t be slightly mitigated.\n\nFor racially exploitive leftists, politics trumps everything, and thus they exempt themselves from the rules of common civility that normally inhibit decent people from doing such reprehensible things as using an innocent young black child as fodder for a cheap laugh \u2014 and as a means for a television personality to further ingratiate herself to the self-congratulatory left. After receiving blowback, Harris-Perry tweeted an apology to the Romney family, but the assumptions and presumptions leading to the incident in the first place doubtlessly remain in this type of leftist mindset, as the next news item illustrates.\n\nOn the same network a day or two later, a panel of MSNBC regulars, on a special edition of \u201cPoliticsNation,\u201d selected awards for 2013. Network contributor Joy Reid said that the \u201cknockout game\u201d was the \u201cmost overrated story of the year,\u201d claiming that conservatives \u201cwent absolutely ballistic\u201d because they wanted \u201cto stoke issues of race.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cknockout game,\u201d according to Wikipedia, is an assault in which one or more assailants attempt to knock out an unsuspecting victim, often with a single sucker punch, for the amusement of the attackers and their accomplices. The participants often record their assaults, and these videos have gone viral on the Internet. In the great majority of cases, the assailants appear to be teenage blacks and the victims defenseless whites.\n\nReid apparently concludes that conservatives have singled out these stories not because they are newsworthy, as reprehensible acts of abject evil that have been underreported in the mainstream media, but because they have largely been committed by blacks. It is much ado about nothing. There is nothing to see here. Move on. The only noteworthy thing about it, according to Reid, is the alleged racism of those focusing on it.\n\nNext, The Daily Caller reports on an essay by a liberal professor of constitutional law at the City University of New York\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, in which the professor blames \u201csouthern White radicals\u201d for the disastrous rollout of Obamacare aka the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d as if either the negative reports about the rollout were overblown or the problems were caused by bigots, as opposed to the incompetent statist bureaucrats actually responsible.\n\nIn her essay, \u201c2013: A Year of Racial Challenges,\u201d Gloria J. Browne-Marshall alleges that \u201csouthern White radicals vowed to stop implementation of the Obama-care law leading one to wonder if Tea Party members would oppose affordable healthcare if it came from a nonBlack President.\u201d\n\nAre these leftists really so blinded by their own ideology or so cloistered among people with their own narrow-minded liberal ideas that they believe we conservatives oppose Obama\u2019s policies, including Obamacare, because of his race? Why, then, did we just as adamantly oppose Hillary Clinton\u2019s scheme for socialized medicine? Why do we always oppose liberal ideas, the overwhelming majority of which have been advanced by white liberals?\n\nIn an ideal world, I wouldn\u2019t dignify with a response these false charges of racism, but if we conservatives have learned any lesson in the past few decades, it is that unanswered allegations in the spirit of respect and civility just egg shameless liberals on \u2014 and all too often, those allegations stick. Like it or not, we have to fight them back at every turn, and that is what I intend to do.\n\nDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author and attorney.
