Two of the three Republicans who want to represent the Republican Party in the race for governor met in a debate tonight in Rugby.

Dr. Rick Becker and Doug Burgum squared off - with Wayne Stenehjem represented by a campaign sign atop an empty chair on the stage.

The two men agreed on many points in much of the first hour of the debate - concurring that the state government has become too big and needs to have budgets cut, and the need to get the state out from under heavy-handed rules imposed by the federal government.

The pair took the occasion to attack Stenehjem, who has a lead in polls conducted in recent weeks, for his actions regarding a legal challenge to Obamacare.

(Dr. Rick Becker, (R) Candidate for Governor) "Mr. Stenehjem also filed an amicus brief with 23 other Democrat attorneys general in King v. Burwell, which was identified as the last hope to overturn Obamacare."

(Doug Burgum, (R) Candidate for Governor) "I find that shocking that our attorney general would be the only Republican on that list along with Democratic attorney generals California, New York, Massachusetts and other places and that's, again, disappointing."

Burgum and Becker disagreed on the role of public-private partnerships with Becker saying the government should not be subsidizing private business in that way and Burgum saying if there's a way they partnerships can reduce government costs in needed projects, they should be considered.

Burgum, Becker, and Stenehjem are hoping to become the Republican candidate for governor.

So far, North Dakota Democrats do not have any announced candidates for governor.

Party conventions are coming up within the next month.
