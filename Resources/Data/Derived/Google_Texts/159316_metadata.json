Not this time.\n\nThe 50 stocks in the S&P 500 with the highest short interest are up an average of 1% since the stock market scraped an intraday low on Aug 24, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That\u2019s well below the average gain of the remaining 450 stocks, which stands at 8%.\n\nBespoke said that bucks the trend that usually plays out when markets rise\u2013and it\u2019s not the only way the recent run-up has been unusual.\n\nBespoke noted that in rallies like the current one, investors usually see smaller stocks outperform larger stocks, growth names outpace value stocks and beaten-up shares bounce the most. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening this time, though.\n\nThe smallest stocks in the S&P 500 aren\u2019t up nearly as much as their large-cap peers, continuing a trend that\u2019s been playing out for much of the year. Bespoke\u2019s data show that the 50 biggest stocks in the S&P are up an average of 11% since Aug. 24, versus an average increase of 3.9% for the 50 smallest stocks.\n\nBespoke Investment Group\n\nAdditionally, stocks with the highest and lowest price-to-earnings multiples are both leading since Aug. 24. Bespoke said it\u2019s usually the case that highly-valued names outperform low-valued firms during rallies like these.\n\nBespoke Investment Group\n\nWhile beaten-down shares usually bounce the most coming out of a correction, that too hasn\u2019t been the case over the last three months. Bespoke data show that the worst performers leading into the market selloff remain the laggards as the market recovers.\n\nBespoke Investment Group\n\nThe S&P 500 is off fractionally the past two sessions. But it\u2019s still up 12% from its Aug. 24 intraday low.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Heavily-shorted stocks usually pop when the broader market rises.
