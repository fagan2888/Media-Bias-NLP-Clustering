Rather, it reflects recognition of the economic benefits expected to result from accepting billions of federal dollars: it\u2019s expected to save Ohio $404 million over two years. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce supported Kasich\u2019s move, as did hospitals and clinics throughout the state.\n\nKasich\u2019s decision may encourage other conservative governors to expand their Medicaid programs eventually, particularly if Kasich survives his re-election campaign next year. But a more likely trend has been set by Arkansas, which put forward an alternative model for low-income, uninsured adults through which federal money would subsidize the purchase of private plans on the state\u2019s new insurance exchange, rather than go directly to the Medicaid program. Iowa is waiting for approval of a similar model, and Maine\u2019s governor, who vetoed state legislators\u2019 approval of the expansion, indicated that he will consider an alternative approach.\n\nCertain measures in the Arkansas and Iowa plans could help reduce healthcare costs\u2014for example, by encouraging preventive care and penalizing unnecessary visits to emergency rooms. But it costs the government more to subsidize beneficiaries on the exchange than to pay their bills through Medicaid, and it isn\u2019t clear who would pick up the extra expense. And while Medicaid strictly limits deductibles and co-pays, many private plans offered through the insurance exchanges are expected to require significant cost-sharing.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republican Governor Tom Corbett has proposed a complete overhaul of the state\u2019s Medicaid program in exchange for accepting federal funds to subsidize the purchase of private insurance for low-income residents. An analysis by the state\u2019s Independent Fiscal Office concluded that these expansion funds would add a net $255 million a year to Pennsylvania\u2019s budget, while a Rand Corporation study said expansion would add more than $3 billion to the state\u2019s economy each year, along with 35,000 jobs. At the same time, Corbett wants to raise Medicaid recipients\u2019 monthly co-pay, reduce the services covered by the program, and institute a work requirement.\n\nClearly these alternative plans aren\u2019t perfect, but little about healthcare reform is. What\u2019s significant is the slow-growing recognition in some red states that refusing to extend insurance coverage to poor Americans out of ideological spite simply doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nIn contrast to the clear fiscal and ethical reasons for expansion, the arguments against it are seriously flawed. Citing data indicating that Medicare patients tend to be sicker than the uninsured, opponents claim that no health insurance at all is better than enrolling in the program. That\u2019s an unsubstantiated conclusion, as Paul Krugman explains: \u201cSick people are likely to have low incomes; more generally, low-income Americans who qualify for Medicaid just tend in general to have poor health.\u201d Many of those who forego insurance are young, therefore more likely to be healthy.\n\nA functioning Healthcare.gov is critical to the healthcare law\u2019s success, but the Medicaid expansion is its heart: about half of those gaining insurance through Obamacare were expected to be new Medicaid recipients, many of whom live below the poverty line but above the eligibility threshold set by their home state. Unlike the federal exchange, the Medicaid website is working, and enrollment is strong. That makes an interesting case for a simpler system for everyone else. Single-payer, anyone?\n\nKansas slashed its mental health services, and now its suicide rate is on the rise.
