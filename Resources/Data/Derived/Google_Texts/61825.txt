Sioux Falls, SD

It might be your New Year's resolution to hit the slopes more often in 2015 and soon you can do so for a good cause at Great Bear.

"It's been good, it's been a great experience," Roxie Johnson said.

The KELO-TV Ski and Snowboard Races at Great Bear are just around the corner. This year the event is a fundraiser for Roxie Johnson's group called Angels With A Dream. The charity got started three years ago after Johnson lost her husband to cancer.

"Bill just passed away about five years ago from cancer. He saw how the kids struggled with their treatments and stuff. It's a wish of his to make dreams come true for the kids," Johnson said.

Johnson, the kitchen manager at the ski valley, initially hoped to raise just $500 for Make-A-Wish of South Dakota but has since helped bring in more than $29,000.

Angels With A Dream has already granted wishes for three families and they've just received some good news. They'll be able to grant a wish for a fourth.

"Very emotional. It's really nice to meet these families to see what these people go through. The kids are amazing. They struggle really hard but they keep really good spirits," Johnson said.

Money raised has sent kids to Hawaii and Disney World. Angels With A Dream also helped build a sun porch for another family.

"It's a great opportunity to help some kids out and these kids would really appreciate it," Johnson said.

The race is scheduled for January 11 at Great Bear. Registration costs $10 with the proceeds going to Make-A-Wish.
