There are so many different options, it\u2019s sometimes hard to choose the right one. Maybe you prefer the simple \u201chaha.\u201d Perhaps you like to go with \u201cLOL\u201d to show you\u2019re hip. You might even try to throw a \u201ctee hee\u201d or a \u201cheh\u201d in there to mix it up a little. Do you know what kind of Internet laugher you are? Well, Facebook did some research, and it turns out you probably fall into the \u201chaha\u201d category.\n\nFacebook is a place that sees a lot of written laughter. From status posts to comments, and everything in between, people express their laughter on Facebook all day, every day. In a recent study that the social media giant conducted on its own users, it looked at the kind of \u201ce-laughs\u201d people were writing and how often they wrote them. It found that over the course of one week, 15 percent of users who posted or commented used at least one e-laugh, written as \u201cLOL,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d and the like.\n\nBreaking that down, the company found that 46 percent of people posted just a single laugh during the week, while 85 percent posted fewer than five laughs a week. It also broke laughs down by total and unique laughs \u2014 unique being two different types of laugh. Fifty-two percent of people used a single laugh, like LOL, while 20 percent of people mixed it up and used two different unique laughs, such as LOL and haha.\n\nSeeing as most people used a single type of laugh, Facebook split them up into four groups: people who used \u201chaha,\u201d people who used LOL, people who used \u201chehe,\u201d and people who used an emoji to express their laughter. The people who used \u201chaha\u201d made up 51.4 percent of the group, while emoji users came in second with 33.7 percent, and \u201chehe\u201d users in third with 13.1 percent. Only 1.9 percent of people used LOL.\n\nWhen it comes to the ages of these people, those who write\u201chaha\u201d and its variations were typically between 13 and 70 years old, which explains why it\u2019s the most popular way to express laughter. Meanwhile, younger Facebook posters were most likely to use emojis, while LOLs were written most by older generations. With regard to gender, men used \u201chaha\u201d more than women, but women were more apt to use an emoji than men were.\n\nCurious about where in the country these laughers are? The study found that the highest percentage of \u201chaha\u201d users were in Seattle, while Chicagoans used emojis more than any other big city. \u201cHaha\u201d and \u201chehe\u201d are used more often on the West Coast, while Midwestern and Southern states are most fond of LOL. Emojis are rarely used on the West Coast, but have high appearance rates on the Facebook pages of Floridians.\n\nAlthough Facebook\u2019s study isn\u2019t a definitive look at how laughter is expressed on the Internet, it offers a glimpse into just how far expressing it has come since the inception of Internet communication.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facebook emoji lol haha laugh laughter", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Facebook recently conducted a study on just how users express laughter on the social media website.", "title": "What The Way You Laugh On Facebook Says About You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-study-laughter-shows-who-uses-haha-lol-most-and-where-theyre-347074", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/10/facebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook recently conducted a study on just how users express laughter on the social media website.", "title": "What The Way You Laugh On Facebook Says About You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-study-laughter-shows-who-uses-haha-lol-most-and-where-theyre-347074", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/10/facebook.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/10/facebook.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-10T16:56:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T16:56:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Facebook recently conducted a study on just how users express laughter on the social media website."}, "article_summary": "With regard to gender, men used \u201chaha\u201d more than women, but women were more apt to use an emoji than men were.\nThe study found that the highest percentage of \u201chaha\u201d users were in Seattle, while Chicagoans used emojis more than any other big city.\nFacebook is a place that sees a lot of written laughter.\nOnly 1.9 percent of people used LOL.\nSeeing as most people used a single type of laugh, Facebook split them up into four groups: people who used \u201chaha,\u201d people who used LOL, people who used \u201chehe,\u201d and people who used an emoji to express their laughter."}
