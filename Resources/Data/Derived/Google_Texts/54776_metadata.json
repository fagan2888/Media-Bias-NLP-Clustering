Writing a book that fits in this category is actually quite easy. First, label yourself a reformist. Never mind the congratulatory self-coronation the tag implies; it is necessary to segregate oneself from all the non-reformists out there. Second, make your agenda clear at the outset by criticizing what is ailing Islam and Muslims. The Qur\u2019an is a good place to start because Muslims, especially in the Middle East, surely treat their holy book more like a military instruction manual than anything else. Third, propose a few solutions. Lest you be accused of nuance, the more vague and generic these are, the better. Fourth, soak up the inevitable publicity that awaits, and with it, your hard-earned cash. Voil\u00e0!\n\nThe books that make up Project Islamic Reformation are not works of scholarship or even well-crafted popular texts. They are almost exclusively political pamphlets of a very personal nature that often begin as biography and end as self-help, except the \u201cself\u201d in this case includes a quarter of the world\u2019s people, and the \u201chelp\u201d may or may not come at the end of a missile. Ayaan Hirsi Ali\u2014who deserves empathy for her personal ordeals but not her conclusions\u2014released such a book earlier this year with neat, Manichean categories delineating good and bad Muslims, as well as the expected checklist of proposed reforms. More tracts will certainly follow because publishers love a good Reformist, and the affluent Western audience that consumes these books loves having most of their pre-existing beliefs confirmed rather than challenged.\n\nIt is in the context of Project Islamic Reformation that the atheist neuroscientist Sam Harris and the redeemed radical Maajid Nawaz have published their latest book, \u201cIslam and the Future of Tolerance,\u201d put out by no less a publishing house than Harvard University Press. The book is structured as a conversation between Harris and Nawaz, who go back and forth over issues ranging from polling data suggesting Muslims support corporal punishment to the Islamic justifications for jihad. Compressed into its 128 pages is the entire Reformation Project, except that the book\u2019s contents are as thin as its subject is grand. For a work whose title includes the words \u201cIslam\u201d and \u201cfuture of tolerance,\u201d the Harris-Nawaz pamphlet consistently veers from the ahistorical into the nonsensical and back again, almost always at Harris\u2019s urging.\n\nWhat is right in the book can be attributed solely to Maajid Nawaz. In fact, one can skip over everything Sam Harris says because he is merely repackaging ideas he has articulated many times before. Among the elementary truisms Nawaz points to: addressing the grievances many young Muslims feel, changing the narrative the Islamist demagogues have mastered, injecting a dose of cultural liberalism into conservative societies to induce progress on women\u2019s rights and free speech, raising the low expectations held by too many Americans about supposedly thin-skinned Muslims who cannot take a joke and must be coddled. Well and good, and self-evident enough, except to the most benighted idealogues.\n\nNawaz knows his history, and crucially, his Islamic history. He cites the Mut\u2019azila (a rationalist theology that flourished between the 8th and 10th centuries in Iraq), Imam al-Shatibi (a 14th-century legal scholar from Spain) and Ibn Taymiyyah (a 13th-century theologian routinely mentioned by jihadists). He could have gone even further, noting that the House of Wisdom in Baghdad was a repository for learning where the works of Aristotle were preserved and translated. He also could have noted the many contributions made to medicine, optics, philosophy, political economy \u2014 indeed, the scientific method itself \u2014 by Muslim polymaths, or the feasts of reason and discourse that flourished in the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Long before atheism went vogue in the West, the 9th-century atheist al-Ma\u2019ari was irking the ruling classes in Syria with his vitriolic, anti-theist poems. (When al Qaeda swept through northern Syria in 2012, they beheaded statues of al-Ma\u2019aari).\n\nThe Sufi tradition barely gets a nod, perhaps because its emphasis on music and mysticism contravene the narrow lane this book travels. \u201cI am free, my mind is free,\u201d wrote the 18th-century Sufi philosopher Bulleh Shah. Enlightenment is an Islamic tradition as well, though one would not learn that from this tract.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear, however, that Sam Harris is illiterate when it comes to history. He has a tendency, both in his online writings and in this book, to reduce all 1,400 years of the Islamic past to jihad. The world, he says, witnessed \u201ca thousand years of jihadism\u201d before Bin Laden sent airliners to mutilate the New York City skyline, and Islam spread \u201cprimarily by conquest, not conversation.\u201d The historian Zachary Karabell wrote an entire book refuting this simplistic repackaging of history. Actually, Muslims, Christians, Jews and other minorities lived together in Muslim-governed territories for long stretches of time. Relations between these communities were not always harmonious \u2014 this is the past we are talking about \u2014 but co-existence was woven into the fabric of Muslim society and polity. As the historian Jason Goodwin writes,\n\nIslam was generally not spread by the sword\u2026In both North Africa and Spain, ordinary people sometimes converted, hoping for access to wealth and status. Often the conversions were sincere. They were welcomed within limits, but they were very rarely forced.\n\nTrue, apostasy was still a crime, though let\u2019s remember that translating the Bible into the local language got one burned at the stake during the contemporary period in Christendom. Even in Britain, Oxford and Cambridge did not begin admitting non-Anglicans until the late 19th century. There was certainly conquest in the lands of Islam, as there was conversation, but more than anything, there was commerce. Merchants who wanted to get rich in Muslim lands converted and engaged in the proto-free market that was already beginning to appear in the Middle East and North Africa. Capitalism tended to do wonders for the social unity of medieval Islamic societies, before the term \u201ccapitalism\u201d even existed. (The Jewish Marxist historian Maxime Rodinson, in his book \u201cIslam and Capitalism,\u201d documented how merchants circumvented the no-usury rule by concocting elaborate financial schemes, not unlike the workarounds today\u2019s interest-free Islamic bankers use.)\n\nThis is not apologia: Muslim empires were bloody, seduced by power and expansion, and their caliphs and sultans, like all imperialists from time immemorial, wanted ever more control. But Harris is no multitasker; holding a complicated picture and talking at the same time seems impossible to him, so he reduces history to mottos and engages in sloganeering to mask his ignorance.\n\nAt one point, Harris even bizarrely rationalizes the Crusades. Remember, he tells readers, the Crusades \u201cwere primarily a response to 300 years of jihad\u201d \u2014 the emphasis here is his. The Crusades were a \u201creaction,\u201d he laments, and in any event, holy war was a \u201clate, peripheral\u201d development within Christianity. This ought to be news to the flayed bodies and burned heretics and massacred dissidents put to death by Christianity\u2019s sword. Muslim empires were authoritarian, as were Christian empires. Muslim clerics gave fatwas declaring jihad, and Pope Urban II gave his own decree explicitly calling on Christian subjects to take up arms and reclaim the Holy Land from the Mohemmadans. Why Sam Harris feels the need to take sides in the fanatical squabbles of our barbaric ancestors eludes me.\n\nAll of this can be excused, but only up to a point. What is inexcusable, and what should preclude Sam Harris from participating in any more projects on Islamic Reformation, is his complete lack of awareness about Muslims as they actually live today. He censures American Muslims for paying more attention to the coldblooded massacre of three American Muslims at the University of North Carolina than to the crimes of ISIS \u2014 proximity to Raleigh over Raqqa may explain why \u2014 before going on to say that hate crimes against American Muslims are \u201ctiny in number, often property-related, and still dwarfed five-fold by similar offenses against Jews.\u201d Reread that sentence and take in the moral callousness of this thinker.\n\nThe FBI says there are now 100 to 150 anti-Muslim hate crimes committed in the United States every year, a five-fold increase from pre-9/11 levels, and that\u2019s before the San Bernardino attacks and Donald Trump\u2019s fascistic fear-mongering. Furthermore, the vandalism and destruction of property is not something that should be taken lightly. Throughout American history, racially and religiously motivated violence desecrated the physical spaces minorities inhabited, threatening them everywhere, at all times, even in their places of worship. Anti-Semitism is a vile and contemptible form of group-hatred, but violence done against one minority should never be downplayed because there is greater violence against another minority. Harris has the supreme privilege \u2014 a rich, white man\u2019s privilege, I should add \u2014 of remaining aloof and ignorant about these crimes, and it makes one wonder if he knows any Muslims beyond Maajid Nawaz and the two others he always cites, or if he has ever set foot in a Muslim-majority country and talked to more than a handful of Muslims.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harris' haughty ignorance & chauvinism are on full display in his new book, a \"dialogue\" with a former radical", "title": "Sam Harris\u2019 detestable crusade: How his latest anti-Islam tract reveals the bankruptcy of his ideas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Harris' haughty ignorance & chauvinism are on full display in his new book, a \"dialogue\" with a former radical", "title": "Sam Harris\u2019 detestable crusade: How his latest anti-Islam tract reveals the bankruptcy of his ideas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/28/sam_harriss_detestable_crusade_how_his_latest_anti_islam_tract_reveals_the_bankruptcy_of_his_ideas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/sam_harris2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harris' haughty ignorance & chauvinism are on full display in his new book, a \"dialogue\" with a former radical", "title": "Sam Harris\u2019 detestable crusade: How his latest anti-Islam tract reveals the bankruptcy of his ideas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/sam_harris2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Omer Aziz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Extremism, Islam, New Atheism, Religion, Sam Harris", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In fact, one can skip over everything Sam Harris says because he is merely repackaging ideas he has articulated many times before.\nWhy Sam Harris feels the need to take sides in the fanatical squabbles of our barbaric ancestors eludes me.\nThe books that make up Project Islamic Reformation are not works of scholarship or even well-crafted popular texts.\nIt quickly becomes clear, however, that Sam Harris is illiterate when it comes to history.\nNawaz knows his history, and crucially, his Islamic history."}
