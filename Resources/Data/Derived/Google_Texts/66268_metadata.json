The idea originally involved reducing the portion of financial aid award letters slated for covering the cost of health insurance to students who waive GHI. Discussions between the financial aid office and A.S. yielded no change in the status quo.\n\nDirector of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Mike Miller said in an email to A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau that the idea was to allocate funds more efficiently from students who are not using the fully designated amount for health insurance and redistributing that amount for other purposes.\n\n\u201cThe issue at hand is that approximately 50% of undergraduate students waive out of GHI and their financial aid awards are not adjusted even though the students are not incurring the GHI expense,\u201d Miller said in an email. \u201cCurrently, financial aid recipients are able to use those funds to address other expenses. Given the rapid increase in GHI costs over the last few years, this has evolved into a significant issue. Based on our projections of past student history, we estimate a savings of about $6M in UCSB Grant if we make the revisions for GHI waivers.\u201d\n\nFourth-year psychology major and GHI advisory committee member Alex Hill said while he understood the financial aid office\u2019s position, he believes the idea was unpopular and stood to affect a large number of students.\n\n\u201cI understand the business perspective of the financial office and it is necessary to be prudent with any budget to make sure that they aren\u2019t bleeding money. From their perspective, if you\u2019re looking at their budget, they were more or less spending their budget inefficiently and they were trying to be more efficient,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHowever, their decisions do affect students directly in a way that was grossly unpopular with the student body.\u201d\n\nA.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy said the financial aid office required additional concrete evidence before moving forward with a formal plan on the idea.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, they lacked specific data about what are student health insurance plans and needs at the time,\u201d Guthy said. \u201cThey were making the decision, from my perspective, on a series of interactions with students coming into the financial office, which is good, firsthand experience is really great. But based off of that they needed to conduct a formal survey and focus groups and studies with students.\u201d\n\nMiller said in a statement that nothing would change regarding financial aid award allocations for health insurance and that the decision was reached after investigation into the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAfter spending time researching the issue and looking into the ever evolving Affordable Care Act and other health insurance options UCSB students have, I determined more time was needed before we could formulate a plan that I felt comfortable with,\u201d Miller said. \u201cMoving forward, there will be many more conversations at the system-wide and campus levels about this issue, but for 2015-16, I have made the decision to continue our current practices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Miller, a concrete plan to implement reduced award letters for students who waived GHI never existed, and Miller said it was only ever an idea.\n\n\u201cThere was never an agreement to move forward with a plan to adjust financial aid awards for GHI waivers. There were simply conversations with a couple of key departments and AS members,\u201d Miller said in an email. \u201cFrom day one, we all said we wanted to be thoughtful about the issue before moving forward with a plan.\u201d\n\nGuthy also said she was pleased to hear the financial aid office would no longer consider any plans to reduce award letters and that her office would continue to discuss the financial aid situation with Miller\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe have to acknowledge they\u2019re coming from a good place. They really listen to students on this issue and I personally could not be more happy with the outcome,\u201d Guthy said. \u201cStudents just need to be aware that this conversation is happening. This conversation will continue to happen in the next couple months.\u201d\n\nInternal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she believes student opposition to the idea contributed to the financial aid office\u2019s decision to discontinue consideration on the proposed possible plan.\n\n\u201cWith more talk about it amongst the student population it became very present or obvious that students were not ready nor were they gung-ho about this whole thing,\u201d Lau said, \u201cand that\u2019s why they\u2019re slowing down the process now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jodie Nakajima, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, despite the change of direction taken by the financial aid office, she will still be waiving GHI.\n\n\u201cI think it depends on how much they would reduce it by, but insurance is pretty expensive anyways \u2026 so I probably would still waive it regardless,\u201d Nakajima said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Nexus", "description": "The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).", "title": "Financial Aid Office Backs Off of Controversial Plan", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/", "image": "http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).", "title": "Financial Aid Office Backs Off of Controversial Plan", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?fit=201%2C303", "site": "@dailynexus", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacde\"", "article_summary": "The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).\nDiscussions between the financial aid office and A.S. yielded no change in the status quo.\n\u201cThere was never an agreement to move forward with a plan to adjust financial aid awards for GHI waivers.\nAn announcement reflecting the change of course to pursue a plan came Wednesday night from On-Campus senator Matthew Santos, stated after weeks of negotiations between Associated Students and the financial aid office.\n\u201cCurrently, financial aid recipients are able to use those funds to address other expenses."}
