UnitedHealth Group Inc. has threatened to pull back from the marketplaces in 2017, although other major national insurers have indicated they believe the marketplaces are viable.\n\nOther top issues include pharmaceutical prices (especially specialty drugs); whether the government will allow four of the top five national insurers to consolidate into two plans; what changes may be made to the ACA's premium stabilization programs; and whether government-funded CO-OPs set up under the ACA will continue.\n\nThe third open enrollment period began Nov. 1, 2015, and continues through Jan. 31.\n\nUncertainty About Marketplaces\n\nIn the third year of the ACA health insurance marketplaces, uncertainty will continue to \u201cplague\u201d health insurers as enrollees drop in and out of coverage and premium requests will be \u201call over the place,\u201d Paul Keckley, a managing director of Navigant Consulting Inc.'s health-care practice, told Bloomberg BNA. Keckley is based in Navigant's Chicago office.\n\n\u201cRelated to that will be the stability of the individual market at the state level,\u201d Keckley said. \u201cIt's the riskiest market for insurers, and the law made it riskier.\u201d\n\nIllustrating his contention, Keckley pointed to attempts by about a dozen states to lower the threshold for the ACA's medical loss ratio when the provision was first implemented in 2011.\n\nUnder the medical loss ratio requirement insurers must spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical claims or quality improvements or refund the difference to consumers annually.\n\nThe states asking for relief feared the threshold was so high many of the individual plans would leave the risky markets, which are characterized by enrollees who aren't able to obtain insurance through employers.\n\nIndividual Market Not \u2018Attractive, Sustainable.'\n\nThe combination of the medical loss ratio as well as ACA age bands that limit the amount of additional premiums insurers can charge older, higher-cost enrollees \u201cmakes the individual market not attractive and not sustainable for the insurance industry,\u201d Keckley said.\n\nThe ACA's premium stabilization programs were intended to solve those problems, Keckley said.\n\n\u201cHad that worked as planned maybe [the individual market] would have been less volatile, but it hasn't,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has so far paid less than 13 percent of claims filed by insurers for the temporary risk corridor program for 2014, and the permanent risk adjustment program has hit hardest the nonprofit Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans (CO-OPs) set up under the ACA with government funding as well as new, small plans.\n\nThe low risk corridor payments contributed to the failure of many of the 23 CO-OPs: 12 have failed and two more have capped enrollment for 2016.\n\nWhile HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell's estimate that about 10 million people will be enrolled in ACA marketplace plans at the end of 2016 is reasonable, Keckley said, \u201cthey keep ratcheting back that number.\u201d\n\nThe HHS's estimates are well below Congressional Budget Office estimates that 21 million would be enrolled in the plans by the end of 2016.\n\n\u201cThey've discovered that not as many young invincibles are ready to jump into the insurance market,\u201d Keckley said. \u201cIt's the cost. If you're not getting a tax credit to pay 75 percent of the premium it's going to cost you a couple of hundred dollars a month at the cheapest and most of these kids think they can just take their chances.\u201d\n\nThe marketplaces have struggled to attract the broad mix of younger, healthier, low-cost enrollees that are needed to keep premiums low while covering older, higher-cost enrollees.\n\nIncreased Penalties\n\nBut Benjamin Isgur, who leads the regulatory center of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's Health Research Institute (HRI), told Bloomberg BNA that a \u201cbig driver\u201d for 2016 sign-ups in the marketplaces will be the ACA's increased penalties for not having minimum essential coverage for themselves and their dependents.\n\nFor 2016 the penalty rises to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child up to $2,085 for a family, or 2.5 percent of family income, whichever is greater.\n\n\u201cThose penalties are something that people are going to take into account much more because they have reached that point where it's a big chunk of money for many individuals and families,\u201d Isgur said.\n\nIn addition, Isgur said, \u201cproviders have become pretty sophisticated in setting people up with navigators and helping people find insurance. It's in their interest that people be signed up.\u201d\n\nThe greatest impact on enrollment will be the economy, Howard Wizig, president of technology company Vivius Holdings LLC, told Bloomberg BNA. Increased employment will result in more employer-based insurance, he said.\n\nPremiums Picking Up\n\nDeloitte Consulting LLP estimates \u201cthat we will again see some fairly significant increases\u201d in exchange premiums when insurers file rate proposals for the 2017 plan year, Gregory Scott, the U.S. health plans sector leader in the Pittsburgh office, told Bloomberg BNA. In prior years the rate proposals have been filed in the early months of the year.\n\nDeloitte's actuarial practice has conducted premium modeling.\n\n\u201cWe expect that many plans will need to get a 10 percent or greater increase in their products in the next premium rate approval cycle in order to hit their financial plans,\u201d Scott said.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of plans that dug themselves a fairly significant pricing hole,\u201d pricing their products aggressively while ending up with less-healthy enrollees, Scott said.\n\nWhile plans generally forecast losing money for up to three years when new products are launched, \u201cplans are generally experiencing more red ink than they have anticipated,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services released an article, \u201cTwo Years In, The ACA's Impact On Health Insurer Ratings Remains Limited,\u201d concluding that, \u201cwith few exceptions, ACA business has been unprofitable for health insurers.\u201d\n\nHowever, the article said, \u201cthis business is only a small part of the overall commercial health insurance market and is an even smaller part of the privately insured marketplace (which includes managed Medicare and Medicaid).\n\nAs we expected, the impact of ACA business on a given health insurer's overall operating performance has typically been tied to the proportion of ACA business in the insurer's total book. This explains the ACA's much smaller overall impact on the operating performance of large, national players (Aetna, United, Cigna, and others) than on single-region Blue plans.\u201d\n\nPremiums are driven by underlying health-care costs, known as medical cost trend. The HRI forecasts that medical cost trend for employers will grow 6.5 percent in 2016.\n\n\u201cThat number is growing because there are more insured,\u201d Isgur said. \u201cTrend is going up but not at the same rates as what we've seen in past years.\u201d\n\nThe HHS has touted the marketplaces' relatively low premiums when ACA tax credits are factored in. But for people earning more than 250 percent of the poverty level the subsidies are often not enough to make the plans affordable, and Keckley expects premiums to start rising more sharply as plans file rate proposals for 2017.\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Manatt Health Solutions recently released comprehensive data, \u201cHIX Compare 2015-2016 Datasets,\u201d that included information on all plans offered in the health insurance marketplaces in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe data showed that the average overall premiums for a silver tier plan increased 11.3 percent to $296 a month from 2015 to 2016, while premiums for the lowest-cost silver plan increased 12.4 percent to $253 a month.\n\nCost and Value\n\nIn a video posted online by health-care consulting firm Avalere Health, Caroline Pearson, senior vice president of strategy and policy, said the two overarching themes for the health-care industry in 2016 will be cost and value.\n\nPearson said three main policy themes are emerging: increased price transparency, value-based purchasing and efforts to reduce consumer out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\u201cHealth plans are facing increased regulatory pressure around both benefit design and network adequacy while at the same time consumers continue to clamor for lower premiums,\u201d Pearson said.\n\n\u201cHealth plans are responding with a variety of strategies, including business strategies around mergers and acquisitions and policy solutions for things like changing the risk adjusters,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth plans also are continuing to push providers into payment arrangements that are intended to reward value instead of volume. The CMS has set a goal of making 30 percent of Medicare payments through alternative payment models by 2016, which health insurers have called for.\n\n\u201cThe question that remains is how those reimbursements will be structured and how we'll measure clinical quality,\u201d Pearson said.\n\nHealth plans, Pearson said, \u201cneed to understand the underlying risk of their enrollees in order to manage financial performance.\u201d\n\nEffect of Drug Costs\n\n\u201cInsurance folks are really watching specialty drug costs,\u201d Keckley said. \u201cThat's the biggest single line-item increase,\u201d accounting for an approximately 12 percent increase in 2015, he said.\n\nEdith Rosato, chief executive officer of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP), told Bloomberg BNA, \u201cIncreases in drug prices and utilization\u2014especially for new specialty pharmaceuticals\u2014will continue to put upward pressure on health insurance plans in 2016.\u201d\n\nHealth plans working with managed care pharmacists \u201cmust examine the implications of use of these medications in individuals by examining clinical trials and evidence,\u201d she said.\n\nThe AMCP represents pharmacists and others who work in managed care settings, including health plans, pharmacy benefit management companies, consultants, union health plans and large employers.\n\nWizig said it's \u201cpossible that pharmaceutical manufacturers may pause their price increases in order to avoid more negative publicity between now and the 2016 elections, but eventually they will resume their practice of increasing price.\u201d\n\nPrice increases \u201chave very little impact on demand since drug copayment and coinsurance out of pocket maximums make the patient insensitive to the cost of the drug,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the most effective tools insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have to reduce prescription drug costs is to restrict drugs they cover on their formularies, Wizig said.\n\nHowever, \u201cthe use of restrictive networks is a target that politicians use to vilify insurers,\u201d which limits the ability of insurers to use the tool.\n\nAnd, while Republican presidential candidates have continued to focus on efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, Democratic candidates, notably Hillary Rodham Clinton, have focused on controlling drug prices.\n\nPremium Stabilization Programs\n\nMany insurers will be pushing the HHS to make changes in the ACA's premium stabilization programs in 2016.\n\nThe so-called premium stabilization programs, two temporary programs and one permanent program that intended to protect insurers who cover sicker-than-average enrollees under the law's guaranteed issue requirements, are \u201ca source of great contempt for the insurance folks,\u201d and are contributing to pressure to raise premiums more in 2017, Keckley said.\n\nRate proposals had already been filed when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued its report in June 2015 announcing low risk corridor payments.\n\nThe premium stabilization programs have \u201cnot worked out as imagined; nor have the policymakers and the regulators been willing to make some concessions,\u201d Keckley said.\n\nIndeed, appropriations legislation for 2016 continues a 2015 provision blocking the HHS from using money from sources outside the risk corridor program to finance it. The risk corridor program ends at the end of 2016, while the risk adjustment program is permanent.\n\nInsurers now feel, \u201cIf that's the way it is, jack my premiums up or just suspend plans altogether,\u201d Keckley said.\n\nHe predicted \u201csome back-room dealing\u201d as the HHS attempts to \u201cmitigate any negative distraction\u201d during the 2016 presidential election in the fall.\n\nPricing, Market Participation\n\n\u201cThe insurers have been loud and clear that the funding that they thought they were going to get for taking on these higher-risk patients\u2014the more costly newly insured\u2014is not coming to fruition,\u201d Isgur said. \u201cIt leaves insurers with some interesting questions for the next months\u2014how are they going to price differently, which markets to exit, which to enter, where are new opportunities? Do you continue to make a play for volume and accept some of that risk or make a play for price and exit some of those markets?\u201d\n\nIn its proposed Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017, the CMS proposed updating 2017 risk adjustment factors to incorporate data on the use of preventive services and prescription drugs and it proposed a lower default risk adjustment charge beginning in 2016 for small issuers in a state's individual and small group markets.\n\nNetwork Requirements\n\nExpect to hear more debate about narrower networks in the marketplaces as the CMS makes a push for more stringent requirements on health plans in its 2017 benefit and payment parameters proposed rule, which will likely be finalized early in 2016.\n\nUnder the ACA, developing more cost-efficient provider networks and drug formularies are among the few methods insurers have for keeping premiums low since the law prescribes a comprehensive set of essential health benefits that must be covered without charging people with health problems higher premiums than healthier people.\n\n\u201cYou have a double whammy on the exchange side in that many of these consumers have never had insurance before\u201d and they're choosing the lowest premiums because they're not familiar with cost sharing, Isgur said.\n\nOut-of-pocket costs for doctors' visits or hospital charges are \u201creally starting to surprise some of the consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nConsumer Concerns\n\nRegulators, politicians and advocacy groups \u201care listening\u201d to consumers' concerns about narrow networks, Isgur said.\n\nWhether that will result in major regulatory changes in 2016 is unclear, \u201cbut I think it's certainly on the table,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is going to have to proceed with caution on this topic,\u201d Deloitte's Scott said.\n\nAdequate choice and access to providers are important goals, but so are \u201chaving networks composed of high-quality providers, not any willing provider,\u201d he said.\n\nThe HHS is placing greater emphasis on value-based payment arrangements, which \u201crequire health plans to make choices and develop collaborations with specific providers,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat sort of partnership that really provides the greatest value-based impact by necessity requires more narrowly defined networks \u2026 Bigger is not always better.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201cPlans are already struggling with financial performance, even in some cases with some narrow networks,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIf the government tries to inhibit narrow networks I think that more plans are going to have to take a harder look at whether or how they participate on exchange products.\u201d\n\nAny Willing Provider Requirements\n\n\u201cLimited networks are among the negotiating levers that insurers may use to lower costs to consumers,\u201d AMCP's Rosato said. \u201cLegislative and regulatory efforts on both a federal and state level often make it difficult to implement limited networks through efforts to enact any willing provider laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nThose requirements generally allow for most or all providers in an area to participate in networks under the terms offered to other providers, and the Federal Trade Commission has assessed such laws to restrain a network's ability to offer lower costs, she said.\n\nIn the 2017 benefit and payment parameter proposal the CMS proposed allowing states with federally facilitated marketplaces to select their own network adequacy standards.\n\nAlternatively, default time and distance standards would be applied to issuers applying for qualified health plan certification in federally facilitated marketplace states that don't implement a standard that meets HHS qualifications.\n\nNetwork adequacy requirements are \u201ca key component\u201d of the CMS proposed rule, Rosato said. The proposal suggests that plans meet minimum CMS requirements for network adequacy or be subject to additional CMS scrutiny, she said.\n\n\u201cThese provisions are vague and confusing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile pharmacy network standards aren't included in the proposed rule, \u201corganizations that represent health plans and pharmacy benefit management companies will continue to examine these provisions,\u201d Rosato said.\n\nThe Health Benefit Plan Network Access and Adequacy Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in November 2015 as a suggested model for states \u201crecognizes that health benefit plans may limit the size of their networks but establishes safeguards to ensure that the network provides the necessary access and is adequate,\u201d she said.\n\nMore Network Restrictions\n\nThe proposed rule means \u201cHHS is already indicating that it will impose more regulatory restrictions on network arrangements,\u201d George Strumpf, of EmblemHealth Inc., told Bloomberg BNA. \u201cHHS intends to nibble at the regulatory margins by proposing additional time and distance standards,\u201d as well as \u201cprospective minimum provider-covered person ratios for the specialties with the highest utilization rate for its state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe HHS proposal also includes \u201cnew network adequacy standards that address patient cost sharing when an individual receives care from an out-of-network provider\u201d such as an anesthesiologist or a pathologist in an in-network facility, Strumpf said.\n\n\u201cIn response to advocacy demands from providers and consumer groups the insurance industry can expect additional and more intrusive/costly regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nPoliticians and provider groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association \u201cwill push for broader networks, since it is an easy concept for the public to understand,\u201d Vivius's Wizig said. \u201cIn reality such requirements will result in higher prices, because by limiting the ability of the insurer to get providers to \u2018compete\u2019 to be in the provider network, providers will be able to negotiate higher prices.\u201d\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nStrumpf lists mergers and acquisitions as one of the top issues in the health insurance industry in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe five largest insurers have a national market share of at least 83 percent,\u201d he said. If the proposed mergers are approved between Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. and between Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc., the remaining three companies, including UnitedHealth Group Inc., would have a market share \u201capproaching 85 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal market concentration has been above Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission recommendations for competitive markets since 2012, Strumpf said.\n\n\u201cApproval of the proposed mergers will consolidate commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollment into a handful of plans who will have significant leverage over providers,\u201d he said.\n\nKeckley expects \u201csome tough negotiations\u201d between the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and Anthem \u201cin how they operate, especially since Cigna is a competitor to many of the Blues.\u201d\n\nMedicare Advantage\n\nDespite a potential negative impact due to increased market consolidation, the outlook for Medicare Advantage in 2016 appears healthy, with continued enrollment and a net increase in plan entry.\n\nIndustry eyes will be focused on the CMS as staff prepares policies that attempt to make quality ratings and payment more equitable for MA plans that enroll a higher proportion of beneficiaries who are lower on the socioeconomic scale.\n\nThe Market\n\nWith the announcement in the April 2015 rate notice that Medicare Advantage rates will rise by an average 1.25 percent in 2016, observers expect the program to have another good year.\n\nIn its annual analysis released in mid-December, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress on Medicare policy, found that MA enrollment grew 6 percent in 2015, a few percentage points lower than in previous years, but significantly higher than fee-for-service enrollment.\n\n\u201cSince 2006, enrollment has more than doubled and plans project continued growth for 2016,\u201d MedPAC said.\n\nIns and Outs\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), in its end-of-year study, said 203 plans that were available in 2015 will be exiting the Medicare Advantage market, and 259 plans will be offered for the first time.\n\nAs examples, Cigna has a new zero-premium plan in Kansas City, Mo. In Colorado, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield has a new health maintenance organization and a special needs plan for beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nOn the West Coast, Stanford Health Care is launching a new plan in Santa Clara County, Calif.\n\nNet Increase\n\nIn 2016, 2,001 Medicare Advantage plans will be available for individual enrollment, 56 more than in 2015, KFF said.\n\n\u201cWith steady growth and higher payment rates, 2016 will be a good time for health plans to be in the Medicare Advantage business,\u201d John Gorman, a health-care consultant, has said.\n\nSean Cavanaugh, CMS's deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicare, characterized the 2016 outlook for the program as bright with a projected 17.4 million enrollees, up by 1 million from 2015.\n\nTom Kornfield, a vice president at Avalere and a health-care consultant, told Bloomberg BNA that although the exact 2016 enrollment won't be known until February, it appears that plans have weathered ACA cuts well, with a good percentage offering zero-premium plans.\n\nThis indicates they were able to tweak their benefit packages to make them more efficient, he said.\n\nMA Concerns\n\nIn February, the CMS will release its proposed rate notice for 2017.\n\nAlthough the agency in December 2015 released underlying numbers that showed a possible increase for 2017, Mara McDermott, a vice president of federal affairs at CAPG, told Bloomberg BNA that the growth numbers indicated in the notice are preliminary. CAPG is a trade association for accountable physician organizations.\n\nShe said she's concerned about other factors that could negatively impact rates, such as risk adjustment, coding intensity and a curtailment of the use of home health risk assessments.\n\nKornfield, a former CMS staffer, said once final payment rates are unveiled in April it will determine how the agency may alter its policies. A rate increase might lead to a policy initiation that could have a negative impact on overall plan payments.\n\nConsolidation Impact\n\nOthers see possible darkening clouds in the MA market created by pending large mergers in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe aggregation of this program has really multiplied very quickly,\u201d Gorman said. With the pending mergers between Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna, other companies in the MA industry will be \u201cfighting against much bigger entities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation said that, while the four firms\u2019 products differ from one another, their combined share of the Medicare Advantage market means that the acquisitions could have important implications for the MA program.\n\nAetna and Humana accounted for 26 percent of MA enrollees in 2015, while Anthem and Cigna accounted for about 6 percent, KFF said.\n\nMarket Variation\n\nKornfield said the impact of merger activity depends on the market. In some cases, fewer plans could mean more negotiating leverage over hospitals.\n\nKFF said that although the average Medicare beneficiary will be able to choose from many plans, in some areas these plans will be offered by just a handful of firms.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, Humana, Blue Cross Blue Shield and its affiliated companies, Kaiser Permanente, Aetna, Cigna and Wellcare accounted for almost three-quarters of MA enrollment in 2015, KFF said.\n\nRegulatory Changes\n\nIn the policy arena, Vanessa D. Pawlak, a principal at Ernst & Young LLP, told Bloomberg BNA that \u201cCMS needs to make sure that plans are not unfairly penalized for enrolling dual eligible and low-income beneficiaries, which has been a challenge for most health insurers nationwide.\u201d\n\nThe CMS stated in 2015 that it will \u201ccontinue to work diligently\u201d to address complaints from plans with high enrollment of the low income that they are disadvantaged in receiving bonuses that stem from star quality ratings.\n\nThe star ratings on the Medicare Plan Finder website inform beneficiaries about the performance of MA and Part D prescription drug plans, as well as serve as the basis of quality bonus payments for MA organizations that score at least four stars on a one-to-five scale.\n\nRequest for Comments\n\nIn the last quarter of 2015, the agency released a request for comments on changes to the 2017 star ratings system, including asking about assistance for MA organizations and prescription drug plan sponsors that contend that enrolling a high percentage of low-income enrollees or those who are disabled and under 65 hurts their ability to achieve high star ratings.\n\nThe CMS has engaged the National Committee for Quality Assurance and the Pharmacy Quality Alliance to examine measure specifications to determine if changes are needed.\n\nIn addition, the IMPACT Act (Pub. L. No. 113-185) instructed the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation to conduct a study before October that would examine the effect of individuals\u2019 socioeconomic status on quality measures and resource use in Medicare.\n\nConcerns About Underpayments\n\nAlso in the last quarter of 2015, the CMS said that, in response to concerns, it has undertaken an evaluation to assess how well its risk adjustment model predicts plan costs for dual eligible and other low income beneficiaries.\n\nUnder risk adjustment, the Medicare program reimburses managed care plans based on the health status of their members as well as other demographic factors.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, there has been an increased focus among some plans on exclusively serving the dual eligible population and CMS feels it is an appropriate time to revisit the model,\u201d the agency said.\n\nRather than looking at all beneficiaries the same, the CMS is considering separate segments for six population groups. These include full benefit dual eligibles, who are eligible for full Medicaid benefits, and beneficiaries who are eligible for partial benefits.\n\n\u201cOur analyses indicate that this revised model would improve predictive performance for aged and disabled full benefit dual, partial benefit dual, and non-dual beneficiaries in the community,\u201d the CMS said.\n\nSeeking Value in MA\n\nAlso during 2016, the CMS will review applications and prepare plans for a new program that will be tested in seven states starting in 2017.\n\nThe five-year Medicare Advantage Value-Based Insurance Design, or MA-VBID, is intended to allow plans to offer benefit packages aimed at improving quality of care and reducing costs for beneficiaries with certain conditions.\n\nApplications are due to the CMS on Jan. 8 and participants will be named in March.\n\n\u201cThe MA-VBID model will test whether the flexibility to offer clinically-nuanced VBID elements in Medicare Advantage plan benefit designs will lead to higher quality and more cost-efficient care for targeted enrollees,\u201d the CMS said.\n\nCurrently, requirements for uniformity in MA benefit design bar approaches based on health status or other enrollee characteristics.\n\nValue-Based Modifier\n\nProvisions on MA comprise a relatively small percentage of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which ended the physician sustainable growth rate payment system. However, the law does require the CMS to submit to Congress a study on the feasibility of integrating alternative payment models in Medicare Advantage.\n\nDue July 1, the study would discuss the feasibility of including a value-based modifier and whether such a modifier should be budget neutral.\n\nCongress wants to know \u201chow we align what is happening in Medicare fee-for-service alternative payment models with what's going on in Medicare Advantage,\u201d CMS's Cavanaugh said.\n\nThe agency will be asking for suggestions from the industry, he said.\n\nMACRA also requires the Government Accountability Office to compare the use of quality measures under fee-for-service Medicare, the Medicare Advantage program and private payer arrangements. It will make recommendations on how to reduce the administrative burden involved in applying quality measures.\n\nPart D Drug Program\n\nThe new year ushered in a new regulatory requirement for disclosing drug pricing that one pharmacy representative described as huge. Pharmaceutical prices remain the major topic for Medicare beneficiaries, and the CMS will try to ignite interest in medicine counseling programs through a new model that offers a prospective payment for more extensive interventions.\n\nGeneric Drug Reimbursement\n\nStarting Jan. 1, Part D drug plan sponsors and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) must offer their network contracted pharmacies regular updates of reimbursement limits for generic drugs.\n\nThe change is a \u201chuge deal\u201d for drugstores, Susan Pilch, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), told Bloomberg BNA.\n\nPart D plans will have to disclose the maximum allowable cost (MAC)\u2014the most a plan will reimburse a contracted pharmacy for a generic drug. The disclosure has to be every seven days so pharmacies have current data on the amount of reimbursement they can expect.\n\nNCPA is pleased but waiting to see how it will be carried out by plan sponsors.\n\nTime to Implement\n\nAlthough the requirement was in a 2014 CMS final rule, implementation wasn't to start until 2016, giving plans time to consider the layout and delivery method for conveying the data to pharmacies.\n\nNCPA said that MAC lists are created by the PBMs, but the methodology to create these lists isn't disclosed.\n\nThe PBMs have contended that requiring public disclosure of MACs and MAC methodologies is likely to lead to collusion and higher prices.\n\nNCPA said pharmacists have had to wait at times months to get updates, frequently resulting in reimbursements below acquisition cost for various medications.\n\nThe change will also allow accurate updates for beneficiaries who use the CMS's Medicare Plan Finder website, Pilch said.\n\nWhen pharmacies can't \u201cdetermine whether their reimbursement is consistent with their contractual arrangements, the accuracy of the prices displayed in the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder is questionable,\u201d the rule said.\n\nData Access\n\nPilch said NCPA members are waiting to see how the sponsors will offer access to the data and how the CMS enforces the new requirement.\n\nThe agency said in the 2014 rule that, despite a request for a requirement that MAC prices be disclosed for easy analysis, it would leave those details up to the parties.\n\nPilch said plans might utilize \u201cuser friendly\u201d portals\u2014such as Wisconsin's ForwardHealth Portal that includes interactive Medicaid Maximum Allowable Fee Schedules\u2014or merely a PDF document that's not in real time.\n\nAccess \u2018Outliers.'\n\nAnother issue that will likely be discussed in 2016 is beneficiary access to Part D preferred cost-sharing pharmacies (PCSP).\n\nUnder a PCSP system, enrollees must fill their prescriptions from a subset of network pharmacies to receive lower cost sharing. The CMS has said that such a system may not be beneficial to all of a plan's enrollees depending on where they reside.\n\nAn April 2015 study by the agency concluded that while plans' preferred cost-sharing pharmacies met convenient access standards in suburban and rural areas, that wasn't always the case in urban areas.\n\nIn a November 2015 memo, the CMS said it would provide drug plan sponsors with an analysis of their 2016 retail pharmacy access and use the data to identify sponsors that the agency considers \u201caccess outliers.\u201d\n\nThe CMS also said it will require plans with PCSP networks considered outliers\u2014set at the bottom 10th percentile compared with all Part D plans in a given \u201cgeographic type\u201d\u2014to disclose this in their marketing materials.\n\nThe information also would be posted on the agency's website.\n\nThe CMS said in the November memo that it will review sponsors\u2019 marketing materials to determine if the required PCSP outlier disclaimer was used appropriately.\n\nPlans sponsor identified as outliers that don't use the outlier disclaimer will receive compliance or enforcement actions, the Medicare agency said.\n\nDrug Prices\n\nThe backdrop of most conversations about Part D is rising drug prices.\n\nCMS's Cavanaugh said this fall that while total Medicare costs per capita grew by 1 percent, Part D drug benefit costs grew by 8 percent and are forecast to grow by 15 percent in 2016.\n\nThe issue is being examined in various government sectors.\n\nHHS Secretary Burwell held a pharmaceutical forum in November 2015 for consumers, providers, employers, manufacturers, health insurance issuers and government representatives on the growing cost of drugs, and particularly the cost of specialty medications.\n\nThe goal was to gather information to \u201cdevelop innovative purchasing strategies and incorporate value-based and outcomes-based models into purchasing programs in both the public and private sectors.\u201d\n\nCongressional Inquiry\n\nOn Capitol Hill, five Democratic senators in mid-December asked acting CMS Administrator Andrew Slavitt about the agency's efforts to contain drug prices.\n\nThe questions dealt with how the agency plans to use its Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to \u201cexamine the potential of alternative payment mechanisms,\u201d including methods to increase the use of generics.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study released in October said the Part D average prescription drug plan premium, weighted by 2015 plan enrollment, will increase by 13 percent.\n\nThis marks \u201ca significant departure from recent years when premiums were essentially flat,\u201d KFF said. \u201cEven if a number of beneficiaries switch or are reassigned to lower-premium plans, the average premium increase for 2016 is likely to be the largest since 2009.\u201d\n\nThe biggest concern for the Part D program \u201cfor 2016 is the uptick in premiums and deductibles,\u201d Ernst & Young's Pawlak told Bloomberg BNA. \u201cThis is stemming from high cost specialty drugs and other breakthrough drug costs.\u201d\n\nOut-of-Pocket Costs\n\nMax Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, told Bloomberg BNA that many beneficiaries will experience an increase in out-of-pocket costs as a result of the spike in prices.\n\nThe top 10 stand-alone prescription drug plans are expected to increase premiums in 2016 as a result of increased drug costs, he said.\n\n\u201cCompared to 2015, more prescription drug plan enrollees will pay at least $60 per month in premiums in 2016,\u201d Richtman said, adding that deductibles are also rising.\n\nKFF said found that about two-thirds of PDPs will charge a deductible in 2016, up from 58 percent in 2015.\n\n\u201cHigh drug costs can also have a significant impact on the quality of care,\u201d Richtman said.\n\nResearch indicates relatively small changes in monthly costs can cause seniors to delay or discontinue using drugs.\n\nMedication Therapy Management\n\nThe CMS will be choosing participants in 2016 for a model intended to control Part D costs through medication therapy management.\n\nThe Part D Enhanced Medication Therapy Management model will offer stand-alone prescription drug plans in 11 states the chance to design and implement strategies to improve medication use and care coordination, the agency said.\n\nThe five-year model will begin in 2017 in Virginia, Florida, Louisiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Arizona.\n\nMTM programs target individuals who have multiple chronic diseases, are taking multiple covered Part D drugs and are identified as likely to incur annual costs for covered Part D drugs that exceed a certain threshold.\n\nThe Medicare Modernization Act required that every Part D plan offer an MTM program but participation has been much lower than expected, both by enrollees and clinicians.\n\nMore Consultations\n\nPDPs participating in the new model could offer enrollees \u201chigher-touch services, such as more frequent person-to-person consultations\u201d after transitions of care or other changes in risk status, the CMS said.\n\nPlans have until Jan. 8 to submit applications and the CMS will name the participants in March.\n\nApplicants will be lured with a prospective payment for more extensive MTM interventions beyond a plan's annual Part D bid as well as performance payment, in the form of an increased direct premium subsidy, for plans that successfully reduce expenditures and fulfill other requirements.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sara Hansard in Washington at shansard@bna.com and Mindy
