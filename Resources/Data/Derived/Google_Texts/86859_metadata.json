Some comments may have been edited.\n\nPost: The University of Tennessee at Martin was given notice this week that it is now under a 12-month academic probation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Interim Chancellor Robert Smith notified faculty of the probation in a campus-wide email Thursday. \u201cWe have not received the official letter (from SACS) with specifics, but you can be assured this will receive 100 percent of our attention over the next several months,\u201d Smith said in the letter. \u201cWe know we are not where we need to be but, given the progress we\u2019ve made in the last four months, I am confident we will be successful thanks to the commitment of our faculty and staff.\u201d\n\nCheri Johnson Spencer: #UTMProud. Not sure of any details but I support UT Martin and their work to improve. As a native of Martin, an alum of UTM, the daughter and granddaughter of UTM retirees, the sister, aunt and parent of UTM students and graduates, I hope the best for the university and the students they continue to serve.\n\nJesse Smith: Wish I could say I was surprised about my alma mater. Maybe they spend too much time asking for money from kids that just graduated instead of actually working to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nSpencer Bowers: I wasn\u2019t surprised either. Some of the programs are so mismanaged.\n\nAmanda MissKitty Pugh: What exactly does this mean?\n\nPowell Franklin: Won\u2019t be the first time at least one of their programs has lost accreditation. They\u2019ll muddle through with a slap on the wrist.\n\nApril Lynn Rice Richey: Wow. I was shocked to see this. I assumed they had good programs based on their college algebra class. That is the only class I have tutored for, but it is tough, not watered down like so many universities are doing.\n\nJonathan Shell: It\u2019s meaningless at this point. The first 12-month probation is the one where they have time to correct the deficiencies found in the SACS initial audit.\n\nTENNCARE MISERY METER\n\nLt. Gov. Ron Ramsey\u2019s, House Speaker Beth Harwell\u2019s and the Tennessee General Assembly\u2019s lack of leadership and urgency and failure to expand TennCare under the Affordable Care Act are bringing misery to an estimated 280,000 Tennesseans who could have received health insurance, including an estimated 30,000 veterans. Meanwhile, the financial stability of hospitals is at risk, and workers could lose their jobs. It is costing Tennesseans an estimated $2.5 million per day. The loss to date is:\n\n$2,292,500,000\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/13/readers-post-ut-martin-academic-probation/77235340/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Selected comments from Jackson Sun Facebook page", "og": {"site_name": "The Jackson Sun", "description": "Selected comments from Jackson Sun Facebook page", "title": "Readers post about UT Martin academic probation", "url": "http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/13/readers-post-ut-martin-academic-probation/77235340/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/jacksonsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Selected comments from Jackson Sun Facebook page", "title": "Readers post about UT Martin academic probation", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/12/JacksonTN/B9320046420Z.1_20151212221220_000_G53CQJTAH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@JSunNews", "site": "@JSunNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=893610877", "fb": {"app_id": 174739675893665}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Editorial (Photo: The Jackson Sun)Buy PhotoWe offer selected comments from a Facebook post by The Jackson Sun about UT Martin being place on academic probation.\nNot sure of any details but I support UT Martin and their work to improve.\nPost: The University of Tennessee at Martin was given notice this week that it is now under a 12-month academic probation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.\nInterim Chancellor Robert Smith notified faculty of the probation in a campus-wide email Thursday.\nThe first 12-month probation is the one where they have time to correct the deficiencies found in the SACS initial audit."}
