There\u2019s a privacy interest involved with accessing private computer systems, but there is also an interest in ensuring the public good,\u201d one Internet researcher tells MintPress, explaining the ambiguities and lack of boundaries in \u201chacktivism.\u201d\n\nA demonstrator stands along the fence during a protest in front of the White House against corrupt governments and corporations, part of a Million Mask March (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nIn November, a Missouri chapter of the Ku Klux Klan distributed fliers near Ferguson and on social media, suggesting that the white supremacy group was preparing to respond to the ongoing protests against police brutality in the St. Louis area with \u201clethal force.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have awakened a sleeping giant,\u201d the flier from the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan read, addressing the protestors. \u201cWe will use lethal force as provided under Missouri law to defend ourselves \u2026 You have been warned by the Ku Klux Klan!\u201d\n\nProtesters initially challenged the police-related death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and a grand jury\u2019s decision not to bring charges against Darren Wilson, the officer involved in the August shooting. Yet the protests that started around Ferguson have morphed into a nationwide call against police brutality in light of similar grand jury acquittals \u2014 including the Eric Garner case in Staten Island \u2014 and a rash of recent police-related shootings.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn response to this perceived threat, the hacktivist collective Anonymous declared \u201ccyber war\u201d on the KKK. In an operation dubbed \u201c#OpKKK,\u201d Anonymous launched distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on several Klan websites and took over two Klan Twitter accounts \u2014 @KuKluxKlanUSA and @YourKKKCentral. Perhaps most damagingly, Anonymous also posted personal information of alleged Klan members \u2014 including photos, addresses, telephone numbers, workplaces, and photos and names of dependent children. Not even Frank Ancona, the self-proclaimed Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights, was spared.\n\n\u201cAfter exposing Klan members and seizing the Klan\u2019s websites and Twitter accounts, Anonymous members faced much criticism regarding freedom,\u201d a statement from Anonymous reads in part. \u201cAnonymous stands for freedom, so why would we strip someone of his or her freedom of speech? The Ku Klux Klan is a terrorist group. The blood of thousands of human beings are on the hands of Klansmen. In most of Anonymous\u2019 member\u2019s eyes, the KKK no longer has the right to express their racist, bigoted opinions.\u201d\n\nDepending on one\u2019s views, actions such as these by Anonymous may seem heavy-handed and even destructive. Recently, a Twitter account that claims association with Anonymous threatened to release the sex tape of rapper Iggy Azalea unless she apologizes to fellow rapper Azealia Banks for alleged racial comments. This, in conjunction with a threat to leak \u201cThe Interview\u201d \u2014 which was pulled from release after the hacker group Guardians of Peace threatened to attack any theater that showed the movie \u2014 have led many to doubt the benevolence and good intentions of the hacktivist collective. These doubts exist persist despite \u201cthe hive\u201d \u2014 the central core of Anonymous activists \u2014 denouncing these actions.\n\nStill, there is little doubt that Anonymous has redefined what it means to be an activist in the Internet era. Hacktivist organizations, such as Anonymous, have given individuals the ability to have a meaningful impact on issues of malfeasance that were previously out of reach or outside public scrutiny. Yet with this has also come a realization of the dangers this new level of public interaction brings and the chaos that can arise in the name of good intentions.\n\nDefining \u201chacktivism\u201d\n\nThe recent hacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment, for example, indicate a potential problem with the notion of \u201chacktivism\u201d \u2014 ethical computer hacking in the name of benevolent protest. On Nov. 24, individuals identifying themselves as Guardians of Peace \u2014 a reference to a speech President Nixon gave regarding South Korea \u2014 illegally downloaded over 100 terabytes of data from the computer servers of Sony, including digital copies of unreleased movies, interoffice emails, personnel files which include the personally-identifiable information of the company\u2019s employees and contractors, usernames and passwords and other protected materials, including health records.\n\nReferred to in the media as a hacktivist group, the Guardians of Peace members behind the hacks justified their actions as a form of protest of the release of \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a film in which James Franco and Seth Rogen play an American television interviewer/producer team charged by the CIA with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after being granted an exclusive invitation to interview him. In July, months prior to the attack, North Korea had formally complained to the United Nations, arguing that \u201cto allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war.\u201d\n\nWhile North Korea has denied any responsibility for the hacking, and while Guardians of Peace has openly mocked the FBI\u2019s assessment that the group is associated with the North Korean government, the group made an explicit threat of violence against any theaters that opt to show the film.\n\nThis threat prompted Sony to initially pull the film\u2019s planned Christmas release, then plan a limited release for theaters willing to show the film. It also came roughly at the same time that saber-rattling from Pyongyang has been on the rise, with North Korea both threatening to retaliate against the U.S. for permitting \u201cThe Interview\u201d to be produced and refusing to participate in any U.N. session in which North Korea\u2019s own human rights record may be discussed (the U.N. Security Council is currently considering referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court).\n\nA statement from North Korea\u2019s state-run news agency KCNA suggested that North Korea has already counteracted against the release of the film, without going into details of what this may entail.\n\nWhile these events are hard to define in positive terms from an American perspective, they are part of the evolving definition of protest. From Guardians of Peace\u2019s point-of-view, the group is making a legitimate statement against how the U.S. treats North Korea.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take, for example, a union protest,\u201d offered Aaron Shull, Internet security research fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, to MintPress News. \u201cIt would be protected free speech to picket in front of a factory or place of business and protest the business practices of the organization. However, if one was to take the same slogans and hack the company\u2019s website and place the slogans on the company\u2019s webpage, that would be a computer crime, despite the fact that the effect would be the same.\u201d\n\nShull argues that Anonymous has helped to make the notion of protest an online concept. In doing this, however, what is acceptable as free speech and what is not have yet to be defined. This ambiguity has allowed for disagreement on what is acceptable, either from a legal or moral standpoint. For example, this ambiguity has given federal authorities prosecutorial discretion that has led to such online dissent to be universally seen as a punishable offense.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trade-off in place here. There\u2019s a privacy interest involved with accessing private computer systems, but there is also an interest in ensuring the public good. This lack of boundaries draw out the difficulties in what we are dealing with with hacktivism and forces a broader societal discussion on what we believe should be acceptable online,\u201d Shull explained.\n\nBoundaries and definitions\n\nThis lack of boundaries was seen in Anonymous\u2019 work in relation to the Steubenville High School rape case. On Aug. 12, 2012, a 16-year-old girl from Weirton, West Virginia, was sexually assaulted by football players from a Steubenville, Ohio, high school after leaving a party.\n\nAs reported in Rolling Stone, despite the victim having no memory of the incident, photos and videos of the encounter were traded on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. However, in Steubenville, the investigation into the rape was initially stalled, as many of the individuals involved \u2014 including the football players themselves, the city\u2019s school superintendent, the coaches and an elementary school principal \u2014 allegedly contributed to an active cover-up by making false statements, hiding evidence, and failing to report the abuse.\n\nThe case may not have been solved without the work of Anonymous member Deric Lostutter, who \u2014 through his initiated Justice Ops \u2014 decided to take on what he saw as an unchallenged case of bullying. Prior to this, Justice Ops had addressed allegations of mishandled funds by the school board of Clark County, Kentucky and forced a revenge porn site offline.\n\nJustice Ops also took on the Westboro Baptist Church \u2014 which takes an extreme view on Christianity, protesting against homosexuality, as well as gays, Catholics and Jews, among others \u2014 by doxing all adult members and taking down the church\u2019s website, \u201cGod Hates Fags.\u201d (Doxing refers to searching for and publishing the personal information of a particular individual or group online, often with malicious intent.)\n\nLostutter\u2019s operation also organized a rally to protect vigils and the funerals of victims of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting from protesting by the Westboro Church, which the Southern Poverty Law Center recognizes as a hate group.\n\nWith an empty threat that everyone involved in the Steubenville cover-up had been doxed, Lostutter\u2019s Justice Ops managed to make Steubenville a national story, leading other Anonymous members to join in \u2014 including one who hacked the Steubenville High School booster club\u2019s website RollRedRoll.com. Lostutter organized two rallies in Steubenville on behalf of the victims under the banner \u201cOccupy Steubenville.\u201d Ultimately, it was the uploading of critical files, including a video detailing the rape, that led to the convictions of Trent Mays and Ma\u2019Lik Richmond.\n\nFor his efforts to expose what he saw as a grave injustice and cover-up, Lostutter is currently awaiting indictment and could face up to 25 years in prison for offenses against the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, including the hacking of the computer of a Steubenville booster, who Justice Ops incorrectly accused of harboring pornographic images of underage girls. (Anonymous would eventually apologize for this.)\n\nIf convicted, Lostutter could serve a longer sentence than Mays \u2014 who is currently serving a two-year sentence on charges of rape and dissemination of pornographic pictures of a minor \u2014 and Richmond, who was found delinquent of rape and served nine months of a one-year sentence in a juvenile detention center.\n\nA modern-day philosophy\n\nAt its core, Anonymous is nothing more than a group of individuals. The only requirement for joining the group is for a person to say that he/she is a member of Anonymous. As such, how one approaches or embraces the Anonymous philosophy differs from person to person.\n\nHowever, the approach the government has taken toward Anonymous has been one of extremity. \u201cI think anything that has to do with Anonymous scare the hell out of the DOJ,\u201d said Tor Ekeland, noted hacktivist advocate and counsel for Lostutter, to Rolling Stone. \u201cHackers are the new communists.\u201d\n\nDespite this, most would argue that hacktivists and Anonymous, in particular, have a place in the modern-day conversation.\n\n\u201cNot only has Anonymous redefined what it means to be an advocate, Anonymous has reinvigorated advocacy in this country and has sent it flying off to the digital revolution,\u201d said Jay Leiderman, a criminal defense attorney who has been called the \u201cHacktivist\u2019s Advocate\u201d for his defense of Anonymous, to MintPress.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think for a minute that politicians and other organizations are not taking what has been learned from Anonymous and applying it to their outreach strategies. Anonymous has been extremely successful in mobilization and has shown how strong a crowdsourced effort could truly be.\u201d\n\nWhile Anonymous is currently in what Leiderman describes as a restructuring phase, and the future of the movement is unclear, the role the group has played in the public discourse since its emergence in 2003 has been seen by many to suggest that the powers-that-be are not necessarily all that powerful. True power, Anonymous suggests, belongs to the people \u2014 and this power can only be taken from the people if the people choose not to use it. Thus, Anonymous proves an age-old, fundamental principle: It only takes one person to make a difference. In this case, however, it\u2019s more that it takes just one person with Internet access and an ability to organize effectively to make a difference.\n\n\u201cThe Internet is the greatest tool we have for free speech and everywhere on the planet we all have a voice now \u2013 7 billion of us,\u201d said Old Holborn, a spokesperson for Anonymous, to Russia Today. \u201cYes of course, somebody is going to get upset at something somebody else says. But we have to realize we all have a voice. We\u2019re all equal. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t listen to it. That is freedom of choice and freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cAnonymous is whatever you want it to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThere\u2019s a trade-off in place here.
