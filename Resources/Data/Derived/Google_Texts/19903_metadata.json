I don\u2019t know if the Colorado Department of Transportation has promoted it that way, but the better, more realistic purpose of Bustang is to provide transportation alternatives for Colorado travelers.\n\nThe private automobile should not be the only way we can travel between Colorado destinations. Our exclusive reliance on cars disempowers many people who cannot drive or cannot afford a car. The list of people who need alternatives to cars includes old folks, children, those with physical disabilities, many college students and members of the armed forces. Add to that those of us who are just fed up with driving. I own a nice car, but would much rather leave the driving to CDOT and be able to use my computer or read a book.\n\nBecause of huge government subsidies to the private automobile through road-building \u2014 subsidies that go far beyond the money received from the gas tax \u2014 it is quite difficult for the private sector to compete in the public transportation business. America once had a fabulous passenger rail system, but it died because we subsidized its competition. If we can make it profitable for the private sector to provide alternatives to the car, they will step up and compete. Until then, we need Bustang, FasTracks, municipal buses, Amtrak, and more. Colorado and America need to diversify our transportation options.\n\nGary Sprung, Boulder\n\nThis letter was published in the Feb. 20 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "eLetters", "description": "I don\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt know if the Colorado Department of Transportation has promoted it that way, but the better, more realistic purpose of Bustang is to provide transportation alternatives for Colorado travelers.", "title": "Creating choices in transportation for Coloradans", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2016/02/20/creating-choices-in-transportation-for-coloradans/40943/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2016/02/colorado-transportation-495x324.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "I don\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt know if the Colorado Department of Transportation has promoted it that way, but the better, more realistic purpose of Bustang is to provide transportation alternatives for Colorado travelers.", "creator": "@denveropinion", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2016/02/20/creating-choices-in-transportation-for-coloradans/40943/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2016/02/colorado-transportation-495x324.jpg", "title": "Creating choices in transportation for Coloradans", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Re: \u201cMissing the point on Colorado transportation funding,\u201d Feb. 10 editorial.\nI don\u2019t know if the Colorado Department of Transportation has promoted it that way, but the better, more realistic purpose of Bustang is to provide transportation alternatives for Colorado travelers.\nThe Post wrote that congestion relief via the new Bustang system is not credible.\nThe list of people who need alternatives to cars includes old folks, children, those with physical disabilities, many college students and members of the armed forces.\nUntil then, we need Bustang, FasTracks, municipal buses, Amtrak, and more."}
