Bunge Adds Cooking Oil with Whole Harvest Foods

The purchase follows deals made by Land O'Lakes, Wilbur-Ellis and El Du Pont

Food ingredients distributor Bunge Ltd. (NYSE: BG) acquired cooking oil maker Whole Harvest Foods LLC. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Whole Harvest, based in Warsaw, North Carolina, makes frying oil, vegetable oil, pan spray and liquid butter alternatives.

“The Whole Harvest Foods products are a great addition to our product portfolio delivering the simple label features that our customers want,” says Bunge executive vice president Tim Gallagher. Bunge’s cooking oil division includes the Nutra-Clear, Amaizing NT and Pro-Formance brands.

Whole Harvest marks Bunge’s first notable acquisition since 2012 when it purchased Climate Change Capital Ltd.

Strategic buyers have been going after agriculture suppliers. Earlier in 2015, Land O’Lakes Inc. and United Suppliers Inc. have merged. Earlier in 2015, EI Du Pont De Nemours And Co. (NYSE: DD), said it will acquire biochemical company Taxon Biosciences Inc. for undisclosed terms. Since 2014, family-owned Wilbur-Ellis Co. purchased Aero Spray Services Inc. and Poynter’s Ag Supply.
