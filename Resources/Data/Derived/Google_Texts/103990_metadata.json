As Rouhani mentions, it began Wednesday at sundown. The image in the tweet is reportedly taken from a synagogue in Tehran.\n\nRouhani, a Shiite Muslim cleric, was elected president in June. He is widely seen as more moderate than former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, though his goodwill gesture on Wednesday stunned even veteran Iran watchers.\n\n\u201cNot even under the monarchy do we remember such a message,\u201d Haleh Esfandiari, a native Iranian and director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, told Al-Monitor.\n\nOn Thursday, however, Mohammadreza Sadegh, an adviser to Rouhani, told Iran's Fars News Agency that the Rosh Hashanah tweet did not come from the Iranian president. The tweet came from former campaign aides, rather, who run the Twitter account, Sadegh said.\n\n\"All the news regarding the president, after his election, is reflected by his appointed bureau chief and those are the only official reports. Mr. Rouhani does not have a Twitter account,\" Sadegh told Fars.\n\nA close aide to Rouhani, however, told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that while the president does not tweet from his account, people in his office do, so it is semi-official.\n\nInterest in Rouhani's Twitter account was nearly eclipsed on Thursday by extraordinary Tweets from the official account of Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister.\n\nHappy Rosh Hashanah \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) September 5, 2013\n\n@sfpelosi Iran never denied it. The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year. \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) September 5, 2013\n\nIf the name of Zarif's interlocutor looks familiar, it should. @SFPelosi is the Twitter account of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's daughter, Christine Pelosi.\n\nAhmadinejad isn't as tech savvy nor as pluralistic as Rouhani, but on a few occasions, he would issue positive statements about Christmas or Rosh Hashanah.\n\nThe former Iranian president was much more widely known, however, for saying that Israel should be eliminated and calling the Holocaust a myth. Usually, Ahmadinejad would caution that he was criticizing \"Zionists,\" not all Jews.\n\nFewer than 10,000 Jews remain in Iran, according to the JTA, the Jewish news service, which still makes it the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel.\n\nReligious minorities are not completely free to participate in Iranian government and often face discrimination, but Jews and Christians are, to some extent, allowed to live and worship openly in Iran.\n\nAs Washington Post foreign policy expert Max Fisher points out, it's difficult to extricate Rouhani's tweet from the context of Israeli-Iranian politics.\n\n\"It\u2019s not exactly a unilateral declaration of peace \u2013 tomorrow, Iran will probably still support Hezbollah \u2013 but it\u2019s yet another hint of Rouhani\u2019s efforts to dramatically soften Iranian foreign policy and rhetoric,\" Fisher writes.\n\nIn honor of Rosh Hashanah, here are some other things to know about the Jewish holiday:\n\nAccording to the Talmud, the world was created on the first day of Tishri, the seventh month of the Jewish calendar. So Rosh Hashanah is considered a birthday of sorts for the world. (Other rabbis teach that it honors the day Adam and Eve were created.)\n\nIt is celebrated on the first and second days of the month of Tishri, which generally corresponds to September or October on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nRosh Hashanah begins the High Holy Days or Ten Days of Penitence, which end 10 days later with Yom Kippur.\n\nOne of the most significant rituals during Rosh Hashanah is the blowing of the Shofar, or ram's horn. It is used as a call to repentance during the High Holy Days.\n\nDuring this time, Jewish people attend synagogue services and refrain from working.\n\nAnother popular practice is to eat apples dipped in honey, symbolizing the hope for a good year to come. Also, challah bread in round loaves instead of braided loaves is dipped in honey instead of salt.\n\nPomegranates are eaten because the seeds are symbolic of the many commandments in the Torah that Jews must fulfill.\n\nAnother popular ritual is to walk to a river or stream and recite special prayers of penitence. Afterwards, one throws breadcrumbs in the river, to symbolically cast away sins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Daniel Burke\u00a0and Mitra Mobasherat, CNN (CNN) -- Marking a sharp shift from his Holocaust-denying predecessor, new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday appeared to wish \"all Jews\" a \"blessed Rosh Hashanah\" on his English-language Twitter account.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Iranian president's surprising message to Jews", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/04/iranian-presidents-surprising-message-to-jews/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130805161618-iran-rouhani-inauguration-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Daniel Burke\u00a0and Mitra Mobasherat, CNN\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Marking a sharp shift from his Holocaust-denying predecessor, new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday appeared to wish \"all Jews\" a \"blessed Rosh Hashanah\" on his English-language Twitter account.", "title": "Iranian president's surprising message to Jews"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "foreign policy, holidays, holocaust, iran, iran, judaism, hassan rouhani, high holy days, iran, jews, middle east, rosh hashanah", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/04/iranian-presidents-surprising-message-to-jews/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1daf\"", "article_summary": "As the sun is about to set here in #Tehran I wish all Jews, especially Iranian Jews, a blessed Rosh Hashanah.\nThe former Iranian president was much more widely known, however, for saying that Israel should be eliminated and calling the Holocaust a myth.\nRosh Hashanah begins the High Holy Days or Ten Days of Penitence, which end 10 days later with Yom Kippur.\nInterest in Rouhani's Twitter account was nearly eclipsed on Thursday by extraordinary Tweets from the official account of Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister.\nOne of the most significant rituals during Rosh Hashanah is the blowing of the Shofar, or ram's horn."}
