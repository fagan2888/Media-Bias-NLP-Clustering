I do believe that Islam backs free speech. I also believe that Islam champions secular governance. But what\u2019s significant about my beliefs is why I believe them \u2014 which is because they are precisely what the Qur\u2019an teaches, and what Prophet Muhammad exemplified.\n\nPerhaps this is why I find arguments like the one put forth by Jeffrey Tayler in Salon earlier this month \u2014 written in the aftermath of the \u201cDraw the Prophet\u201d shooting in Texas and Charlie Hebdo\u2019s controversial PEN award \u2014 to be yet another straw man, one that avoids three realities critics of Islam continue to ignore. For example, Tayler\u2019s claim that \u201cProphet Muhammad was a triumphant warlord leading military campaigns that spread Islam throughout Arabia\u201d is but one example of the numerous historical fantasies he writes; a fantasy that is wholly contradictory to Prophet Muhammad\u2019s well established rules of war. (SPOILER: Islam forbids spreading faith by the sword and permits fighting only in self-defense).\n\nHad Tayler presented his arguments as a criticism of several Muslim majority political regimes \u2014 Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia to name a few \u2014 I would have largely agreed with his claims. He runs into trouble, however, when he unwarrantedly conflates political regimes with the religion of Islam as a whole. Further exacerbating Tayler\u2019s position is his reliance on comedian Bill Maher and internationally recognized hatemonger Pamela Geller as presenting some sort of authentic reality of Islamic teaching. Maher, I\u2019ve heard, is actually a nice guy in person \u2014 but that characteristic does not somehow make his commentary Islamic scholarship. Geller, meanwhile, is on hate watch lists for both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and is banned from the United Kingdom for her hatemongering; she has zero academic credentials on the subject of Islam. And lest there be any confusion, the United Kingdom is definitely not an \u201cEnforcer of Shariah\u201d \u2014 a term Tayler uses to describe the 204 authors who signed a letter dissociating themselves from a free speech award given to the surviving artists of Charlie Hebdo.\n\nIndeed, the United States has a proud free speech model \u2014 one I support as an American, as a Muslim, as an attorney and as a person who regularly receives death threats for speaking my mind. America\u2019s current free speech model is not only unique in its own history, but unique when compared to the contemporary developed world.\n\nAnd here is the first reality critics like Tayler ignore: Most of America\u2019s staunchest allies enforce speech laws much stricter than what Islam teaches \u2014 yet no one accuses such Western nations of being free speech obstructionists.\n\nFor example, Article 415 of the Italian Penal Code states, \u201cWhoever publicly incites\u2026 hatred between the social classes, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to five years.\u201d Likewise, Article 261 of the Swiss Penal Code states issues up to a three-year prison sentence for anyone who \u201cpublicly disseminates, organizes, or encourages participation in events promoting ideologies that have as their object the systematic denigration or defamation of the members of a race, ethnic group or religion.\u201d Our neighbor Canada\u2019s Criminal Code Section 319 offers a two-year prison sentence for anyone who \u201cwilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group [by] communicating statements, other than in private conversation.\u201d\n\nI could go on with Denmark, Poland and Spain, among other Western nations that enforce speech restrictions that not only mimic blasphemy laws in nations like Pakistan, but would also clearly violate our First Amendment. Yet, we see no outcries of oppression from these laws in these Christian-majority nations. Meanwhile, Islam is somehow blamed when nearly the exact same laws are promulgated in Muslim-majority nations. The double standard is astounding.\n\nAnd Western nations \u2014 not Shariah \u2014 in fact enforce such laws restricting speech. Germany rewards Holocaust deniers with a five-year prison sentence. Two years before the horrific Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack a French judge ordered Twitter to hand over identifying information of users engaging in anti-Semitic and racist comments. Where was the outcry of free speech oppression then?\n\nThe second reality critics like Tayler ignore is that they insist on viewing terrorism done by Muslims in a vacuum and unique to just Muslims \u2014 both of which are false positions.\n\nThe reality is that Western foreign policy has long supported corrupt dictators and despots in Muslim-majority nations, including Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Muammar Ghaddafi, Hosni Mubarak and even Bashir Assad. In turn, these corrupt leaders \u2014 who already endorsed terrorism before U.S. support \u2014 have only further advanced their extremist agendas after U.S. support by leveraging the fact that Western wars have killed some 4 million Muslims, mostly civilians, since 1990 alone. President Obama correctly stated, \u201cISIL is direct outgrowth of al Qaeda in Iraq, which grew out of our invasion, which is an example of unintended consequences, which is why we should generally aim before we shoot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher & Richard Dawkins continue to disparage a religion that, in all honesty, they know little about", "title": "These guys are painfully wrong about Islam: 3 things that every anti-Muslim zealot needs to admit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bill Maher & Richard Dawkins continue to disparage a religion that, in all honesty, they know little about", "title": "These guys are painfully wrong about Islam: 3 things that every anti-Muslim zealot needs to admit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/these_guys_are_painfully_wrong_about_islam_3_things_that_every_anti_muslim_zealot_needs_to_admit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/dawkins_maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill Maher & Richard Dawkins continue to disparage a religion that, in all honesty, they know little about", "title": "These guys are painfully wrong about Islam: 3 things that every anti-Muslim zealot needs to admit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/dawkins_maher.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Qasim Rashid", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Bill Maher, Editor's Picks, Islam, Islamophobia, Religion, Richard Dawkins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7a0\"", "article_summary": "America\u2019s current free speech model is not only unique in its own history, but unique when compared to the contemporary developed world.\nI do believe that Islam backs free speech.\nWhere was the outcry of free speech oppression then?\nAnd Western nations \u2014 not Shariah \u2014 in fact enforce such laws restricting speech.\nTopics: Atheism, Bill Maher, Editor's Picks, Islam, Islamophobia, Religion, Richard Dawkins, News, Politics NewsAs a practicing Muslim, I don\u2019t believe Islam is above criticism."}
