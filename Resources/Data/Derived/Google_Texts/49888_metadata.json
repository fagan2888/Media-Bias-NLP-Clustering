Jeb Bush, who is trailing Trump badly in state polls.\n\nTrump took the stage at the University of South Florida\u2019s Sun Dome 40 minutes late. Screaming fans didn\u2019t seem to care, however, cheering for \u201cThe Donald\u2019s\u201d familiar themes such as building a wall between the United States and Mexico and abolishing Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win again,\u201d Trump said, spreading his arms to signal the scope of his ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start winning with the military. We\u2019re going to win with health care. We\u2019re going to terminate Obamacare.\u201d\n\nTrump took Obama to task continually, painting the president as un-American, incompetent and weak-kneed. He criticized the White House\u2019s recent deal with Iran to slow that country\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a giveaway. He said the United States gave Iran $150 billion and got nothing but four hostages in return.\n\n\u201cWe get zero,\u201d Trump said.\n\nActually, Iran is getting $100 billion in revenues from sales of oil it produced. The United States froze those assets in 2012 and the money has been sitting in foreign banks since then.\n\nTrump joked about Clinton\u2019s problems with a private e-mail server that she is accused of using to send and receive classified information.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand with Hillary \u2014 when you see 19,000 and 2,000 (e-mails) and how do you have that many?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d\n\nBut the flaxen-haired New Yorker saved special venom for Bush, whom Trump labeled \u201cgutless\u201d and \u201ca total stiff.\u201d He noted that Bush has spent over $100 million on ads, many of them attacking Trump, but remains low in the polls after finishing fourth in Monday\u2019s New Hampshire primary.\n\n\u201cJeb, ugh. He\u2019s asleep at the wheel,\u201d Trump said. \u201cCan you imagine Jeb negotiating with China?\u201d\n\nHis supporters ate it up, booing when Obama or Bush\u2019s name came up, and chanting with Trump, \u201cBuild that wall,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s pledge that Mexico will pay \u201c100 percent\u201d for a border barrier.\n\n\u201cDonald is the only one that\u2019s going to save us,\u201d said supporter Claudia DeGrazia, clasping her hands over her chest. \u201cHe really holds my heart. Right from the beginning, I have never strayed from my belief this guy is going to make it.\u201d\n\nDeGrazia and thousands of others stood in lines that wrapped hundreds of yards around the Sun Dome to present tickets they printed online with no guarantee of a seat. They joked and laughed, showing off red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and Trump signs.\n\nEvery one of the 10,500 seats in the arena appeared full, the occupants subjected to detailed searches that included metal detectors.\n\n\u201cAs a good American, we\u2019re here to make American great again,\u201d said Stacey McQuestion of Apollo Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a man speak his mind for once. It\u2019s nice to hear him say what needs to be said. If you ask every person in this line what they want to say, that man is going to say it.\u201d\n\nKathy Muscillo of Michigan said she respects Trump for the reverence he shows veterans. Several retired service men and women spoke from the stage before Trump. The candidate said several times he loves veterans and blamed Obama for not fixing problems with poor care and long waits at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u201cHe loves our vets,\u201d Muscillo said. \u201cI want all the money that goes overseas and goes to all the illegals to go to our vets. The hell with all those giveaways.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidate Bernie Sanders, whom Trump called a communist, has drawn large crowds of younger voters, but Trump had his share, too.\n\nJeb Hagewood, 19, of Huntsville, Alabama, said young people attracted to Sanders need to be educated about the cost of the Democrat\u2019s proposed social programs, like free college tuition.\n\n\u201cThey like him because he\u2019s going to give out a lot of free stuff,\u201d Hagewood said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think young people are educated about how his policies would work and the repercussions.\u201d\n\nA number of Trump critics showed up to protest, both inside and outside the arena. As many as 70 people outside held signs labeling Trump a racist and a friend of the rich. One sign read, \u201cBuild a wall around Donald Trump and make him pay for it.\u201d\n\nThere were a number of scuffles between supporters and critics.\n\nEmily Mohr, a 20-year-old USF student, said she showed up to protest because Trump is racist and sexist.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a terrible human being,\u201d Mohr said.\n\nShannon Evans, 35, carried her son Liam, 2, and a sign saying that Muslims had accompanied Christopher Columbus on his ship the Santa Maria when the explorer reached the New World. Several people in line booed Evans.\n\nOne man said, \u201cI was on the boat trying to sink that boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I sitting here booing? I\u2019m trying to educate people,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIf people knew the facts, they would change their minds.\u201d\n\nmsalinero@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-8303\n\nTwitter: @mikesaltbo", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 06:07:03 -0400", "Description": "Billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump delighted more than 10,000 fans Friday night, savaging President Obama, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and former Florida Gov.
