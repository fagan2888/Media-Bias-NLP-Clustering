Wednesday on TV One’s “News One,” host Roland Martin went on a rant against Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly for calling the Black Lives Matter movement a hate group because Minnesota Black Lives Matter protesters chanted “pigs in a blanket, fry ’em like bacon” after the execution style murder of a Texas deputy this weekend.

Martin said, “I don’t recall you Bill O’Reilly ever saying that you are going to take out police brutality. I don’t recall you ever saying that you are going to take out police corruption. But all of a sudden you want to take out Black Lives Matter movement because you don’t like the fact that they are out there protesting.”

Martin listed several cases where he believes police brutality was at play and said, “When are you going to use your voice and platform to go after cops. When are you Bill O’Reilly going to tell the good cops they should stand up and say something when cops lie on police reports when they kill black people. Until you do that, shut the hell up!”
