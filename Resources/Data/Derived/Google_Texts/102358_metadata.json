Since last spring, first-time parents Austin and Kyra Faught have stumbled, fallen and risen again after learning their child has cystic fibrosis, a lifelong disease that damages the lungs and pancreas.  Three weeks ago, a new fight landed at their doorstep, one that came with just as many tears and sleepless nights, waged not with medicine but phone calls and fax machines.  At a time when millions of lower-income Americans are enjoying insurance coverage, some for the first time, an untold number of middle-class families are discovering that the kind of health care they want and need is slipping from their grasp.  On the final day of 2015, tens of thousands of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas health insurance customers, including the Faughts, saw previous plans expire.  At least 1,000 other children who have been treated there may have lost access when they lost their insurance plan - double what administrators first feared.  Each day, in addition to hooking Jack to the machine to unblock mucus, his parents crush two dozen enzyme tablets, hiding them in bowls of applesauce and yogurt to help his body absorb nutrients so he can grow.
