The text of the 2010 law states that the Internal Revenue Service can authorize subsidies \u2014 which are awarded to Obamacare enrollees with annual incomes of up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level in the form of tax credits \u2014 to qualifying insurance consumers who purchase policies through an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d Seemingly, especially to Obamacare critics, those four words in the many hundreds of pages of regulations excludes the 36 states in which the federal government, rather than the state, operates the online insurance marketplaces from providing subsidies. However, it should be noted, in 2012 the Internal Revenue Service did adopt a regulation that allowed individuals who qualify for the subsidies but live in states that defaulted to the federally-facilitated exchanges to receive the tax credit, \u201cregardless of whether the exchanges is established and operated by the state.\u201d\n\nThe Urban Institute calculated that 9.3 million people will lose their tax credits if the Supreme Court decides subsidies distributed by the federally-facilitated exchanges are invalid. Losing the subsidy would make insurance coverage too expensive for many exchange enrollees, forcing an estimated 8.2 million to forgo insurance in 2016. The ramifications of such a decision extends far beyond the millions who would lose coverage. Pushing so many customers out would erode the entire system by making health insurance coverage more expensive for all Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s what we call the \u2018death spiral,\u2019\u201d Peter Cunningham, a health care policy expert at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Bankrate. If the Supreme Court limits subsidies, \u201cit would, basically, destabilize the insurance markets and the exchanges in those states,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s likely going to raise prices for everybody else.\u201d\n\nObamacare, encompasses a number of health care reforms ranging from how hospitals are reimbursed for care to the regulation that chain restaurants post calorie counts on their menus to requirements that large employers provide workers with affordable insurance coverage. But the most essential, and most controversial, provision is the one that changed U.S. tax code to create subsidies (in the form of tax credits) that enable millions of uninsured Americans to purchase coverage. The goal of the Affordable Care Act was to make health care in the United States more accessible and more streamlined, and without the insurance subsidies that mission is unreachable\n\nPolitics and judicial questions may cast a shadow across the future of the Affordable Care Act, and it may be too early to completely evaluate the reform, but taking stock of how well it has performed to this point is necessary. According to an analysis conducted by consumer financial services company Bankrate, Obamacare is largely \u201cdelivering on its promises\u201d because more insurance carriers are entering the marketplace and premiums are not \u201cspiraling out of control.\u201d\n\nIn order to fully analyze the successes of the Affordable Care Act, it is important to specify what exactly the reform was intended to accomplish. \u201cThe ACA starts from a place of wanting to make sure that all individuals can obtain affordable insurance, even if they have a prior medical condition,\u201d explained Aaron Carroll MD, MS, \u2014 director of Indiana University\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research \u2014 in a 2012 blog post. \u201cBut if you guarantee access to insurance to everyone and mandate that people with preexisting conditions can\u2019t be charged higher rates than their healthier peers, you need to prevent adverse selection (having relatively sicker individuals more likely to buy insurance coverage rather than relatively healthy people) and people gaming the insurance market (forgoing coverage and enrolling only when they become ill) \u2014 thus, the mandate that everyone must purchase insurance or pay a penalty. And if you demand that people buy insurance, then you have to make sure they can afford it. That\u2019s why you have subsidies,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe plus is that many more people get access. The negative is that it costs people and the government money. That\u2019s the trade-off.\u201d\n\nMore than 16 million Americans have gained coverage as a result of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, an expansion that has lowered the uninsured rate by approximately one third to the lowest level ever recorded. That the exchanges have produced strong enrollment numbers has proven the viability of the reform to insurers, and as a result more insurance carriers are entering the marketplace, according to Bankrate\u2019s analysis of Department of Health and Human Services data from 40 states and Washington D.C. \u201cThis is certainly a good thing,\u201d David Becker, a public health expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told the firm. \u201cThe health insurance industry is becoming more like how other markets work.\u201d\n\nOn average, each state\u2019s insurance exchange added one new insurance carrier in 2015. New Hampshire experienced the greatest improvement, with the the number of participating insurers rising from one to five. In Georgia and Indiana, the number of carriers offering plans on the state exchanges at least doubled. By comparison, California, Oregon, and Oklahoma lost carriers. New carriers mean increased customer choice, leaving 2015 with an average nine plan options per county in the 35 states examined.\n\nAn even more basic concern than intra-exchange competition is whether the prices for plans offered through those marketplaces are affordable. If the main objective of the the health care reform was to health insurance accessible for nearly every single American, the premiums for insurance plans must be manageable. Whether premiums are growing more burdensome or more fair is hotly debated because of the complexity and politicization of the Affordable Care Act. Premiums did rise from 2014 to 2015, according to Bankrate\u2019s analysis, but the increase was far more mild than those experienced before Obamacare was implemented. For the insurance plans in the second lowest-cost or \u201csilver\u201d bracket, which is the benchmark level, unsubsidized premiums for 40-year-olds increased by an average of 5%. Before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces, premiums rose an average of 11% a year between 2008 and 2010, according to data from the health research organization, the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cThere were a lot of concerns about premiums rising for the second year,\u201d says Peter Cunningham, a health care policy expert at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cThat didn\u2019t really turn out to be the case.\u201d Likely a contributing factor to the more moderate increase in premium prices has been the increased competition on the exchanges. The evidence? Washington D.C\u2019s insurance commissioner Philip Barlow told Bankrate that companies operating within the city\u2019s marketplace have lowered prices in each of the past two years after noticing what other insurers were offering.\n\nStill, Congressional Republicans want to dismantle the reform.\n\nClick here for a more in-depth examination of how the Affordable Care Act has impacted employment, premiums, competition in the insurance market, the U.S. budget deficit, and the insured rate has been mythologized.\n\nFollow Meghan on Twitter @MFoley_WSCS\n\nMore from Politics Cheat Sheet:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "2015-05-16 14:06:03", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cheat Sheet", "sailthru.author": "meghan-foley", "news_keywords": "Supreme Court,uninsured rate,insurance subsidies,coverage,the Affordable Care Act,ObamaCare,Insurers,democrats,death spiral,republicans", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Cheat Sheet", "description": "According to an analysis conducted by consumer financial services company Bankrate, Obamacare is largely \u201cdelivering on its promises.\u201d", "title": "Is Obamacare Delivering on Its Promises?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481715489-e1417467674401.jpg", "url": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/politics/is-obamacare-delivering-on-its-promises.html/?a=viewall", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to an analysis conducted by consumer financial services company Bankrate, Obamacare is largely \u201cdelivering on its promises.\u201d", "title": "Is Obamacare Delivering on Its Promises?", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481715489-e1417467674401.jpg", "creator": "@MFoley_WSCS", "site": "@cheatsheet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/politics/is-obamacare-delivering-on-its-promises.html/", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-16T14:06:03-04:00", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091, "app_id": 354932851235506}, "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481715489-e1417467674401-150x100.jpg", "item-category": "US Politics", "sailthru.tags": "politics,usa-politics,healthcare,supreme-court,uninsured-rate,insurance-subsidies", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wallstcheatsheet", "section": "Healthcare", "tag": "uninsured rate", "published_time": "2015-05-16T14:06:03-04:00"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481715489-e1417467674401.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "According to an analysis conducted by consumer financial services company Bankrate, Obamacare is largely \u201cdelivering on its promises.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "Pushing so many customers out would erode the entire system by making health insurance coverage more expensive for all Americans.\n\u201cThe health insurance industry is becoming more like how other markets work.\u201dOn average, each state\u2019s insurance exchange added one new insurance carrier in 2015.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we call the \u2018death spiral,\u2019\u201d Peter Cunningham, a health care policy expert at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Bankrate.\nLosing the subsidy would make insurance coverage too expensive for many exchange enrollees, forcing an estimated 8.2 million to forgo insurance in 2016.\nWhether premiums are growing more burdensome or more fair is hotly debated because of the complexity and politicization of the Affordable Care Act."}
