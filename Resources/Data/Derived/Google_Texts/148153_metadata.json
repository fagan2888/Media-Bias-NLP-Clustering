So it should be no shocker when someone mentions his name and drugs. But what if Obama was still partaking in illicit and illegal substances? Would he be pouring up with the likes of Lil' Wayne, Chief Keef, and A$AP Yams? Well, streetwear brand Codean Couture imagines what the leader of the free world would look like when he's gone off that purp with its new \u201c#Obamacare\u201d tee.\n\nThe graphic takes advantage of the fact that no matter what activity the POTUS is doing, it can be Photoshopped into many different activities. And in this particular instance, Obama is straight up sipping on that lean. Eyes drooped down and a thumbs up complete the trifecta.\n\nThe only thing that might hold you back from purchasing this tee is that it\u2019s a V-neck. But at least it's not a super deep V that shows off the taco meat, so you get a pass. Visit the ESGWIZ website to purchase these \u201cEXTREMELY RARE\u201d shirts.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/nfastslkhztg8zlsr4b3.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Teofilo Killip", "description": "Gone off that lean.", "og": {"site_name": "Complex", "description": "Gone off that lean.", "title": "A Hilarious New Tee Shows President Barack Obama Sippin' Sizzurp Out a Double Cup", "url": "http://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/codean-couture-obama-drank-sippin-t-shirt", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/nfastslkhztg8zlsr4b3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gone off that lean.", "title": "A Hilarious New Tee Shows President Barack Obama Sippin' Sizzurp Out a Double Cup", "url": "http://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/codean-couture-obama-drank-sippin-t-shirt", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/nfastslkhztg8zlsr4b3.jpg", "site": {"id": 13049362}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-03T10:56:05-0500", "p": {"domain_verify": "51da1c238ae41f7163c35ac3e762917b"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685812641524750}, "sailthru.content.type": "News", "sailthru.tags": "News, President Barack Obama, T Shirts, Complex, Style, complex", "keywords": "News, President Barack Obama, T Shirts, Complex, Complex Magazine, Style Guide, Fashion News, Celebrity Profiles, Sneakers, Sneakers Guide, Sneakers Blog", "sailthru.channel": "Style", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/nfastslkhztg8zlsr4b3.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "President Obama has admitted in his first book that he has used marijuana and \u201cmaybe a little blow\u201d in the past.\nBut at least it's not a super deep V that shows off the taco meat, so you get a pass.\nThe only thing that might hold you back from purchasing this tee is that it\u2019s a V-neck.\nWould he be pouring up with the likes of Lil' Wayne, Chief Keef, and A$AP Yams?\nBut what if Obama was still partaking in illicit and illegal substances?"}
