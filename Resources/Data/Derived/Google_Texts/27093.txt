BRENTWOOD, N.H. â€” A New Hampshire woman who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to forcing her two children to drink bleach will spend at least five years in a state psychiatric hospital.

Wendy Miller-Wright was charged last year with attempted murder. She admitted in court that she made the children drink the chemical in June 2013 at their home in Seabrook by telling them it was medicine.

Police say her 6-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter spit out most of the bleach and went to a neighbor for help.

Miller-Wright also drank bleach. Police say she was trying to kill herself and her children.

Miller-Wright has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was sentenced Friday.

The children are living with their father.
