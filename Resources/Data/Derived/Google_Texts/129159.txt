NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Colon cancer is 90 percent preventable, yet approximately 24 million Americans who should have a colonoscopy screening have not done so.

Medical experts recommend that men and women over 50 (45 for African Americans) get screened for colon cancer because they are at the highest risk of developing the disease, but an estimated 40 percent of at-risk individuals have not had a colonoscopy.

The question is: Why not?

StopColonCancerNow.com sponsored online market research of 1,100 at-risk participants – none of whom have had a colonoscopy. The study was split 45 percent and 55 percent between men and women, respectively.

The results revealed that the reasons for not getting a colonoscopy are varied, and no single reason dominates. But most participants cited one or two main reasons:

28 percent do not feel it is necessary

20.1 percent say it’s too expensive

20.1 percent dislike the procedure itself

15.8 percent rely on other methods to avoid colon cancer

6.5 percent do not know they are supposed to get one

6.5 percent are too busy with other priorities

According to the research, 16 percent (15.7) of all 50-65 year olds are not likely to ever get a colonoscopy. That leaves a lot of at-risk men and women open to the idea who perhaps just need better information to take action.

To dispel the myth that colonoscopies are unaffordable, StopColonCancerNow.com has created a digital quiz for consumers to understand their potential eligibility for a free or low cost screening colonoscopy under the Affordable Care Act.

Physicians agree colonoscopy is a vital screening tool. During a colonoscopy, precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they develop into cancer; it is the only colon cancer screening test that does this. Despite this evidence, 18.5 percent of respondents say that a significant reason they haven’t had a colonoscopy is that their doctor has never discussed the need for it with them.

The survey, conducted by research firm Mizzouri, also revealed that better prep methods could persuade 32.3 percent of people to schedule the procedure. And, contrary to popular belief, women are more reticent than men about having a colonoscopy.
