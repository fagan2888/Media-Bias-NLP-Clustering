Enrollment under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a little easier for some Cincinnati residents. On Monday, March 17 the "Countdown to Get Covered" bus tour made a stop in Cincinnati. The stop is part of a national campaign focused on encouraging people to sign up for health insurance.

The “Countdown to Get Covered” bus tour will be in Ohio until March 19 and will make stops in Dayton and Columbus before ending in Cleveland. The bus will appear at enrollment fairs, canvasses, phone banks, community events, and schools to rally volunteers and encourage people to enroll in ACA coverage.

The tour bus stopped Monday to participate in the “Pray for a Healthy Cincinnati” interfaith event held at Word of Deliverance Ministries. The event featured faith leaders including Sr. Sally Duffy, President and Executive Director of SC Ministry Foundation and Bishop Bobby Hilton from the Word of Deliverance Church encouraging residents to sign up for health care coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.

A group of elected officials, faith leaders, community partners, organizers, and volunteers manned the bus including Anne Filipic, Enroll America President and Trey Daly, Enroll America's State Director for Ohio.

Filipic, Daly, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Chicago Regional Director Kathleen Falk discussed the effort to sign-up people for health coverage on WVXU's Cincinnati Edition during the Cincinnati stop.

Current enrollment under ACA is two million short of the Obama administration's six million target. The tour is part of the final push to get people to sign up for coverage before the March 31 deadline.
