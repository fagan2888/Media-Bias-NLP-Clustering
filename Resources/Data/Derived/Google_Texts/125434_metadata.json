Her adoption agency, Bethany Christian Services, cautions that the process could take close to four years under Haiti\u2019s newly tightened procedures, but Sperling is undeterred.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been frustration that the government is moving so slow,\u201d she said. \u201cHave I ever wavered in my commitment? No, I have not.\u201d\n\nSperling, a 40-year-old school administrator from Orland Park, Illinois, started the process in November 2013 and is braced for a timetable that could stretch until mid-2017.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of patience, a lot of prayer,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to raise my kid with my husband, but I can definitely support a child even though it will be on my own.\u201d\n\nSperling has yet to visit Haiti, but says her interest in the country was kindled by the devastating earthquake in 2010 and reinforced by accounts she heard from fellow church members who did mission work there.\n\nIn Wauconda, Illinois, just 60 miles north of Sperling\u2019s home, two brothers from Haiti have settled in with their American parents, Jodi and David Mork, after an adoption completed through Bethany in January 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For some in US, adopting from Haiti becomes a vital mission", "title": "For some in US, adopting from Haiti becomes a vital mission", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For some in US, adopting from Haiti becomes a vital mission", "title": "For some in US, adopting from Haiti becomes a vital mission", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/11/for_some_in_us_adopting_from_haiti_becomes_a_vital_mission/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/haiti-adoptions-americans.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For some in US, adopting from Haiti becomes a vital mission", "title": "For some in US, adopting from Haiti becomes a vital mission", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/haiti-adoptions-americans.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Crary", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4262\"", "article_summary": "Now, nine years into widowhood, Jill Sperling is pursuing that dream with efforts to adopt a boy from the impoverished Caribbean nation of Haiti.\nHer adoption agency, Bethany Christian Services, cautions that the process could take close to four years under Haiti\u2019s newly tightened procedures, but Sperling is undeterred.\nIn Wauconda, Illinois, just 60 miles north of Sperling\u2019s home, two brothers from Haiti have settled in with their American parents, Jodi and David Mork, after an adoption completed through Bethany in January 2014.\n\u201cIt takes a lot of patience, a lot of prayer,\u201d she said.\nNo, I have not.\u201dSperling, a 40-year-old school administrator from Orland Park, Illinois, started the process in November 2013 and is braced for a timetable that could stretch until mid-2017."}
