So when a friend offered her a stun gun to protect herself, she took it.\n\nCaetano, who is homeless, never had to use it but now finds herself at the center of a contentious Second Amendment case headed to the highest court in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court is being asked to decide whether a state law that prohibits private citizens from possessing stun guns infringes on their right to keep and bear arms. In an unusual twist, the court is also being asked to examine whether the Second Amendment right to defend yourself in your own home applies in the case of a homeless person.\n\nArguments before the court are scheduled Tuesday.\n\nPolice found Caetano\u2019s stun gun in her purse during a shoplifting investigation at a supermarket in 2011. She told police she needed it to defend herself against her violent ex-boyfriend, against whom she had obtained multiple restraining orders.\n\nDuring her trial, Caetano, 32, testified that her ex-boyfriend repeatedly came to her workplace and threatened her. One night, she showed him the stun gun and he \u201cgot scared and left me alone,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was found guilty of violating the state law that bans private possession of stun guns, devices that deliver an electric shock when pressed against an attacker.\n\nIn her appeal, her lawyer, Benjamin Keehn, argues that a stun gun falls within the meaning of \u201carms\u201d under the Second Amendment. Keehn wrote in a legal brief that the state\u2019s ban \u201ccannot be squared with the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d He also argues that self-defense outside the home is part of the core right provided by the Second Amendment.\n\nMassachusetts is among only five states that ban stun guns and Tasers for private citizens, said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively about Second Amendment issues. The devices are used by law enforcement agencies around the country.\n\nA ban in Michigan was overturned in 2012 after the state appeals court ruled that a total prohibition was unconstitutional under the Second Amendment and the Michigan Constitution.\n\nVolokh said the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense \u201cnecessarily includes the right to do so outside one\u2019s home.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that the Second Amendment secures a right aimed in large part at self-defense, we have to recognize that often people need to defend themselves in public,\u201d Volokh said. \u201cSo it\u2019s especially important that people have some useful device that would be effective in defending themselves outside the home.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth Second Amendment, a Massachusetts-based group that filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, argued that stun guns are a \u201clogical option\u201d for people who do not want to use deadly force for self-defense.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, not everybody who has a need for self-defense would necessarily be comfortable carrying a firearm,\u201d said Brent Carlton, the group\u2019s president and co-founder.\n\nMiddlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan declined to comment on the case.\n\nIn a legal brief, prosecutors argue that the Second Amendment does not establish a constitutional right to own a stun gun and that two pivotal U.S. Supreme Court decisions that upheld the right to own a firearm for self-defense inside homes did not automatically grant that right outside the home.\n\n\u201cWhile homelessness is a serious problem all its own, the defendant has offered no authority to support the idea that a person without a home may carry a firearm wherever he or she may travel or otherwise exercise a Second Amendment right free from the limits that restrict that right for every other person otherwise situated,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Michael Kaneb wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jaime Caetano was beaten so badly by her ex-boyfriend that she ended up in the hospital.
