(The cases are being rolled together and heard in 90 minutes of oral argument, rather than the usual 60.) Before we lift up the robes to look for some data, here\u2019s a bit of background on the case.\n\nThe Case\n\nMore Politics\n\nThis suite of cases is a challenge to how the EPA regulates pollutants from power plants. Here\u2019s the question before the court: \u201cWhether the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities.\u201d\n\nEssentially, what the petitioners \u2014 mainly Republican-led states and industry groups \u2014 claim is that the EPA, unlawfully, did not perform the \u201ccost\u201d part of a cost-benefit analysis. In its petition for a writ of certiorari, the National Mining Association wrote, \u201cNo rational person would see spending $9.6 billion for $4-6 million in return as an appropriate exchange.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, the respondents \u2014 the federal government and some allied groups \u2014 argue that the EPA took costs into account properly. Specifically, they argue that the relevant statutes require taking costs into account when determining the precise level of regulation to bring down on a plant, but not when determining whether or not to regulate a plant in the first place. They also argue with the petitioners\u2019 calculations, citing huge potential benefits down the road from the elimination of toxic emissions like mercury.\n\nStepping back: Some see these cases as part of a series of cases that are meant to provoke the court\u2019s suspicion of the Obama administration\u2019s regulations. First on health care, now on environmental regulation, and perhaps in the near future on immigration.\n\nThe Combatants\n\nIt\u2019s a counsel clown car at the court for this case, with a quartet of combatants. Arguing for the petitioners are Aaron D. Lindstrom, Michigan\u2019s solicitor general, and F. William Brownell, a partner and Hunton & Williams. According to the Oyez Project, neither have argued before the Supreme Court before.\n\nFor the respondents, it\u2019s U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and Paul Smith, a partner at Jenner & Block. Verrilli last argued before the court earlier this month, and did quite well, according to court watchers. This will be his 41st appearance before the court. It will be Smith\u2019s 16th appearance. His record thus far: 7-7 (one case is excluded here as it was ruled that certiorari was improvidently granted).\n\nThe Role Of The Government\n\nVerrilli has been busy lately, and is arguing this case hot on the heels of his defense of Obamacare. He\u2019ll be arguing, of course, on behalf of the EPA, a federal government agency.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court Database, since 1946, petitioners (the EPA opponents, in this case) win 64 percent of the time. However, if the respondent is a federal government agency (the EPA, in this case), the respondent wins 54 percent of the time. Your federal government hard at work!\n\n(And if the petitioner is a federal government agency, it wins 77 percent of the time.)\n\nThe Predictions\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ll turn to two sources: the wisdom of the FantasySCOTUS crowd and the machine learning algorithm {Marshall}+. But they won\u2019t tell us too much \u2014 the predictors see the cases completely differently. As I write, the crowd views all three cases as likely affirms \u2014 wins for the EPA \u2014 including two 9-0 affirms. The algorithm, on the other hand, sees them all as reversals: 9-0, 9-0 and 7-2 losses for the EPA. In Michigan v. EPA, the two are diametrically opposed, predicting 9-0 votes in opposite directions.\n\nThe crowd predictions may change, and improve, however, after the court watchers have had a chance to dissect what happens in oral argument.
