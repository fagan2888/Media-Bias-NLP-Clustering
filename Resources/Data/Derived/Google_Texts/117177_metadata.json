The only way for insurers to make money was to avoid getting stuck with customers who would rack up high medical bills, forcing them to expend enormous time and expense to screen potential customers for preexisting conditions. Even people who could find plans with affordable premiums had to sign contracts loaded with fine-print exclusions leaving them responsible for unexpected costs. Obamacare overhauled that market, eliminating insurers\u2019 ability to screen out healthy customers. In the new, regulated individual markets, people buy plans regardless of their prior health status. This has been a godsend to those unable to obtain coverage before.\n\nRepublicans would repeal all these new protections. But never fear, conservatives insist. In their place will be new protections. Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in National Review, points to two protections put in place by Scott Walker\u2019s proposal, which is the prototypical Republican \u201csee, we do too have a plan to replace Obamacare\u201d plan.\n\nPonnuru mentions two protections. The first is a provision that would \u201cbar insurers from charging higher prices to sicker customers provided they had maintained continuous coverage.\u201d Republicans have taken to using this line a lot, because it sounds to the average person tuning in a lot like a promise to protect people with preexisting conditions, but the last six words are crucial. Maintaining continuous coverage is really hard. We know this because Congress passed a law in 1996 letting people who have employer-provided insurance keep their plan if they maintain continuous coverage. It has proven nearly useless. Maintaining continuous coverage is really hard for people who have financial distress, and it\u2019s harder if the insurance company has every incentive for you to miss a payment or fail to dot one of your i\u2019s or cross one of your t\u2019s, so they can kick you out. And, of course, in a market where insurers can charge higher prices to sicker customers, \u201cmaintaining continuous coverage\u201d means buying insurance that\u2019s really expensive and can deny you coverage for lots of treatments you need.\n\nThe second provision is high-risk pools. This is a special market for the customers with the most expensive medical needs. Many states have tried high-risk pools. They also work really, really badly. There are all sorts of practical barriers that make it hard to operate a special insurance system for people with the most expensive conditions. For instance, how do you determine eligibility? Tens of millions of Americans have something in their medical history that makes them a less than perfect risk, from the insurance company\u2019s standpoint. Where do you draw the cutoff for eligibility? And how do you keep insurance companies from skimming the high-risk pools, too \u2014 after all, they\u2019ll want to cover the least costly people in the high-risk pool, not the most costly ones.\n\nEven if it is possible to devise solutions to these problems, the biggest single impediment is that high-risk pools cost money. There\u2019s no magic secret in a high-risk pool that makes insurers able to sell affordable insurance to people who need lots of medical care. And where would Republicans get the money to finance the high-risk pools? They don\u2019t say. And they all have signed the Grover Norquist pledge that they will never raise taxes under any circumstances \u2014 even if aliens come to Earth and threaten to destroy humanity unless the president agrees to raise taxes by a single penny.\n\nThe funding problem is not ancillary. There\u2019s an old joke in which a chemist, a physicist, and an economist are trapped on a desert island, and some cans of food wash up onshore. The physicist devises a plan to smash open the cans. The chemist comes up with a plan to heat them open. And the economist says \u201cassume a can opener.\u201d This is the problem not just with the high-risk pools, but the Republican health-care plans as a whole. They assume the availability of funding, but the party is theologically opposed to raising revenue of any kind. Like having a can opener, if the Republicans were able to overcome their fanatical opposition to revenue, the problem wouldn't exist in the first place. Any reform that assumes Republicans will find a way to fund it is assuming a can opener. It\u2019s premised on a fantastical assumption. That is why, in the absence of some concrete way around the no-taxes-ever problem, a vague hand-waving promise can't be called a real plan.\n\n\n\nBefore Obamacare took effect, different measures were tried to reform America\u2019s cruel and dysfunctional individual health-care marketplace. The continuous-coverage protection and high-risk pools both failed. One thing that succeeded was tried in Massachusetts, by Mitt Romney. The Obama administration decided to build that model out nationally, and it has worked very well \u2014 premiums have actually come in well under projections. But since it was Obama\u2019s plan, Republicans oppose it. But since Obamacare is working, they need to have something they can say they\u2019ll replace it with, and they\u2019ve turned to the things that have already failed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Will Scott Walker really take care of people who depend on Obamacare?", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Will Scott Walker really take care of people who depend on Obamacare?", "title": "The Republican Plans to Replace Obamacare Have Been Tried, and They Failed", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/republican-plans-to-replace-obamacare-failed.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/21/21-scott-walker.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will Scott Walker really take care of people who depend on Obamacare?", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/21/21-scott-walker.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Republican Plans to Replace Obamacare Failed", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, campaign 2016, obamacare, scott walker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,campaign 2016,obamacare,scott walker", "published_time": "2015-08-21T16:17:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, campaign 2016, obamacare, scott walker", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "They also work really, really badly.\nRamesh Ponnuru, writing in National Review, points to two protections put in place by Scott Walker\u2019s proposal, which is the prototypical Republican \u201csee, we do too have a plan to replace Obamacare\u201d plan.\nAnd the economist says \u201cassume a can opener.\u201d This is the problem not just with the high-risk pools, but the Republican health-care plans as a whole.\nEven if it is possible to devise solutions to these problems, the biggest single impediment is that high-risk pools cost money.\nThe continuous-coverage protection and high-risk pools both failed."}
