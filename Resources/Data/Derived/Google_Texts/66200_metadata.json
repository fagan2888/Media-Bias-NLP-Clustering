DJ LeMahieu opened the inning by singling to right.\n\nColorado\u2019s second consecutive victory over the Dodgers prevented the Dodgers from inching closer to clinching their 14th National League West title. Los Angeles\u2019 magic number remained at two as it looks to close out San Francisco in the division race.\n\nIf Saturday\u2019s magic moment belonged to CarGo, whose game-winner was his 39th homer of the season, the night belonged to the incomparable Nolan Arenado, who launched his 40th homer in grand style.\n\nAt game\u2019s end, Arenado waited for CarGo in the mosh pit at home plate and gave him a bear hug.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a lot of fun together,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough late in the season when you know you\u2019re not going anywhere and you are playing games against teams that are (headed to the playoffs).\n\n\u201cBut I keep telling Nolan, \u2018Whatever happens, just continue to fight, because you are having a special year.\u2019 It\u2019s the same thing for me.\u201d\n\nArenado and CarGo are indeed on the verge of something memorable. The last time the Rockies had two or more players hit 40 home runs in the same season was in 1997 when Larry Walker hit 49, Andres Galarraga 41 and Vinny Castilla 40.\n\nArenado began his night with a teaser.\n\nIn the Dodgers\u2019 first at-bat, the Rockies lined up in an extreme shift to the right side of the infield for the left-handed hitting Chase Utley, leaving Arenado all by his lonesome on the left side. No matter. Arenado glided toward second base, vacuumed Utley\u2019s grounder, did a 360-degree turn and threw Utley out by half a step to end the inning.\n\nArenado\u2019s second act would have been the show-stopper, had it not been trumped by CarGo\u2019s game-winner.\n\nArenado, 24, stepped to the plate with the bases full in the first inning and sent left-hander Brett Anderson\u2019s 2-2, 94 mph fastball over the center-field wall for the third grand slam of his young career.\n\nThe slam made him the seventh Rockies player to hit the big 4-O, the first since Todd Helton pulled off the feat in 2001.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, pretty special,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy to get it out of the way, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAdded manager Walt Weiss: \u201cThere\u2019s not much more to say. Nolan just keeps adding to his unbelievable season.\u201d\n\nArenado also became the first Rockies player to hit 40 home runs since the humidor was installed in 2002. And while critics will howl about the Coors Field effect, 21 of Arenado\u2019s 40 homers have come on the road.\n\n\u201cIt feels good, because I can hit on the road, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that people question that about players here sometimes.\u201d\n\nArenado, in line for his third consecutive Gold Glove, leads the National League with 121 RBIs. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, only one major-league third baseman has led his league in RBIs, won a Gold Glove and hit 40 or more homers in the same season. That would be Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt, who hit 48 homers and drove in 121 runs for the 1980 Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\u201cThat would be pretty cool. Pretty awesome, to join that kind of company,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Mike Schmidt.\u201d\n\nAdding to the Rockies\u2019 16-hit onslaught was a 4-for-4 night by Justin Morneau, his most hits since getting four on Sept. 6, 2014 vs. San Diego.\n\nStruggling starter Kyle Kendrick, whose one-year, $5.5 million contract is nearing its end, pitched like he\u2019s always pitched at Coors Field this season. Badly.\n\nHe struggled through five-plus innings and frittered away the Rockies\u2019 early leads. In his final game on the Coors Field mound in a Rockies uniform, Kendrick gave up six runs on seven hits, including a two-run homer in the second to Andre Ethier.\n\nIt was the 33rd homer served up by Kendrick, the most in the majors. Twenty-one of those home runs came at Coors, where Kendrick finished 2-6 with a 7.62 ERA in 13 starts.\n\nKendrick has pitched five innings or fewer in nine consecutive starts, the longest streak for a Rockies pitcher since Alex White had nine such starts from Aug. 7 to Sept. 16, 2013.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 bullpen bailed Kendrick out, pitching four scoreless innings to set up the victory.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carlos Gonzalez hits a two-run walk-off home run to beat the Dodgers", "title": "Carlos Gonzalez hits a two-run walk-off home run to beat the Dodgers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/carlos-gonzalez-hits-a-two-run-walk-off-home-run-to-beat-the-dodgers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__Carlos-Gonzalezp1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__Carlos-Gonzalezp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T21:26:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:17:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Carlos Gonzalez launched a two-run, walk-off homer off Yimi Garcia in the ninth inning, lifting the Rockies to an 8-6 victory.\nColorado\u2019s second consecutive victory over the Dodgers prevented the Dodgers from inching closer to clinching their 14th National League West title.\nTwenty-one of those home runs came at Coors, where Kendrick finished 2-6 with a 7.62 ERA in 13 starts.\nAt game\u2019s end, Arenado waited for CarGo in the mosh pit at home plate and gave him a bear hug.\nThe Rockies\u2019 dynamic duo left the mighty Dodgers feeling mighty blue Saturday night at Coors Field."}
