While many scenes featuring \u201cRichard Parker,\u201d the Bengal tiger who shares a lifeboat with a boy lost at sea, were created using CGI technology, King, very much a real animal, was employed when the digital version wouldn\u2019t suffice. \u201cThis one take with him just went really bad and he got lost trying to swim to the side,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cDamn near drowned.\u201d King\u2019s trainer eventually snagged him with a catch rope and dragged him to one side of the tank, where he scrambled out to safety. \u201cI think this goes without saying but DON\u2019T MENTION IT TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE!\u201d Johnson continued in the email, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI have downplayed the f\u2014 out of it.\u201d\n\nUniversal Music Group\n\nVulture\n\nKanye, Kim, and the 'New Uncanny'\n\nJerry Saltz\n\nWhen performers like Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga, and, yes, Jeff Koons and Marina Abramovic try so hard to showcase and communicate how sincere they are, instead they reveal how out-of-touch they are \u2014 from each other, from themselves, from us. These are not just famous performers; they are performers of fame. In their grandiose sincerity, their attempt to keep it real (West says his \"passion is for humanity\" and that his art is totally about \"beauty, truth, awesomeness\"), these stars become alien things, automata, odd gods before our eyes. By some bizarre alchemy, they then toggle back into demented sincerity while simultaneously remaining alien, other, apart. They become psychological quantum particles, in two states at once. Sincerity and fame combine, float free of common rules. \"Bound 2\" represents a psychological fissure whereby stars gives us exactly what we ask of them \u2014 a glimpse into their inner selves \u2014 and then are shunned and mocked for it. They're sacred cows and sacrificial lambs at the same time. Just as the Rodney King video included in the 1993 Whitney Biennial, \u201cBound 2\u201d should be in the upcoming one, representing a bend of cultural nature. Columbia Grantland\n\nOne Direction Should Not Be Ignored\n\nSteven Hyden It's true that the majority of Midnight Memories sounds very much like another widget produced by a massive machine that's been programmed to wring One Direction dry before the inevitable Jonas slide sets in. As a stock \"maturity\" stab \u2014 remember, these memories have been reserved strictly for after dark \u2014 it's heavy with ballads in the mold of \"Story of My Life,\" a jaunty, finger-picked ditty with a blindingly shiny chorus. Then there are the two aforementioned pretty good classicist pop-rock tracks \u2014 \"Best Song Ever\" nicks its crashing electric guitar riff from the Who's \"Baba O'Riley,\" and the title track gamely grafts the pretty-boy New Wave of Rick Springfield's Working Class Dog onto an \"I Love Rock-n-Roll\" beat. This leaves \"Little Black Dress,\" which basically justifies the whole enterprise. Look, I didn't expect to find one of the year's best rock songs on a One Direction album, but I guess it's just been that kind of weird year. \"Little Black Dress\" is a perfect little two-and-a-half-minute power-pop tune. Again, let's look at the facts: The guitars career loudly yet melodically, like they were sampled from a late '90s Sloan record. The drums are as big and dumb as Peter Criss's cranium. The phrase \"it's so right\" appears as an infectious chant exactly 15 times, in the style of \"She Loves You\" or \"Surrender,\" and immediately rings inside your head another 257 times. \"Little Black Dress\" is a prime example of what used to be known as \"bubblegum\" music, which Lester Bangs defined as \"the basic sound of rock and roll \u2014 minus the rage, fear, violence, and anomie.\" That's \"Little Black Dress,\" all right: It sounds like Big Star trying to re-create its own version of the Raspberries' \"Tonight\" and getting reasonably close. I have no clue whether a song like this can be a hit in 2013, but I know a few forty-ish-year-old record collectors who would love it.
