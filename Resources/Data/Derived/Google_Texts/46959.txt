This week, For the Record examines health care and health insurance and finds that they may not be as closely related as you’ve been led to believe.

While the Affordable Care Act has forced millions of Americans to buy health insurance that covers basic treatments like birth control, a growing number of physicians and nurse practitioners are going an entirely different direction: They’re cutting insurance out of their practices entirely.

The number of so-called “concierge” practices in the U.S. jumped more than 500 percent from 2010 to 2012 and has continued to grow.

In this week’s “Producer’s Notebook” podcast, For the Record executive producer Joe Weasel talks to Dr. James Pinckney, who started one of those practices. Diamond Physicians in Dallas offers clients unlimited visits and 24/7 access to care for a fixed monthly membership fee. Everything is paid in cash, which saves the practice massive amounts of time and money.

You can listen to the podcast below or on the For the Record Soundcloud stream.

“Cashcare: Exposing the Middleman” airs Wednesday, March 4 at 8:00 p.m. ET on TheBlaze TV.
