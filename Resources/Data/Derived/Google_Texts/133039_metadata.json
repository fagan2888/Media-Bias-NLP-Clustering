( Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images )\n\nAt California\u2019s five state psychiatric hospitals, patients are mostly criminal defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial. They\u2019ve been sent to these institutions for psychiatric care. But sometimes the patients can be violent.\n\nFive years ago this week, a staff member was murdered by a patient at Napa State Hospital. In the time since, the hospital has tried to improve safety. While the majority of patients are not violent, sometimes those who are target not just staff, but other patients as well.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s rare for members of the media to gain access to the hospital, I was invited by Frank and Barbara Brackin to join them in visiting their 45-year-old son, Shawn, who has been a patient at Napa State for nearly 20 years. I met up with Shawn\u2019s parents in the parking lot.\n\n\u201cSometimes he says he can\u2019t sleep when he\u2019s expecting a visit because he\u2019s so excited,\u201d Barbara Brackin tells me as we walk to the hospital\u2019s front door.\n\n\u201cOur main concern now is for Shawn\u2019s safety,\u201d her husband says. \u201cHe was not given the death sentence, (but) he\u2019s almost had it twice in the past three years,\u201d Frank adds, in reference to assaults Shawn has suffered at the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter passing through a number of locked gates and surrendering our driver\u2019s licenses, we pass through several locked doors and then a metal detector, where we also surrender our cellphones and wallets.\n\nAt last, we\u2019re ushered into a tiny room to visit with Shawn Brackin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you,\u201d he says, shuffling toward us with difficulty. He\u2019s wearing a blue helmet to protect his head in case he falls \u2014 which happens somewhat frequently \u2014 or is pushed.\n\nShawn wasn\u2019t always in this condition, his parents had explained to me earlier. His life took a bad turn at age 6, when he was struck by a car and had a severe head injury. That accident began a slow descent that ended in tragedy.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Shawn became increasingly depressed and withdrawn. In 1995, he took a small gun and walked into a local police station.\n\nFrank Brackin says that was an attempt at \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was wanting to die,\u201d Frank Brackin says. \u201cAnd so he put himself before the firing squad, and he had no idea the firing squad would turn on themselves.\u201d\n\nOn that day, when he was 25 years old, Shawn was shot by police but survived. In the mayhem, an officer shot and killed another cop.\n\nShawn Brackin was charged with six felonies. As part of a plea deal, he was found \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d And that plea \u2014 with its diagnosis of mental illness \u2014 is what led him to Napa State Hospital.\n\n\u201cWe had no choice, really,\u201d Shawn\u2019s father says. \u201cWe wanted to protect him and make sure he had a safe environment. We thought a hospital would be a safe environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut over the years, Shawn Brackin has been assaulted by several patients. Last year he suffered a particularly brutal assault when a patient turned on him.\n\n\u201cAnd he slammed Shawn into the wall so hard that it buried his head into the wall and left hair in the wall,\u201d Frank Brackin says. \u201cAnd then he hit him. And then Shawn hit that concrete floor.\u201d\n\nShawn needed emergency brain surgery. He was left with severe disabilities.\n\nThe day I visited Shawn, his hair was damp from sweat. It was a hot day in Napa, and the tiny room had no air conditioning or ventilation. I ask him if feels he\u2019s gotten well while at the hospital, if he thinks he\u2019s better off for having been sent there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better off,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good right now.\u201d\n\nBut his mother says things are not good. Before he entered the state hospital system, Shawn was able to drive and hold a job, Barbara Brackin says.\n\n\u201cHe interacted with the family, laughed and joked, played cards. And he was the Uno champ,\u201d she says, and laughs. \u201cNobody else could usually beat him.\u201d\n\nToward the end of our 45-minute visit, Frank Brackin reads a Bible verse, and then they say their goodbyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll visit you again on Sunday, Shawn,\u201d Frank says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have time to play some cards if you want. I love you. You\u2019re my main man, you know?\n\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d Shawn says.\n\nThe latest assault on Shawn Brackin was just one of 1,800 at Napa State Hospital last year. To be fair, most of those assaults are very minor.\n\nWhile the Brackins don\u2019t dismiss what their son did 20 years ago in that police station, they feel he\u2019s had to pay too high a price and have filed a lawsuit against the hospital, alleging negligence in failing to keep their son safe.\n\nNapa has made many changes since psychiatric technician Donna Gross was murdered by a patient five years ago, but mostly those changes are intended to protect staff. While a new law took effect in July that will allow the hospital to isolate the most dangerous patients, hospital Executive Director Dolly Matteucci says more needs to be done.\n\n\u201cWe have made tremendous progress in safety improvements and in mitigating violence at the hospital,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut sadly it continues to be a part of our environment and our shared experience as patients and employees. And it is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all families are critical of Napa. Many say they enjoy the visits with their loved ones \u2014 who they say are finally getting the kind of treatment they should have gotten before the tragedy that sent them there happened.\n\nCandace and Hans \u2014 they\u2019ve asked that we just use their first names to protect their privacy \u2014 say their son has been at Napa for 3\u00bd years. At their request, we\u2019re not using his name.\n\nI met with them in their home in Alameda, where Hans showed me his son\u2019s high school trophies from basketball and football.\n\n\u201cHe loved fishing, so we have pictures of him catching a 32-pound salmon,\u201d says Hans.\n\nCandace says that when their son was in high school, he started changing.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t organize his homework. He couldn\u2019t turn in assignments,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he was becoming very quiet around the house, and also talked about feeling spirits and things around him.\u201d\n\nIt was the early signs of schizophrenia. The symptoms got worse, and his behavior escalated. Hans and Candace were so worried their son would hurt himself or someone else that they had him confined against his will.\n\n\u201cWhen police come into the house and handcuff your kid and take him out of the house, in the same house he grew up in sprawled across the floor, it\u2019s quite an experience,\u201d she says.\n\nThey called the police many times, but authorities could not hold him indefinitely, so he was always released. Candace and Hans tried repeatedly to get their son psychiatric help, but as an adult he had the right to refuse treatment.\n\nFinally, in 2012 while suffering delusions, their son killed someone in the Berkeley Hills.\n\nHe was found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to Napa State Hospital, where his mother says he is slowly getting better.\n\n\u201cIt has taken this long to see real results of recovery,\u201d she says, \u201cin little bits and pieces along the way. It was only because of the sustained treatment we had through Napa.\u201d\n\nDespite the complaints and problems at California\u2019s state mental hospitals, there\u2019s a long waiting list to get into them \u2014 and many of those waiting spend their time in jail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For one family, a son's safety was compromised in an attack at the psychiatric facility.
