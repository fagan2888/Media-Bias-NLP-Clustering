Besieged with a wave of laws restricting reproductive freedoms, defeats on fair pay legislation, and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to exempt employers from providing contraceptive coverage, women have been playing defense for too long.\n\nThankfully, that tide is turning, and Colorado is playing a leading role in a growing women\u2019s movement to take the offensive on protecting their reproductive rights.\n\nGrowing up with increasing access to education and jobs, today\u2019s generation of women took for granted many of the freedoms our mothers and grandmothers won for us in the 1960s and 70s. The Equal Pay Act in 1963 and the Civil Rights Act in 1964 banned gender discrimination in the workplace. But laws forbidding women to prevent conception (such as in Connecticut and seven other states) still made it difficult for women to enter the workforce.\n\nLandmark Supreme Court decisions in 1965 and 1973 dramatically changed women\u2019s economic prospects by upholding their right to use birth control and have safe and legal abortions. With the ability to control their childbearing decisions, women flooded the workforce, and began to pursue advanced degrees that opened doors to careers in medicine, law, and business.\n\nToday, women vote in greater numbers, control some 75 percent of household purchases, and hold the majority of college degrees. Individually, we exercise our rights to control our bodies, our families, and our careers. But collectively, we lack strength when those rights are threatened.\n\nWith just 19 percent of the seats in Congress, five governorships and a third of the Supreme Court, women still lack political power. That became painfully clear when conservatives swept the mid-term elections in 2010. Since then, state legislatures have passed over 200 anti-abortion restrictions \u2014 more than the previous 10 years combined.\n\nInundated by the wave of attacks, and underrepresented in the political arena, women began to play defense by staging protests on the steps of statehouses across the country, and fighting to block the offensive laws in court. But the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Hobby Lobby decision reminded women that we\u2019re outnumbered in the judiciary branch as well, with all three female justices strongly dissenting from a majority opinion penned by five men.\n\nIronically, it was one of those five male justices who pointed the way for women to fight back. In 2010, Justice Antonin Scalia said the Constitution doesn\u2019t guarantee equal rights for women. \u201cIf the current society wants to outlaw sex discrimination, hey, we have legislatures,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, women\u2019s advocates took his cue, and decided to get more proactive in the legislative arena. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which bans restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive health care that aren\u2019t medically necessary, and wouldn\u2019t be required to obtain comparable medical procedures \u2014 such as invasive ultrasounds and waiting periods that assume patients can\u2019t make up their own minds. Or building requirements for wider hallways and bigger janitors\u2019 closets aimed at shutting down clinics.\n\nIn April, Colorado lawmakers withdrew a similar bill, the Reproductive Health Freedom Act, which would have proactively safeguarded women\u2019s reproductive rights from similar attacks by state and local governments. Faced with a heated battle in the final weeks of the legislative session, the bill could be reintroduced in the next term.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate also voted on the so-called \u201cNot Your Boss\u2019 Business Act\u201d to nullify the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision, stating that no federal law can exempt employers from complying with Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nCo-sponsored by Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, with a similar version sponsored by Rep. Diana DeGette in the House, the bill lost by just four votes. after Majority Leader Harry Reid switched to a \u201cno\u201d vote that will allow him to reintroduce the bill at a later time.\n\nIn April, the Paycheck Fairness Act was defeated in the Senate by seven votes \u2013 a reminder of how critical women\u2019s votes will be in the upcoming midterm elections that will determine who will continue to fight for us in Congress and our statehouses.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about a woman\u2019s uterus. But having a uterus shouldn\u2019t prevent women from being able to participate equally in the workforce and support our families. It\u2019s time to play offense to make sure our daughters can do the same.\n\nLisa Wirthman of Highlands Ranch is a monthly columnist for The Denver Post.
