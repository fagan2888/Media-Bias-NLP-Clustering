Instead it uses the funding to offer subsidies on the private health care market. It eliminates most copays and reduces premium costs for those that would have been eligible under the federal Medicaid expansion. The proposal also requires enrollees to fulfill work search requirements and engage in health measures, including regular physical exams.\n\nHealthyPA was proposed back in September, but the Corbett administration announced this week that it is formally moving forward with the plan by filing Waiver 1115 with the federal Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe plan has been met with popular approval. The American Cancer Society surveyed Pennsylvanians and asked respondents whether they supported a HealthyPA type plan or the Medicaid expansion as a combined option, or opposed to both. Support for any sort of expansion in access to subsidized health insurance was 65% to 25% in favor.\n\nBut Democrats contends the plan will not adequately provide coverage for the targeted population. His 8 would-be opponents have all criticized the move.\n\nThe state party accused Corbett of rejecting a Medicaid expansion entirely.\n\n\u201cCorbettcare is an out-of-touch health care plan that focuses more on playing politics than providing quality, affordable health insurance to all Pennsylvanians. Corbett\u2019s proposal will reduce benefits, create obstacles, and increase costs for the the Commonwealth\u2019s most-vulnerable,\u201d PA Dems spokesman Marc Eisenstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised considering Governor Corbett\u2019s record on health care. He has kicked 90,000 children off of Medicaid, expelled 40,000 Pennsylvanians off of adultBasic, and slashed $84 million dollars from social services funding.\u201d\n\nWhile Corbett\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t expand Medicaid, it does accept federal funds and provide subsidies for individuals and families living in poverty.\n\nPennsylvania Health Access Network released a statement that supported the plan, but condemned its timeline; the Corbett proposal doesn\u2019t take effect until January 2015. PHAN is a statewide coalition of groups interested in reforming the private insurance provider system to expand care to the uninsured and keep medical costs affordable.\n\n\u201cExpanding coverage right away will not only protect hundreds of thousands of low-income Pennsylvanians who will finally have access to stable, affordable health coverage, it will also generate $522 million in state budget savings in 2014 and keep us on track to create 35,000 new, good-paying jobs across the Commonwealth,\u201d PHAN Director Antoinette Kraus said. \u201cDelaying by a year will mean much needed revenue to our state lost and another year Pennsylvanians will be forced to gamble with their economic and physical health.\u201d\n\nDecember 6th, 2013 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Governor, Top Stories | 8 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Corbett administration filed its Medicaid expansion waiver plan with the Department Health and Human Services, but Democrats are unhappy with the plan.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/corbett-officially-asks-obama-admin-for-hybrid-medicaid-expansion/53453/", "description": "The Corbett administration filed its Medicaid expansion waiver plan with the Department Health and Human Services, but Democrats are unhappy with the plan.", "title": "Corbett Officially Asks Obama Admin for Hybrid Medicaid Expansion"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "corbett,medicaid,pa dems,hhs,phan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a10\"", "article_summary": "It eliminates most copays and reduces premium costs for those that would have been eligible under the federal Medicaid expansion.\nCorbett Officially Asks Obama Admin for Hybrid Medicaid ExpansionWritten by Brittany Foster, Deputy EditorInstead of accepting the federal Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or rejecting it outright, Governor Tom Corbett officially moved forward on a hybrid plan Friday that unsurprisingly, Democrats don\u2019t like.\nInstead it uses the funding to offer subsidies on the private health care market.\nThe state party accused Corbett of rejecting a Medicaid expansion entirely.\n\u201cCorbettcare is an out-of-touch health care plan that focuses more on playing politics than providing quality, affordable health insurance to all Pennsylvanians."}
