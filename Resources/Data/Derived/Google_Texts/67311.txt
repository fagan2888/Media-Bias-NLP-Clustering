“Duck Dynasty” star Willie Robertson says he’d “love” to see Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) make a 2016 White House bid.

“He’s young, but he’s got the values. I think he’s got, you know, the intelligence to do it and I’d love to see him run and I’d love for him to get in the mix,” Robertson told Fox News Radio in a recent interview.

When asked by host Brian Kilmeade if Robertson considers Jindal — who has not officially thrown his hat in the GOP ring — “your man,” the cammo-loving reality television star replies, “It is, if he chooses to run. He hasn’t decided yet. Bobby is a great man, he’s a godly man.”

Robertson added of the term-limited governor: “If he chooses to go on, I know the values he has. I’m the kind of guy where I really like smart people because I’m a guy who hires a lot of smart people. I don’t feel like I’m the smartest guy, but I have a lot of smart people with me. And that guy’s one of the smartest guys I’ve met in my life.”
