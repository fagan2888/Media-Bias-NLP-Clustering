President Bill Clinton had a number of press conferences where he had to put on his best face and lie to the American people\u2014the most infamous being his 1998 \"I didn't have sexual relations with that woman\" press conference about Monica Lewinsky, a woman he did, in fact, have sexual relations with.\n\nHillary Clinton has a new addition to her collection of dubious press conferences after giving this answer to a question from Ed Henry about who wiped the server that stored Clinton's emails and for which Clinton was responsible. Watch below:\n\nCovering the Lewinsky scandal in 1998 for U.S. News & World Report, Ronald Brownstein and Kenneth Walsh started their report thus: \"In some ways, Bill Clinton's career in national politics amounts to a sustained test of public tolerance for ethical controversy.
