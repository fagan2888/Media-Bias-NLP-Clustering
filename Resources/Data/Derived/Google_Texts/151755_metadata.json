Johnson gave one of the most memorable speeches by a United States president, calling on Congress to enact a voting rights bill by invoking the cry of the civil rights movement: \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nThe Voting Rights Act passed a little more than four months later, dramatically changing politics in the American South. Yet there remains a debate over whether it transformed the politics of race. There are powerful reasons for optimism. An African-American is president; that was unthinkable just two decades ago.\n\nThe despicable denial of the basic right to vote has largely ended. Black citizens are registering and voting in impressive numbers.\n\nIn 1965, there hadn\u2019t been a black United States senator since Reconstruction. There have been seven since, including the two who serve today: Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, and Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. When Johnson delivered his speech, there were only five blacks in the House of Representatives; now there are 44.\n\nAt the local level, the numbers are striking: There are more than 3,000 black elected officials in the states of the old Confederacy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same time, the multitude of ugly incidents in recent months demonstrates that there remains an appalling underside to American race relations. America is politically polarized, yet some of the opposition to President Obama seems driven, in part, by race. One conservative Republican senator told me recently that his rank and file\u2019s hatred of Mr. Obama is so intense and irrational that he found it frightening. (This politician opposes the administration about 80 percent of the time.)\n\nThe birther issue \u2014 the insane charges that Mr. Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States and thus wasn\u2019t eligible for the presidency \u2014 was demonstrably motivated by race. For all the venom directed at Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, no one suggested that they weren\u2019t born in America.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to read racial undertones when the former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said last month that \u201cI do not believe that the president loves America.\u201d At a gathering of business executives and Republicans, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Obama \u201cwasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.\u201d\n\nAnd electoral gains by blacks in the South have come at a price: the election of many more right-wing Republicans. Blacks and Republicans have often negotiated redistricting deals that created a predominately black district, along with several Republican-oriented ones.\n\nThere are 19 black members of the House who represent districts in the 11 states of the Confederacy; there were none when the Voting Rights Act passed. Of the 129 total districts, 92 are represented by Republicans. In most of the South, moderates of either party seem extinct.\n\nOn the economic issues of import to many blacks, the Southern delegation in the House is more conservative than in 1965.\n\nIn 1965, more than 40 percent of the white Democratic members from the Southern states voted for Medicare as did four of the 16 Republicans. In 2010, almost 70 percent of Southern representatives voted against the Affordable Care Act. The health care law also gave states the option to adopt a federally financed expansion of Medicaid, which disproportionately helps blacks. Eight of the 11 Southern states, all but one with Republican governors, have rejected expansion. Arkansas accepted the plan, and it is under consideration in two others.\n\nWhen Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, he reportedly told confidants that Democrats would lose the South for a generation. He knew more black political involvement would engender a white backlash. He didn\u2019t know these new Republicans would be so conservative.\n\nThe civil rights movement broke down economic and social barriers and ushered in new opportunities for black Americans.
