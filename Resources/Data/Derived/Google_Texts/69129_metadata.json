A ruling based on standing, he said, \u201cwould wipe the slate clean, so the program could be considered in the future by a full Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s plan would allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents to apply for a program shielding them from deportation and allowing them to work legally. In the short term, a ruling to dismiss the case on standing grounds would at least temporarily save the plan.\n\nA tie vote, on the other hand, would leave in place an injunction blocking the plan and probably deny Mr. Obama any chance of resurrecting it.\n\nThe case, United States v. Texas, No. 15-674, was brought by Texas and 25 other states, which say the plan went beyond what Congress had authorized. Lower courts have sided with Texas.\n\nThe trial judge ruled that the Obama administration should have given notice of the plan and sought public comments on its new program. The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one: The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court asked the parties to address the even broader question of whether Mr. Obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation\u2019s laws. But the court must first address whether Texas has suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cChief Justice Roberts will be very skeptical of Texas\u2019s standing claims,\u201d said Tara Leigh Grove, a professor of law at William & Mary and the author of an article on lawsuits by states against the federal government to be published next month in The Cornell Law Review.\n\nKen Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, said his state had brought the case to settle fundamental questions about presidential power.\n\n\u201cOur goal really was pretty basic: defend the Constitution and stop President Obama\u2019s lawlessness,\u201d he said.\n\nA White House spokeswoman declined to comment. In court papers, the administration has defended its plan as lawful, humane and valuable.\n\nA ruling based on standing would sidestep all of those issues. Even lawyers who believe that Texas has demonstrated that it has standing say they are not sure how the chief justice will vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the chief justice is not a fan of expansive standing doctrine,\u201d said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who filed a brief supporting Texas on the standing issue.\n\nProfessor Adler, who was an architect of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s nationwide tax subsidies that the Supreme Court rejected last year in a majority opinion from Chief Justice Roberts, added that there was a second reason to worry about the chief justice\u2019s vote in the Texas case.\n\n\u201cWays of disposing of cases without addressing the merits do become more attractive on an eight-member court,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTexas says it has standing to sue based on the budget shortfalls it would sustain if many unauthorized immigrants applied for driver\u2019s licenses. The state sets fees for driver\u2019s licenses below what they cost and ties eligibility for them to federal determinations about who is lawfully present in the country.\n\n\u201cOur standing argument is based on the cost of driver\u2019s licenses, which is obviously not part of our budget at this point,\u201d said Mr. Paxton. \u201cThe Legislature meets only every other year, and they put together a budget and all of the driver\u2019s licenses come out of the budget, and there\u2019s no money for it. So our standing is based on that cost.\u201d\n\nExperts on standing law have sharply differing views about whether the cost of driver\u2019s licenses, a consequence of the state\u2019s own choices about fees and eligibility, can confer standing. \u201cSuch self-imposed \u2018injury\u2019 has never provided a ticket to federal court,\u201d Walter Dellinger, a former acting United States solicitor general in the Clinton administration, wrote in a supporting brief. Chief Justice Roberts cited Mr. Dellinger\u2019s views on standing in an opinion in an earlier case.\n\nErnest A. Young, a law professor at Duke who filed a supporting brief for Texas, said the state has plainly been injured. \u201cAll one has to accept for Texas to have standing,\u201d he said, \u201cis that governments have interests in administering their own legal regimes, and that because these legal regimes are intertwined with federal law in various ways, federal actions often do affect state public administration in a cognizable way.\u201d\n\nChief Justice Roberts wrote a sharp dissent in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, a 5-to-4 decision in 2007 that said Massachusetts had standing to challenge the Bush administration\u2019s decision not to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. Relaxing standing requirements \u201cbecause asserted injuries are pressed by a state,\u201d the chief justice wrote, \u201chas no basis in our jurisprudence.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ctrue goal for this litigation may be more symbolic than anything else,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe constitutional role of the courts, however, is to decide concrete cases \u2014 not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates.\u201d\n\nStanding is a neutral legal principle that applies to the right and left alike, he wrote in an influential 1993 law review article.\n\n\u201cIt restricts the right of conservative public interest groups to challenge liberal agency action or inaction,\u201d he wrote, \u201cjust as it restricts the right of liberal public interest groups to challenge conservative agency action or inaction.\u201d\n\nMr. Dellinger said a rigorous approach to standing was consistent with Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s statement at his confirmation hearings that judges should aspire to be umpires, whose only job is to call balls and strikes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBefore any judge begins calling balls and strikes,\u201d Mr. Dellinger said, \u201che must first make sure the batter at the plate is an actual player and not just a fan who ran on the field.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160417200149, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives are worried that Chief Justice John G.
