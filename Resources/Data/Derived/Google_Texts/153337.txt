The opposition from within House GOP ranks is easy to explain: Conservatives want to put up a tougher fight with Obama over his executive order ending the deportation threat for millions of undocumented immigrants.

Conservatives fear that the Senate will ignore a pending House GOP bill — introduced by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) — that says Obama cannot exempt groups of people from deportation, which would allow his executive order to stand unchallenged. Boehner and other party leaders had hoped to use the Yoho bill to mollify conservatives, while quickly passing a funding bill to take a shutdown out of the equation, while keeping a tight leash on DHS funding. But many conservatives think a three-month extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security is too long. There are a good number of Republican hard-liners who want to fight in the early days of their new majority.
