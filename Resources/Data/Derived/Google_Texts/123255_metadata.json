Some media reports have said the company would be taking over the locations and expanding.\n\nThe claims are the latest in a four-month court battle that began with each side accusing the other of unfair practices. The Baernses say they were materially misled into thinking the stores would be easily profitable when they were not; Steak \u2018n Shake says the family ignored uniform pricing requirements intentionally overcharged customers.\n\nThe 40-page document filed Monday is in answer to Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s original July lawsuit that seeks to permanently sever the ties between the popular eatery and the Baerns family, who bought the state\u2019s first two locations in September 2012.\n\nU.S. District Judge Raymond Moore last week granted the company\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the family to stop operating the restaurants as Steak \u2018n Shakes. He also ordered the Baernses to remove any identifiers of the chain from the property. Moore did allow the Baernses to run a competing eatery, although both locations remain adorned with Steak \u2018n Shake signage and are closed.\n\nThe Baernses and their attorneys did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday; attorneys for Steak \u2018n Shake also did not return calls.\n\nThe countersuit also seeks to stop Steak \u2018n Shake from granting potentially profitable development rights in the Denver market, which the Baernses controlled before the judge\u2019s order. It also seeks treble damages, allowed under claims asserting violation of the state\u2019s Consumer Protection Act.\n\nNo hearing date has been set for the latest accusations.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Steak \u2018n Shake franchisees say corporate scuttled deal to sell", "title": "Steak \u2018n Shake franchisees say corporate scuttled deal to sell", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/10/steak-n-shake-franchisees-say-corporate-scuttled-deal-to-sell/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130904__Sept_Steak_n_shakep1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130904__Sept_Steak_n_shakep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T12:03:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:19:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf0c\"", "article_summary": "The Baernses and their attorneys did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday; attorneys for Steak \u2018n Shake also did not return calls.\nMoore did allow the Baernses to run a competing eatery, although both locations remain adorned with Steak \u2018n Shake signage and are closed.\nThe countersuit also seeks to stop Steak \u2018n Shake from granting potentially profitable development rights in the Denver market, which the Baernses controlled before the judge\u2019s order.\nThe Baernses say they were materially misled into thinking the stores would be easily profitable when they were not; Steak \u2018n Shake says the family ignored uniform pricing requirements intentionally overcharged customers.\nU.S. District Judge Raymond Moore last week granted the company\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the family to stop operating the restaurants as Steak \u2018n Shakes."}
