So am I. The good news is that states will bring more competition to a defined contribution industry that badly needs it. But if that competition exists on a less-than-level playing field, it starts to feel like a government subsidy, with the attendant unintended consequences, that tend to always be bad and the intended consequences that are far from guaranteed. The lack of outcry about a proposed system, or network of systems, bearing more than a passing resemblance to the struggling Obamacare system speaks loudly to how baffling all this is to observers. Maybe it\u2019s because it will happen under state control, not federal? Maybe because the legacy players will end up as the profit-realizing custodians anyway? Of course, there could be another explanation for the muted response: Nobody outside the know seems to know it\u2019s even in the works \u2014 a situation this article seeks to counter.\n\nThe retirement industry is in a swivet at the prospect of states running their own individual retirement accounts with the blessing of \u2014 and perhaps even with a leg-up from \u2014 the Department of Labor.\n\nWashington state has already created a marketplace in which employees of small businesses may purchase IRAs; Illinois, California and Oregon are well on their way to creating IRAs for small-business employees who don\u2019t have a retirement plan in place; and more than 18 other states are considering similar measures. See: Why Wall Street\u2019s DOL killer threat \u2014 that 'millions\u2019 of IRA investors will go unadvised under new rules \u2014 is hogwash.\n\nAdvisors and their watchdogs are not yet of one mind about the Obamacare-evoking government 401(k) providers: They see a way to bring unadvised assets out from under the mattresses but are also leery that a monster is being created.\n\n\u201cFor retirement advisors, the positive side of such state-run programs will be the large increase in available retirement dollars in IRAs that will need professional guidance,\u201d says Rick Meigs, founder of the 401khelpcenter.com, pointing out that when these IRA balances grow, individuals may seek help from an advisor down the road.\n\nBut, he continues: \u201cOn the negative side, if you are an advisor or firm that has a large presence in the small-plan market, your state government has just become your chief competitor.\u201d\n\nERISA tripwire\n\n\n\nJason Roberts: These economies of scale\n\nwould be unfairly competing with the\n\nprivate sectors and these things could\n\nbe huge if you can consolidate\n\nacross states\n\nLast month, the Department of Labor issued guidance about state-run retirement plans, encouraging states to consider either creating IRA or 401(k) plans to help the nearly 70 million workers nationwide without access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.\n\nUnder that guidance, a company could set up automatic enrollment for an state-created IRA without it triggering ERISA rules \u2014 but only if several conditions are met.\n\nBy contrast, an employer in the private sector setting up automatic enrollment for an IRA would trigger an ERISA restrictions. See: Why exactly DOL\u2019s latest action is so shocking to so many brokers \u2014 and even ERISA lawyers \u2014 despite years of warnings.\n\n\u201cToday if a company sets up automatic enrollment for an IRA, the plan would fall under ERISA rules and regulations,\u201d says Michael Kreps, an attorney with Groom Law Group based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cHowever, the DOL is allowing states to set up automatic enrollment for IRAs without triggering ERISA rules. This is setting up an unfair advantage in that the states won\u2019t have to follow the same rules and regulations as advisors.\u201d See: IRA assets could be ripped from the grasp of brokers if DOL has its way.\n\nNo safety in multiples\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the removal of ERISA red tape from state-run plans that\u2019s problematic, according to Jason Roberts, lawyer and CEO of Pension Resource Institute LLC\n\nOne potentially huge advantage that state-run plans have over private IRA providers is that numerous states will be allowed to work together, in essence creating a giant cooperation with thousands of employees. By contrast, per ERISA regulations, private employers aren\u2019t allowed to form \u201cmultiple employer plans\u201d unless they are part of the same company or shared ownership. See: The White House puts its best Obamacare minds behind cleaning up the 401(k) business \u2014 starting by issuing a withering memo.\n\n\u201cThese economies of scale would be unfairly competing with the private sectors and these things could be huge if you can consolidate across states,\u201d Roberts says.\n\nBut Scott Dauenhauer, principal and owner of Meridian Wealth Management and Meridian Fiduciary Consulting in Murrieta, Calif., isn\u2019t daunted by the prospect of state-sponsored competition.\n\n\u201cI am supportive of the state-run 401(k)s, if done right. California is currently working on launching one and I\u2019m interested to see what it looks like. I know many advisors have issues with them, but I don\u2019t. I think there is a lot of money to be made overcharging small 401(k) plans and to have a multi-employer option that is possibly run with low costs and modern features that could be offered to small employers would be a good thing. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see the downside,\u201d he says. See: Two advisors debate the financial viability of serving as a fiduciary to small accounts amid DOL\u2019s new rules.\n\nMEP advantage\n\n\n\nScott Dauenhauer: I know many advisors\n\nhave issues with them, but I\n\ndon\u2019t.\n\nMultiple employer plans, or MEPs, offer small businesses the opportunity to band together to purchase one retirement plan. The DOL has nixed MEPS in the private sector unless employees have \u201ccommonality,\u201d Roberts explains.\n\nFor instance, a MEP may exist for members of the American Bar Association or for those involved at business or residential co-ops. But the DOL allows MEPs without any commonality other than the fact that they are under the state\u2019s plan \u2014 or perhaps even under a group of states.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking to allow states to run and operate as multiple employers plans and they were even considering allowing regional MEPS where several states could combine their otherwise unaffiliated companies into these giant multiple employer plans. The private sector can\u2019t run these open MEPs. Given the direction of where we\u2019re at now, how do we get them to level the playing field?\u201d Roberts asks.\n\nThe latitude ERISA gives states to form MEPS is indeed a formidable advantage, says Kreps.\n\n\u201cIn the DOL bulletin, they said they believe a state set up a multiple employer plan because it creates the nexus between employers because of its representation. However, if Prudential steps in, it couldn\u2019t put the same employers and employees in one plan because they are unrelated. But if the state steps in, they can create a multiple employer plan.\u201d See: Report: 'Brother-in-law\u2019 dabblers are giving 401(k) ground slowly to specialists in $1.3 trillion market.\n\nThe Labor Department has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nClarifying guidance\n\n\u201cBoth automatic IRAs and state-based ERISA plans have been created, or are being considered, by various states,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cA lack of clarity of this area of the law has made other states reluctant to move forward with plans to create additional retirement savings opportunities for workers. The department\u2019s guidance is meant to give states clear information as they move forward in creating programs.\u201d\n\nIn December 2014, Illinois approved the Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program, which state officials say would help 1.2 million small business employees to save more for retirement with an automatic IRA payroll deduction program. The program is slated to start in 2017 with 3% automatic enrollment. Illinois officials were waiting for the guidance from the federal government.\n\nAbandoned 401(k)s\n\n\n\nBrooks Herman: This is an attempt\n\nto have [Americans] experience tax-deferred savings.\n\n\n\nAll this talk of state- and pan-state-administered IRAs and 401(k)s is leading to industry fear that some smaller employers will simply dump their own 401(k) plans in favor of ones run by the government. Many RIAs oversee smaller 401(k) plans.\n\n\u201cFor smaller-plan sponsors, these state-run plans could be seen as a way to abandon existing 401(k) plans,\u201d Meigs says.\n\nAdvisor Jim O\u2019Shaughnessy at Sheridan Road Advisors, who works mostly with retirement plans, is adopting an wait-and-see attitude.\n\n\u201cIllinois is one of the states, so we have been paying attention,\u201d he writes in an email. \u201cI have held off on forming too strong of an opinion because I feel this issue is still in early stages and will potentially change a ton over next couple years. We at Sheridan are all for progressive policy and regulatory changes that ultimately help create a stronger public/private retirement system.\u201d\n\nIllinois-based Sheridan Road Advisors is part of LPL Financial.\n\nERISA burden?\n\nBut other private entities have no problem going public with their dissent.\n\nFor instance, New York-based BlackRock Inc. posted a paper Nov. 25 pointing out that if government-sponsored retirement plans don\u2019t need ERISA rules, perhaps the rules are too cumbersome for the private sector as well.\n\n\u201cStates\u2019 reluctance to proceed with programs that might be subject to ERISA requirements highlights the burdens imposed by these rules. Given that ERISA was designed to protect the interests of plan participants and their beneficiaries, we recommend a comprehensive review of legal/compliance burdens imposed by ERISA and similar state laws to determine what rules are truly necessary to protect participants.\u201d See: The great 401(k)-or-not debate: RIABiz webinar lays out the perils and rewards for RIAs thinking of wading into the fast-moving 401(k) stream.\n\nNew York-based BlackRock is a big player in the private sector 401(k) arena.\n\nSIFMA, always leery of any instrument that offers low fees, published a similar paper on its website arguing against the new DOL scheme. See: New York conference: SIFMA wants members to be like RIAs \u2014 minus the same rules of accountability.\n\nThe state-run plans, SIMFA states, are based on the \u201cmisguided notion that private sector retirement plans are inaccessible to most Americans \u2026. The reality is that over 75% of full-time American workers have access to retirement plans through their workplace,\u201d writes Marin E. Gibson, managing director of state government relations for SIFMA.\n\nGibson says that 25 states have considered such legislation.\n\n\u201cBefore jumping into a state-run program, states should not only explore all the costs and benefits of running a plan, but also look to other states for workable alternatives,\u201d Gibson writes.\n\nEmbracing advisors\n\n\n\nRick Meigs: If you are\n\nan advisor or firm that has\n\na large presence in the small\n\nplan market, your state government has\n\njust become your chief competitor.\n\nFidelity Investments, the nation\u2019s largest retirement provider with more than $1.2 trillion in assets, commented but without revealing any point of view.\n\n\u201cMany retirement savings vehicles exist today, and we remain focused on helping thousands of employers and their advisors set up competitive workplace retirement plans so workers can save toward their financial goals,\u201d says Steve Austin, spokesman for the Boston-based company. See: How the future of the 401(k) industry may hinge on the outcome of a lawsuit brought by Fidelity employees against their own company.\n\nWhat do these changes portend for RIAs, who count on many of these smaller 401(k) plans? In the long run, a net gain, speculates Fred Reish, attorney with Drinker Biddle and Reath LLC.\n\n\u201cOver the longer haul, it will depend on the type of state plan and how well they are run. I think the MEP alternative has some potential to become popular among employers \u2026 at the small end of the market. But, to do that, they will need to embrace advisors. That\u2019s because plan sponsors will still need help in operating their plans and will want the help of advisers\u201d Reish writes in an email. See: DOL tells employers when they must fire advisors to 401(k) plans.\n\nWal-Martized 401(k)s\n\nThe bottom line is that millions of employees still don\u2019t have access to retirement plans, says Brooks Herman, a researcher at financial data provider BrightScope Inc. in La Jolla, Calif.\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s in favor of state-run IRAs.\n\n\u201cThe real reason we favor this is there are a lot of Americans who work in companies who don\u2019t have 401(k) plans and can\u2019t put $18,000 away and have it grow tax free over time. This is an attempt to have them experience tax deferred savings.\u201d\n\nHerman says these plans may resemble those of a mammoth company like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has a giant 401(k) plan that\u2019s cumbersome for advisors because so many employees are coming and going.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is the target for these 401(k) plans will be lower-income earners making less contributions. They might look kind of like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has more than a million active participants. Wal-Mart spent a lot of time and energy on its plan. They have lower-wage employees and lots of employees coming in and out of it.\u201d See: What a wave of 401(k) lawsuits tell us about what RIAs really need to worry about.\n\nHe also suspects that small employers will still continue to host 401(k) plans. There are many questions about portability too, he adds.\n\n\u201cThe question is where was all of this money going before these state run plans? Was it going to savings or checking accounts or under the mattress? Advisors can\u2019t really call it their money if it\u2019s in a checking or savings account. Chances are these plans will be targeting people with small accounts and I\u2019m not sure the first iteration will be rich enough environment for advisors to swim.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://riabiz.com/a/5011109790613504/401k-industry-howls-as-dol-lets-state-governments-become-dc-providers-advantageous-exemptions", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-10T11:00:38.842480-08:00", "author": "Lisa Shidler"}, "image": "http://riabiz.com/i/5028161280540672/h", "type": "website", "title": "401(k) industry howls as DOL lets state governments become DC providers with advantageous exemptions"}, "keywords": "Michael Kreps, Scott Dauenhauer, Rick Meigs, Jim O'Shaughnessy, Fred Reish, Jason Roberts, ERISA, Groom Law Firm, Meridian Wealth Management, Meridian Fiduciary Consulting, 401khelpcenter, Sheridan Road Advisors, Drinker Biddle & Reath", "description": "The retirement industry howls as DOL lets states compete and stack the deck - Multiple employer plans' under states will have economies of scale, fewer rules, while ERISA bars private firms from banding together", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFor smaller-plan sponsors, these state-run plans could be seen as a way to abandon existing 401(k) plans,\u201d Meigs says.\n\u201cOver the longer haul, it will depend on the type of state plan and how well they are run.\nWhat do these changes portend for RIAs, who count on many of these smaller 401(k) plans?\n\u201cMy understanding is the target for these 401(k) plans will be lower-income earners making less contributions.\nHe also suspects that small employers will still continue to host 401(k) plans."}
