Jerry Falwell, called the president \u201cthe man with the least character, integrity and morals of any president;\u201d and when the Clinton administration declared June 1999 to be \u201cGay and Lesbian Pride Month,\u201d the Southern Baptist Convention called it a \u201cmost public endorsement of that which is contrary to the Word of God.\u201d\n\nObama, meanwhile, who had to break with his longtime pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright during his 2008 campaign, has been subjected to constant, unfounded assertions that he is not a Christian, and has clashed with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on policies related to same-sex marriage and the (now modified) requirement in the Affordable Care Act that insurance from religious employers cover contraceptive care.\n\nAnd yet, on this Presidents Day weekend, it seems worthy to look at two recently published collections of spiritual writings provided to the two presidents, each revealing a very different view of their spiritual sides than that promoted by their critics.\n\n\u201cLetters to President Clinton: Biblical Lessons on Faith and Leadership,\u201d edited by Rabbi Menachem Genack, includes short essays by Jews from around the world discussing biblical lessons on topics including leadership, faith and community. The letters were sent to Clinton both during and after his time in office, and they show Clinton as an avid reader of the Bible, a steadfast friend to Israel and a Southern Baptist with a vast curiosity about Jewish rituals and customs.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s Devotional\u201d offers 365 snippets from inspirational texts e-mailed to Obama each morning by Joshua Dubois, then-director of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Dubois, who Time magazine dubbed Obama\u2019s \u201cPastor-in-Chief,\u201d never claims to offer an account of Obama\u2019s inner spiritual life. But by presenting the sources he shared with the President \u2014 which include scripture, poetry, quotations from founding fathers as well as jazz singers and even stories about ordinary and extraordinary Americans \u2014 he offers a look at some prompts the president saw during his first term.\n\nGenack, CEO of the Orthodox Union\u2019s Kosher Division, first met Clinton during the 1992 campaign and the two men continue to correspond to this day. \u201cLetters to President Clinton\u201d includes selections by Rabbi Norman Lamm, former chancellor of Yeshiva University, esteemed writer Cynthia Ozick, and Daniel C. Kurtzer, the former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt and later Israel, among many other writers.\n\nThe letters, mostly from Americans, attempt to draw lessons from the Hebrew Bible in a manner reminiscent of weekly sermons. In the foreword, Clinton calls these letters \u201cinvaluable to me in addressing the challenges of leadership and public service,\u201d with what he calls a theme of \u201ccommon humanity.\u201d Despite their differences, Genack \u2014 who wears a beard and a black velvet kippah \u2014 bonded with Clinton from a shared appreciation for the lessons of scripture.\n\n\u201cNon-Jews want to hear the Jewish voice on morality,\u201d Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, writes in the book\u2019s introduction. \u201cThey want to understand how to create a culture that emphasizes responsibilities, not just rights.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, \u201cThe President\u2019s Devotional\u201d is a far more intimate book. Dubois, like Obama, is a politically involved African-American man who grew up far from the seat of power, not really knowing his biological father and who reaffirmed his commitment to Christianity as an adult. Moreover, Dubois has clearly been influenced and inspired by his boss, and, as a result, his book \u2014 a quintessentially Christian text that offers a thought or homily to guide one\u2019s prayer on each day of the Gregorian calendar \u2014 reads like a selection of notes passed between people who share similar cultural and spiritual references.\n\nAnd similar challenges: Reading Dubois\u2019 prompts urging the president to pray for order (June 11), to pray that God \u201cremove from me any unhealthy desire to control\u201d (June 20) and to pray for the ability to \u201ckeep my eyes on the prize\u201d (April 6), it\u2019s hard not to imagine Dubois, who turned 30 during Obama\u2019s first term, using those same prompts in his own prayers.\n\nIn their lessons on leadership, however, the two books are quite similar, and never more so than in their reverence for Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\u201cWe can defeat our enemies by the sword and thereby create even more enemies. Or we can love them into submission,\u201d Dubois writes in the devotion for Jan. 30, putting forward Lincoln\u2019s treatment of Southerners during the Civil War as a way to deal with opponents.\n\nGenack \u2014 whose Manhattan office displays a portrait of Lincoln \u2014 also put forward America\u2019s 16th president as a model. In a letter to Clinton on July 28, 1997, Genack talks of Lincoln\u2019s recognizing that he could not predict what the divine would ordain.\n\nPointing to Joseph centralizing storage of grain in Egypt during years of plenty, Genack points out that the policy enabled Egypt to survive a brutal famine, but it also sowed the seeds of the Israelites\u2019 upcoming bondage \u2014 which was God\u2019s plan all along.\n\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln recognized the infinite distance between God and man,\u201d Genack wrote to Clinton. \u201cSensing our limited perspective, he commented in his second inaugural address, \u2018The Almighty has His own purposes.\u2019\"\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/praying_with_presidents", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/nw_the-presidents-devotional_021414.jpg", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "title": "Praying with presidents | Nation"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "Praying with presidents | Nation", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/praying_with_presidents", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/nw_the-presidents-devotional_021414.jpg", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae86\"", "article_summary": "U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have had rough public relationships with religious leaders.\nAnd yet, on this Presidents Day weekend, it seems worthy to look at two recently published collections of spiritual writings provided to the two presidents, each revealing a very different view of their spiritual sides than that promoted by their critics.\n\u201cThey want to understand how to create a culture that emphasizes responsibilities, not just rights.\u201dBy contrast, \u201cThe President\u2019s Devotional\u201d is a far more intimate book.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s Devotional\u201d offers 365 snippets from inspirational texts e-mailed to Obama each morning by Joshua Dubois, then-director of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships.\n\u201cLetters to President Clinton\u201d includes selections by Rabbi Norman Lamm, former chancellor of Yeshiva University, esteemed writer Cynthia Ozick, and Daniel C.
