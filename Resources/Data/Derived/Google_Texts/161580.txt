Ted Cruz took time out of his busy campaign schedule to endorse Republican Michael Burgess for re-election to Congressional District 26 in North Texas.

“My friend, Congressman Michael Burgess is a principled and courageous man,” Cruz said in a statement released by the Burgess campaign. “During my senate campaign when no one believed we had a prayer, Dr. Burgess stuck his neck out and endorsed me, stating: ‘We need a change in Washington.’”

Burgess is running in the March 1 Republican primary against Joel Krause and Micah Beebe.

An endorsement from Cruz gives Burgess added credibility with activist Republicans.

“As a physician Dr. Burgess understands first-hand the catastrophic effects of Obamacare, and we will need his expertise when we repeal Obamacare and begin rebuilding our country’s health care system. I ask that you join me in supporting Dr. Michael Burgess,” Cruz said.
