Many states\u2019 employers will see that option become available this fall. Some, though, will be left waiting into next year, if not longer. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nOne year in, the new small-business insurance marketplaces born out of the new federal health-care law have fallen short of their promise in nearly every state, both in terms of functionality and enrollment. However, many are scheduled to see some important updates heading into year two \u2014 ones that health officials say should make them much more useful and appealing to small employers and their workers.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, for example, officials are preparing to roll out the third major update to the District of Columbia\u2019s health-care marketplace, which already houses one of the country\u2019s most robust small-business exchanges, often called SHOP (Small Business Health Options Program) exchanges. District small businesses have already been able to shop for and select plans online \u2014 an option that was delayed by at least a year in most states.\n\nThe District\u2019s update, scheduled for later this month, is to include new features that allow employees to update their information and more easily make changes to their coverage if, for instance, they get married or need to add or drop a dependent from their plan. District officials have also tweaked the site to give employers more flexibility in the enrollment process and permit them to more easily hand the entire process over to a licensed broker.\n\nIn addition, officials this fall unveiled a mobile app for small-business owners, which allows them to browse health plans, determine their company\u2019s eligibility and find a nearby broker using built-in GPS technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been soliciting feedback from employers, employees and brokers to see how we can improve the process and what additional functionality would help,\u201d Hannah Turner, manager of the city\u2019s small-business exchange, said in an interview.\n\nMore improvements are coming early next year, she said. By this spring, her team hopes to have added stand-alone dental plans to the site\u2019s small-business offerings and implement an online payment system. Currently, business owners who purchase plans through the exchange can send in one check (or pay by phone) to cover their premiums for the entire company, but they cannot pay over the Internet.\n\nIn Maryland, meanwhile, small-business owners are still waiting for an online marketplace \u2014 and the wait will continue into next year, if not longer.\n\nState officials repeatedly delayed and eventually scrapped their plans to build an online small-business portal, instead focusing their attention on improving the state\u2019s glitch-ridden individual exchange. Consequently, Maryland small employers interested in plans available through the new state-run marketplace this past year had to work with a broker and apply for coverage using paper applications.\n\nMaryland will likely be the only state where that remains the case next year, as state officials have elected to turn over the state\u2019s small-business health exchange to three third-party organizations that work with brokers. Joshua Sharfstein, chairman of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange board, said those third-party administrators are expected to build electronic sign-up systems and eventually an online health care portal, but neither will be ready for companies enrolling in coverage later this year.\n\nAsked about a timeline for the online functions that were supposed to be in place last year, he said \u201cit\u2019s in 2015, but I don\u2019t know exactly when.\u201d In addition, the new system, which is expected to save the state upwards of $10 million over building its own employer exchange, could ultimately result in multiple online small-business marketplaces operated by each of the third-party organizations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much less expensive plan and one that we expect to be more successful,\u201d Sharfstein said of the state\u2019s decision to put the SHOP in the hands of third-party groups.\n\nSharfstein added that the state is working with brokers to implement some important improvements to the state\u2019s small-business marketplace early next year. In January, for example, Maryland small businesses can expect to see the start of what\u2019s called the \u201cemployee-choice\u201d option \u2014 a provision built into the health-care law that allows small-business owners to select multiple plans from various carriers and let their employees choose which coverage works best for them.\n\nDespite facing similar challenges, other states are plowing ahead with their own small-business exchanges.\n\nColorado, for example, which had numerous technical problems, has made several improvements to its online SHOP portal, and officials expect a smoother shopping experience for small businesses this year. Washington state, which nixed its plans for online small-business site last year after few carriers showed interest, relaunched its online SHOP exchange earlier this month.\n\nIn the nearly three dozen states that have defaulted to the federal government\u2019s small-business exchange (including Virginia), employers can also expect to see some improvements, but still not the whole caboodle. After a test run in five states later this month, Healthcare.gov\u2019s small-business portal is scheduled to roll out on Nov. 15, more than a year after its originally scheduled start. At that point, employers will be able to sign up for coverage with the click of a mouse.\n\nHealth and Human Services officials in charge of Healthcare.gov say they have made other improvements to the site, too, which should allow it to withstand the type of heavy traffic that caused the site to crash last year.\n\nOne improvement that won\u2019t be ready is the availability of an employee-choice option. Earlier this year, federal health officials granted 18 states permission to delay that option for a second year.\n\n\u201cEmployee choice has been one of the principle justifications for having SHOP exchanges,\u201d Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, wrote in a blog post about the waivers this summer. \u201cPostponing it another year will in all likelihood impede enrollment growth for 2015.\u201d\n\nJust having those services might not be enough. In the District, only about 1,200 people have enrolled in plans through the employer exchange (companies can enroll at any point during the year), compared to more than 5,000 through the city\u2019s individual exchange, which has a limited open-enrollment window. In part, that may bebecause of the type of companies officials have tried to attract.\n\n\u201cOur focus has been on reaching small businesses that don\u2019t offer coverage, and that\u2019s been a challenge, trying to make the business case for why they should start offering it,\u201d said Mila Kofman, director of the city\u2019s exchange, called DC Health Link. She noted that her team has partnered with business groups such as the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, the Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington to reach out to small employers.\n\nKofman declined to say how many small businesses she expects to sign up this year, saying that \u201cit\u2019s more about what we\u2019re able to offer to customers than about numbers.\u201d She added that her team will \u201ctry to keep making modifications and improvements based on what we\u2019re hearing from individuals and small businesses.\u201d\n\nFollow J.D.
