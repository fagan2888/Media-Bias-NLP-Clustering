Kivvik Wealth\u2019s surveys offer clients a variety of possible developments to update their advisors with, from buying a new car, to selling a house, to retiring. Presently, advisors must take the time at standard touch points to call and email individual clients, asking for information that might impact their financial futures. However, with Kivvik Wealth, financial advisors will know their clients through fast and painless communication, allowing them to save time, and become more competitive in their field. \u201cWe saw how stretched thin financial advisors were with their huge numbers of clients,\u201d said Chike Nwankwo, co-founder of Kivvik.\n\nIn 2015, the average financial advisor has over 100 clients to manage. As a result, to advisors, time is valuable, and the ability to manage time effectively is paramount. Kivvik Wealth aims to organize and simplify at least one aspect of a busy financial advisor\u2019s life so that more time can be spent on finance, rather than on phone calls and emails.\n\nThe Guardian Life Insurance Company of America\u00ae (Guardian) announced that the company continued to deliver strong performance across the board, ending 2014 with $6.8 billion in capital, marking its sixth consecutive year of capital growth. As a result, Guardian policyholders received a $787 million dividend payout. For the year, on a consolidated basis, Guardian earned $1.3 billion in operating income before taxes and dividends to policyholders. The company took in $17.3 billion in premiums and deposits, paid out $5.3 billion of benefits to policyholders and had $529 billion life insurance in force. Additional details regarding Guardian\u2019s 2014 financial performance are available in the company\u2019s annual report available here.\n\nNew York Life Insurance Company announced a 14.7 percent increase in 2014 operating earnings to a record $2.02 billion, and record surplus and asset valuation reserve, which reached $21.9 billion for the year. \u201cDespite continued low interest rates, competition from a strong stock market, and low growth in the life insurance market nationally, New York Life exceeded $2 billion in earnings for the first time and reached a new high in surplus and asset valuation reserve, a key measure of our financial strength. I want to thank our agents and employees for a remarkable year, and for showing once again why millions of families and businesses choose New York Life as a steward for their financial futures,\u201d said chairman and CEO Ted Mathas. \u201cI also want to thank our policyholders for placing their trust in New York Life. Our company\u2019s founders set forth a singular objective for New York Life 170 years ago \u2013 to operate for the benefit of our policyholders \u2013 and we will not waver from that course,\u201d he added.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual distributed nearly $48 million in permanent life insurance dividends in 2014 to policyowners who work with the company\u2019s Washington, D.C. network office that includes locations in the District of Columbia; Rockville, Md.; and Fairfax, McLean and Reston, Va. \u201cOur annual dividend payout is money that goes back into the pockets of our policyowners, and can have a tremendous impact not only on them and their families, but in their communities as well,\u201d said Leo Tucker, managing partner for Northwestern Mutual \u2013 Washington, D.C. He added that, \u201cThe nearly 42,000 policyowners we serve are the driving force behind our success, and this dividend payout shows why more people put their trust in Northwestern Mutual than in any other financial services company.\u201dNorthwestern Mutual expects the dividend amount to increase in 2015 as the demand for the company\u2019s comprehensive financial planning approach grows. The company recently announced it expects to distribute an industry-leading $5.5 billion in total dividends to its more than 4 million policyowners across the United States. The payout will be the largest in the company\u2019s history, according to a press release.\n\nThe U.S. business group of Sun Life Financial hosted its third Sun Life Wake Up Summit to shed light on important and complex issues surrounding health care reform. The Summit gave perspectives on how employers are taking control of their health care benefits and analyzing solutions like self-insurance. Keynote speakers \u2014 Dr. Jonathan Gruber, MIT economist and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expert, and Michael Cannon, director of Health Policy Studies at the Cato Institute \u2014 shared opposing viewpoints on the current state of reform and tackled questions about the implications of the King v. Burwell Supreme Court case and the impending Cadillac tax.\n\nFollowing their session, two panels explored the pros and cons of self-insurance and shared experiences and pragmatic advice for those considering self-insurance. Paul Fronstin, director of the Health Research and Education Program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, pointed to a number of advantages companies have when they self-insure, including uniformity of benefits across states and access to health plan data that can help tailor wellness programs to the needs of employees, which can directly lead to the bottom line. He explained, \u201cThe growing interest in self-insurance among large-size firms pre-dates the Affordable Care Act. Yet as a result of health care reform, we may see smaller employers evaluating, for the first time, if self-insurance is right for them.\u201d\n\nAdding to those points, Booker Moore, president and CEO of L.R. Webber Associates, an employee benefits advisory firm, said, \"We're seeing a trend with employers of converting fully insured plans into a self-funded program as they seek to gain access to more detailed claims data to address long-term cost-control issues.\" Members of the panel also emphasized that not all self-funding is the same, and with a lot of choices and ways to administer a plan, it\u2019s critically important to have trusted, knowledgeable partners to help weigh the risks and tailor a solution.\n\nFronstin further explained, \u201cSmaller employers that can absorb less risk have to look at how one large medical claim could wipe them out. That\u2019s why having the right stop-loss insurance to protect against that is critical.
