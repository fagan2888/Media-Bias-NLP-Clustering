Burwell, some 6 million people would lose their subsidies and far fewer people would be able to buy coverage on the insurance exchanges. This could have enormous implications that could upend the entire law.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Might Happen if SCOTUS Rules Against Obamacare\n\nThe case challenges whether the law\u2019s language only provides subsidies to people who signed up for coverage through the state exchanges, since the law doesn\u2019t explicitly mention the federal exchange.\n\nCongress could always swoop in and pass legislation to amend the law\u2019s language and restore the subsidies, but GOP lawmakers are unlikely to make that happen.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Republicans would block any attempts by Democrats to correct the language. As The Journal notes, \u201cthe GOP-controlled House and Senate see the challenge as their best hope for tearing apart a law they have long opposed.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s plan runs counter to what the majority of Americans want. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released on Thursday found that about 64 percent of people say they want the Congress to restore subsidies if the Court strikes them down.\n\nThis raises the stakes of the Court\u2019s decision. An unfavorable ruling for the administration will be disastrous news for the White House and the millions of people getting health coverage through Obamacare.\n\nDemocrat lawmakers who drafted the law, as well as patient advocates have been gearing up for the decision\u2014pleading to the Court to side with the administration\u2014saying a failure to do so would have devastating implications for millions of Americans.\n\nOf course, as legal experts have pointed out, even if the Court strikes down the subsidies and Congress doesn\u2019t pass a fix, there is still hope.\n\nStates that currently rely on the federal exchange could create their own exchanges. And as some experts have pointed out, they could use workarounds that technically establish intent to set up some sort of state marketplace that still uses the federal portal. Many state lawmakers are exploring the possibilities.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican lawmakers are still vowing to repeal Obamacare\u2014but this time they\u2019re bankin", "title": "Will the Supreme Court Help the GOP Repeal Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/01/Will-Supreme-Court-Help-GOP-Repeal-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11222013_Obamacare_Buttons.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/01/Will-Supreme-Court-Help-GOP-Repeal-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11222013_Obamacare_Buttons.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican lawmakers are still vowing to repeal Obamacare\u2014but this time they\u2019re bankin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce89b\"", "article_summary": "Republican lawmakers are still vowing to repeal Obamacare\u2014but this time they\u2019re banking on the Supreme Court to help them.\nOf course, as legal experts have pointed out, even if the Court strikes down the subsidies and Congress doesn\u2019t pass a fix, there is still hope.\nMany state lawmakers are exploring the possibilities.\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll released on Thursday found that about 64 percent of people say they want the Congress to restore subsidies if the Court strikes them down.\nCongress could always swoop in and pass legislation to amend the law\u2019s language and restore the subsidies, but GOP lawmakers are unlikely to make that happen."}
