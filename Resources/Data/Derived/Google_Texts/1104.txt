Thousands of people are out on the water across Southwest Florida this Labor Day weekend.

Many of them flocked to Picnic Island off the coast of Sanibel on Sunday for the "Sandbar Extravaganza."

The Facebook page for the event lists 4,000 people attending, but event organizers and law enforcement expected much more.

"We have over 4,000 RSVPs and if we have the same ratio as last year, we should have about 16,000 people here," said organizer Dan Sinclair.

He held five similar parties last year, events people are still talking about.

"There were more people on the stage, a little bit more fighting, a little bit rowdy or music or younger crowd, I would say," said Kyah Yergi, a Fort Myers resident.

Sinclair said he wants to change that reputation. "99.99% of the people have a good vibe. They're happy, they're positive, but sometimes there'll be maybe six or 10 people that can't handle alcohol. They drink a little too much and they start fighting with one another and it causes a bad vibe for everyone else."

This time around, he did things differently. He reached out to law enforcement early on with safety plans to make sure they prevent any emergencies.

"We actually asked the sheriff's office and all the other agencies this year if they see any violence whatsoever or anything to vent to put the people in cuffs and get them out of here because we don't want to deal with it," Sinclair said.

Partygoers said they notice an increase in law enforcement presence, but they don't mind.

"They are absolutely doing their job keeping everything safe, under control, keeping underage drinking under control," Yergi said

Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission representatives worked the party and said as of 6 p.m., they responded to two medical emergencies, including someone having a bottle broken over their head.

The final attendance number - and how many people may have been arrested - wasn't available late Sunday.
