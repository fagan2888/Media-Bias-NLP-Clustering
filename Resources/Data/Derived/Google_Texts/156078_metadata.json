Their demise means that eight of the 23 co-ops in existence a year ago will be unavailable to consumers shopping for 2016 coverage through insurance marketplaces created under the ACA.\n\nFederal health officials have been cracking down recently on many of the plans, warning them that their finances, enrollment or business model needed to shape up. Some state regulators have applied pressure of their own.\n\n[Half of Obamacare co-ops have eroding financial health]\n\nBut it was a move by the Department of Health and Human Services that the four closing co-ops say was critically destabilizing. HHS announced Oct. 1 that it could afford to pay insurers participating in the federal and state-run exchanges just 12.6 percent of nearly $3 billion they were owed under a temporary provision of the health-care law. Known as risk corridors, it is intended to help cushion insurers that end up with sicker customers and bigger medical claims than they had anticipated.\n\nThe CEO of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs, Kelly Crowe, labeled the latest collapses a \u201cdevastating blow to Americans who seek competition, choice, innovative benefits, and non-profit alternatives when selecting a health insurer.\u201d In a statement, Crowe noted that \u201cfew businesses can sustain hits like the CO-OPs and other small and new insurance companies have endured\u201d because of the federal government\u2019s reversal on the risk corridor dollars.\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the exchanges, said the agency recognizes that those lower-than-expected payments \u201cmay have raised additional solvency concerns.\u201d\n\nThe priority of CMS \u201cis to make sure that marketplace customers have access to quality, affordable coverage,\u201d Aaron Albright said late Friday. \u201cWe are working with Colorado and Oregon officials to do everything possible to make sure consumers stay covered.\u201d\n\nState regulators made the closure call for the Colorado HealthOP, saying they would decertify it from the insurance marketplace there. The co-op immediately denounced the move, blasting the federal government\u2019s \u201cfailure to pay billions of dollars in promised funding\u201d and pointing out that projections indicated the plan would be profitable in 2016.\n\nCEO Julia Hutchins called the state\u2019s action \u201cirresponsible and premature\u201d and contended it would hurt access to low-cost health-care options. She vowed to fight the shutdown directive, although her statement did not elaborate on how the plan would do so. The co-op has more than 80,000 members, accounting for nearly 40 percent of residents with coverage through the Colorado insurance exchange.\n\nThe Health Republic Insurance Co. of Oregon also blamed the sharp cut in federal payments for its demise. The plan, which has nearly 15,000 members and is one of two co-ops in that state, will cease operation on Dec. 31.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s refusal to honor its risk corridor obligations represents a negative financial impact of over $20 million,\u201d president and CEO Dawn Bonder said in a statement. \u201cThis has placed us in a difficult financial position that could jeopardize our members and partners. As a result, we believe the most ethical step is for Health Republic to refrain from entering the market in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe co-ops in Tennessee and Kentucky each cited the federal funding shortfall in their closure announcements as well. In the two states, more than 82,000 consumers will now be forced to find other coverage for next year.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s third open-enrollment season begins Nov. 1.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Nearly 100,000 consumers in Colorado, Oregon will be affected for 2016 coverage", "title": "Two more Obamacare health insurance plans collapse", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/two-more-obamacare-health-insurance-plans-collapse/2015/10/16/cc324fd0-7449-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/16/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Health_Overhaul_Website_Upgrade-0e269-1625.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@goldsteinamy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/two-more-obamacare-health-insurance-plans-collapse/2015/10/16/cc324fd0-7449-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "cc324fd0-7449-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Nearly 100,000 consumers in Colorado, Oregon will be affected for 2016 coverage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73d3\"", "article_summary": "Nearly a third of the innovative health insurance plans created under the Affordable Care Act will be out of business at the end of 2015, following announcements Friday that plans in Oregon and Colorado are folding.\nFederal health officials have been cracking down recently on many of the plans, warning them that their finances, enrollment or business model needed to shape up.\nThe co-op has more than 80,000 members, accounting for nearly 40 percent of residents with coverage through the Colorado insurance exchange.\nThe Health Republic Insurance Co. of Oregon also blamed the sharp cut in federal payments for its demise.\nIn just the past week, four co-ops, as the nonprofit plans are known, have decided or been ordered to shut down."}
