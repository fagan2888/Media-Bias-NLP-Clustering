Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University.\n\n\u201cWe think the growth rate for Orange County will be about 3.1 percent, and that is the fastest growth since the year 2000,\u201d said Esmael Adibi, director of the Anderson Center. \u201cIt\u2019s going to taper off in 2016, with a growth rate like 2.7 percent.\u201d\n\nBut it is still welcome news for the county, which was hit hard in the Great Recession as an epicenter of the housing collapse that fueled the economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThe recession hit us really bad \u2014 disproportionately to the rest of the nation or California,\u201d Adibi said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the catch-up mode. The growth rate is kind of making up for what we did not get, but then we\u2019re also kind of reaching a plateau. \u2026 But, overall, based on that we\u2019re seeing a really strong job market and that should help income growth and spending.\u201d\n\nTopping off the list of industries creating the most jobs this year and next are white collar workers in professional and business services, Adibi said. That sector should see 23,000 new jobs, he added.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is primarily credited with fueling an increase of 17,000 jobs in health care and private education, Adibi said.\n\nThe third biggest contributor to job growth locally is the leisure and hospitality industry, with about 12,400 jobs, Adibi said.\n\nForecasters predict about 10,000 new or restored jobs in government, Adibi said.\n\nA rosier than usual state budget, which includes extra money for schools, will likely contribute to hiring in the local government sector, Adibi said.\n\nHome prices are expected to continue to rise for the most part, Adibi said.\n\n\u201cThe housing is a little problematic when you look at affordability, Adibi said. \u201cWe believe home prices will still go up, but not as fast as they did in 2013 or 2012.\n\nFederal officials have told Chapman\u2019s economists that they plan to revise upward the first quarter GDP statistics because of a flaw in calculating them, Adibi said.\n\nIn the most recent year, the GDP suffered in California due to the port strike and bad weather.\n\n\u2014 Wire reports\n\n>> Want to read more stories like this?
