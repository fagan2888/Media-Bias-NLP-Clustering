Men and women scored about the same for frequency and importance of sexual behaviors overall, and for quality of life.\n\nAlthough people with frequent sexual activity also placed higher importance on it, the analysis found the two measures were associated with different aspects of quality of life.\n\nParticipants reporting more frequent sexual behavior rated their social relationships as higher quality, while people who found sexual activity to be important had higher scores for psychological quality of life.\n\nOverall, however, seniors\u2019 health status had the strongest impact on all aspects of quality of life.\n\nJohn DeLamater, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, said the fact that participants were recruited in community settings - which may attract more healthy and active older people - might affect the results.\n\n\u201cIf they are generally healthier (which the results show to be associated with quality of life), they are probably more sexually active,\u201d DeLamater said in an email.\n\nFor people who have valued sexuality throughout their lives, he noted, \u201ccontinuing activity provides protection against a sense of aging and loss, and of continuity if the person is in a long-term relationship.\u201d That may explain the links between sex and well-being found in the study, he said.\n\nWhile the current study only looked at associations and cannot determine whether sexuality raises quality of life, Gow noted, he hopes that future research will focus more on this subject.\n\n\u201cWhat we hope is that our current findings encourage other researchers interested in the determinants of health and well-being in older adults to also consider sexual behaviors,\u201d Gow said in an email.\n\nThe sexuality of older people should be considered and encouraged, DeLamater said. \u201cWe should encourage couples to spend time alone, provide arrangements in care facilities that enable sexual intimacy, provide sexual health information in medical settings.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1CXCiLh Age and Ageing, online July 14, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "seniors, sexual, activity, linked, higher, quality, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A small study shows older adults who value and engage in sexual activity have better social lives and psychological well-being.", "title": "For Seniors, Sexual Activity Is Linked To Higher Quality Of Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seniors-sexual-activity-linked-higher-quality-life-345680", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/01/seniors.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A small study shows older adults who value and engage in sexual activity have better social lives and psychological well-being.", "title": "For Seniors, Sexual Activity Is Linked To Higher Quality Of Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seniors-sexual-activity-linked-higher-quality-life-345680", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/01/seniors.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/01/seniors.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-08-01T11:24:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T11:24:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A small study shows older adults who value and engage in sexual activity have better social lives and psychological well-being."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb88\"", "article_summary": "Participants reporting more frequent sexual behavior rated their social relationships as higher quality, while people who found sexual activity to be important had higher scores for psychological quality of life.\nAlthough people with frequent sexual activity also placed higher importance on it, the analysis found the two measures were associated with different aspects of quality of life.\nMen and women scored about the same for frequency and importance of sexual behaviors overall, and for quality of life.\nA small study shows older adults who value and engage in sexual activity have better social lives and psychological well-being.\n\u201cWe should encourage couples to spend time alone, provide arrangements in care facilities that enable sexual intimacy, provide sexual health information in medical settings.\u201dSOURCE: bit.ly/1CXCiLh Age and Ageing, online July 14, 2015."}
