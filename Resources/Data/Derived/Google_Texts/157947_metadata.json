A memo released yesterday from Ryan's office indicates he believes they have the votes to override the veto without a Senate vote.\n\nHowever, Ryan faces opposition from his own party, as hard-line Republicans are demanding concessions in other areas in exchange for their votes. Specifically, they want to step back from last year's budget deal with the Obama administration.\n\nThis will put the number of times Republicans have attempted to repeal Obamacare at well over 60, making the timing of the vote on Groundhog Day especially ironic. And, as in the movie, history is expected to repeat itself, with the challenge failing once again.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Led by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the House is set to vote today at 7 P.M. to override President Obama's January 8 veto of legislation that would have...", "application-name": "Glamour Magazine", "author": "Mikki Halpin", "og": {"site_name": "Glamour", "description": "Led by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the House is set to vote today at 7 P.M. to override President Obama's January 8 veto of legislation that would have...", "title": "Republicans Voting Tonight to End Obamacare", "url": "http://www.glamour.com/story/democratic-senators-call-on-co", "image": "http://media.glamour.com/photos/56e1f7fa1632e6ca44c17fa6/master/pass/inspired-2016-02-Ryan-main.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.glamour.com", "description": "Led by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the House is set to vote today at 7 P.M. to override President Obama's January 8 veto of legislation that would have...", "title": "Republicans Voting Tonight to End Obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://media.glamour.com/photos/56e1f7fa1632e6ca44c17fa6/master/pass/inspired-2016-02-Ryan-main.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "glamourmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 823617, "app_id": 101358874221}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Paul Ryan,Planned Parenthood,President Obama,affordable care act,obamacare,reproductive rights", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 Cond\u00e9 Nast 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A memo released yesterday from Ryan's office indicates he believes they have the votes to override the veto without a Senate vote.\nHowever, Ryan faces opposition from his own party, as hard-line Republicans are demanding concessions in other areas in exchange for their votes.\nLed by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the House is set to vote today at 7 P.M. to override President Obama's January 8 veto of legislation that would have ended the Affordable Care Act and effectively defunded Planned Parenthood.\nThis will put the number of times Republicans have attempted to repeal Obamacare at well over 60, making the timing of the vote on Groundhog Day especially ironic.\nAnd, as in the movie, history is expected to repeat itself, with the challenge failing once again."}
