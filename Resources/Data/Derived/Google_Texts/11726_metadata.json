Which, sadly, is not even that original a thought. Not only has the right compared Obamacare to rape, they have also compared it to both slavery and the holocaust. Which I suppose just means that it is as bad as rape times slavery times the holocaust. Not to be dramatic, or anything.\n\nVia Right Wing Watch:\n\nThere is one particular group of these programs called: \u201cLaw And Order: SVU\u201d. And in this series there are a few episodes that I simply cannot watch because they expose the deepest darkest side of human nature and despite their disclaimer that no real persons are reflected, most people recognize that there are far too many real world parallels for comfort. And in some of these episodes, there are gifted actors that portray fictional characters whose defense when charged with rape runs along these lines: \u201cShe seduced me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wanted it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe enjoyed it.\u201d Really? At what point does rape become a pleasurable experience for the victim? And whom among us are not revolted and angered by such nonsense? And whom among us are willing to believe that if we \u201cJust lay back and don\u2019t fight it you will inevitably enjoy it.\u201d? And the \u201cIT\u201d that I am referring to here is \u201cObamacare\u201d. The Obama Regime is encouraging people to become the evangelists for Obamacare in their own family and social groups over Thanks Giving dinner [sic]. Their message is truly quite simple: Lie back and quit fighting and eventually you will enjoy the experience.\n\nYes. Much in the same way that women are supposed to lie back and take it when you idiots keep comparing things to rape that are not, in fact, rape? Not only is offensive, at this point, it\u2019s getting a little tedious.\n\nThere are myriad things the government has done that I am opposed to and offended by. I was opposed to the Iraq War. I was opposed to the Food Stamp cuts. In fact, I am not thrilled with Obamacare as I would vastly prefer Single Payer. I do not, however, compare every single thing I don\u2019t like and am forced to endure to rape. I don\u2019t compare it to slavery, I don\u2019t compare it to the Holocaust.\n\nThere was a study done recently saying that the reason the Occupy Movement failed to influence the Democratic Party the way the Tea Party influenced the Republican Party is because Liberals tend to think they are \u201cunique\u201d and thus do not assume everyone agrees with them, whereas Conservatives assume that everyone does, in fact, agree with them and share their views. I do not see this as \u201cprioritizing uniqueness,\u201d I see this as being a reasonable person. The idea of presuming that everyone agrees with me seems altogether bizarre, particularly given the fact that it is clearly untrue. I am a lot of things, but I am certainly not delusional.\n\nIf this study is correct\u2013and I\u2019m not sure that it is\u2013Rockantansky clearly falls into the category of assuming everyone agrees with him. He assumes that Obamacare is being cruelly forced on an entirely unwilling public. If that were the case, tactlessness of the comparison aside, he might have a point. In some ways it is\u2013because it\u2019s a compromise. The right wants the \u201cfree market\u201d to decide how much we all pay for insurance, and for it to be a thing that is only available for those who can afford it, while the left sees health care as a human right, and would prefer Single Payer. Neither of us got what we wanted here.\n\nHowever, the simple fact is that every one of us has to deal with legislation we disagree with, by virtue of the fact that we all have different opinions and stances on things. No one gets everything exactly the way they\u2019d like it to be. In all likelihood, if Darwin Rockantansky got his way on everything, I would probably be pretty damned miserable, and vice versa.\n\nRockantansky ends his rant by explaining the myriad ways in which Obamacare itself is a rapist:\n\nBut I will encourage you to think about your own families and extended families and decide for yourself if there is a point at which this rape experience could possibly become enjoyable; rape of our free will, rape of our religious convictions, rape of free markets, rape of our Constitution, a brutal rape of the American Dream and personal freedoms.\n\nWhich is a tad hyperbolic, and, quite frankly, an insult to every non-fictional person who has ever been raped.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can Republicans go a whole week without comparing something to rape, slavery or the Holocaust?
