Alan Bersin, an assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told a House oversight panel last week that using the government\u2019s various \u201cno fly lists\u201d to deny Americans the right to buy a gun is nonsense.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say it quite like that. Assistant secretaries of anything don\u2019t dispute the president of the United States, but when a congressman asked whether he thought it appropriate to deny someone on one of the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cno fly\u201d or \u201cterrorist watch\u201d lists their right to buy or own a gun, as the president suggests, Mr. Bersin gave a straight and honest answer.\n\nSuggesting that anyone on those lists is seriously suspected to be a terrorist, President Obama had complained that \u201c[such] people can\u2019t get on planes, but those same people who we don\u2019t allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and there\u2019s nothing that we can do to stop them. That\u2019s a law that needs to be changed.\u201d\n\nSomeone should explain to the president how these things actually work. The names of about 47,000 persons are on the various \u201cno fly\u201d lists and over a million are on \u201cterrorist watch\u201d lists compiled from nominations by various federal agencies. No one knows exactly how someone gets on the lists. James Gilmore, the former governor of Virginia who from 1999 to 2003 headed a commission that studied weapons and their availability, once observed that \u201cif there are really that many potential terrorists in this country we might as well give up.\u201d He couldn\u2019t say how many actual suspects were being monitored by government agencies, but it was far, far fewer than the number of people on the lists.\n\nJust about anyone can make it to such a list, without evidence of even a vagrant thought of mischief. The no-fly list has included members of Congress and even employees of the Department of Homeland Security. Assistant Secretary Bersin was asked whether it would make sense to deny those on these lists their Second Amendment rights just because they were on one of the lists, and he replied that no, that would be \u201ccomparing apples to oranges.\u201d\n\nOnly one-tenth of one percent of the 47,000 persons on the no-fly lists are Americans, and it\u2019s clear that the policymakers in the White House, to put it politely, don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Bullets come out of the business end of a gun, and in this administration that\u2019s all anyone needs to know about guns, the Second Amendment and terrorism.\n\nJames Comey, the director of the FBI, told Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina at a recent Senate hearing that he was not familiar with how guns were purchased on the Internet, but assumed that a seller just mailed the gun to the customer.\n\nIn fact, a gun purchased on the Internet cannot by law be mailed directly to the purchaser, but must be sent to a licensed gun dealer who can deliver it to the buyer only after the buyer passes a background investigation conducted by Mr. Comey\u2019s FBI. It\u2019s difficult to understand how and why policymakers can make policy about things they don\u2019t understand, but it\u2019s easy to understand how their policies sometimes make no sense at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Diogenes can take his lamp and go home to ancient Athens, satisfied that an honest man has emerged in the Obama administration.
