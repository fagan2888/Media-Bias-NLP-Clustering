Twenty-nine percent oppose it, the poll found.\n\nMore generally, 57 percent of respondents said they\u2019d approve of a policy that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, if even if meant higher electricity bills. That is the highest approval rating for that question since NBC and the Wall Street Journal started asking it.\n\nOnly 31 percent agreed that climate change is a serious problem that needs immediate action, but that was the highest response since 2007.\n\nThe NBC/Wall Street Journal survey came to a similar conclusion as a Bloomberg News survey a week prior. That June 11 poll found that 62 percent of United States residents would be willing to pay more in their electricity bills to reduce carbon pollution, and only 33 percent would not.\n\nBut a June 12 poll sponsored by the National Mining Association concluded that most voters in eight coal-heavy states would not vote for a Senate candidate who supports EPA\u2019s proposal. Among those same voters, 47.1 percent supported the power plant emissions proposal and 37.3 percent opposed it.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Two-thirds of United States residents support the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) proposal to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions, according to a poll released Wednesday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.", "description": "Two-thirds of United States residents support the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) proposal to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions, according to a poll released Wednesday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Two-thirds of United States residents support the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) proposal to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions, according to a poll released Wednesday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Poll shows support for EPA\u2019s climate rules", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/209743-poll-shows-support-for-epas-climate-rules", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/209743-poll-shows-support-for-epas-climate-rules", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-18T09:17-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, power plants, carbon pollution,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-18T09:17:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/209743-poll-shows-support-for-epas-climate-rules", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Two-thirds of United States residents support the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) proposal to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions, according to a poll released Wednesday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll shows support for EPA\u2019s climate rules"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll shows support for EPA\u2019s climate rules"}, "article_summary": "The survey found that 37 percent of respondents strongly support EPA\u2019s proposal unveiled June 2, and 30 somewhat support it.\nThat is the highest approval rating for that question since NBC and the Wall Street Journal started asking it.\nAmong those same voters, 47.1 percent supported the power plant emissions proposal and 37.3 percent opposed it.\nTwo-thirds of United States residents support the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) proposal to reduce power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions, according to a poll released Wednesday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.\nThe NBC/Wall Street Journal survey came to a similar conclusion as a Bloomberg News survey a week prior."}
