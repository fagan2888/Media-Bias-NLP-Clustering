The glitch-ridden rollout of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2013 proved the federal government didn\u2019t possess the launch prowess of companies in the private sector, critics said. Homeland Security has beefed up its operations ahead of the launch of the expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which will cover an estimated five million undocumented immigrants who are parents of children born in the U.S.\n\nDHS leased a massive office building in Crystal City, Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C., where 2,000 federal workers and contractors will process applications, Fox News reported. The U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services predicted that 1.3 million people could apply for the program in the first six months. Supporters of the program have noted that taxpayers won\u2019t foot the bill for the expansion \u2013 applicants will pay a $465 fee -- and that the program is not mandatory for all undocumented immigrants.\n\nWith undocumented immigrants spread out all over the country, the proposed vetting process for applications have critics worried that the program is vulnerable to widespread fraud. \"Those employees are not going to ask people from all over the country to come to Crystal City to be interviewed,\u201d Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama said in the Fox News report. \u201cThey're not going to be effectively interviewed. They\u2019re going to do online most of their work.\"\n\nThe plan, officially known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, is estimated to cost $324 million to $484 million over the next few years, according to the Fox News report. The launch could face another substantial setback, if Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on a funding bill for Homeland Security before the agency runs out of money on Feb. 27.
