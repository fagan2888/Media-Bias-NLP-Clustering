This covers operations for leadership, committees and officers of the House, among other things.\n\nCapitol Police would receive $369 million under the bill, an increase of $21 million above the 2015 level. The Appropriations panel said this is meant to fund critical safety and security at the Capitol and to maintain public access to its buildings.\n\nThe Architect of the Capitol would receive nearly $497 million, which is $9 million below the 2015 level. The measure would provide authority for the renovation and restoration of the Cannon House Office Building.\n\nThe Library of Congress would receive $591 million, which is $510,000 above the 2015 level.\n\nThis is the third fiscal 2016 appropriations bill the panel has released so far. It is marking up the first two bills on Wednesday, which cover energy and water development as well as military construction projects and veterans benefits.\n\nThose last two bills are expected to hit the House floor next week.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "House Republicans are keeping the freeze on salaries in the annual funding bill.", "description": "House Republicans are keeping the freeze on salaries in the annual funding bill.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "House Republicans are keeping the freeze on salaries in the annual funding bill.", "title": "No pay raise for Congress in $3.3B bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/239687-house-panel-releases-33b-bill-to-fund-legislative-branch-operations", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/capitol_lead_hillfilephoto_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/239687-house-panel-releases-33b-bill-to-fund-legislative-branch-operations", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-22T11:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-22T11:06:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/239687-house-panel-releases-33b-bill-to-fund-legislative-branch-operations", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "House Republicans are keeping the freeze on salaries in the annual funding bill.", "card": "summary", "title": "No pay raise for Congress in $3.3B bill"}, "dcterms.title": "No pay raise for Congress in $3.3B bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce17c\"", "article_summary": "This is the third fiscal 2016 appropriations bill the panel has released so far.\nThe bill funds House operations at the 2015 level, which is $1.2 billion.\nCapitol Police would receive $369 million under the bill, an increase of $21 million above the 2015 level.\nThe House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday released a $3.3 billion bill to fund the operations of the legislative branch for fiscal 2016.\nThe measure would provide authority for the renovation and restoration of the Cannon House Office Building."}
