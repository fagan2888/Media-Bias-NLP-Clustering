This is a big deal. Why is no one covering that Ted Cruz is going down to the border for a relief program?\u201d SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Beck said Cruz\u2019s involvement is scarcely being mentioned because the left has to paint the senator as a \u201chater,\u201d and some on the right don\u2019t want to help a conservative that is not part of the Republican \u201cestablishment.\u201d \u201cThey cannot cover Ted Cruz going down to the border,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThis gives Ted Cruz the ammo to be tough on immigration, to be tough on justice. Once you have mercy established, you have credibility to talk about justice.\u201d \u201cIf [former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush] were going down, I guarantee you Fox News would be covering it,\u201d Beck added. \u201cNBC would have cameras there.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAnd the lack of coverage should tell you everything you need to know: We are already playing presidential games. We\u2019re already playing presidential games. Can\u2019t we not play games?\u201d\n\nI know Beck knows that\u2019s a rhetorical question. Consider Senator Cruz\u2019s efforts covered in these quarters. Here he is helping to unload supplies from a truck, in a photo borrowed from The Blaze\u2019s coverage of the relief effort:\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure this will all be very confusing for media folks determined to paint Cruz as an ogre because he\u2019s sponsoring legislation that would prevent President Obama from making the crisis worse with another irresponsible, unilateral amnesty giveaway, to be followed by bills that would give state governors authorization to deploy National Guard troops to the border, and remove \u201cthe current legal obstacles to humanely and expeditiously reuniting those minors with their families back home,\u201d as a statement from his office put it.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: the number one humanitarian priority at this moment is to stop Obama\u2019s border invasion. It\u2019s not only an assault on the American immigration system, and a drain on resources that should be used for the benefit of American citizens who need help \u2013 a point being made with increasing energy by people initially inclined to support anything Obama does. It\u2019s also extremely dangerous to the children who are being catapulted across the southern hemisphere, through dangerous terrain, in the company of dangerous people. That pictorial at The Blaze also includes a few chilling images captured during a predawn tour of the border, including an abandoned infant-size sneaker, and a child-sized life vest with a scorpion crawling on it.\n\nNothing will stop these people from coming until effective action to begin large-scale repatriation is under way. I don\u2019t even think we can pin all our hopes on beefed-up physical security, because that just means the squalid disease-ridden camps will blossom in northern Mexico instead of southern Texas, and that\u2019s no \u201csolution\u201d to those with genuine humanitarian concerns. In fact, it\u2019s a worse situation from that perspective.\n\nI criticized the way Glenn Beck talked about his big relief effort, particularly his aggressive self-victimization and claims nobody but him cared enough to do something like this, but he and everyone else participating deserves appreciation for actually doing something about a situation the Left created to use as political leverage. What happens to the actual people they employ as pawns doesn\u2019t matter that much to liberals, when it comes to illegal immigration or any other issue. Frankly, one reason I had to frown at some of Becks\u2019 rhetoric is that he knows as well as I do that when a large group of people are in need, especially children, you can\u2019t stop Americans from helping out. And that help is far better provided by hard-working volunteer charity than bloated government programs run by the same mindset that brought you ObamaCare and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit worrisome that shipments of supplies and toys might encourage more Central American families to try throwing their children into the coyote network. That won\u2019t be a much of a problem, though, if the kids (and far larger cohort of families and adults) are repatriated swiftly. There won\u2019t be that many people eager to risk their childrens\u2019 lives, and pay what little money they have to smugglers, if the children return a few months later with some bottled water and a Glenn Beck T-shirt as souvenirs from their journey.\n\nBut if Obama continues to serve as the Coyote-In-Chief (as Mark Steyn has dubbed him) by running a taxpayer-funded resettlement service that effective turns the young \u201crefugees\u201d into colonists, while the rest of the American political system talks about giving them citizenship plus benefits, the invasion will never stop. And considering how copiously the American people have been lied to by the Obama Administration, every step of the way throughout this disaster, I wager it\u2019ll be a while before some Friday-night document dump reveals how many of the children sent here from Central America have been abused and killed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz helps out with border relief effort", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz helps out with border relief effort", "title": "Ted Cruz helps out with border relief effort - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ted-Cruz-487x620.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/blog/2014/07/19/ted-cruz-helps-out-with-border-relief-effort/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz helps out with border relief effort", "title": "Ted Cruz helps out with border relief effort - Breitbart", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ted-Cruz-487x620.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Glenn Beck, Ted Cruz, The Blaze,The Conversation,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "The Conversation", "tag": "The Blaze", "published_time": "2014-07-19T12:59:45-07:00", "categories": "The Conversation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4ac\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis gives Ted Cruz the ammo to be tough on immigration, to be tough on justice.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: the number one humanitarian priority at this moment is to stop Obama\u2019s border invasion.\nWhy is no one covering that Ted Cruz is going down to the border for a relief program?\u201d SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Beck said Cruz\u2019s involvement is scarcely being mentioned because the left has to paint the senator as a \u201chater,\u201d and some on the right don\u2019t want to help a conservative that is not part of the Republican \u201cestablishment.\u201d \u201cThey cannot cover Ted Cruz going down to the border,\u201d Beck said.\nNothing will stop these people from coming until effective action to begin large-scale repatriation is under way.\n\u201cAnd the lack of coverage should tell you everything you need to know: We are already playing presidential games."}
