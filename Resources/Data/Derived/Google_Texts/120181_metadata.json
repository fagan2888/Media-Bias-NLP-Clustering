Buzz over fresh political leader Ward grows daily with talk that she is the \u201cDavid\u201d considering taking on threatened political \u201cGoliath,\u201d U.S. Senator John McCain, in the 2016 primary election.\n\nWard started out telling Boyle she\u2019s \u201cstill in the consideration phase,\u201d while she finishes out the current Arizona legislative session. She said this week she\u2019ll be focusing her efforts on her duties in the state Senate.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTurning to a recent McCain fundraising plea, Boyle mentioned that McCain seems \u201creally worried that he might not win\u201d his expected re-election bid to the Senate. Boyle asked Ward, \u201cWhy do you think it is that Senator McCain is really worried about re-election prospects?\u201d\n\nWard didn\u2019t speculate, but offered, \u201cI know here in Arizona there is some dissatisfaction with the representation that\u2019s been going down, at least the last couple of terms he\u2019s been in office. I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s as popular as he used to be, and maybe that worries him that there are people out there looking and thinking and considering jumping into that race.\u201d She continued, \u201cI have to say that I agree with Senator Cruz: It\u2019s time for the next generation of leadership to come in and to put America back on the right path.\u201d\n\nThe rising leader listed qualifications for elected officials heading into the future. \u201cI think we are going to need new leadership, fresh new faces at all levels, people with bold ideas, people who have backbones and people who have proven records,\u201d she said.\n\nBoyle recalled when McCain faced primary challenger J.D. Hayworth in 2010, and the Senator aired a border security ad in which he walked along the border and pledged to build \u201cthe danged\u201d border fence. But was the fence built?\n\n\u201cI would have to say, there is no danged fence!\u201d Ward told the listening audience in reference to the campaign claim. Not opposed to some virtual fencing, Ward said, \u201cWe have got to have a physical fence, we\u2019ve got to have people down there who are able to do that job, and then we\u2019ve got to enforce the laws that are in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be coming across our border and then getting lawyers in order to stay in the county for 6, 7, 8, 9 years before they even get a court case, then not show up to that court date because they\u2019re just lost in the United States somewhere.\u201d She continued, \u201cWe have to not provide amnesty to the people who have come here and broken our laws and expect to go to the front of the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of building the danged fence as Senator McCain promised he was going to in 2010,\u201d Boyle added, \u201cHe actually was one of the lead sponsors of the Gang of 8 Amnesty Bill.\u201d Given those facts, Boyle asked Ward if immigration would play a significant role in 2016.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that immigration and illegal immigration is still a hot button issue with the people of this state, and I think with the people of this country,\u201d Ward responded. \u201cThey\u2019re tired of seeing people break our laws and being rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nWard reminded the listening audience of all the citizens of foreign countries still waiting to come to America legally, including the family members of some of Ward\u2019s friends. \u201cWe have to stress that we want legal immigration. We want people to be able to come here and experience this great country. I want people to be able to live out the American dream.\u201d\n\nMcCain doesn\u2019t seem to want to bring attention to the immigration issue, Ward remarked, saying the Senator is likely aware of his unpopularity on the issue with the people of Arizona.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen Senator McCain on TV a lot lately, but at times being an apologist for the President\u2019s policies that I think are failing policies.\u201d She told the audience, \u201cI want to see somebody who\u2019s positive, who\u2019s passionate, who\u2019s principled in that Senate seat, working hard for Arizona.\u201d\n\nBoyle moved on to ask Ward more about why the medical doctor chose to get involved in government and run for state senate.\n\n\u201cThe thing that pushed me over the edge was Obamacare,\u201d Ward told Boyle. She recognized what she calls as assault on the liberty and freedom of her patients\u2019 healthcare. Ward told the audience that before she ran there were just a few physicians, liberals, who wanted \u201cbig medicine,\u201d \u201cbig government,\u201d socialized medicine, and \u201csingle-payer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not able to stop Medicaid expansion in Arizona,\u201d Ward said, \u201cWe fought a very hard battle here and lost.\u201d She noted that some Republicans joined state Democrats to push through the entitlement expansion. She went on:\n\nI want to take care of the people who can\u2019t take care of themselves. I want to take care of the poor. I want to take care of the elderly. I want to take care of the little children who are unable to care for themselves. There are people out there who can take care of themselves who are not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, who are not becoming productive members of society, who are not enjoying the success that being economically stable and being self-sufficient can bring, that happiness, that sense of achievement, because we the government are allowing them not to.\n\nBoyle asked Ward what difference it would make to have her bring her perspective as a medical professional that understands healthcare issues to the U.S. Senate should she decide to run and win.\n\nWard replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have people from the trenches, not only the people from the ivory tower in the position, people who have actually touched patients,\u201d saying she still practices part-time. After 16 years of experience, Ward said she brings with her not only her experience in primary care and emergency medicine, but also holds a master\u2019s degree in public health with an emphasis in health policy.\n\nWard aims to \u201cget the government out of healthcare and get people and doctors back together.\u201d\n\nBoyle questioned Ward over the McCain political machine, asking Ward about her recent reference on Mark Levin\u2019s radio program to her potential \u201cDavid and Goliath\u201d primary challenge to the long-sitting Senator.\n\nWard reminded the audience that McCain has, \u201cbeen in office for over 30 years,\u201d who has, \u201ctouched most of the political operatives throughout my entire state.\u201d She said McCain \u201chas that political machine in place.\u201d\n\nCountering McCain\u2019s infrastructure, Ward said, \u201cwhat I have on my side is the grassroots. The grassroots is on fire with the desire to have someone else in that seat.\u201d Ward said she\u2019s reaching out to a number of potential support bases in her contemplation of the challenge and looking into potential financial team members. She acknowledged the uphill battle in building the infrastructure that could rival McCain, pointing out that McCain has been in office before she could even vote.\n\n\u201cI think that people are ready for a change, but not just change for the sake of change, change for the sake of good,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something to take lightly. It is something that could potentially politically kill me if I decide to do this, but I didn\u2019t get into this to become a politician or have a life in politics.\u201d Ward continued, \u201cIf I were to take this on and not win, there\u2019s nothing that Senator McCain and his people could take away from me.\u201d\n\nWard suggested that part of what makes her different than the typical political class is, \u201cI\u2019m not just out there waiting for my next political opportunity. I\u2019m doing this because I want to represent the people of Arizona. I want government of, for, and by the people. I think you have to be of the people to be able to do that, and I think that maybe Senator McCain kind of lost touch with that, lost touch with being of the people over these last 30 years.\u201d\n\nThose interested in learning more about Kelli Ward and her potential primary challenge of Senator McCain were told they can visit Kelli Ward for Arizona on Facebook, @KelliWardAZ on Twitter.
