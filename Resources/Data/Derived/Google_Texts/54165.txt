Commuters in and out of New York Penn Station Wednesday adjusted travel plans on the fly as the Amtrak train derailment north of Philadelphia Tuesday evening impacted the northeast region.

There was no Amtrak service between New York and Philadelphia Wednesday, but New Jersey Transit was honoring Amtrak tickets between New York City and Trenton, the railroad said, as it worked to provide modified services between Washington D.C. and Boston.

Amtrak services between New York and Albany-Rensselaer; New Haven and Springfield, Mass., and other points would operate, officials said, with additional updates when available at: http://blog.amtrak.com/2015/05/amtrak-northeast-regional-train-188-north-philadelphia/.

With southbound service canceled out of New York City’s Penn Station, some stymied travelers headed to the Port Authority Bus Terminal to catch buses out of town.

Dave Driesch, 58 years old, was one of three priests from an abbey outside Philadelphia who traveled to New York City by train Tuesday to see Les Miserables on Broadway. On Wednesday morning, the trio bought bus tickets at the Greyhound desk in Port Authority. Their 2 p.m. return train to Philadelphia had been cancelled.

“I got a text message last night from my sister” about the crash, Mr. Driesch said. His reaction: “shock.”

Will Rogers, 42, had been planning to return to his native Atlanta on a 10:30 a.m. train, but realized Wednesday that wasn’t going to happen and was also preparing to board a Greyhound at Port Authority.

He said he’d never taken a long distance bus trip before. “I’m not very happy about it,” he said.
