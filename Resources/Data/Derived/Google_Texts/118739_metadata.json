It\u2019s not shocking, but no less frustrating. Words mean things and they have consequences so you would hope that those given the responsibility of covering the disease to the public would behave responsibly. Then again, who cares about responsibility so long as you make headlines?\n\nRELATED: 2nd Ebola Victim Amber Vinson Wanted To Be Nurse Since Childhood\n\nFox News contributor, psychiatrist, and village idiot Keith Ablow has already managed to racialize Ebola. While appearing on \u201cMedical A-Team,\u201d Ablow continued his shtick as the KKK Frasier and argued that President Barack Obama is failing to protect the country from Ebola due to \u201caffinities, his affiliations are with\u201d Africa and \u201cnot us \u2026 He\u2019s their leader.\u201d\n\nAblow went on to liken America to a hostage with Stockholm Syndrome under the assertion that we elected a man who dislikes the country to which he leads. Not to be outdone, Ablow decided to highlight that Obama \u201chas names very similar to two of our archenemies: Osama, well, Obama. And Hussein.\u201d\n\nAgain, this is a man who is not only a psychiatrist, but has actually been asked to appear on national television and say these things.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that Chris Brown wasn\u2019t asked to appear on the show and repeat his theory that Ebola is being used as a means of population control. If the booking agent is reading this, I\u2019ll be happy to recommend the person I only know as \u201cthat fool in front of the bodega\u201d to offer his medical expertise too.\n\nRELATED: Chris Brown: Is Ebola \u2018Population Control?\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, there are members of the press trying to make the case that the \u201cEbola crisis\u201d in the United States will become \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina.\u201d Writing for The Hill, Justin Sink declares,\n\n\u201cThe Ebola crisis in the United States has become an anchor threatening to sink the Obama presidency.\u201d\n\nSink keeps the hyperbole going by comparing the one person dying from Ebola in the United States to the Bush administration\u2019s gross mishandling of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nAnyone arguing that Ebola is \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d can dip their head in a hot pot of red beans & rice. While we\u2019re at it, they can choke on a boudin ball too. There is no comparison between what\u2019s happening right now in Dallas to what happened in New Orleans. That is disrespectful to those who died and to those who still have yet to truly recover from the gross negligence they suffered from in 2005.\n\nSink is not the only one trying to make fetch happen with respect to Ebola dooming the Obama presidency.\n\nTalking Press Memo\u2019s Dylan Scott also highlighted the New York Times\u2019 Michael Barbaro theorizing that Ebola could define the Obama presidency more than the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSeriously? One of the biggest legislative achievements in modern history will be ignored due to the death of a single person.\n\nAnd when members of the press aren\u2019t trying to doom the Obama presidency, they\u2019re continuing to play racial politics in terms of how we cover those who contract the disease.\n\nIn \u201cThe problem with the West\u2019s Ebola Response Is Still Fear of a Black Patient,\u201d Hannah Giorgis notes that Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died from Ebola in Dallas, was not given favorable coverage given his background: Black, poor, and African.\n\nGiorgis writes:\n\nA Dallas hospital turned away the uninsured Liberian immigrant after an initial exam concluded he suffered only from a \u201clow-grade viral disease\u201d, and the media turned him into the unsympathetic, undeserving face of a contagion with which the West is frantically grappling. He \u2013 and the West Africans to whom he is tied by both birth and cause of death \u2013 have become nothing more than disease vectors responsible for infecting innocent western health workers, tarnishing pristine nations by importing the blemish of an African scourge. And yet, American citizenship alone does not sanitize the blight of Blackness; Amber Joy Vinson, the second healthcare worker diagnosed with the virus, is already being met with scrutiny as Nina Pham\u2019s quarantined dog receives an outpouring of support.\n\nLaura Seay and Kim Yi Dionne echo this sentiment in their Washington Post piece,\u201dThe Long and Ugly Tradition of Treating Africa as a Dirty, Diseased Place,\u201d which begins with Newsweek\u2019s latest magazine cover: an image of a chimpanzee behind the words (pictured), \u201cA Back Door for Ebola: Smuggled Bushmeat Could Spark a U.S. Epidemic.\u201d\n\nThis has serious ramifications.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that two Pennsylvania soccer coaches have resigned after complaints their players hurled Ebola taunts at an opponent from West Africa. The boy is 16, from Guinea, and reportedly \u201cworries about his parents given the Ebola outbreak there.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need or deserve this treatment.\n\nBy the way, feel free to treat the latest issue of Newsweek as toilet paper.\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I\u2019d like to quote a FOX News anchor on all of this.\n\nOn Wednesday, Shepherd Smith proved once again why more times than not, he stands in a unique space on FOX News as the only person with even a minuscule amount of sense. In response to much of the coverage about Ebola making its way Stateside, Smith was clear: \u201cGiven what we know now, you should have no concerns about about Ebola. None.\u201d As for those who have suggested otherwise, Smith made the most appropriate suggestion: \u201cDo not listen to the hysterical voices on the radio or the television or read the fear-provoking words online. The people who say and write hysterical things are being very irresponsible.\u201d\n\nAnd they all need to grow up.\n\nRELATED: President Appoints Former Biden Chief Of Staff Rob Klain As Ebola \u2018Czar\u2019\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem, and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.
