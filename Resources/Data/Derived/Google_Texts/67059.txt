PA-9: Halvorson Goes After Shuster in New TV Ad (VIDEO)

Written by Chris Calabrese, Contributing Writer

Art Halvorson released a new ad today directed toward his GOP primary opponent, Congressman Bill Shuster.

The commercial blasts the Congressman’s voting record by claiming Shuster “sold out” and supported Planned Parenthood, Obamacare and amnesty among other things.

It also mentions Shuster’s relationship with an airline lobbyist.

“Our country is in deep trouble because of career politicians like Bill Shuster and their betrayal,” Halvorson spokesman Joe Sterns said. “Come election day, Republican primary voters will have a clear choice between Shuster and Art Halvorson, a principled conservative who will help rescue America by leading with integrity on Republican values and priorities,” Sterns added.

Sterns also noted that the thirty-second spot could not give them enough time to really go through “the depth of Shuster’s betrayal”.

The two will face off in their rematch of 2014 on April 26th.
