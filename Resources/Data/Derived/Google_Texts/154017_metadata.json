As I\u2019ve written before, the GOP thought that if it could just harness the righteous anger of the religious right, and the zealous bitterness of the Tea Party, they could ride both movements to repeated electoral victory.\n\nBut, to mix my metaphors, if you\u2019re going to ride a tiger, you\u2019d better kill it. At some point, the tiger\u2019s gonna turn on you. Especially if you keep feeding it.\n\nThe GOP has been taken over at the local level by the religious right, and at the national level by the Tea Party (who are basically ultra-conservative Republicans). Both movements may have helped Republicans electorally for a while, but now they\u2019ve poisoned the party and are putting the entire country at risk.\n\nIt\u2019s beyond abominable that, by threatening to default on the national debt, the Republicans have taken the nation hostage, and are now threatening to send us into a depression far worse than what happened in September of 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed.\n\nIt was bad enough, in the early years of the Obama administration, when the GOP was content with holding the unemployed, the poor and the elderly hostage by threatening unemployment insurance, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Now they\u2019re looking to take down the entire world economy in a move that far too many experts, including Republicans themselves, have labeled \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t care how bad the Republicans think Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act is, how does a politician \u2013 how does any American \u2013 get away with taking the entire nation hostage, for any reason?\n\nIn less democratic countries, such a move would be treated as sedition, and they\u2019d all be under arrest, or worse.\n\nThe GOP has become what it has long claimed of Democrats: un-American bullies who don\u2019t like our system of government, and don\u2019t particularly care for most of our people either.\n\nWhat kind of person would threaten our retirement accounts AGAIN by threatening to crash the stock market?\n\nWhat kind of person would threaten to poison up our mortgage market AGAIN by sending interest rates skyrocketing?\n\nAll of that, and more, is going to happen if the Republicans force a default on the national debt.\n\nThe economy has been bad enough since September of 2008 \u2013 I\u2019m still only at 40% to 50% of the annual income I made in 2008. Neither I, nor the country, can afford another economic crash.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what the Republicans are threatening.\n\nTo crash our economy into a building.\n\nEnough.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the longer 5 minute video of that segment:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The movie was War Games, circa 1983.
