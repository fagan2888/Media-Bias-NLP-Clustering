Owner Arthur Blank recently said an agreement would come soon, and he has consistently said he wants Jones to play his full career with the Falcons.\n\nJones learned the deal was done while the Falcons were warming up for the game. Blank came on the field and they shared a hug.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any doubt in my mind we\u2019d get it done - if not this year, next year,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI want to be a Falcon the rest of my career, and Mr. Blank let it be known he wanted me here as well.\u201d\n\nThe deal, which keeps Jones in Atlanta through the 2020 season, includes guarantees of $47.5 million. His average salary during the contract is $14.25 million, and his motivation won\u2019t change, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to say I have to turn it on. I\u2019m already on.\u201d\n\nJones was set to earn about $10 million this year, the last season of a four-year deal.\n\nTwo other top NFL receivers, Denver\u2019s Demaryius Thomas and Dez Bryant of Dallas, signed $70 million contracts this year.\n\n\u201cJulio\u2019s really everything we love in terms of a player, off the field and on the field,\u201d Blank said after the game in Miami. \u201cHe will be a major anchor for us going forward.\u201d\n\nJones set career highs with 104 catches and a franchise-record 1,593 yards receiving last season. It was an important bounce-back season for the former Alabama star following the 2013 surgery to repair the fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot. He broke the same bone in the foot in 2011.\n\nJones has looked strong and quick this preseason. He caught four passes from Matt Ryan, including one for a touchdown, on the Falcons\u2019 first preseason possession against Tennessee. He sat out the game in Miami.\n\nIn his first four seasons, Jones has 278 receptions for 4,330 yards and 26 touchdowns. He earned Pro Bowl selections in 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Falcons\u2019 big investment in Jones began with a bold trade with Cleveland to move up in the 2011 draft. In order to make Jones the No. 6 overall pick, the Falcons traded first-round picks in 2011 and 2012, its 2011 second- and fourth-round picks and its 2012 fourth-round selection.\n\nNow he\u2019s paired with new coach Dan Quinn, who applauded the extension.\n\n\u201cHe really represents all the things I love about football - the attitude, the effort, the style,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really unique player, and I can\u2019t wait to coach him for a long time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Atlanta Falcons agreed to a $71.25 million, five-year contract extension with Julio Jones on Saturday that compares favorably with recent deals paid to other top wide receivers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons agreed to a $71.25 million, five-year contract extension with Julio Jones on Saturday that compares favorably with recent deals paid to other top wide receivers.", "title": "Falcons announce 5-year contract extension for Julio Jones", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/falcons-announce-5-year-contract-extension-for-jul/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/27/4b8f9f2a50d63826800f6a7067009ffa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/27/4b8f9f2a50d63826800f6a7067009ffa.jpg", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons agreed to a $71.25 million, five-year contract extension with Julio Jones on Saturday that compares favorably with recent deals paid to other top wide receivers.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Falcons announce 5-year contract extension for Julio Jones"}, "Author": "CHARLES ODUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c9c\"", "article_summary": "ATLANTA (AP) - The Atlanta Falcons agreed to a $71.25 million, five-year contract extension with Julio Jones on Saturday that compares favorably with recent deals paid to other top wide receivers.\nJones learned the deal was done while the Falcons were warming up for the game.\nThe deal, announced by the team before Saturday night\u2019s preseason game at Miami, was expected.\nThe Falcons\u2019 big investment in Jones began with a bold trade with Cleveland to move up in the 2011 draft.\nHe caught four passes from Matt Ryan, including one for a touchdown, on the Falcons\u2019 first preseason possession against Tennessee."}
