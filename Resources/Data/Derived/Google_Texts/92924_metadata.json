NFL telecasts\u2014particularly on Sunday nights\u2013always the top program in its timeslot. 30 million people\u2014including over five million women\u2014now play Fantasy Football. Needless to say, Commissioner Roger Goodell is one of the most powerful men in the country right now.\n\n\n\nSo that\u2019s why it was shocking to see that three playoff games this weekend in Green Bay, Cincinnati and Indianapolis\u2026actually hadn\u2019t sold out yet. What makes this development particularly interesting from a television perspective is the NFL\u2019s antiquated blackout rule, which states if a team doesn\u2019t sell every last seat (in this case by 4:35 PM EST Friday), the game gets blacked out locally in the home team\u2019s market. Considering many of these stadiums were built on the backs of taxpayers, not allowing them to watch their team because they\u2019re not reaching deeper into their wallets is (for lack of a better term)\u2026rich.\n\nIn Ohio the situation has now become political, where Senator Sherrod Brown (D) is livid that Bengals\u2019 fans at home may not be able to see its team take on the San Diego Chargers in this weekend\u2019s Wild Card round.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable at a time when the price of attending games continues to rise and the economy is not yet where it needs to be,\u201d Brown said in the letter sent Thursday. \u201cFans, through local taxes, often help pay for the stadiums. They should be able to cheer on their local teams, especially during the playoffs.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the rule antiquated is simply a matter of revenue and how it gets generated. Back in the 1973 when the rule was first introduced, NFL teams largely depended on ticket sales for the bulk of its revenue. That aspect has drastically changed with the improvement of television (cable, larger screens, more camera angles, invention of high-def, etc.), resulting in rights fees going from millions then to billions now. Consequently, ticket sales are basically an afterthought now\u2026it\u2019s truly all about the tube and networks outbidding each other for the monster ratings that come with the package.\n\nIronically, technology has made the league what it is now, but in the process has assisted in hurting it at the gate. With HD and relatively affordable flat screens populating an increasing amount of living rooms across the country, the experience of watching a game at home has become so awesome, the urge to attend a game live has diminished.\n\nAfter all, why spend 6-8 hours of a day off battling stadium traffic, pay insane parking fees (locally here at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the cost for parking alone is $250.00 for eight regular season home games), drop hundreds on just halfway-decent tickets, pay $10 for ONE beer, and be subjected to overserved idiots when you can have a better, infinitely more cost-effective game experience without ever leaving your home?\n\nAnd if you live in Green Bay or Milwaukee, not leaving the homestead means avoiding certain frostbite that comes from sitting outdoors in minus-30-degree wind chills, as is the forecast this Sunday\u2019s 49ers-Packers tilt. But remember, the league says if you don\u2019t help buy up the remaining 5000 tickets available at Lambeau Field, you\u2019re not seeing this game in any capacity. Ironic considering the Pack\u2013which is publicly owned\u2013has sold out every regular season game since 1959.\n\nSo should the NFL punish its fan base by blacking out games because they fall a few thousand seats shy of selling out a game, particularly when the money generated isn\u2019t remotely as crucial as it used to be?\n\nIs TV technology now compelling fans to stay home?\n\nThe answers, respectively, are no and yes.\n\nNo other league owns the hearts and minds (and wallets) America today.\n\nIf the Commissioner knows right from wrong, he\u2019d punt on the whole blackout rule.\n\nNow.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Joe Concha on Twitter @ConchaMedia", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to ranking the popularity of professional sport leagues, there\u2019s the National Football League\u2026and there\u2019s everyone else. $10 billion annually in", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pack-e1388757950195.gif", "title": "Antiquated and Asinine: NFL\u2019s Outdated TV Blackout Rule May Sack Three Cities This Weekend"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mediaite", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pack-e1388757950195.gif", "description": "When it comes to ranking the popularity of professional sport leagues, there\u2019s the National Football League\u2026and there\u2019s everyone else. $10 billion annually in revenues.
