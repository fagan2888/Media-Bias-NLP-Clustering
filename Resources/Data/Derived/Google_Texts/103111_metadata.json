The first was to never call someone a liar, which was considered the worst character indictment one could issue. The accuser had best be prepared to fight or be fleet of foot.\n\nThe other was a dictum so oft- repeated that it is permanently tattooed on my brain: \u201cIf you\u2019ll lie by omission, you\u2019ll lie by commission.\u201d\n\nThis first rule sheds light on why it was so shocking when in 2009 Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) shouted, \u201cYou lie,\u201d as President Obama was addressing Congress. Beyond an insult to decorum, it was widely viewed as another tipping point in our descent into incivility.\n\nNow that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, has been released upon the land \u2014 sort of \u2014 Wilson is being regaled in Republican quarters as the voice of Cassandra, though his outburst was prompted by Obama\u2019s saying the ACA wouldn\u2019t insure illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe big lie,\u201d as the president\u2019s broken Obamacare promise is now known, was that everyone could keep his or her doctor and insurance policy under the ACA. No one, Americans were justified in inferring, would be remotely inconvenienced by Obamacare. Instead, the reality is well-known: Millions are expected to lose their insurance policies, while others will see their premiums skyrocket.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

But it is not possible to pretend that the American people have been told the truth. Nor is it possible to pretend that Barack Obama has been completely honest.\n\nThe question is, how much dishonesty from a president is tolerable? How can a dishonest president lead a nation? The truth is, if the president were not immune from such things, the American people could file a class-action suit on grounds that they were sold a product under false pretenses. In the private sector, we call that fraud.\n\nNow the White House tells us that Obama always meant you could keep the insurance policy you like if it met the standards of the ACA. Apparently, plenty of people involved with the law, including the House minority whip, Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who recently said so, have known for at least three years that between 40 percent and 67 percent of those in the individual market would lose their policies.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney explained: \u201cWhat the president said, and what everybody said all along, is that there are going to be changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act that create minimum standards of coverage, minimum services that every insurance plan has to provide. . . . So it\u2019s true that there are existing health-care plans on the individual market that don\u2019t meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nWell, as the guardian of the Emerald City gates said to Dorothy: \u201cBust my buttons! Why didn\u2019t you say that in the first place?\u201d\n\nWe know why. This sin of omission wasn\u2019t an accidental oversight. It was a feint because many Americans wouldn\u2019t have followed the wizard had they known the truth.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the ACA implemented the popular aspects of the bill first \u2014 allowing parents to cover their children until age 26 and eliminating their children\u2019s preexisting-condition barrier to insurance coverage \u2014 before the 2012 election and postponed the nasty news until enough people were hooked on Obamacare\u2019s sugar. And, of course, after the president was reelected. This is what Republicans were referring to when they wanted to impede the law before the rollout because people might like it. Sugar is addictive after all.\n\nFormer Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tried to explain otherwise. The president kept repeating the promise \u2014 some 23 times \u2014 because the White House was trying to keep things simple so as not to confuse people with too many details, he said. This is not only insulting on its face but also not precisely true. Some might have been alarmed by the details, but they wouldn\u2019t have been confused. Either the White House doesn\u2019t have faith in the people or it doesn\u2019t have faith in its own plan.\n\nTo sum up, the American people were duped; the administration did not misspeak, as the New York Times editorialized. The administration knowingly misled with a false promise and a deliberate omission. Worse, it did so for your own good because you might be confused by the truth. Call it what you will.\n\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The problem of Obama\u2019s selling of his health-care law.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The problem of Obama\u2019s selling of his health-care law.", "title": "Kathleen Parker: The sin of omission in Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-the-sin-of-omission-in-obamacare/2013/11/05/ad45eb2e-464a-11e3-bf0c-cebf37c6f484_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/03936128-1905.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kathleenparker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-the-sin-of-omission-in-obamacare/2013/11/05/ad45eb2e-464a-11e3-bf0c-cebf37c6f484_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker washington post, kathleen parker column, obamacare, obamacare promise, obama promises insurance, health insurance, obama lies, obama lies obamacare, obama lies health insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathleenparker"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ad45eb2e-464a-11e3-bf0c-cebf37c6f484", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Kathleen Parker, kathleen parker washington post, kathleen parker column, obamacare, obamacare promise, obama promises insurance, health insurance, obama lies, obama lies obamacare, obama lies health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5d3\"", "article_summary": "Either the White House doesn\u2019t have faith in the people or it doesn\u2019t have faith in its own plan.\n\u201cThe big lie,\u201d as the president\u2019s broken Obamacare promise is now known, was that everyone could keep his or her doctor and insurance policy under the ACA.\nIt was a feint because many Americans wouldn\u2019t have followed the wizard had they known the truth.\nRead more from Kathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.\nNow the White House tells us that Obama always meant you could keep the insurance policy you like if it met the standards of the ACA."}
