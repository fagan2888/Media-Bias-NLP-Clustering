When that person tried to find out if Washington needed help, he refused to speak or roll down the window, she said.\n\n\n\nPolice were then called to the Gleneagles Community Centre, by witnesses who saw Washington drive into the ditch, then continue to rev his engine.\n\n\n\nThe police officer who attended described Washington as \u201cstumbling all over the road\u201d after he was asked to get out of his truck.\n\n\n\nWashington was taken back to the West Vancouver police detachment, where he blew breathalyzer blood alcohol readings of .110 and .100. The legal limit is .08.\n\n\n\nWashington was originally charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. Under an agreement between Crown and defence lawyers, those charges were dropped and Washington pleaded guilty to the less serious Motor Vehicle Act offence.\n\n\n\nMatthew Nathanson, Washington\u2019s defence lawyer, said his client\u2019s unusual behaviour that night was caused by a reaction to a prescription sleeping pill he\u2019d taken that night. Nathanson said Washington had never taken the drug before and didn\u2019t know how it would affect him.\n\n\n\nHe added some of Washington\u2019s \u201cbizarre behaviour\u201d that night was \u201ctotally inconsistent with alcohol\u201d but consistent with a reaction to the sleeping pill he\u2019d taken. He added Washington has very little recollection of what happened.\n\n\n\nNathanson noted Washington does significant work in the community, including being involved in foundations that work with at-risk youth and adults and has already completed 20 hours of community work service. \u201cThis behaviour is not typical of his character,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nJudge Doug Moss handed Washington a $2,000 fine in addition to the three-month driving ban. \u201cIn my view, your driving was quite dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe judge noted Washington only lives a short distance from the yacht club. \u201cYou could have walked home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Times Colonist", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kyle Washington, the executive chairman of Seaspan Corp. \u2014 a global shipping company that works out of Vancouver's port \u2014 has been handed a three-month driving, ban but avoided a criminal record . . .", "title": "Seaspan chairman handed driving ban after crash near West Vancouver Yacht Club", "og": {"site_name": "Times Colonist", "description": "Kyle Washington, the executive chairman of Seaspan Corp. \u2014 a global shipping company that works out of Vancouver's port \u2014 has been handed a three-month driving, ban but avoided a criminal record . . .", "title": "Seaspan chairman handed driving ban after crash near West Vancouver Yacht Club", "url": "http://www.timescolonist.com/news/b-c/seaspan-chairman-handed-driving-ban-after-crash-near-west-vancouver-yacht-club-1.1975185", "image": "http://www.timescolonist.com/polopoly_fs/1.978487.1398105534!/fileImage/httpImage/tc-facebook-logo-156x154.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.timescolonist.com/polopoly_fs/1.978487.1398105534!/fileImage/httpImage/tc-facebook-logo-156x154.png", "description": "Kyle Washington, the executive chairman of Seaspan Corp. \u2014 a global shipping company that works out of Vancouver's port \u2014 has been handed a three-month driving, ban but avoided a criminal record . . .", "site": "@timescolonist", "card": "summary", "title": "Seaspan chairman handed driving ban after crash near West Vancouver Ya"}, "author": "Jane Seyd", "robots": "NOODP", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 589634334411994}, "msvalidate.01": "B35552358D0685310DF5A3DE206352FA", "MobileOptimized": 320, "DC.creator": "Jane Seyd", "keywords": "Victoria, B.C., British Columbia, news, Vancouver Island, capital region", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/timescolonist", "section": "News"}, "DC.title": "Seaspan chairman handed driving ban after crash near West Vancouver Yacht Club", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Victoria, B.C., British Columbia, news, Vancouver Island, capital region"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2ffc\"", "article_summary": "Washington was taken back to the West Vancouver police detachment, where he blew breathalyzer blood alcohol readings of .110 and .100.\nWashington was originally charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08.\nJudge Doug Moss handed Washington a $2,000 fine in addition to the three-month driving ban.\nNathanson noted Washington does significant work in the community, including being involved in foundations that work with at-risk youth and adults and has already completed 20 hours of community work service.\nThe judge noted Washington only lives a short distance from the yacht club."}
