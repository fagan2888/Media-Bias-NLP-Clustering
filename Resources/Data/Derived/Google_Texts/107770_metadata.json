The Mass traditionally marks the start of the court year, including the opening of the Supreme Court term.\n\nWashington Notable cases from Catholic perspective on Supreme Court docket By PATRICIA ZAPOR, Catholic News Service | Published October 10, 2013\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nHHS Mandate The Supreme Court will be asked to consider lower court cases over the requirement of the Affordable Care Act that most employers provide free coverage of contraceptives in employee health plans. A key case is that of Hobby Lobby, whose Christian owners object on moral grounds to the requirement that they provide emergency contraceptive coverage\u2014such as the morning-after pill or Plan B. The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to review a ruling of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of Hobby Lobby.\n\nWASHINGTON (CNS)\u2014The Supreme Court\u2019s docket for the term beginning Oct. 7 is notable\u2014from the perspective of the Catholic Church\u2014for a handful of cases accepted or in the pipeline that would refine previous rulings on free speech, public prayer and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe docket so far lacks cases that would appear to be of wide-reaching significance, like last year\u2019s rulings on same-sex marriage, the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action at colleges. But there are several challenges bubbling up from lower courts which the court could add to the calendar, over aspects of the national health care law and its requirement that most employers cover contraceptives free of charge in their health plan for workers.\n\nOn Nov. 6, the court will consider whether it\u2019s appropriate for the town council of Greece, N.Y., to open its sessions with a prayer. The case may test the reach of a previous ruling that permitted prayers in legislatures as \u201ca tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.\u201d The case is Greece v. Galloway.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the practice in Greece violates the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment of the Constitution. Although the town allows the prayer to be offered in any faith tradition, the court found that because the vast majority of the prayers were specifically Christian, with sectarian references to Jesus and \u201cyour son,\u201d and there was little effort to broaden the type of prayers offered, the practice is unconstitutional.\n\nAmong the issues likely to be raised as distinguishing the town council from state legislatures that were the subject of previous case law, is that at the local government level, applicants for permits or zoning may be required to appear at the meetings, where they might be subjected to unwelcome prayers. Participating in sessions of legislatures, on the other hand, is voluntary.\n\nThe protest buffer zone around an abortion clinic in Massachusetts is the focal point of another case involving the First Amendment as well as the 14th Amendment\u2019s right to equal protection under the law. The case, McCullen v. Coakley, has been accepted by the court, but as of Oct. 4 had not yet been put on the calendar for oral arguments. It could be heard as early as January.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops joined an \u201camicus,\u201d or friend-of-the-court brief, with nearly a dozen religious organizations calling for the Supreme Court to overturn a 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld a Massachusetts law on activities around abortion clinics. The law prohibits protesters from being on public sidewalks or rights-of-way within 35 feet of the entrance, exit or driveway of a \u201creproductive health care facility,\u201d though it applies only at abortion clinics and exempts many categories of people, observed the American Bar Association\u2019s online preview of the case.\n\nIt summarized: \u201cIn effect, the law restricts the speech of only those who wish to use public areas near abortion clinics to speak about abortion from a different point of view.\u201d\n\nThe brief the USCCB joined, led by the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, argues that the high court\u2019s 2000 ruling in Hill v. Colorado, whose precedent was cited by the 1st Circuit in upholding the Massachusetts law, was wrongly decided.\n\n\u201cHill\u2019s analysis charts a course for government manipulation of the public forum to suppress unwanted expression,\u201d said the brief\u2019s summary. \u201cIt exalts form over substance.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 10, the court will take up Mayorkas v. Cuellar, which challenges how the Board of Immigration Appeals deals with the problem of a decades-long backlog for certain types of immigration applications.\n\nOne example cited in the petition to the court to take the case was of a man whose U.S. citizen sister applied for a visa on his behalf, including his then-minor daughter as a derivative beneficiary. By the time the petition for the man was granted a decade later, his daughter was over 21 and ruled ineligible to receive a visa derived through her aunt. She would have to begin the process again, as a beneficiary of her father\u2019s status, beginning another multi-year wait.\n\nIn its ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the practice of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services violates a 2002 law, the Child Status Protection Act.\n\nThe court also will be asked to consider cases from lower courts over a requirement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that most employers provide free coverage of contraceptives in employee health plans.\n\nUnder final rules from the Department of Health and Human Services implementing the requirement there is an exemption for some religious bodies that fit certain criterion in the Internal Revenue Code. HHS also has an accommodation for religious ministries that do not fit the exemption but morally oppose the mandate: They can use a third-party to provide the coverage.\n\nBut dozens of Catholic dioceses, colleges and other religious institutions have sued over the mandate, saying the exemption is too narrow.\n\nA second category of lawsuits against the mandate have been filed by the owners of several for-profit businesses who object to it on moral grounds; secular companies are not exempt.\n\nAmong them is arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby. The Christian owners of the Oklahoma-based chain specifically object on moral grounds to that part of the mandate requiring they provide emergency contraceptive coverage\u2014such as the morning-after pill or Plan B\u2014saying that violates their religious freedom.\n\nThe family has no moral objection to be covering \u201cpreventive contraceptives\u201d and will continue to cover those for employees.\n\nThere\u2019s been a mixed bag of lower court rulings on the HHS mandate lawsuits. Most recently, a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Sept. 17 that a Michigan business must comply with the mandate even though the Catholic owner is morally opposed to such coverage.\n\nOn Sept. 19, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to review a ruling of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said Hobby Lobby could proceed with its request for an injunction protecting it from having to implement the mandate. In a June ruling, the Circuit Court remanded Hobby Lobby\u2019s request for an injunction back to a federal District Court.\n\nIn July, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of appeals ruled that a Mennonite-owned company had to comply with the HHS mandate, because as a for-profit secular corporation it \u201ccannot engage in religious exercise\u201d and therefore is not protected by either the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (CNS)\u2014The Supreme Court\u2019s docket for the term beginning Oct. 7 is notable\u2014from the perspective of the Catholic Church\u2014for a handful of cases accepted or in the pipeline that would refine previous rulings on free speech, public prayer and the Affordable Care Act.
