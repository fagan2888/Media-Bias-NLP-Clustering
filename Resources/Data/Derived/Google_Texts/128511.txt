The Mesa County Coroner on Sunday identified a 60-year-old Grand Junction resident as the man involved in a fatal motorcycle accident on Saturday.

Gary Willis was riding the motorcycle when it struck the side of a truck about 3 p.m. Saturday.

The cause of death is blunt force trauma, according to a coronerâ€™s office release.

Willis was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.

The Colorado State Patrol responded to the crash at the intersection of D Road and East Grove Drive, but turned the investigation over to local police because it occurred inside city limits, according to The Daily Sentinel.

According to police, the driver of the truck was headed east on D Road when he turned onto East Grove Drive in front of the motorcycle, the Sentinel said.
