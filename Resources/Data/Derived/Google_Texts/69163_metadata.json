They, together with Brett Welch of ACHC and Patricia Barrett of NCQA, shared their views about health reform and its impact on accreditation-related products and offerings.\n\nACHC\n\nThere are many payers and managed care organizations that are looking at accreditation as a means of assuring the quality of providers, says Britt Welch, Behavioral Health Clinical Manager with the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC), which offers Behavioral Health Accreditation for psychiatric home care, case management, community support, day treatment, outpatient treatment, and psychosocial rehabilitation. \u201cI\u2019m hearing more and more about states looking at accreditation standards as a way of reducing some licensing requirements,\u201d he says, adding that these states are establishing a deeming process whereby accredited providers are considered as having met select state standards.\n\nStates are also depending on more managed care organizations (MCOs) to manage Medicaid programs, another important factor in the increased demand for accreditation. Often the MCOs are using performance-based contracting, says Welch. \u201cThey\u2019re also looking at providers\u2019 ability to integrate behavioral health and medical care,\u201d he adds, noting that this is a national trend. \u201cIntegration, sometimes called bi-directional care, can lead to cost savings and improved outcomes,\u201d says Welch.\n\nIntegrated care can also be a means for overcoming the effects of stigma, which can prevent people from accessing appropriate care, says Welch. \u201cMany people with a mental illness will go in to see their therapist. But if they have to go to another location for physical care, they may not go for any number of reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can bring behavioral health and medical care under one roof, you can improve overall outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn response to this trend, Cary, North Carolina-based ACHC has standards that are specific to integrated care. These standards can apply to a behavioral health practice that is trying to integrate medical aspects of care, or to a primary care practice that is integrating behavioral health, says Welch. \u201cWe are also in the development of health home standards.\u201d\n\nHealth homes are a key concept in the Affordable Care Act. These organizations encourage patients to get all of their medical needs met, or at least coordinated, in one place.\n\n\u201cWe also have standards that address supportive employment,\u201d says Welch. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just the healthcare piece,\u201d he adds, noting that people with behavioral health concerns have needs that go outside traditional medical services, such as housing and employment.\n\nThe total ACHC accreditation fee depends on the complexity of the organization, the number of locations, and the types of services offered. A $1,500 deposit is applied toward that amount.\n\nACHC was established 27 years ago when a group of private duty nursing providers in North Carolina wanted standards that fit better with what they did on a day-in day-out basis, says Welch. \u201cOver the years we have added a variety of accreditation offerings, such as home health and hospice, durable medical equipment, prosthetic fitting services, retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and convenient care,\u201d he says. Behavioral health accreditation is one of ACHC\u2019s newer offerings.\n\nACHC\u2019s accreditation is for three years. Accreditation decisions include: accredited, deferred, dependent, or accreditation denied. \u201cWe do require a plan of correction if there are areas of deficiency,\u201d says Welch. \u201cTo better assist our customers, we have tried to take the guesswork out of developing plans of correction,\u201d he says. ACHC is specific about what the deficiency is, and helps guide providers in what needs to be corrected. \u201cWe provide that information through on-site education and in the summary of findings report, which is sent to the provider following the on-site survey,\u201d says Welch. \u201cWe also supply providers with a plan-of-correction template.\u201d\n\nContinue to part 2", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee83\"", "article_summary": "ACHCThere are many payers and managed care organizations that are looking at accreditation as a means of assuring the quality of providers, says Britt Welch, Behavioral Health Clinical Manager with the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC), which offers Behavioral Health Accreditation for psychiatric home care, case management, community support, day treatment, outpatient treatment, and psychosocial rehabilitation.\nThe total ACHC accreditation fee depends on the complexity of the organization, the number of locations, and the types of services offered.\nBehavioral health accreditation is one of ACHC\u2019s newer offerings.\nStates are also depending on more managed care organizations (MCOs) to manage Medicaid programs, another important factor in the increased demand for accreditation.\nThis month, Behavioral Healthcare talked to four behavioral health accrediting organizations, two of which \u2014 The Joint Commission and CARF \u2014 named new executive directors \u2014 Michael Johnson and Tracy Griffin Collander \u2014 to head their behavioral health accreditation programs just this year."}
