Tests of the 2-foot-diameter pipe in 2012 found 41 anomalies mostly due to external corrosion, frequently near welds, the agency said.\n\nThe company has said there were no previous problems with the pipe.\n\nPlains said it could take weeks or even months before investigators find what caused the disaster.\n\nThere\u2019s no estimate to how much damage the spill caused, but a dead dolphin was found in Santa Barbara Harbor and three dead pelicans were recovered.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the dolphin found in the harbor, about 20 miles from the source of the spill, died from exposure to oil, said Veterinarian Michael Ziccardi.\n\nTwo sea lions, an elephant seal and six pelicans have been rescued, said Ziccardi, director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California oil spill harder to clean up in choppy waters", "title": "California oil spill harder to clean up in choppy waters", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "California oil spill harder to clean up in choppy waters", "title": "California oil spill harder to clean up in choppy waters", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/california_oil_spill_harder_to_clean_up_in_choppy_waters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/california-oil-spill.jpeg24-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California oil spill harder to clean up in choppy waters", "title": "California oil spill harder to clean up in choppy waters", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/california-oil-spill.jpeg24-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Melley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The spill is also being investigated by federal, state and local prosecutors for possible violations of state and federal law.\nThe pipeline safety agency\u2019s corrective action order said the 10.6-mile line had recently been inspected, but the results weren\u2019t known.\n\u201cBefore restarting operations, we\u2019re going to make sure they do things right,\u201d said Linda Daugherty of the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A 10-square-mile oil slick off the California coast is thinner than a coat of paint and it\u2019s becoming harder to skim from choppy waters, officials said as more dead animals were discovered.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the dolphin found in the harbor, about 20 miles from the source of the spill, died from exposure to oil, said Veterinarian Michael Ziccardi."}
