Baxalta itself spun off from medical products company Baxter International just last month. It\u2019s the third-largest announced deal in the industry this year.\n\nShire\u2019s offer to buy Baxalta brings the transaction value of global pharma deals announced so far in 2015 to $284 billion, marking the biggest year for pharma dealmaking going back to at least 1995, according to Dealogic.\n\nChanges stemming from the Affordable Care Act continue to fuel a merger boom in the health-care space, with a recent wave of consolidation resulting in three health-care behemoths now controlling half the US commercial health-insurance market.\n\nThe frenzy is aided by a number of factors, including Big Pharma\u2019s fears that a decline in research productivity could stunt growth; biotech execs looking to put their excess cash to use; and companies of all stripes looking to lower their tax burdens with overseas deals.\n\nAnd the head-spinning pace doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to let up, which means it\u2019s likely the industry will far surpass the 2014 record ($280 billion worth of transactions announced, according to Dealogic).\n\nHere\u2019s a crib sheet for the 10 biggest pharma M&A deals announced so far this year, according to Dealogic:\n\n1. Teva\u2019s $40 billion acquisition of Allergan\u2019s generic drug business unit\n\n2. Mylan\u2019s $35 billion acquisition of generic drug maker Perrigo\n\n3. Shire\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Baxalta\n\n4. AbbVie\u2019 $21 billion acquisition of biotech company Pharmacyclics\n\n5. Baxter\u2019s $17 billion spinoff of Baxalta\n\n6. Valeant\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of specialty drugmaker Salix\n\n7. CVS Health\u2019s $13 billion acquisition of pharmacy services provider Omnicare\n\n8. Alexion\u2019s $9.5 billion acquisition of rare-disease drugmaker Synageva\n\n9. Endo\u2019s billion $8 billion acquisition of specialty drugmaker Par Pharmaceuticals\n\n10.
