It comes as the president looks toward a modest legislative agenda for the year, circumscribed by the realities of a presidential campaign that has sharply curtailed the congressional calendar and will most likely sap lawmakers\u2019 appetites for tough votes.\n\nFrom the moment he tapped Ms. Fallon for the job, Mr. Obama charged her with improving his relations with Capitol Hill, which had grown toxic amid complaints from lawmakers in both political parties that the president was too aloof, and that his staff was unwilling to involve them in big decisions and debates. Ms. Fallon was at one time a senior aide to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have their differences, but when it comes to Katie, they\u2019re united in their admiration and respect,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cShe came into her role at a time when we needed to build up our relationships with folks in both parties. And from bipartisan budget agreements to protecting a deal that will prevent a nuclear Iran to ensuring the long-stalled Ex-Im and I.M.F. reforms were enacted, we simply could not have made the progress we\u2019ve made without her.\u201d\n\nMs. Fallon, 40, who gave birth to twin boys in April two months ahead of schedule, had told friends and colleagues she was determined to return to the West Wing after her maternity leave \u2014 which she did full time in August \u2014 and finish 2015 at the White House. During much of that time, she has essentially been functioning as a single parent; she is married to Brian Fallon, another former aide to Mr. Schumer who spends weekdays in Brooklyn, where he is the press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter an improbable flurry of bipartisan deals late last year, including the completion of a two-year budget agreement that did away with automatic spending cuts Mr. Obama had long fought to reverse, Ms. Fallon concluded that the time was right for her to leave, people close to her said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. She has not said what she plans to do next.\n\n\u201cKatie is a rare talent, capable of getting hard things done but never forgetting or compromising why we are doing those hard things: to make sure working families get the shots she got,\u201d said Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff. \u201cWe will miss her \u2014 I will miss her.\u201d\n\nMs. Fallon will be replaced by Amy Rosenbaum, a former senior policy aide to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, who has served as Ms. Fallon\u2019s deputy and took on her responsibilities during her leave last year.\n\nMs. Pelosi called Ms. Rosenbaum a \u201ckey force\u201d in shaping the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, and pushing it through Congress in 2010. Her focus this year, officials said, will be trying to secure the bipartisan agreements the president is seeking on a broad revision of criminal justice laws, measures to improve mental health services and to address opioid addiction, and winning congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\n\n\u201cAmy has had a hand in some of the most consequential legislative progress for American families in the past decade,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nMs. Fallon quickly established herself at the White House and among key players of both parties on Capitol Hill as a deal maker who could speak both for the president and to him. She forged a strong working relationship with Republicans including Mike Sommers, the chief of staff to Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio when he was House speaker. She spoke with him daily to strategize, haggle or count votes.\n\nBefore Ms. Fallon arrived, Mr. Sommers said, \u201cit was totally a dysfunctional relationship between this White House and the Hill, and everybody knew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key to fixing it,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the knowledge that she had the president\u2019s ear. It made it easier for us to negotiate, because we knew that we were dealing with somebody who could not just deliver the news or report the news, but make the news.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarly one morning in October, when Ms. Fallon was in the thick of negotiating a budget deal with Republicans that was nearing an impasse, she spotted Mr. Boehner during his morning walk on Capitol Hill and rushed across the street to bargain with him. A one-year deal could be struck \u201ctoday,\u201d Ms. Fallon told the speaker. Mr. Boehner, who had announced his resignation, responded that he would accept only a two-year agreement, to spare his successor the burden of negotiating another budget in 2016. Ms. Fallon went back and told Mr. Obama it had to be two years.\n\n\u201cEveryone on Capitol Hill knew Katie was the go-to person when you wanted an open ear and the ability to get things done,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nThose attributes served Ms. Fallon well in navigating some of the most bitter and high-stakes debates of Mr. Obama\u2019s past two years. She sat with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office through round upon round of calls to Democratic lawmakers to cajole them to support the Iran nuclear deal. (It was after one such session, while she was briefing Mr. McDonough in his office on the calls, that Ms. Fallon\u2019s water broke; Mr. McDonough and his security detail rushed her to the hospital.)\n\nShe also worked with Republicans to push through Trade Promotion Authority legislation \u2014 fiercely opposed by most in the president\u2019s own party \u2014 that was vital to the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation pact Mr. Obama wants ratified before he leaves office. Ms. Fallon was calling White House officials about the trade measure from the hospital the day after she delivered her twins.\n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, said he had long relied on Ms. Fallon\u2019s \u201csharp insight, shrewd judgment and steadiness under pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the victories we secured in recent years would have been possible without her,\u201d Mr. Reid said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160129113847, "twitter": {"description": "Katie Beirne Fallon, the president\u2019s legislative director, has been credited with improving his relations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.", "title": "Katie Fallon, Top Obama Aide, Leaving White House", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/us/politics/katie-beirne-fallon-obama-aide-resigning.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004175664"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/30/us/30fallon-web/30fallon-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/us/politics/katie-beirne-fallon-obama-aide-resigning.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004175664", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/us/politics/katie-beirne-fallon-obama-aide-resigning.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Obama\u2019s Capitol Hill Liaison Is Leaving White House", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 29, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Fallon  Katie Beirne,United States Politics and Government,Obama  Barack,Appointments and Executive Changes", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "30fallon", "byl": "By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Katie Beirne Fallon, the president\u2019s legislative director, has been credited with improving his relations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/30/us/30fallon-web/30fallon-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Katie Beirne Fallon, the president\u2019s legislative director, has been credited with improving his relations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 29, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-02-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Appointments and Executive Changes", "published": "2016-01-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160206020003, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/us/politics/katie-beirne-fallon-obama-aide-resigning.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/30/us/30fallon-web/30fallon-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Katie Beirne Fallon, the president\u2019s legislative director, has been credited with improving his relations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.", "title": "Katie Fallon, Top Obama Aide, Leaving White House"}, "pdate": 20160129, "des": "Appointments and Executive Changes", "articleid": 100000004175664, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Katie Fallon, Top Obama Aide, Leaving White House", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/30/us/30fallon-web/30fallon-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Ms. Fallon was calling White House officials about the trade measure from the hospital the day after she delivered her twins.\nMs. Fallon was at one time a senior aide to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have their differences, but when it comes to Katie, they\u2019re united in their admiration and respect,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement.\nMs. Fallon went back and told Mr. Obama it had to be two years.\nThose attributes served Ms. Fallon well in navigating some of the most bitter and high-stakes debates of Mr. Obama\u2019s past two years."}
