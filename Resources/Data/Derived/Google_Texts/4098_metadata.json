As we rack our brain and begin to get frustrated, we ask ourselves, why is it so hard for me to remember names? In AsapSCIENCE\u2019s \u201cWhy Do You Forget Their Name,\u201d hosts Micthell Moffit and Greg Brown explain our inability to commit names to memory is linked to how our brain processes information and our level of interest (or lack thereof).\n\nAs humans, we are better apt to remember someone\u2019s face over their name. This is because our brains are far better equipped to process visual data like facial recognition. The visual cortex of the brain \u2014 part of the cerebral cortex \u2014 is responsible for processing visual information, meaning we are programmed to encode and retrieve visual data more so than auditory. Unlike names, facial details convey a mix of gender, age, ethnicity, among many others, which helps us better capture and store this information.\n\nThe inability to remember someone\u2019s name after introduction could also be connected to \u201cThe Baker Effect.\u201d The brain can\u2019t make any mental links if we only hear a person\u2019s name. However, we can tell this person apart if they provide information about what they do and how they spend their time. After all, names are just often a combination of letters that don\u2019t hold any specific information in them.\n\nThe quick exchange that occurs during the period of introduction can also impact how the brain stores information. Our brain seems to fry when both disseminating information at the same time we try to take in and store new information, although we have both short- and long-term memory. However, short-term memory can only hold so much information that if we don\u2019t focus on it, it fades away. This is known as \u201cThe Next-in-Line Effect.\u201d\n\nNow, all the blame can\u2019t be placed on the brain. Our inability to remember names could simply be due to our lack of interest. If we\u2019re at a party in which we\u2019ll never see this person again or are just generally uninterested in forming a new relationship, then chances are we won\u2019t care to remember their name.\n\nSimply put, the more interest we have in something, the more likely we\u2019ll make an effort to remember it.
