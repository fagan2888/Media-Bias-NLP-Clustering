Those who have taken up the challenge then post videos online and call on more people to continue the chain. And on it goes.\n\nRelated: The App That Brings a Doctor to Your Door\n\nCelebrities and leaders who have so far accepted the challenge include Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah, LeBron James, Bill Gates, Justin Timberlake, Chris Christie and Steven Spielberg. Many have called for President Obama to take up the challenge \u2013 but he\u2019s yet to do so.\n\nALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, eventually leading to a loss of muscle control. Death often occurs within two to five years of diagnosis, as there\u2019s no cure currently and only one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration that modestly extends survival.\n\nThe ALS ice bucket challenge was started on July 29 by Pete Frates, a 29-year-old Boston College alumnus and former athlete with the college\u2019s baseball team who has lived with ALS since 2012. With the help of his family, his challenge quickly went viral on Facebook and Twitter and soon money was flowing in.\n\nRelated: Why There\u2019s No Money in An Ebola Vaccine\n\nMany ice bucket challenges, however, had already taken place earlier in the year, though they weren\u2019t connected to ALS. It\u2019s not exactly clear who called the first challenge.\n\nSome think it may have started with firefighters in the spring who wanted to raise money for various charities, according to The Columbus Dispatch. Then, in June, motocross celebrity Jeremy McGrath took the challenge and called on some friends, including American pro golfer Rickie Fowler, to take the challenge or make a donation to Bethematch.org. It then spread around the pro golf world. At that point, there was no mention of ALS. People would simply ask to give to any charity of their choice.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the ALS Association has suddenly become the only charity mentioned during the millions of ice bucket challenges that followed Pete Frates\u2019s challenge. But what is clear is that he has succeeded in bringing tremendous awareness, and big money, to his cause.\n\nAs of Friday, the ALS Association had received $9.5 million in donations since July 29, according to the ALS Association. Three days later, it had received an additional $6.1 million, bringing the total as of this morning to $15.6 million \u2013 almost nine times as much as the ALS Association raised in the same period last year.\n\nIn part, this is due to the fact that while most people actually take the challenge, many also give to the association. ALS spends most of the money it receives in funding research and care services and on public policy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For almost a month now, loads of people, including celebrities, have been asked to dump a bucket of water on themselves \u2013 or make a donation to the ALS Association to raise awareness for the Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.
