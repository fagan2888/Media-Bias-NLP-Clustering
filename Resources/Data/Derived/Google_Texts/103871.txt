In his catch-up of the week’s biggest news stories Sunday night, John Oliver cruised through the Scottish Independence vote before arriving at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s defensive press conference.

After playing a montage of nonsensical quotes from Goodell’s presser, Oliver summed up his words like this: “And in so saying, I have effectively made sounds, which when put together make words, which can then be turned into sentences, which can make noise and travel into your ears, and that’s 45 minutes, I’ve done it, Goodell out! Clear eyes, full heart, can’t take my job, fuck you!”

But the moment that Oliver enjoyed the most was Goodell’s interaction with TMZ Sports reporter Adam Glyn. While Goodell reiterated that the NFL was unable to get the elevator surveillance video of Ray Rice punching out his then-fiancée, Glyn pointed out that TMZ was able to get with “one phone call.”

“You know that things are not going well when you lose the moral high ground to a TMZ reporter,” Oliver remarked.
