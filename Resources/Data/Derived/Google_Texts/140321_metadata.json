This was not because their marriage was troubled, but because her grandfather had fallen ill and medical bills threatened to consume their entire life savings and all their income, leaving Ms. Sandler\u2019s grandmother penniless.\n\nThe separation, as Ms. Sandler recalls it, allowed her grandfather to qualify for Medicaid and her grandmother to stay solvent. Ms. Sandler, now an elder care consultant in Cortland Manor, N.Y., says that in those years divorcing was a mainstream financial planning move. Tactics to keep elderly people\u2019s assets and income within their family\u2019s control while still qualifying them for Medicaid were common. Loopholes were exploited.\n\nBut legislative changes in the late 1980s and a major overhaul in 2003 have closed some loopholes, and the eligibility requirements for Medicaid have been eased; they will relax further on Jan. 1 under the Affordable Care Act of 2010, in an expansion that some but not all states have embraced. Such changes allow elderly people to keep more assets and income and still qualify for Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid is intended to provide health care to people who are indigent, including people who are indigent and disabled or elderly. And paying for long-term care at home or in a nursing facility is an effective way to quickly run out of money. The national median rate for a year in a nursing home is $83,950. In New York State, it is $125,732.\n\nThe exact qualifications for Medicaid vary by state and will continue to do so. Most states now will cover nursing home expenses for someone whose income is $2,130 or less each month and who has $2,000 or less in assets, not including the primary residence. The threshold is substantially lower for at-home care. In New York the monthly income limit for receiving care at home is $800, or $1,175 for a couple. Any surplus that materializes must be spent on the patient\u2019s care for that person to remain eligible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost people would prefer that their family inherit their life savings. But if in the five years before applying for Medicaid, an elderly person transfers any assets \u2014 for example, money or property to children or grandchildren \u2014 the giver would incur a penalty upon enrollment. Those five years are known as the look-back period.\n\nThere are a handful of exceptions. Federal law keeps some assets out of the equation altogether. A patient\u2019s house is exempt, if the equity in it falls under a threshold that varies by state, from $500,000 to $802,000, and if the enrollee plans to remain there or to return after a stay elsewhere for medical care. Personal belongings are also exempt, like furniture or even a car. So are small life insurance policies and prepaid funerals.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131119181738, "twitter": {"description": "Changes in Medicaid rules have helped some elderly couples cope financially with the illness or nursing home care of one spouse without resorting to an old strategy: divorce.", "title": "Medicaid Help Without Falling Into Poverty", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/medicaid-help-without-falling-into-poverty.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002559946"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "Nadia8", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/20/your-money/20POOR/20POOR-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/medicaid-help-without-falling-into-poverty.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002559946", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/medicaid-help-without-falling-into-poverty.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "yourmoney", "hdl_p": "Medicaid Help Without Falling Into Poverty", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 19, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Medicaid,Nursing Homes,Income,Home Health Care,Divorce  Separations and Annulments", "news_keywords": "Medicaid,Income", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Nadia Taha", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/20/your-money/20POOR/20POOR-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By NADIA TAHA", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Changes in Medicaid rules have helped some elderly couples cope financially with the illness or nursing home care of one spouse without resorting to an old strategy: divorce.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/20/your-money/20POOR/20POOR-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Changes in Medicaid rules have helped some elderly couples cope financially with the illness or nursing home care of one spouse without resorting to an old strategy: divorce.", "CG": "your-money", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 19, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/your-money/index.html", "section": "Your Money", "modified": "2016-01-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "tag": "Divorce, Separations and Annulments", "published": "2013-11-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "ED7B8594-44CE-4D37-A58B-1CDAA19774E4"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "20POOR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160101182538, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/medicaid-help-without-falling-into-poverty.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/20/your-money/20POOR/20POOR-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Changes in Medicaid rules have helped some elderly couples cope financially with the illness or nursing home care of one spouse without resorting to an old strategy: divorce.", "title": "Medicaid Help Without Falling Into Poverty"}, "pdate": 20131119, "des": "Divorce, Separations and Annulments", "articleid": 100000002559946, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Medicaid Help Without Falling Into Poverty", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The separation, as Ms. Sandler recalls it, allowed her grandfather to qualify for Medicaid and her grandmother to stay solvent.\nTactics to keep elderly people\u2019s assets and income within their family\u2019s control while still qualifying them for Medicaid were common.\nMs. Sandler, now an elder care consultant in Cortland Manor, N.Y., says that in those years divorcing was a mainstream financial planning move.\nSuch changes allow elderly people to keep more assets and income and still qualify for Medicaid.\nMedicaid is intended to provide health care to people who are indigent, including people who are indigent and disabled or elderly."}
