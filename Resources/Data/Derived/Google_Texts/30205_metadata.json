You lace up, you throw your mask on and you go out there and perform. In your mind, you\u2019re performing for the fans and you\u2019re performing for them in heaven.\u201d\n\nAguayo died from a broken neck in March during a match in Tijuana. Though it\u2019s not clear which blow led to his death, he was launched out of the ring, climbed back in and soon after received a flying kick to the shoulder and neck from Mysterio.\n\nVideo footage showed Aguayo hanging motionless from the ropes unattended as the bout continued for about two more minutes before other wrestlers and the referee realized he was seriously injured. He was taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead.\n\n\u201cEverything happened so fast,\u201d Mysterio said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even think.\u201d\n\nA free agent after 13 years in the WWE, Mysterio had serious doubt about performing again.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to get back,\u201d he said. \u201cI was doubting myself. I didn\u2019t know if this was what I wanted to continue to do or if I just needed a little bit of time. There were just so many mixed emotions.\u201d\n\nMysterio has done this before, pulling on the tights and mask to help bury the pain of losing friends like Umaga, Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit. Encouraged by the wrestling community to keep fighting, Mysterio returned to the ring in May and now his biggest match in years is set for this weekend at Triplemania.\n\n\u201cThe people that I work with in the ring, they helped me out,\u201d Mysterio said. \u201cThe boys from AAA made me feel loved. They\u2019ve helped me cope with it. The fans, the family, they all lent their hands of support. This is not the time to hang up the mask.\u201d\n\nMysterio wrestles in the main event for AAA against Myzteziz and agreed to tie his ring entrance to a promotion for the latest \u201cMission Impossible\u201d movie.\n\nAlso on the card, former WWE champion Alberto El Patron (Alberto Del Rio in the WWE) faces Brian Cage in a hair vs. hair match, while Blue Demon Jr. and La Parka face El Mes\u00edas and Electro Shock. The lucha libre match shown for free in Mexico is being sold for $29.95 in the United States, offering English commentary with announcers Hugo Savinovich and Matt Striker.\n\n\u201cThat struggle, that\u2019s honest. The fans can feel that,\u201d Striker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an actor playing a character. Rey is Rey and that translates to the fans.\u201d\n\nMysterio said he could be open to a return to the WWE, though he remained disappointed with the way his stay ended with no fanfare. He last wrestled a match for the WWE in 2014 and severed ties with the company this year.\n\n\u201cI was very happy to work there,\u201d he said. \u201cToward the end, things didn\u2019t work out in the best way. Despite that, I had a great time, I made great money and I\u2019m nothing but thankful for the opportunity.\u201d\n\nAt 40, Mysterio said he\u2019d like to wrestle a limited schedule \u2014 akin to the ways veterans like Rob Van Dam and Chris Jericho cameo for the WWE \u2014 or pursue acting or broadcasting.\n\n\u201cI always kept the fans happy,\u201d Mysterio said. \u201cThey always saw a different Rey, whether it was a mask, a design, a color. I never gave them the same thing twice and always kept them on their feet. They were always excited to see what Rey was going to bring to the table.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rey Mysterio Jr. honors pro wrestling friend in main event bout", "title": "Rey Mysterio Jr. honors pro wrestling friend in main event bout", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/rey-mysterio-jr-honors-pro-wrestling-friend-in-main-event-bout/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_102917_rey-mysterio-jr.jpg", "height": 421}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_102917_rey-mysterio-jr.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T10:30:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:49:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc520\"", "article_summary": "Rey Mysterio Jr. keeps a collection of his vibrant outfits and masks lined up in a closet, doubling them as works of art.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even think.\u201dA free agent after 13 years in the WWE, Mysterio had serious doubt about performing again.\nAn undersized underdog, Mysterio wants to honor his friend by pushing forward in the ring.\n\u201cThey always saw a different Rey, whether it was a mask, a design, a color.\n\u201cThe people that I work with in the ring, they helped me out,\u201d Mysterio said."}
