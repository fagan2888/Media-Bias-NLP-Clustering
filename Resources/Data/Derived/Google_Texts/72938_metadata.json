Dannel Malloy on Friday for a new tax increase that hurts businesses in the state.\n\nHost Joe Scarborough called it \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot fundamentally, arithmetically, have a situation where you\u2019re forcing businesses to leave. You\u2019re going to go out of business as a state and as a governor you won\u2019t get reelected,\u201d contributor Donny Deutsch said.\n\nGeneral Electric is making moves to get out of Connecticut after Malloy passed another massive tax increase, despite promising there would not be one.\n\nGE has historic roots in Connecticut but CEO Jeff Immelt emailed employees saying that the company was looking to move to a state that had a more pro-business environment.\n\nThe state legislature approved a $40 billion budget Wednesday, which raised taxes by $2 billion over two years.\n\nConnecticut has been continually ranked last in job creation and growth since 2008, and is currently ranked as the nation\u2019s third-highest state and local tax burden. It is also one of only a few states currently dwindling in population.\n\nDuring Malloy\u2019s campaign for reelection in 2014, he promised not to raise taxes and that there would not be a budget deficit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there will be a budget deficit and I pledge that there won\u2019t be one. And I have also pledged that there will not be a tax increase,\u201d said Malloy during his reelection campaign.\n\nIn another speech Malloy walked back his claims that he never took a pledge to raise taxes.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe panel slammed Connecticut and its Democratic Gov.\u00a0Dannel Malloy on Friday for a new tax increase that hurts businesses in the state.
