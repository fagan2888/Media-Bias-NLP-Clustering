Its 40,000 miles of state-maintained highway \u2014 making it No. 5 in the nation \u2014 shows critical signs of wear. Truck traffic on 1,754 miles of interstate highways is more than double the national average.\n\nLast November, Pennsylvania tired of waiting for Washington to address its transportation problems and took matters into its own hands.\n\nGov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, signed a bipartisan transportation bill giving the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation $2.3 billion over five years to repair and maintain state roads and bridges, plus the mass transit system.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of the $6 billion a year PennDOT was set to receive.\n\n\u201cThe extra resources were critically needed,\u201d PennDOT spokesman Rich Kirkpatrick says.\n\nAlthough some conservative lawmakers criticized the bill because it raises Pennsylvania\u2019s gas tax to pay for road improvements (the increase will be phased in at the wholesale level), the move represents an attempt by a state to regain control of its transportation destiny.\n\nLawmakers at the federal and state levels across the nation have grappled for years with shortfalls in highway funding.\n\nThe federal Highway Trust Fund gets its money from the federal gasoline tax. Not only has the tax held steady at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993, it produces less revenue today because Americans drive less and get better gas mileage.\n\nShortly before its August recess, Congress approved a 10-month patch to replenish the nearly exhausted Highway Trust Fund, but that only put off the debate until next year.\n\n\u201cOur transportation needs were underfunded, apart from what is happening in Washington, \u201d PennDOT\u2019s Kirkpatrick says.\n\nPennsylvania lawmakers want to bring some certainty to the process now. Just before Congress passed its highway bill, a group of state legislators wrote to Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, urging him to support an alternative that they knew wouldn\u2019t be voted on yet \u2014 the Transportation Empowerment Act.\n\nThe lawmakers, led by state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Butler County, chairman of the Pennsylvania House\u2019s State Government Committee, said they preferred the approach of the Transportation Empowerment Act because it would \u201creturn the funding of transportation projects to the states.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsors, Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, say their plan would give block grants to states to pay for individual transportation needs and lower the federal gas tax to 3.7 cents per gallon from 18.4 cents over five years.\n\n\u201cThis is a campaign to help people spend less time in traffic and more time enjoying life,\u201d Graves told The Daily Signal in an email. \u201cThe Transportation Empowerment Act paves the way for better roads, easier commutes and more family time.\u201d\n\nMetcalfe says he opposed Pennsylvania\u2019s transportation bill because \u201cthe state can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nBut he does support states\u2019 having more discretion over their transportation funding needs. He told The Daily Signal:\n\nIt only makes sense in Pennsylvania to keep the money here. We like to take care of our own. We know our needs better than D.C. I think a minority of states make out well in this deal [under the current system].\n\nUnder the current system, states send revenue from the federal gas tax to the Internal Revenue Service. The U.S. Treasury Department places the money in the Highway Trust Fund, then distributes portions to states based on a federal formula.\n\nStates and local metropolitan planning organizations work with federal transportation bodies to determine funding priorities.\n\nMetcalfe calls the process a \u201chorse-trading game\u201d that benefits special interests.\n\nFor instance, he says, a $1.9 million project to repair the structurally deficient Graham Bridge, in his Butler County district, probably could have waited. A full 80 percent of the total cost is federal money.\n\n\u201cCertainly, that project was a priority, but there had to be some other projects that were more worthy,\u201d Metcalfe says. \u201cThey [the agencies involved] barter back and forth.\u201d\n\nThe expiration next May of Congress\u2019 temporary fix to the Highway Trust Fund provides another opportunity to enact more comprehensive reform.\n\nThe Senate last month voted on the Transportation Empowerment Act as an amendment to the Highway Trust Fund bill, and it got 28 votes, all from Republicans.\n\nThe Transportation Empowerment Act has gathered 51 co-sponsors in the House as of Monday. Graves says:\n\nThe May deadline has given us valuable time to build more awareness and broaden support. Right now, I\u2019m working to bring state and local officials into the national transportation policy debate. We need their input on the policy and their voices in support of reform.\n\nRegardless of whether Graves\u2019 bill comes to fruition, Pennsylvania\u2019s experiment likely won\u2019t be the last attempt by states to take control of their transportation destinies.\n\nEmily Goff, a transportation policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, says Pennsylvania represents a valuable practice run:", "article_metadata": {"description": "How one state's struggle to set highway spending priorities is a signpost for conservatives' plan to cut the gas tax with transportation \"empowerment\" bill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How one state's struggle to set highway spending priorities is a signpost for conservatives' plan to cut the gas tax with transportation \"empowerment\" bill.", "title": "Your State May Be Next in Drive to Control Highway Dollars", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140807_Highway_Siegel.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-19T22:10:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/Ywi7Bg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How one state's struggle to set highway spending priorities is a signpost for conservatives' plan to cut the gas tax with transportation \"empowerment\" bill.", "title": "Your State May Be Next in Drive to Control Highway Dollars", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140807_Highway_Siegel.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2014-08-20T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-19T22:10:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Transportation Empowerment Act, Highway Trust Fund, Daryl Metcalfe, Tom Corbett, Tom Graves,  PennDOT,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc10\"", "article_summary": "The federal Highway Trust Fund gets its money from the federal gasoline tax.\nShortly before its August recess, Congress approved a 10-month patch to replenish the nearly exhausted Highway Trust Fund, but that only put off the debate until next year.\n\u201cThey [the agencies involved] barter back and forth.\u201dThe expiration next May of Congress\u2019 temporary fix to the Highway Trust Fund provides another opportunity to enact more comprehensive reform.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department places the money in the Highway Trust Fund, then distributes portions to states based on a federal formula.\nLawmakers at the federal and state levels across the nation have grappled for years with shortfalls in highway funding."}
