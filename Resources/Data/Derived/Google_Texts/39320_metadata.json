She has a lot of friends who work in the tech sector, and they always want to go to trendy places.\n\n\u201cI went out for ramen with some startup kids and it was 30 bucks a person. It was stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone at the table is making twice as much as I do.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re willing to spend twice as much on food. It\u2019s an economic dynamic she notices in the cost of therapy, too. Desimone pays $65 an hour at a community clinic to get help with her anxiety.\n\n\u2018Geek whisperers\u2019 needed now more than ever as the price of mental health services rises.\n\n\u201cThe pool of my friends, they\u2019re all $100, $120 per appointment,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d never be able to do that. I couldn\u2019t do that and pay my rent.\u201d\n\nThe influx of tech workers to the Bay Area has had a profound effect on the local economy: Affordable housing is nearly impossible to find. Dining out has become a competitive sport. And now, it seems the tech sector is applying upward pressure on the cost of some mental health services, too.\n\n\u201cOne big variable is money,\u201d says Michael Klein, a clinical psychologist in San Francisco. \u201cThe other is stress.\u201d\n\nIPOs and venture capital rounds have armed tech workers with a lot of disposable income. With that money comes intense competition, long hours and the ever-looming threat of failure. That means there are more people willing to pay higher prices for someone to talk to.\n\n\u201cThere are more and more people that have the affluence that they can afford therapy, and they have enough stress where therapy becomes more of a need,\u201d Klein says.\n\nSome large tech companies will even foot the bill. Managers see really talented engineers mess up projects because they don\u2019t know how to work well with others.\n\n\u201cTheir emotional maturity is on the lower side,\u201d says Klein.\n\nKlein is something of a geek whisperer. He\u2019s been practicing in San Francisco for 20 years, and he often treats socially awkward tech workers.\n\nWhen he asks new clients how they feel, they can\u2019t answer the question.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he says.\n\nBut after six months or a year of therapy, that changes.\n\n\u201cThey blossom,\u201d Klein says. \u201cThey can really track different emotions in themselves. And then they can start to notice them in their co-workers.\u201d\n\nTherapy Prices Rise\n\nThe increased demand for therapy from tech workers is compounded by another trend. About half the therapists in private practice in the state don\u2019t accept insurance, according to a recent survey by the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists. That means their clients have to pay out-of-network fees, or completely out of pocket.\n\n\u201cMost people in the tech world can afford to do that,\u201d Klein says.\n\nTherapists can set prices accordingly \u2014 leaving receptionists, waiters and teachers competing with wealthy tech workers for appointments. Established therapists in the Bay Area routinely charge $150 to $200 an hour.\n\n\u201cMany experienced therapists charge a lot and they\u2019re out of reach to lower-middle-class or some middle-class people,\u201d says Klein.\n\nThere are other options, he says. Less experienced therapists charge less, and there are several training institutes in San Francisco where people can see unlicensed therapists for as low as $30 a session.\n\nYet, even some of those clinics have had to raise their prices recently.\n\nTake the Access Institute, where Carolyn Desimone goes for care. It is now facing its own set of financial pressures because of the tech boom \u2014 evidenced by the new neighbors who have moved in since the clinic opened its doors 10 years ago in Hayes Valley.\n\nA few blocks down the street in one direction is the Twitter office. In the other, near the corner of Hayes and Gough, there\u2019s now an artisanal chocolate shop, an Oysteria and a Warby Parker glasses shop.\n\nWhen the lease at Access Institute was up for renewal last year, the landlord wanted to increase the rent by almost 90 percent.\n\n\u201cWe had been paying $5,900 a month,\u201d said executive director Bart Magee, speaking over the construction noise outside his office. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go to $11,000 a month.\u201d\n\nMagee managed to negotiate \u2014 a bit. He still has to pay the full increase, but not for another five years. In the meantime, he got a 40 percent rent hike.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s $50,000 a year that we could have provided more services; with that we\u2019re not going to be able to,\u201d he says, adding that the clinic has had to raise salaries as well, so the therapists who work there can afford the increases they\u2019re facing in cost-of-living expenses.\n\nMagee says the clinic had no choice but to raise its prices.\n\nHe\u2019s also looking for new philanthropic donors, but he says the clinic needs a long-term plan for when the full rent increase takes effect or they won\u2019t be able to stay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no place to go,\u201d he says. \u201cOur commercial real estate has gotten to be one of the most expensive in the country.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Desimone says she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if Access Institute were ever forced to move or shut down.\n\n\u201cThat would be really hard,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m worried that if I lost them, that the barrier to entry would seem too hard to find somebody else, and then I would get really bad again. I\u2019m afraid I would be too overwhelmed by having to find somebody, that I would just not.\u201d\n\nCurious about the boom/bust cycle that is reshaping the Bay Area?
