Anyone who works in the medical field knows the toll chronic pain exerts on patients firsthand. Often when you first see a pain patient, he or she already has a long list of providers he has seen and treatments that have failed. He often brings to the visit not only a long and discouraging narrative but an increasingly despondent emotional state.







Millions of Americans have chronic pain by public domain



Many chronic pain patients have stopped working and limited their life activities out of fear that their pain will worsen--a fear which ironically usually makes pain worse. They have become isolated and irritable and their family relations have become strained. Their eating and sleeping behaviors have often become dysfunctional and they may be catapulting toward depression, if they are not already clinically depressed. They have likely adopted verbal or non-verbal pain "behaviors" like sighing and grimacing which perpetuate the pain portrayal to others--and themselves. When you see such a patient, you often inherit the disappointing pain outcomes he has already endured and his increasing feelings of pessimism and skepticism.

Over 100 million Americans experience chronic pain and its treatment costs the U.S. $635 billion a year--compared with heart disease ($309 billion), cancer ($243 billion) and diabetes ($188 billion) (Institute of Medicine 2011). Chronic pain represent $11.6 to $12.7 billion a year in lost work days in (Institute of Medicine 2011) in the U.S. with many workers not returning at all. Yet, of the 27 institutes in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) not one is dedicated to pain.
