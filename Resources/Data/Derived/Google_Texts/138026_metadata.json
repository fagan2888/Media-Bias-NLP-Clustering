For doctors and researchers, flagship journals such as The New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and The Lancet are critical for keeping up to date with the latest breakthroughs, establishing new standards of care, and improving treatments for patients.\n\nIn January, a proposal was put forward by the editors of these publications, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, that poses a serious threat to the privacy of patient data. In it, the editors would require that investigators of clinical trials make publically available within six months of publication de-identified (i.e., anonymous), individual patient data underlying the results presented in the trial.\n\nAt face value, this sounds smart. It promotes transparency in research and data sharing and makes it easier for other scientists to develop and test new hypotheses. Yet it provoked an immediate and vocal protest about the specter of \u201cdata parasites,\u201d organizations who conduct research on data collected by others.\n\nHowever, even this protest ignores a more chilling issue -- the threat to patient privacy and the ability to conduct cancer clinical trials. This proposal may even harm the ability of the Vice President\u2019s Cancer \"Moonshot\" to expand patient access to these trials.\n\n\n\nAs cancer doctors and clinical researchers, we are obsessed with protecting patient privacy in health care, particularly in the clinical research area, both because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and because it\u2019s the law, covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n\n\n\nWhat would it take to compromise a patient\u2019s privacy? It turns out, not much.\n\nDe-identifying data is actually quite hard. The Department of Health and Human Services reports that \u201cthe combination of a patient\u2019s Date of Birth, Gender, and 5-Digit ZIP Code is unique for over 50 percent of residents in the United States.\u201d In other words, the majority of the U.S. population could be identified with these three items alone.\n\nTwo out of the three \u2013 age and gender \u2013 are standard parts of any clinical trial that reports basic demographics of enrolled participants and outcomes for men and women. The third \u2013 zip code \u2013 can easily be extrapolated from the zip code of the hospital enrolling a patient onto a study, as even a hospital as large as Cleveland Clinic derives 80 percent of its patients from surrounding Northeast Ohio.\n\nThe ability to identify clinical trial participants increases when even limited information is cross-matched to other publically available sources, such as voter registration rolls.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, within cancer trials, the ultimate measure of a clinically meaningful benefit to an intervention such as treatment with a new drug is improvement in overall survival. This is measured from the time of diagnosis or enrollment onto a study, to the time of death or the study\u2019s end. Introducing these dates to publically disclosed information further increases the likelihood that an individual can be identified, particularly if that person has a rare cancer.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s take, for example, hairy cell leukemia, which is diagnosed in approximately 600 people in the U.S. yearly. Compare that to the 70 million people in the U.S. living with high blood pressure.\n\nA person enrolled on a clinical trial of, say, a new monoclonal antibody for this type of leukemia whose supposedly de-identified data is made publically available is much more likely to be detectible than someone with hypertension, who could more easily get lost in the shuffle of the one-quarter of the U.S. population with the same diagnosis.\n\n\n\nCancer clinical trials are also increasingly becoming smaller, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the holy mantra of cancer research is referred to as \u201cbench to bedside,\u201d which involves taking an exciting discovery from the lab, developing a drug based on that discovery that targets a specific cancer, and bringing it to the bedside, to treat a patient.\n\nSecond, cancer clinical trials are moving towards enrolling patients with particular genetic mutations underlying their cancers.\n\nSo, even within the small population of patients with hairy cell leukemia, a trial may focus on those hairy cell leukemia patients with a BRAF mutation. These types of trials are frequently limited to a single cancer center, or at most a small handful of centers, and are often internally funded, at least in part.\n\n\n\nIntroducing a requirement that clinical trial data be made publically available requires infrastructure in the form of databases, computer servers, and personnel, which adds to the price tag for these studies. At a certain financial inflection point, studies may not be conducted, even when they ask important research questions for patients who desperately need new therapies.\n\n\n\nA final impact that disclosure of patient data will have on cancer research is on the unfair position in which we will be placing our patients. Before a person enrolls on a clinical trial, he or she provides informed consent, acknowledging that the potential risks, benefits, personnel involved in conducting the study, and alternatives to a study treatment have been presented, in an understandable way.\n\nIf public disclosure of data is required, it would, justifiably, have to be added to the informed consent process, and our patients would face what amounts to a Faustian bargain: agree to allow your data to be made public, or you cannot enroll on a clinical trial. It would be all or nothing, as an \u201copt-out\u201d clause is not being proposed.\n\nThis is not the sort of choice we want to force people to make when they are about to undergo treatment for their cancer.\n\n\n\nWhile we appreciate the scientific rationale for the proposal to make clinical trial data publically available, in the end it cannot trump the rights of our cancer patients to maintain their privacy, have a full range of clinical trials available, and make treatment decisions free of conflict.\n\n\n\nMikkael A.
