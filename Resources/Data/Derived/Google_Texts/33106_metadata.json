When a light flashes (the contemporary equivalent of the hook), it\u2019s time to vacate the stage. At a comedy club, performers on an open-mic night can include working comics trying out new stuff, newcomers taking their first shot on stage, and anything in between.\n\n\n\nRather than the \u201cshow-up-and-put-up\u201d structure of other open mics, however, 10@10 is curated. Improv vet Erin Carr Adams, the show\u2019s producer, hand-picks the lineup in advance, turning this more into a showcase night. Yes, there\u2019s traditional stand-up in the mix. But the \u201csomething else\u201d is what makes the night different.\n\nOn the night I attended, Adams took care of warm-up duties, seamlessly segueing from welcoming the crowd into a routine about the challenges of raising a child in a non-religious household. Her pleasure at finding an audience for her show was palpable and added a pleasant gathering-of-friends layer to the evening that helped smooth over a few rough patches (including a comic who decided to talk about current affairs instead of deliver jokes and failed to make any coherent points).\n\nJason Adams (Photo courtesy of Kurt Messick Jason Adams (Photo courtesy of Kurt Messick\n\nHighlights of the evening included a pair of songs by local composer/actress Paige Scott, accompanying herself on keyboard. Far from the overstaying-their-welcome song parodies often heard at comedy club open-stage nights, her songs \u201cLazy Ass\u201d and \u201cHarrison Ford\u201d were clever, character-based, and left me wanting to hear more from Scott\u2014and to hear both songs again. (Scott\u2019s latest work, \u201cHoly Ficus,\u201d will be part of the 2015 Indy Fringe festival. Count me in.)\n\n\n\nBig laughs were earned by Jason Adams, offering a taste of his upcoming Fringe show \u201cJason Adams is a God Damn Mind Reader.\u201d I\u2019m sure this Adams (husband of host Erin) is tired of Chris Farley references being used to describe his persona, but the resemblance is unmistakable.\n\n\n\nTo his credit, though, Adams never crosses over into impersonation. He creates his own clear, funny persona as a boisterous, relentlessly self-assured mentalist. While anyone who has even a passing understanding of magical methodology could probably see how his routine worked, it didn\u2019t matter. Had tickets to his Fringe show been available, I\u2019m guessing he could have sold them on the spot.\n\n\n\nWhile leaving specific content up to her acts, Erin Carr Adams wisely hedged her bets by booking headliners in the final slots of the evening. (She also sprinkled the middle of the show with thrift-shop-level prize giveaways, which helped keep the energy going.)\n\nDavid Britton (Photo courtesy of Kurt Messick) David Britton (Photo courtesy of Kurt Messick)\n\nThe last of the 10 (or maybe it was 11\u2014Adams isn\u2019t too concerned with the accuracy of her show\u2019s title) was a more traditional stand-up comic\u2014and a very good one\u2014Bloomington\u2019s David Britton, a regular at the Comedy Attic and winner of its 2014 Funniest Person in Bloomington contest. He deadpanned his way through a journey from the beginning to the end of time. Even past 11:30 on a Thursday night, I would have stayed to hear his full act.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one of the benefits of a show like 10@10: It offers the opportunity to get a taste of talent that might not already be on your radar. It also is a flexible enough format that it leaves room for music, magic, improv, character comedy and wild cards.\n\n\n\nAnd while I rarely mention ticket prices in this column\u2014what\u2019s expensive to one person might be affordable to another\u2014here, the low $5 tab is worth noting. That\u2019s $.50 per performer. And even with a few questionable calls, it\u2019s pretty easy to get your money\u2019s worth.\u2022\n\n\n\n__________\n\n\n\nThis column appears weekly.
