It concludes from this that the government must either come up with more money for the NHS or reduce services or \u201ccharge users more.\u201d \u201cTo choose none of those is not a realistic option.\u201d\n\nWe can expect an orchestrated campaign of such arguments to grow in the next year or so. This raises the possibility of the new government publicly flouting David Cameron\u2019s previous explicit insistence that patients would not face charges for treatment or be required to take out health insurance.\n\nBut we are in a period in which a newly elected Tory government feels free to ditch its pre-election promises and earlier commitments and crack on with the policies which will appease the right-wing backbenchers and the backwoodsmen who fund the party.\n\nMeanwhile NHS regulator Monitor has written to cash-strapped trusts facing a massive \u00a32bn total of deficits this year, telling them in effect to disregard targets for waiting times and tear up guidance on safe staffing levels, with all financial penalties suspended in a desperate effort to balance the books.\n\nMonitor, too, is saying there is simply not enough money to maintain NHS services as before \u2014 again proving that Cameron\u2019s bland pre-election promises of an extra \u00a38bn for the NHS by 2020 is no guarantee that services will not be slashed to ribbons and the choicest services privatised.\n\nWe are entering a new, dangerous, silly season in politics. That\u2019s why the underlying principles of the NHS, as a tax-funded universal system delivering a comprehensive range of healthcare free at point of use, and free to plan and allocate resources according to need rather than market forces, are again being questioned \u2014 and constantly undermined.\n\nIn addition to the fact that it is socially regressive and economically nonsensical, the very idea of introducing user fees for the NHS is also a major electoral liability. Even the recent King\u2019s Fund Barker Review weighing up a series of unpalatable \u201coptions\u201d rejected the idea of user charges, while suggesting a range of taxes, mainly on the elderly, to help pay for increased investment in the NHS.\n\nBut just because a policy is mad and unpopular does not mean that neoliberals don\u2019t aspire to do it. The combination of the continued tightening freeze on NHS budgets, coupled with demands for massive, unprecedented \u201cefficiency savings\u201d and the chaos of the new, dysfunctional system introduced by Andrew Lansley\u2019s Health & Social Care Act, also results in all kinds of common language being turned upside down.\n\n\u201cDevolution\u201d \u2014 in Manchester, Cornwall and now increasingly planned for other areas of England \u2014 has been transformed from a progressive measure putting health services to some degree under democratic control, into a bureaucratic monster, with imposed mayors and arrogant decision-making by small cabals of self-important councillors.\n\nInstead of a transfer of real powers to a more local level, budget pressures mean \u201cdevolution\u201d is now an exercise in shifting blame for unpopular cutbacks and closures from central government \u2014 which since the 2012 Act no longer has any duty to provide healthcare \u2014 to unwitting but ambitious local authorities.\n\nIn countless Our Healthier Area projects and NHS England boss Simon Stevens\u2019s Five Year Forward View, \u201cpublic health\u201d and \u201cpreventive\u201d measures now no longer mean long-term interventions tackling the social determinants of ill health and designed to make the local public healthier.\n\nInstead they have become a magic incantation which is somehow supposed to achieve miraculous short-term reductions in use of hospitals and health services \u2014 and generate billions in \u201csavings,\u201d irrespective of the \u00a3200 million slashed from public health spending in George Osborne\u2019s Budget.\n\nThe mantra of \u201cintegration\u201d of health and social care services is also echoed by all the main parliamentary parties. In itself it\u2019s a desirable goal \u2014 if the objective is to extend the NHS principle to social care and scrap the present means-tested charges.\n\nBut in place of any genuine \u201cintegration\u201d we are faced in real life with the disintegration of an underfunded, largely privatised social care system, which will be further torn apart by another five years of cuts under Osborne\u2019s plans for local government.\n\nThe NHS, too, is visibly disintegrating \u2014 clinical commissioning groups are one after another restricting the range of services they will pay for, capping numbers of treatments and finding excuses to exclude smokers and overweight patients from treatment. It is also conniving with local trusts as they flout targets for patients to wait no longer than 18 weeks for treatment.\n\nDifferent clinical commissioning groups are now adopting different, contradictory plans for future services \u2014 in Somerset, GPs appear ready to pool part of their primary care budgets with hospital budgets and social care to create a new \u201coutcomes-based\u201d system of commissioning services.\n\nBut in the north-east England, a Health Service Journal report reveals Northumberland clinical commissioning group is proposing a completely different scheme to hand the bulk of its budget and commissioning functions to Northumbria Healthcare Foundation Trust, to be administered by a \u201cprovider-led Accountable Care Organisation\u201d \u2014 not yet established.\n\nThe trust would deliver emergency and acute services as well as community health, and it already runs a number of GP practices. Other GPs in the area would be encouraged to group together in federations. They too would work under contract with the trust.\n\nThe scheme appears to break down the \u201cpurchaser/provider split\u201d that has dominated much of the NHS since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government introduced a costly \u201cinternal market\u201d in 1991, later transformed by Tony Blair\u2019s government and then the Lansley Act into a full-scale competitive market involving the private sector.\n\nHowever the establishment of an Accountable Care Organisation also worryingly copies similar organisational structures in the US, where ACOs run by private insurers operate in the private sector. This raises obvious fears of a future privatisation \u2014 if the private sector could be assured it could make a profit after being stung by a series of losses from NHS contracts to deliver clinical services.\n\nBut while the first NHS ACO is being set up, other clinical commissioning groups are following different lines. Some are dividing up whole \u201cpathways of care\u201d and groups of services, with each going to \u201clead providers,\u201d many of them private companies.\n\nThese include Bedfordshire (contracts for musculoskeletal services and dermatology); Nottinghamshire (which disastrously awarded a dermatology contract to Circle, resulting in the collapse of specialist services in Nottingham as consultants departed rather than work for the company); and Cambridgeshire (where a long wasteful saga of seeking to contract out older people\u2019s services wound up eventually giving the lead provider contract to a consortium led by local trusts).\n\nThe most notorious case is Staffordshire, where the contract for end of life care seems certain to go to a private provider, while the even more controversial cancer care contract is in chaos after the only Staffordshire trust in the consortium \u2014 University Hospitals North Midlands \u2014 pulled out of negotiations, arguing that they could not guarantee to treat a rising caseload with the limited funding on offer.\n\nOnly the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust is hanging on.The Staffordshire clinical commissioning groups that have been driving the process, shamefully egged on and financed by cancer charity Macmillan, are now left with a lame \u201cconsortium\u201d led by support service provider Interserve, which has no clinical expertise, and now no prospect of being able to offer a viable or accessible service.\n\nBut with so much prestige now at stake for the clinical commissioning groups, which have defied local opposition to press the scheme through so far, there seems little chance of them seeing sense and scrapping the whole farcical process to negotiate a fresh contract with the trusts.\n\nIt\u2019s a crazy, dangerous time for the NHS \u2014 the unthinkable is not only being thought, but put into practice by senior managers desperate to balance the books, while the Tory right looks for ever more avenues for private sector takeover.\n\nIt\u2019s a time for health campaigners, health unions and the growing numbers drawn into progressive politics by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s astonishingly popular challenge for the Labour leadership to get together to build a new, bigger and united challenge to a Tory government with a wafer-thin majority.\n\nAnother NHS is possible \u2014 and affordable if the scrounging rich would only pay their share of tax. To reinstate the NHS and protect it we need a movement that is stronger and more powerful than before. While the Tories dream up more unthinkable policies, let\u2019s make sure we keep our eyes on the prize \u2014 and focus our anger on the enemy in front of us.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The only English-language socialist daily newspaper in the world, published six days a week.", "Author": "Peoples Printing Press Society", "og": {"published_time": 1439766000, "description": "The Tories are prepping our health service to become a paid-for service on the quiet, writes JOHN LISTER", "title": "Beware this dangerous \u2018silly season\u2019 for the NHS", "url": "http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-960d-Beware-this-dangerous-silly-season-for-the-NHS", "image": "http://morningstaronline.co.uk/assets/static/images/default-og-image.png", "modified_time": 1439765131, "tag": "monitor", "type": "article", "section": "Features"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Tories are prepping our health service to become a paid-for service on the quiet, writes JOHN LISTER", "title": "Beware this dangerous \u2018silly season\u2019 for the NHS", "site": "@M_Star_Online", "card": "summary", "creator": "@M_Star_Online"}, "Robots": "noodp", "Revisit-After": "7 Days", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae20\"", "article_summary": "The mantra of \u201cintegration\u201d of health and social care services is also echoed by all the main parliamentary parties.\nBut while the first NHS ACO is being set up, other clinical commissioning groups are following different lines.\nIn itself it\u2019s a desirable goal \u2014 if the objective is to extend the NHS principle to social care and scrap the present means-tested charges.\nTo reinstate the NHS and protect it we need a movement that is stronger and more powerful than before.\nWe are entering a new, dangerous, silly season in politics."}
