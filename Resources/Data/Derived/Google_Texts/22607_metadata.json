Russians have seen the purchasing power of their savings cut in half due to a plunge in the value of the ruble, brought about by a devastating decline in oil prices and a raft of economic sanctions levied by the international community in response to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade parts of neighboring Crimea.\n\nOn Monday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev admitted that the economy is facing a crisis, but said the Kremlin was focused on the problem. Russian leaders will apparently respond by holding meetings. Lots of them.\n\nRelated: Fallout from Obama\u2019s Russia Strategy Is Spreading Through Europe\n\n\u201cThe economic situation is quite problematic to say the least,\u201d Medvedev said Monday, according to a number of media reports. \u201cTherefore, all of the members of the government must hold key meetings in the areas that they coordinate, as we have already agreed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis should be done regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, given the challenges facing Russia, the usefulness of bureaucrats gathering in conference rooms is debatable. On Monday, the market prices of both crude oil and natural gas, far and away Russia\u2019s most important exports, continued their precipitous drop.\n\nBenchmark crude oil prices are now lower than they have been in years, at $45.66 per barrel, compared to more than $100 a year ago. Natural gas prices have fallen by nearly half since the summer.\n\nRelated: Vladimir Putin: International Man of Mystery\n\nThe result is that the Russian economy \u2013 and the Kremlin\u2019s treasury \u2013 continues to be in serious trouble. International lenders have been reluctant to provide liquidity to the Russian government. The Russian central bank has cancelled several debt auctions in the past six months, and in the rare case in which it allowed one to continue, sold only a fraction of the debt it was offered at a price higher than most U.S. firms with \u201cjunk\u201d level debt ratings have to pay.\n\nThe Russian government still has substantial foreign currency reserves left over from the days when oil was expensive but has been gradually spending them down in an unsuccessful effort to prop up the value of the ruble.\n\nThe Fitch ratings agency last week became the latest to pile on the Kremlin, reducing its rating of Russia\u2019s sovereign debt to one level above its top-level junk bond rank. Some might argue that the market was well ahead of the rating agency, but the announcement lent a degree of authority to something many market participants were already feeling.\n\n\u201cThe economic outlook has deteriorated significantly since mid-2014 following sharp falls in the oil price and the ruble, coupled with a steep rise in interest rates,\u201d the Fitch announcement read. \u201cWestern sanctions first imposed in March 2014 continue to weigh on the economy by blocking Russian banks' and corporates' access to external capital markets.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Threatens to Send Nukes into Crimea as Ruble Tumbles\n\nIt continued, \u201cHaving grown by just 0.6 percent in 2014, Fitch now expects the economy to contract by 4 percent in 2015, compared with our previous forecast of minus 1.5 percent, as steep falls in consumption and investment are only partially offset by an improvement in net exports, driven by a sharp drop in imports. Growth may not return until 2017.\u201d\n\nAdding an insult to the injury of a near-junk rating, the Fitch announcement noted that the agency\u2019s assessment of the Russian economy comes with a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d \u2013 meaning that there is a substantial likelihood of further downgrades in the future.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Russian economy has been struggling for months to get out from under the massive problems caused by a combination of the shock caused by plummeting oil process and punishing international sanctions.
