This time it\u2019s Jeb Bush, who said the other day that though we can keep Medicare around for the people who are currently on it, \u201cwe need to figure out a way to phase out this program for others and move to a new system that allows them to have something \u2013 because they\u2019re not going to have anything.\u201d\n\nThis is an old argument from Republicans, one they also use to justify attacks on Social Security: the program is doomed anyway, so we should go ahead and privatize it. The argument is completely wrong with regard to Social Security, and the truth about Medicare is that the program\u2019s future is looking brighter and brighter \u2014 in no small part because of the Affordable Care Act. The argument Bush is making is ten years out of date.\n\nBush did try to walk back his statement a bit, saying the \u201cphase out\u201d part was taken out of context and he\u2019s only talking about how we \u201creform our entitlement system.\u201d Here\u2019s his follow-up, which doesn\u2019t change the essence of what he was arguing:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an actuarially unsound health care system,\u201d said Bush, who said something must be done before the system burdens future generations with $50 billion of debt. \u201cSocial Security is an underfunded retirement system; people have put money into it, for sure. \u201cThe people that are receiving these benefits, I don\u2019t think that we should touch that; but your children and grandchildren are not going to get the benefit of this that they believe they\u2019re going to get, or that you think they\u2019re going to get, because the amount of money put in compared to the amount of money the system costs is wrong.\u201d\n\nBush hasn\u2019t yet released his plan to phase out/reform Medicare, but given these comments it seems likely he\u2019ll embrace something like what Paul Ryan has been advocating for years. It involves changing Medicare from a guaranteed single-payer government insurance plan into a voucher plan, in which the government gives senior citizens a set amount of money with which they can go out and get private health insurance. It saves money by limiting the value of that voucher, so if it\u2019s less than what coverage actually costs, well, tough luck. In that way, it eliminates the central promise of Medicare, which is that every American senior citizen will have health coverage.\n\nWe\u2019ll await Jeb\u2019s particulars, but I promise you that most of the GOP candidates will embrace some version of this plan, because that\u2019s what the Republican consensus on Medicare is these days. And it\u2019s always justified with the argument Jeb gives: because of skyrocketing costs the program is doomed, so privatization is the only way to make sure it\u2019s there for your kids. But don\u2019t worry, current seniors, we won\u2019t touch your Medicare! Which is one of the ironies of their argument: the free market is supposed to make everything wonderful, but they fall all over themselves to promise senior citizens that they won\u2019t disturb the big-government, socialist program that seniors love.\n\nNow on to the cost question. As it happens, the Medicare Trustees just released their annual report on the future of the program. And as Kevin Drum noted, things are looking a lot sunnier than they were a few years ago:\n\nTen years ago, Medicare was a runaway freight train. Spending was projected to increase indefinitely, rising to 13 percent of GDP by 2080. This year, spending is projected to slow down around 2040, and reaches only 6 percent of GDP by 2090. Six percent! That\u2019s half what we thought a mere decade ago. If that isn\u2019t spectacular, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nThose are projections for what\u2019s going to happen decades from now, so things are doubtless going to change. But the presumption of the Republican argument is that Medicare is eventually going to eat the entire federal budget, and so we have no choice but to fundamentally alter it. And that\u2019s just not true.\n\nThe other assumption they make is that the way to alter Medicare is simple: privatize it. But they\u2019re wrong about this, too. Medicare is expensive, but that\u2019s not because it\u2019s an inefficient big-government program. In fact, Medicare is remarkably efficient, more so than private insurance. That\u2019s because it benefits from economies of scale, and because it doesn\u2019t have to spend money on things like marketing, underwriting, and big salaries for executives. The reason Medicare is expensive is that American health care is expensive, and it serves a lot of people. The retirement of the large Baby Boom generation is what\u2019s producing its current funding challenges.\n\nAs Medicare turns fifty, the politics of the plan are as hotly contested as ever. For Republicans, it's created a wedge among the presidential candidates. (Pamela Kirkland/The Washington Post)\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that at the same time Republicans cry that Medicare is unaffordable and so must be dismantled, they fight any effort to actually lower costs in a rational way. For instance, they\u2019re adamantly opposed to comparative effectiveness research, which involves looking at competing treatments and seeing which ones actually work better. That this isn\u2019t something Medicare already takes into account sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s true. If there are two medications for a particular ailment that are equally effective, but one costs $100 a year and one costs $100,000 a year, wouldn\u2019t it make sense for Medicare to 1) find that out, and 2) make coverage decisions accordingly? But Republicans have said no \u2014 Medicare should just pay for both, no matter what it costs.\n\nRepublicans also oppose the most significant effort to reduce Medicare costs in decades, something called the Affordable Care Act, which included all kinds of provisions meant to achieve this goal. Perhaps most critically, the law starts a move away from the fee-for-service model, in which doctors and hospitals make more money the more procedures they do, to a model where they get paid a single rate for treating a patient. Under the fee-for-service model, if your hospital screws up, you get an infection, and you have to get re-admitted, they make more money; the ACA actually punishes them for that, giving them a greater incentive to provide better and less expensive care.\n\nBut Republicans not only want to repeal the ACA, which means repealing all those kinds of payment provisions, they have nothing much to say about how, specifically, we might save money in Medicare. Their only answer is that if we privatize it, the magic of the market will produce savings. Of course, if that were true America would have the cheapest health care system in the advanced world, since ours is already more private than in any other similar country. And yet we don\u2019t \u2014 ours is far and away the most expensive, and that\u2019s precisely because the market has failed.\n\nSo to sum up, this is the Republican argument on Medicare: We absolutely can\u2019t do anything in particular that would bring down the cost of Medicare, but the cost of Medicare is so outrageous that we have no choice but to privatize it.\n\nWhen Jeb Bush and the other candidates talk about this subject, pay close attention to what they say. They\u2019ll use the word \u201cstrengthen\u201d a lot \u2014 we want to strengthen Medicare! They\u2019ll tell seniors, who vote in great numbers, that they aren\u2019t going to touch their precious Medicare. And they\u2019ll ignore what we\u2019ve learned in the last few years, talking as though things look just as bad as they did before the Affordable Care Act was passed and health care spending slowed. But the truth is that their solution is no solution at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare is not doomed, and privatizing it is the worst idea available.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Medicare is not doomed, and privatizing it is the worst idea available.", "title": "Jeb Bush now says he wouldn\u2019t \u2018phase out\u2019 Medicare.
