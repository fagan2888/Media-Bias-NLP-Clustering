PATERSON — Nearly 100 people gathered Saturday evening in Paterson for a candlelight vigil honoring refugees who have died trying to flee war-torn Syria, the Record reported.

Local politicians—including Prospect Park Mayor Mohamed T. Khairullah, Paterson Councilman Andre Sayegh and Al Abdel-aziz, a leader of the Paterson Democrats—urged attendees to call on the United States and United Nations to act.

A moment of silence was held for innocent civilians killed by the violence in Syria.

The death of Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old who drowned along with his mother and 5-year-old brother Ghalib while trying to cross from Turkey to Greece by boat, sparked international outrage over the plight of thousands of Syrian refugees killed trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. Aylan and his family fled their home in Kobane, Syria to escape the advancing Islamic State group, the Washington Post reported.

Khairullah, a native of Syria, told NJ Advance Media silence from the public and inaction from world leaders had worsened the situation. He called for a no-fly zone over Syria.
