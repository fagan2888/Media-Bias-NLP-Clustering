Less than a year after announcing its plan to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017, Tyson Foods Inc. has voluntarily recalled 52,486 pounds of chicken wing product due to an “off odor” scent.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the recall on Tuesday adding that “the fully cooked buffalo style chicken wing section item was produced on Oct. 24, 2015 and Oct. 25, 2015.”

The recall includes all “28-oz. retail bags containing multiple pieces of “Tyson Any’tizers Fully Cooked Hot Wings CHICKEN WING SECTIONS COATED WITH A FLAVORFUL HOT, TANGY SAUCE” with use by/sell by dates of Oct. 24, 2016 and Oct. 25, 2016.”

These products also bear the establishment number “P-13456,” packaging dates 2975PBF0508-23/2985PBF0500-01, and case codes 2975PBF0508-23/2985PBF0500-01.

The world’s second largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork discovered the adulteration after it received consumer complaints about an “off odor” and mild illnesses experienced by people who consumed the product.

Although no reports of major adverse reactions caused by consumption have been received, anyone experiencing an injury or illness should contact their doctor immediately. Anyone who purchased this product has been advised to throw it away or return it to the place of purchase.
