As we noted in a Sunday editorial, cultural and political shifts abounded. The Supreme Court made pivotal rulings about Obamacare and same-sex marriage, leaders of southern states moved toward taking down the Confederate flag, and lawmakers in California settled a bitter debate over vaccine exemptions.\n\nBut for almost anyone old enough to be reading this, even developments as significant as these pale in comparison to any number of memorable news events.\n\nSo let\u2019s reflect on the history we\u2019ve seen. Here\u2019s the Opinion section\u2019s Question of the Week for readers: What\u2019s the biggest news event of your lifetime?\n\n\u201cBiggest\u201d can mean any number of things: Most significant. Most far-reaching. Most influential on life, culture, the order of things. Best. Worst.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, historians nominated all sorts of events as the biggest of the era: World War II. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima specifically. Men landing on the moon. The advent of the Internet. The development of penicillin.\n\nThat\u2019s a brief sampling of the possibilities.\n\nWere the 9/11 attacks, early in the 21st century, and the ensuing fight against terrorism the most life-changing development of your lifetime?\n\nHow about something else from the sphere of international affairs, such as the Cold War and the eventual fall of the Soviet Union?\n\nOr something from U.S. politics, like the election of President Obama, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, or Watergate?\n\nOr the triumphs of the civil rights, feminist or environmental movement?\n\nOr advances in medicine, science, technology or industry?\n\nOr how about something in the entertainment world? Did the Beatles really, as the pop culturalists claim, change everything?\n\nTell us: If your life is a newspaper, what\u2019s the top headline?\n\nEmail your thoughts to opinion@langnews.com.
