'Amnesty' card: GOP's border war\n\nSo much for that fresh start with Latino voters.\n\nIn a dramatic departure from their determination only months ago to win a second look from that rapidly-growing community, national Republicans have embarked on a sustained campaign to make the immigration crisis a central issue in 2014 and exhort voters to punish the White House for failing to lock down the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe intensity of their rhetoric has increased as a surge of child migrants has renewed attention to the border and amid anticipation that President Barack Obama will issue a set of executive actions on immigration, including potentially suspending deportations for countless migrants.\n\nGone are the days of tiptoeing around the real and perceived sensitivities of the Latino community, which holds powerful sway over the Electoral College in presidential elections.\n\n( WATCH: This summer's hottest issue: Immigration)\n\nPublic and private polling shows border control creeping up the list of concerns among conservative voters and independents, and the GOP is responding accordingly. Republican candidates are lacing into the Obama administration and its congressional allies for supporting \u201camnesty\u201d and casting them as unable to secure the southern border.\n\nThree major Republican Senate hopefuls \u2013 Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Scott Brown of New Hampshire and Terri Lynn Land of Michigan \u2013 are airing commercials blasting their Democratic opponents for supporting \u201camnesty\u201d and attacking \u201clawlessness\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d on the border. Other candidates are expected to join them.\n\nAt the start of August, the House of Representatives voted to reverse the White House action \u2013 dating to 2012 \u2013 that deferred action on deportations for illegal immigrants brought into the country as minors. The measure was hugely popular among Latinos during the presidential campaign that year, but it caused an outcry on the right as an example of brazen executive overreach.\n\nAnd the most prominent national Republican voice on immigration and the border is no longer Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American legislator who supported the Senate\u2019s immigration compromise bill, but rather Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the swaggering border-state conservative who has deployed national guardsmen to the Rio Grande.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Immigration status may cost people Obamacare coverage)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how sharply the GOP\u2019s new strategy breaks with the party\u2019s determination to enact sweeping new immigration policy in the aftermath of the 2012 election, when Obama won more than 7 in 10 Latino votes and prompted the release of a grim Republican National Committee report to endorse immigration reform as its primary policy recommendation.\n\nMany prominent Republicans, from House Speaker John Boehner to billionaire super-donor Sheldon Adelson, still support immigration reform in word. But with the 2014 election squarely in sight, the party has spun away from a national quest to reintroduce itself to Latinos and planted itself squarely on the turf of the midterm campaign \u2014 where individual races are playing out in largely conservative territory in the Deep South and Mountain West states with fewer Latino voters.\n\nEven Republicans who fear the party\u2019s dire position with Latinos will hurt them in the presidential race just two years out say that prosecuting the case against Obama may need to come first for now.\n\nFormer Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, one of the GOP\u2019s premier strategists and an endorser of immigration reform, called it appropriate for Republicans to campaign against any Obama action to \u201cgive amnesty to thousands and thousands \u2013 hundreds of thousands or however many it is \u2013 of children who have crossed the border illegally.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP, DOJ duel on migrants\u2019 legal aid)\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the authority to do that by law. That\u2019s something that Congress should decide,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cWe do need to have immigration reform, but it does need to secure the border and do so demonstrably.\u201d\n\nBut Al Cardenas, the former Florida Republican Party chairman who helmed the American Conservative Union, cautioned that what voters hear from the GOP in 2014 may resonate to the party\u2019s detriment later on.\n\n\u201cThe bigger the political prize is, the more counterproductive these hard-hitting amnesty positions are,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cYou can find certain congressional districts where, politically, maybe this kind of harsh rhetoric is self-serving.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders in Washington say that even a few months ago, the short- and long-term political math might have argued against a border-hawk message in 2014. Yet as the economy shows fresh signs of life and the white-hot national firestorm over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s botched rollout subsides at least modestly, Republicans have turned with greater frequency to the broad-strokes argument that Obama and his party are simply incompetent to run the country.\n\nBorder control would seem to be a case in point: At the end of July, an AP/GfK poll showed that 68 percent of Americans disapproved of Obama\u2019s handling of immigration. About the same fraction called illegal immigration an \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery serious\u201d problem.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring predicted that go-it-alone immigration actions from the White House \u201cwould be the political equivalent of nuclear explosion for Democratic candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Executive Amnesty would inject adrenaline into an electorate already eager to send him a message of disapproval,\u201d Dayspring wrote in an email.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans exhort voters to punish the White House for failing to lock down the border.", "title": "'Amnesty' card: GOP's border war", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/republicans-border-crisis-2014-elections-109988.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/06/immigration_border_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Immigration Reform,Republicans,Border Security,Immigration,Border Crisis", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans exhort voters to punish the White House for failing to lock down the border.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc71\"", "article_summary": "'Amnesty' card: GOP's border warSo much for that fresh start with Latino voters.\nRepublican candidates are lacing into the Obama administration and its congressional allies for supporting \u201camnesty\u201d and casting them as unable to secure the southern border.\nMany prominent Republicans, from House Speaker John Boehner to billionaire super-donor Sheldon Adelson, still support immigration reform in word.\nAnd the most prominent national Republican voice on immigration and the border is no longer Florida Sen.
