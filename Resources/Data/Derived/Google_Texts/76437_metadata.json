No action or payment is required by ADP shareholders to receive the common stock of CDK Global in the distribution. Shareholders who hold ADP common stock on the record date will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of CDK Global common stock, or their brokerage account will be credited for the shares. The share distribution ratio for the spin is expected to be announced early next week.\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, ADP's U.S. shareholders (other than those subject to special rules) generally should not recognize gain or loss as a result of the distribution of CDK Global shares, except with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares. ADP shareholders are urged to consult with a tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of the CDK Global spin-off.\n\nADP expects that CDK Global common stock will begin \"when-issued\" trading on September 22, 2014 in the public market on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"CDKVV\" and will continue through the distribution date. ADP also anticipates that \"regular way\" trading of CDK Global will commence on the first trading day following the distribution date, October 1, 2014, under the symbol \"CDK\".\n\nBeginning on September 22, 2014, and through the distribution date, it is expected that there will be two ways to trade ADP common stock - either with or without the right to receive shares of CDK Global common stock. Shareholders who sell their shares of ADP common stock in normal trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"ADP\" after the record date and on or prior to the distribution date will be selling their right to receive shares of CDK Global in connection with the distribution. It is anticipated that shares of ADP common stock will also trade without the right to receive the CDK Global distribution during that period under the symbol \"ADPVV\". Investors are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the specific implications of buying or selling ADP common stock on or before the distribution date.\n\nThe planned spin-off of Dealer Services into CDK Global will allow both ADP and CDK Global the opportunity to focus on their respective industries. ADP will remain focused on enhancing its position as a leading global provider of HCM solutions, while CDK Global will be focused on providing leading global technology solutions dedicated to helping dealerships and manufacturers drive measurable results.\n\nAbout ADP\n\nWith more than $12 billion in revenues and 65 years of experience, ADP\u00ae (Nasdaq:ADP) serves approximately 637,000 clients in more than 125 countries.
