Q: Why is coconut oil suddenly considered healthy after being declared unhealthy for three decades?

A: Coconut oil’s image has had a makeover in recent years. But despite “a lot of hype about it,” said Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, a Tufts University professor of nutrition science and policy, “there’s virtually no data to support the hype.”

Coconut oil is high in saturated fat, which has been linked to high cholesterol levels and heart disease. Though critics have recently raised questions about the scientific evidence for the link, longstanding dietary guidelines urge Americans to reduce saturated fat intake to less than 10 percent of daily calories.

There is little research on the health effects in people of coconut oil, Lichtenstein said, but “there appears to be no independent benefit of consuming it.”

That said, virgin coconut oil may not have the same harmful effects as highly processed oils, said Dr. Tom Brenna, a professor of human nutrition at Cornell University. Refined, bleached and deodorized — RBD — coconut oil, treated with solvents and subjected to intense heat, raises cholesterol so reliably that scientists have used it as a control in experiments. The harsh processing may destroy some of the good essential fatty acids and antioxidants, such as lauric acid.

“If you’re going to use coconut oil, make sure you get virgin oil,” Brenna said.
