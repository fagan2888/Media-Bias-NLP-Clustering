Denver police blocked off 13th Avenue access to downtown after apparent manhole explosions near 13th Avenue and Pennsylvania Street Saturday night.

Residents and bar patrons, who were told to evacuate the area, said they heard explosions. “Power went out, followed by three loud booms,” said Phil Kasch, 33. He and three friends were told to leave by bar security because the area was being cleared.

Police told Damon Montoya, 50, who lives on Pennsylvania that he couldn’t go back into his apartment. “They said there was some manhole covers that blew up,” Montoya said.

There were similar problems twice last week, Montoya said. “Same thing. Starting with electricity going out and explosions.”

Apartment blocks around the intersection, the cathedral, and business along East Colfax lost power.

Power was out after 10 p.m. between Grant and Pearl streets from Colfax Avenue to around 12th Avenue. Blinking Xcel Energy trucks rolled through the area and power was mostly restored by 10:30 p.m.
