That includes a deal with Chinook USA LLC to make and distribute a beverage named for Uncle Si, who drinks from a bottomless cup of iced tea on the show.\n\nAt least one branding expert said the Duck Commander family has too many products and trinkets, telling officials at the beverage maker that it\u2019s \u201csad to walk through their retail store in Monroe and see all the junk they\u2019ve licensed,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nThe over-scheduled Duck Commander family allegedly broke its contract to promote Uncle Si\u2019s Iced Tea in media interviews and special appearances, according to the lawsuit. Si Robertson also failed to promote the tea on nationally televised morning shows, the lawsuit said.\n\nAs a result, sales haven\u2019t been great for the beverage, which was unveiled in spring at a Nascar race near Dallas.\n\nDuck Commander and its licensing companies haven\u2019t responded to the lawsuit yet. The family\u2019s publicist did not respond to emailed requests for comment on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nChinook is now running low on money after spending more than $4.5 million on the project. Several million bottles are out for sale in at least 10 states, according to the company\u2019s website. It comes in four flavors: sweet, unsweet, peach, and half tea/half lemonade. Mr. Robertson, who served in the Vietnam War, drinks his tea unsweetened\u2014a nod to wartime sugar rationing.\n\nChinook filed for bankruptcy last week and laid off its roughly one-dozen employees while leaders figure out what to do. The firm\u2019s employees have worked on more than a dozen beverage brands, offering advice on sourcing raw materials, find production facilities or send drinks to its distribution network, according to its website. The employees also have worked with celebs like Kid Rock, Jimmy Fallon and the Black Eyed Peas and once put a spotlight on Hpnotiq liqueur\u2014a mix of vodka, cognac and fruit juice that\u2019s been promoted by Khloe Kardashian.\n\n\u201cNow, hopefully, we have the attention of the Robertsons,\u201d said Chinook lawyer J. Bruce Miller in an interview with Bankruptcy Beat. \u201cThey have a billion-dollar business, and they need to get it under control.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also said that Duck Commander shouldn\u2019t have made deals with two other companies that planned to make Duck Dynasty-branded vitamin water and energy shots. The contract gave Chinook the right to sell both the iced tea and any other \u201cready to drink\u201d beverage for at least five years, according to the lawsuit.\n\nSince 2012, Duck Dynasty has chronicled the camouflaged, bushy-bearded Robertson family in the Louisiana bayou, documenting what it\u2019s like to get rich off of selling duck-hunting calls. The fourth season of the A&E network show in mid-2013 drew an audience of 11.8 million viewers, breaking the cable television industry\u2019s record for most-watched nonfiction telecast.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
