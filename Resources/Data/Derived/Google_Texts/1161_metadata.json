The Cyclones have won three of the last four games in the rivalry. Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy\n\nCole Netten hit a 42-yard field goal with two seconds left and Iowa State rallied to beat Iowa, 20-17, on Saturday, picking up its first win of the season.\n\nSam Richardson had 255 yards passing and 2 TDs for the Cyclones (1-2), who beat the rival Hawkeyes (2-1) for the third time in four tries.\n\nIowa State took a 17-14 lead with 7:33 left on Richardson's 27-yard TD pass to DeVondrick Nealy. Iowa answered with Marshall Koehn's 44-yard field goal with 4:08 to go.\n\nNetten appeared to miss his first try at the game-winner, but Iowa had already called a timeout.\n\nNetten's second attempt went straight through the uprights.\n\nJake Rudock threw for 146 yards and an interception for Iowa, which was held to just three points after halftime.\n\nDown, 14-3, midway through the third quarter, Iowa State found itself in desperate need of a spark.\n\nT.J. Mutcherson gave the Cyclones life with their first takeaway of the season, intercepting Rudock and returning it to the Iowa 32. Richardson then found E.J. Bibbs with a jump pass on fourth and inches to pull Iowa State to 14-10 with 6:50 left in the third quarter.\n\nThe Cyclones went 92 yards on their initial go-ahead drive \u2014 which was aided by a targeting call that got Iowa safety Jordan Lomax ejected and Iowa State's Jarvis West knocked out of the game.\n\nKoehn's game-tying kick was just his third made field goal in six tries.\n\nWest Virginia 40, Maryland 37: Clint Trickett passed for 511 yards and four touchdowns, and the Mountaineers (2-1) gave away a 22-point lead before Josh Lambert kicked a 47-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Terrapins (2-1) in College Park, Md.\n\nWest Virginia let a 28-6 lead dwindle to 28-27 in the third quarter, then gave away a 10-point advantage in the fourth quarter before Trickett directed a 65-yard drive to set up Lambert's winning kick.\n\nTrickett went 37 for 49, and his passing yardage was the second-most in West Virginia history behind a 656-yard performance by Geno Smith in 2012. The Mountaineers finished with a whopping 694 yards in offense compared to 447 for Maryland.\n\nBowling Green 45, Indiana 42: James Knapke threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Roger Lewis with 9 seconds to play as the host Falcons (2-1) knocked off the Hoosiers (1-1).\n\nKnapke, a redshirt sophomore making his second career start, set school records for attempts (73) and completed passes (46) as he threw for 395 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nLewis, a freshman, finished with 16 receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown.\n\n(22) Ohio State 66, Kent State 0: J.T. Barrett matched a school record with six touchdown passes \u2014 five in the first half \u2014 to lead the Buckeyes (2-1) over the Golden Flashes (0-3) in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe win was the 39th in a row over an in-state opponent for Ohio State, which hasn't lost since a 7-6 setback to Oberlin in 1921.\n\nNow the Buckeyes, who plummeted 14 spots in the polls and weathered a lot of criticism after last week's 35-21 loss at home to the Hokies, have a bye week before hosting Cincinnati on Sept. 27.\n\nMichigan 34, Miami (Ohio) 10: Derrick Green ran for 137 yards and two touchdowns, and the Wolverines (2-1) overcame three first-half turnovers to beat the RedHawks (0-3) in Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nMichigan allowed only eight first downs, but it wasn't a particularly impressive win against a Miami team that has lost 19 straight. Michigan was coming off a 31-0 loss to Notre Dame, and the Wolverines struggled to put this game away.\n\nTCU 30, Minnesota 7: Receiver Josh Doctson caught two first-half touchdown receptions and the Horned Frogs' defense smothered the Golden Gophers' run-oriented attack in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nTCU (2-0) forced five turnovers and held Minnesota (2-1) to 99 yards rushing \u2014 134 below its average.\n\nWashington 44, Illinois 19: Linebacker Shaq Thompson returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown, picked up a fumble and rumbled 52 yards for another score, and the Huskies routed the Illini (2-1), improving to 3-0 under Chris Petersen.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Cyclones storm to win over Hawkeyes", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/cyclones-storm-to-win-over-hawkeyes-b99350968z1-275034171.html", "image": {"width": 1467, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99350968z.1_20140913230724_000_g437s11f.1-1.jpg", "height": 921}, "type": "article", "description": "Cole Netten hit a 42-yard field goal with two seconds left and Iowa State rallied to beat Iowa, 20-17, on Saturday, picking up its first win of the season.", "title": "Cyclones storm to win over Hawkeyes"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99350968z.1_20140913230724_000_g437s11f.1-1.jpg", "title": "Cyclones storm to win over Hawkeyes", "description": "Cole Netten hit a 42-yard field goal with two seconds left and Iowa State rallied to beat Iowa, 20-17, on Saturday, picking up its first win of the season.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@journalsentinel"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Iowa State players celebrate with the Cy-Hawk trophy after defeating Iowa, 20-17, on Saturday.\nCredit: Associated PressByCole Netten hit a 42-yard field goal with two seconds left and Iowa State rallied to beat Iowa, 20-17, on Saturday, picking up its first win of the season.\nDown, 14-3, midway through the third quarter, Iowa State found itself in desperate need of a spark.\nBibbs with a jump pass on fourth and inches to pull Iowa State to 14-10 with 6:50 left in the third quarter.\nSam Richardson had 255 yards passing and 2 TDs for the Cyclones (1-2), who beat the rival Hawkeyes (2-1) for the third time in four tries."}
