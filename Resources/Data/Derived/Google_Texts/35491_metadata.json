The engine in his Chevrolet overheated in his Can-Am Duel qualifying race Thursday night, but it was scheduled to be replaced anyway. Menard is scheduled to line up 37th Sunday, but as drivers drop back for changing into backup cars or other reasons, he'll take the green flag in a better position than that.\n\nKenseth, a two-time Daytona 500 winner from Cambridge, is among those who will drop back. A crash in the Duel wiped out the car with which he had qualified second-fastest and would would have started alongside Chase Elliott on the front row.\n\nOf the 25 drivers who practiced Saturday, Kenseth turned 30 laps, the most laps of anyone, and ranked 21st-best, more than a second off the pace of Dale Earnhardt Jr., the fastest.\n\nHere's what Kenseth said in a brief interview after practice:\n\nQ. Today . . . any better, any worse? The same as yesterday?\n\nA. It\u2019s hard to say. It\u2019s hard to say honestly. The weather is quite a bit different, the wind is different. I don\u2019t know. It felt like we were more competitive yesterday. Today we just did all single-car stuff, never ran with any other cars, so it\u2019s hard to compare.\n\nQ. Do you approach the race any different from there? Does it matter?\n\nA. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d much rather be in the front. I think there\u2019s going to be some cars that hang in the back in the beginning, hoping there\u2019s a wreck and they\u2019re not in it and then start racing after that. I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ve got to think about it and go from there. Maybe do that for a run or two, but typically when everybody\u2019s trying to be careful is the time you should try to make your way to the front. That\u2019s the time to do it. When everybody\u2019s trying to get to the front, that\u2019s a great time to already be in the front. You\u2019ve got to play it by ear. I don\u2019t like being in the back.\n\nQ. The first car seemed to be really, really, unusually good. Any reason to think this one won\u2019t be the same?\n\nA. We didn\u2019t get in a ton of different situations with our 500 car. We were up toward the front. We were first or second. We did get shuffled back, and I couldn\u2019t get recovered the way I wanted to. But it did seem like obviously I did qualify well and did have good speed. It\u2019s honestly hard to tell what you have here until you get in the race tomorrow and get toward the front, and then you can kind of tell.\n\nQ. You mentioned not being in a lot of positions the other night. Maybe this is a stretch, but is there some benefit to having to have to work traffic early in the race, to learn?\n\nA. Nah, not really. You\u2019re so far in the back and the draft is so big that until you get up to the top seven or eight rows you can hardly ever run wide open anyways. It\u2019s just whether you can pick a place to go or not. I wanted to learn a little more Thursday and hopfully still have that car, but the track\u2019s going to be totally different, so we haven\u2019t really practiced in big groups for the race.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Daytona 500 final practice update for Wisconsin drivers Paul Menard, Matt Kenseth", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/369535881.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "<br /><br />Daytona Beach, Fla. -- Paul Menard took Saturday off, and Matt Kenseth turned more laps than anyone in the final practice before Sunday's 58th Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway.<br />", "title": "Daytona 500 final practice update for Wisconsin drivers Paul Menard, Matt Kenseth"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "<br /><br />Daytona Beach, Fla. -- Paul Menard took Saturday off, and Matt Kenseth turned more laps than anyone in the final practice before Sunday's 58th Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway.<br />", "card": "summary", "title": "Daytona 500 final practice update for Wisconsin drivers Paul Menard, Matt Kenseth"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The first car seemed to be really, really, unusually good.\nI don\u2019t know.\nA.
