The letter came in response to complaints after Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount University excluded elective abortion from their employee insurance policies on religious grounds.\n\n\n\nThe letter cites California\u2019s Constitution and the 1975 Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act, which \u201crequires the provision of basic health care services\u201d in justification of their abortion mandate.\n\n\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, on behalf of the Foothill Church in Glendora, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino, and The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch.\n\n\n\nThe churches are suing Michelle Rouillard, the director of the DMHC, who issued the letter, and are seeking injunctive and declarative relief against the mandate.\n\nThe lawsuit states that the churches have been searching for a way to \u201cprovide health insurance coverage to their employees in a way that does not also cause them to pay for abortions,\u201d as they believe that \u201cabortion kills an innocent human life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause no exemption exists from the Mandate, Plaintiffs\u2019 group health insurance plans were changed to include elective abortion coverage without their authorization and over their objections,\u201d the lawsuit points out.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit also charges that the DMHC \u201crealizing that Plaintiffs and others have sincerely held religious beliefs against paying for or providing coverage for abortion,\u201d still \u201cencouraged the insurers to hide these changes by informing them that they may \u2018omit any mention of coverage for abortion services in health plan documents.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nInitially last year, ADF filed a complaint directly with DMHC, claiming among other things that their mandate violates federal law, namely the Hyde-Weldon Amendment which \u201cforbids governmental bodies receiving federal funds from discriminating against those who decline to take part in abortion or abortion coverage.\u201d\n\n\n\nADF and Life Legal Defense Foundation went on to file formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services against DMHC back in October 2014. However, the lawsuit states: \u201cTo date, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights has not indicated whether it intends to enforce the Hyde-Weldon Amendment, leading Plaintiffs to file this lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cElective abortions are not part of \u2018basic health care,\u2019\u201d ADF Litigation Staff Counsel Jeremiah Galus said in a statement. \u201cThey have no business being forced into the medical coverage provided by churches that do not wish to support terminating lives due to very real, sincere, and well-known faith convictions. We hope the court will require California to follow the Constitution and respect these churches\u2019 fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause Obamacare requires health insurance coverage, and the California mandate requires abortion coverage in any health plan, these churches are truly left with no way to opt out of paying for abortions,\u201d Galus explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s absurd, though,\u201d he added, \u201cis that the same government that rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage. Californians should not be forced to choose between following their deepest convictions and submitting to unlawful and unnecessary government mandates.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Three California churches filed a lawsuit Friday against California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) as part of their fight against the DMHC\u2019s classification last year of elective abortion as a \u201cbasic health service,\u201d mandating abortion coverage in all state health care plans with no religious exemptions.", "title": "California Churches File Lawsuit to Fight Mandatory Abortion Funding in Health Plans", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/california-churches-file-lawsuit-fight-mandatory-abortion-funding-health", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/pro-life_protesters.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-19T15:51:39-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T15:51:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T15:51:39-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three California churches filed a lawsuit Friday against California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) as part of their fight against the DMHC\u2019s classification last year of elective abortion as a \u201cbasic health service,\u201d mandating abortion coverage in all state health care plans with no religious exemptions.", "title": "California Churches File Lawsuit to Fight Mandatory Abortion Funding in Health Plans", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/california-churches-file-lawsuit-fight-mandatory-abortion-funding-health", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/pro-life_protesters.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Three California churches filed a lawsuit Friday against California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) as part of their fight against the DMHC\u2019s classification last year of elective abortion as a \u201cbasic health service,\u201d mandating abortion coverage in all state health care plans with no religious exemptions.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The letter cites California\u2019s Constitution and the 1975 Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act, which \u201crequires the provision of basic health care services\u201d in justification of their abortion mandate.\n(AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Three California churches filed a lawsuit Friday against California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) as part of their fight against the DMHC\u2019s classification last year of elective abortion as a \u201cbasic health service,\u201d mandating abortion coverage in all state health care plans with no religious exemptions.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s absurd, though,\u201d he added, \u201cis that the same government that rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage.\nThe California DMHC stated in an August 2014 letter to seven insurance companies that they were required to include elective abortions in their health plans with no exceptions.\nThe letter came in response to complaints after Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount University excluded elective abortion from their employee insurance policies on religious grounds."}
