Let's face it: No matter whether your votes lean red or blue, you're going to need alcohol to get through Thursday's GOP debate. There will be 10 presidential candidates on stage trying to impress the public before the Republican primary, and with that many people the conversation is guaranteed to be interesting.

First, gather your friends and tune into Fox News or a live stream from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT on Thursday. Next, lay down the rules. Most early-debate drinking games fall into two categories: general-issue or candidate-specific. We're going to combine them, but you still need to choose a candidate to root (read: drink) for.

Pick your poison, then select your favorite from this lineup: Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John Kasich.

But also, per You Might Notice A Trend, make sure everyone drinks if:

A candidate references former President Ronald Reagan.

Trump brags about his wealth.

Someone denies climate change.

Walker mentions labor unions.

Fox News is praised for holding the debate.

Christie makes a Bruce Springsteen reference.

Bush tries to distance himself from his family.

Rubio criticizes the reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba.

You think a question is too easy.

Someone makes a bad joke.

Be sure to drink responsibly -- the election isn't for another year, after all.
