(Photo: Special to the Citizen-Times)\n\nWestern North Carolinians, like people everywhere, want convenient and timely health care.\n\nThey appear to be getting their wish addressed, as a growing trend emerges with urgent care centers.\n\nThe region\u2019s urgent care industry has seen appreciable growth recently, with four new centers opening in the past few years alone.\n\nSisters of Mercy, for example, has four centers in the Asheville area \u2014 the last opened in 2010 \u2014 and it has plans to add another within two years, CEO Tim Johnston said.\n\n\u201cThere is a demand on the part of consumers for convenient, quick, easy access to health care when they want it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides another way to access care for people who don\u2019t need ongoing care of chronic conditions.\u201d\n\nUrgent care centers provide walk-in medical care during traditional doctors\u2019 hours as well as on weekends and evenings. Typically, they treat minor conditions such as colds and flu, sprains and cuts.\n\nAround the country, there are about 6,400 urgent care centers, each of which sees on average 342 patients a week, according to the Urgent Care Association of America.\n\nThey\u2019re on the rise. Between 2008 and 2010, these centers grew at a rate of about 300 a year nationwide, according to the group. And that growth rate doubled in 2011.\n\nAt least 183 urgent care centers operate in North Carolina, the association reports. While they\u2019re usually staffed by doctors, about half also have physician assistants and nurse practitioners.\n\nAnd they\u2019re popping up because people want more convenient hours for medical care.\n\nCommunity access\n\n\u201cBeing able to get to a physician or someone who can help you with something that is not an emergency, but needs to be dealt with sooner rather than later outside your regular working hours is really important to people,\u201d said Alwyn Cassil, an independent health policy consultant with Policy Translation in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s putting access into the community where people actually can get to it in a more convenient way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to take a whole day off to go to the doctor.\u201d\n\nDr. Ateev Mehrotra, a policy analyst at the nonprofit RAND Corp. who has researched urgent care centers, said it\u2019s the result of a societal shift.\n\n\u201cWhat you expect from a bank or grocery store is 24/7 and people are expecting that ... from health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat might have been acceptable for your grandmother \u2014 that the doctor will see you in a couple of days \u2014 people don\u2019t accept that any more.\u201d\n\nReuel Heyden, director of communications for FastMed Urgent Care, which has opened three centers in the Asheville-Hendersonville area in the past two years, one as recently as four months ago in Candler, said there\u2019s definitely a demand.\n\n\u201cSince 2011,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve grown exponentially \u2014 over 350 percent.\u201d\n\nPardee Hospital opened Pardee Urgent Care at the Mission-Pardee Health Campus about 18 months ago in Fletcher on the county line between Buncombe and Henderson counties, spokesman Adam Fisher said.\n\n\u201cThe Fletcher area has been one that shows growth and there are a lot of families moving in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognized the need for an urgent care in that area.\u201d\n\nPardee has another urgent care center in Hendersonville that\u2019s been open for several years. Both are extremely busy, Fisher said.\n\nDoctor shortage\n\nThe lack of primary care doctors also is fostering the growth. Nationally, a new report from the Association of American Medical Colleges projects a shortage of between 46,000 and 90,000 doctors in the next decade, including 12,500 to 31,100 primary care physicians.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a documented need for primary care physicians nationwide,\u201d Johnston said, \u201cand a significant and growing shortage.\u201d\n\nMehrotra said the Affordable Care Act also has affected the provider side, because more insured people are seeking a primary care doctor.\n\n\u201cThe biggest complaint I hear is it\u2019s hard to get in to see your doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now more people want care more quickly and need an alternative.\u201d\n\nA 2013 study by the Center for Studying Health System Change showed that while urgent care centers don\u2019t increase the number of providers, they may improve access because they offer more convenient hours.\n\nInsurers are generally supportive of urgent care as a way to keep people out of far more expensive ERs, Cassil said. It\u2019s generally less expensive than ERs for patients, as well, because the copay is lower.\n\nSome hospitals also open urgent care centers to keep people out of the ER for minor conditions that can be handled in a less-expensive setting.\n\n\u201cIt does help alleviate the demand on our emergency room, so it\u2019s not as overwhelmed,\u201d Pardee\u2019s Fisher said. \u201cUrgent care is designed to be another avenue for patient access.\u201d\n\nCassil, however, said there is some question as to how hard hospitals try to keep people out of the ER, because it\u2019s a source of profits from insured patients. But for those that take on some of the financial risk for patient outcomes \u2014 called accountable care organizations \u2014 it makes economic sense to find less expensive ways of providing care.\n\nThe wait is also typically much shorter than at ERs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based largely on a cost-effective alternative to expensive and long delays in hospital ERs that has continued to get worse over the last couple of decades,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nCassil said that while there is optimism that urgent care centers can improve people\u2019s care experience and reduce costs, there is no clear evidence yet that shows a savings.\n\nOne RAND Corp. study, however, concluded that about 17 percent of all ER visits could be handled at retail medical clinics or urgent care centers, saving an estimated $4.4 billion a year in health care costs.\n\nBlurred lines\n\nWhile urgent care centers traditionally have been operated by physician groups and hospitals, an increasing number today are run by for-profit chains and even insurers, said Mehrotra, noting there has been rapid growth in retail clinics, such as CVS\u2019s MinuteClinics, and virtual, or E-visits, as well.\n\nHumana, for example, owns Concentra, a chain of 300 urgent care centers nationwide.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies used to be all about insurance, they didn\u2019t deliver care, but we\u2019re seeing a blurring of those lines,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cThey view it as the world is changing and they need to get into delivering care. And they are hoping fewer people go to the emergency department.\u201d\n\nUrgent care centers also are increasingly funded by venture capital money, Mehrotra said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen in health care,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are profitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a business model, it\u2019s growing so well it leads you to believe there is certainly a demand there,\u201d said Cassil. \u201cAlthough in health care we are very good at creating more capacity than we need sometimes.\u201d\n\nAround the country, she said, hospitals also are setting up urgent care centers as a way to get new patients.\n\nSo are there downsides to more urgent care centers in the health care landscape?\n\nSome worry that going to an urgent care center could undermine a patient\u2019s relationship with a primary care doctor, who also manages other aspects of care, such as reminders for screening tests, Mehrotra said.\n\nBut people who use urgent care centers still go to their primary care providers, just less often, he said. And many people say they see a nurse practitioner these days instead of their doctor anyway.\n\nCassil said that becomes less of a problem as more practices adopt electronic medical records so information can be shared.\n\nAnother concern is that since patients are paying more for their health care out of pocket, and urgent care centers can cost 30 percent to 40 percent more than a doctor\u2019s office, patients may wind up spending more, Mehrotra said.\n\nFuture growth\n\nThe nonprofit Sisters of Mercy, which has been in the region for 115 years, has been running urgent care centers for 30 years \u2014 three in the Greater Asheville Area and one in Brevard, Johnston said.\n\nAll have been relocated to newer, larger facilities in the past six years.\n\nThey\u2019ve grown at a rate of about 2 percent to 3 percent a year despite other urgent cares and retail clinics opening up in the region, Johnston said.\n\nThe organization has been looking for about a year at adding another center in Eastern Buncombe County, he said. While no final location has been determined, he said he expects it will be up and running within two years.\n\nFisher said he\u2019s not aware of any plans for nonprofit Pardee to open any more.\n\nHeyden said that when deciding to open a new urgent care, FastMed \u2014 a privately owned company in which BlueCross has a minority share in Western North Carolina \u2014 considers drive time, population density, the age of primary care physicians in the area and other factors.\n\nPrimary care doctors, who may not be taking new patients and not have extended hours, don\u2019t typically view FastMed as competition, he said, but as a support to local doctors in a symbiotic relationship.\n\nThough the company has looked at communities further west for expansion, nothing is confirmed at this time, Heyden said. Most expansion is concentrated in the Eastern part of the state.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1MNA6qI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "WNC wants convenient and timely health care.", "og": {"site_name": "Citizen Times", "description": "WNC wants convenient and timely health care.", "title": "Patient demand fueling growth of urgent care centers", "url": "http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/03/19/patient-demand-fueling-growth-urgent-care-centers/25022475/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/citizen-times.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WNC wants convenient and timely health care.", "title": "Patient demand fueling growth of urgent care centers", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ab63d0dff0d636cfbac13f6a8e46c9a71320c21/c=262-0-937-675&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Asheville/2015/03/19/B9316664061Z.1_20150319134831_000_G59A91GBR.4-0.jpg", "creator": "@asheville", "site": "@asheville", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=787264923", "fb": {"app_id": 117201858348253}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Around the country, there are about 6,400 urgent care centers, each of which sees on average 342 patients a week, according to the Urgent Care Association of America.\nBut people who use urgent care centers still go to their primary care providers, just less often, he said.\n\u201cWe recognized the need for an urgent care in that area.\u201dPardee has another urgent care center in Hendersonville that\u2019s been open for several years.\nSo are there downsides to more urgent care centers in the health care landscape?\nThey appear to be getting their wish addressed, as a growing trend emerges with urgent care centers."}
