GRAND RAPIDS, MI – More than 4,000 fruit and vegetable farmers and farming experts from 42 states and seven Canadian provinces are planning to attend the Great Lakes Farm Expo, at DeVos Place and the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel from Dec. 9 to Dec. 11.

“The Great Lakes Farm Expo is the premier show of its kind in the country,” said Dave Smith, Executive Director at the Michigan Vegetable Council, in a news release.

“Nearly a third of the growers who attend come from outside Michigan. In total, the expo brings more than 6,000 people to Grand Rapids.”

As the “ultimate show for fruit and vegetable growers,” the expo will include more than 400 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services in the convention center.

The expo also will include an education program, bus tours of farm markets and greenhouses, and a chance to visit with growers, farm marketers and industry associates from the Great Lakes region and beyond.

Sixty-nine educational sessions will be offered on topics such as fruit and vegetable crops, specialty crops such as chestnuts and hops, greenhouse crop production, farm marketing ideas and operations, farmers markets and organic production and marketing.

General interest topics will include food safety, hoop houses and tunnels, farm labor and the Affordable Care Act.

The conference also will feature presentations by researchers and extension educators from Michigan State University and other “land grant” universities and research stations, including speakers from Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands. There will also be presentations by farm marketers and several grower panels.

More information for the Great Lakes Fruit, Vegetable and Farm Market EXPO is available on the Expo’s website (GLEXPO.com).
