But Ben Domingo, director of Health Services, said it\u2019s fair to say that about 25 percent of students are underinsured, meaning they have some sort of health care coverage, but it may not be adequate.\n\nIn an effort to improve health care coverage across the university, SU is implementing a student health insurance plan that requires all full-time students to carry some form of coverage compatible with President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. The plan will cost $1,890 and is in line with other universities across the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not forcing you to buy our plan. We\u2019re instilling an insurance requirement and an investment in your education,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cWe want to make sure that you\u2019re insured the same way that you can\u2019t have a car without car insurance.\u201d\n\nBeginning Aug. 1, all incoming, newly matriculated, matriculated international full-time students and graduate student fellows will be required to have health insurance. The following year, all full-time matriculated students will be required to have health insurance.\n\nThe process to assess a university-wide plan began in 2012 when a Student Health Insurance Advisory Committee was convened. The committee analyzed the Affordable Care Act and looked at the risk of SU students who are uninsured or underinsured, among other duties.\n\nThe committee, which was chaired by Domingo and Executive Director of Human Resources Operation Karen Morrissey, found that students who are uninsured or underinsured face many challenges, including receiving proper care, and some are forced to withdraw from the university due to significant medical expenses that are not covered by insurance.\n\nWhile SU offered its own plan, the coverage was found to be unsustainable and nearly every peer institution looked at by the committee required all students to have health insurance, with the one exception being Baylor University, according to SU\u2019s consultants.\n\n\u201cThe plan was spiraling out of control,\u201d Domingo said of SU\u2019s offering.\n\nMany of the students who had purchased the plan were high-end users, meaning those who had the insurance used it a lot. This led to carriers not showing interest in offering plans at SU, Domingo added. Last year there were about 245 students on the voluntary plan.\n\nDomingo said that at other peer institutions, some students get off their parents\u2019 health insurance because policies such as the one SU is implementing are cheaper.\n\n\u201cSyracuse University right now is currently an outlier,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new health insurance plan is not a substitute for the health and wellness fee.\n\nMorrissey, one of the co-chairs of the advisory committee, said the health and wellness fee is independent of the health insurance policy. She added that right now, anybody can go to Health Services to receive primary care, but what the insurance policy does is provide care for more serious medical treatment that has to be done off-campus.\n\nFour health care providers put in bids for the right to cover SU students. Aetna Student Health, a Massachusetts-based insurance company, will offer the $1,890-a-year plan to SU students. The company currently serves about 200 other schools, according to its website.\n\nAetna has filed its plans with New York state to make its plans compliant with the Affordable Care Act, Morrissey said.\n\nThose who are subject to the insurance requirement are defaulted into the plan, but may be waived by showing proof of other coverage that is Obamacare-compliant and that provides in- or out-of-network coverage in the Syracuse area for more than just emergency care.\n\nAll \u201ctentacles\u201d of the university are involved, such as the Division of Student Affairs, the Health Center, graduate officials, the Slutzker Center for International Services and enrollment management, among others, Morrissey said.\n\nMorrissey said SU is still figuring out the financial aid side of it, but peer institutions have some variance in their financial aid for required health insurance.\n\nMichelle McCormick, a special benefits specialist at SU, said SU\u2019s goal is to ensure that all students have access to an affordable insurance option and the $1,890 is much lower than other gold-level plans sold on the New York State of Health Marketplace.\n\n\u201cIf you were to get this on the exchanges, you\u2019re looking at $3,500 to $6,000 roughly for what students are able to get for $1,890,\u201d said Domingo, the director of health services.\n\nStudent Association President Boris Gresely said that as someone who doesn\u2019t have health insurance, he finds the cost and the ability to have the care outside of the Syracuse network to be beneficial.\n\n\u201cAs young adults we don\u2019t fall victim as quickly to illness and that may be a reason why we don\u2019t get health insurance, but it\u2019s very important because the university is increasing a lot of its health services\u2026 and all of that should be utilized by the students,\u201d he said.\n\nGresely said that while he supports it, SA has not taken a definitive stance.\n\n\u201cSometimes in your life you don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re going to have an accident or not and if you do have one, especially considering the high levels of alcohol consumption, having health insurance is very important,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we go to school to get an education and succeed in life and all that, you can\u2019t do that without health. Health comes first.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "/wp-content/themes/ostrom/images/do-icon.png", "description": "SU is implementing a student health insurance plan that requires all full-time students to carry some form of coverage compatible with President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.
