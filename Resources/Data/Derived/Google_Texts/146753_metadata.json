The senators said they fear contracting work on the marketplaces could give an unfair benefit to the insurance arm of the company.\n\nGrassley and Hatch have raised these concerns before, but are renewing them now that Slavitt has moved up from deputy administrator to acting administrator at CMS.\n\n\u201cThe multiple relationships between Mr. Slavitt and United subsidiaries raise real concerns about how, and to what extent, CMS has prevented conflicts of interest given the fact CMS makes decisions that impact United and its subsidiaries every day,\u201d the senators write. \u201cWhile Mr. Slavitt may have recused himself from such decisions in the past, it may be difficult or impossible for him to do so in his current position at CMS.\u201d\n\nA CMS spokesman said the agency is reviewing the letter and referred The Hill to an ethics waiver that Slavitt signed when he joined the agency in June.\n\nThe waiver allows Slavitt to be involved in some matters relating to his former employer, but also sets limits.\n\nIt prevents him, for example, from being involved in awarding new contracts or performance bonuses to QSSI.\n\nAaron Albright, the CMS spokesman, said Slavitt has severed \"all financial ties with his former employer, which allows him to execute his duties and participate in broad policy matters. ... With limited exceptions as specified in the document, he is recused from participation in specific party matters, such as contracts or claims, involving his former employer.\"\n\nAlbright stressed that Slavitt was \"integral to both the relaunch of HealthCare.gov and this year\u2019s successful second open enrollment\" period for ObamaCare.\n\nIn February, CMS wrote a letter to Hatch responding to the senator's concerns about the other potential conflict of interest, between the insurance and website contracting arms of United Health.\n\nThe letter says that the agency has a \u201cmitigation strategy\u201d against conflicts of interest from QSSI. \u201cWe thereby limited QSSI involvement to areas where it would not provide subjective judgment, advice or recommendations on work in which it has a financial interest, including State-based Marketplace projects,\u201d the letter states.\n\nIt says workers who receive private information about the marketplaces cannot be transferred to a sister company.\n\nIn the letter released Wednesday, however, the senators say this response from CMS was \u201clargely unresponsive and did not provide sufficient information to relieve our concerns.\u201d\n\nThe senators are asking for all documents, including emails, related to evaluations of conflicts of interest Slavitt might have. They also ask for all of the instances of Slavitt recusing himself since June, and any exemptions he has received.\n\nThey ask for the response by April 8.\n\n\u2014 Updated at 6:58 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Two Republican senators are warning about a possible conflict of interest for Andy Slavitt.", "description": "Two Republican senators are warning about a possible conflict of interest for Andy Slavitt.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Two Republican senators are warning about a possible conflict of interest for Andy Slavitt.", "title": "GOP senators question industry ties of Obama health official", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/237649-gop-senators-raise-conflict-of-interest-concerns-about-top-health-official", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/slavittandrew_102414gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/237649-gop-senators-raise-conflict-of-interest-concerns-about-top-health-official", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-01T16:05-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-01T16:05:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/237649-gop-senators-raise-conflict-of-interest-concerns-about-top-health-official", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Two Republican senators are warning about a possible conflict of interest for Andy Slavitt.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP senators question industry ties of Obama health official"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP senators question industry ties of Obama health official"}, "article_summary": "Two Republican senators are warning about a possible conflict of interest for a top Obama administration health official who used to be an executive at a contractor for HealthCare.gov.\nThe senators said it is troubling that Slavitt now makes decisions at CMS that affect contractors where he used to work.\nIn February, CMS wrote a letter to Hatch responding to the senator's concerns about the other potential conflict of interest, between the insurance and website contracting arms of United Health.\nThe senators said they fear contracting work on the marketplaces could give an unfair benefit to the insurance arm of the company.\nThey also ask for all of the instances of Slavitt recusing himself since June, and any exemptions he has received."}
