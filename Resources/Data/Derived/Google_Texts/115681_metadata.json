That was 22 years before Lincoln, as president, issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring slaves in rebel states not under Union control free.\n\nNance Legins-Costley and her son William were from Pekin, a central Illinois community about 130 miles southwest of Chicago, which is what drew the interest of a local amateur historian, Carl Adams. Adams, who now lives in Stuttgart, Germany, spent years researching her and her children\u2019s lives . Last year he published \u201cNance: Trials of the First Slave Freed by Abraham Lincoln \u2014 A True Story of Nance Legins-Costley.\u201d\n\nIn his book, Adams writes that after winning her lengthy legal battle for freedom, Legins-Costley, who had been born to slaves and sold twice before Lincoln took up her cause, lived to a ripe old age in Pekin. Military records helped Adams retrace her son\u2019s steps, but finding his gravesite required the help of a curator at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, and a historical researcher in Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe are 99.9 percent certain that this is William H. Costley,\u201d Adams said of the gravesite.\n\nWilliam Costley enlisted as a private in the 29th Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops from Illinois in 1864, three years after the Civil War started following the election of Lincoln as president.\n\nCostley was wounded during the war, and after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered in April 1865, Costley\u2019s regiment was dispatched to Galveston, Texas. Adams said he may have witnessed Gen. Gordon Granger\u2019s June 19, 1865, declaration there that the state\u2019s 250,000 slaves were now free. That date is now celebrated as the holiday Juneteenth.\n\nIn 1870, an all-white jury acquitted Costley of murder in the fatal shooting of a man considered disreputable in the community. Costley\u2019s defense was that he killed him while protecting a woman.\n\nCostley moved to Iowa and later to Minnesota, where his health declined. A war wound, a head injury he suffered as a teenager and a case of sunstroke in 1887 eventually left him an invalid. He died in Minnesota in 1888, Adams said.\n\nAdams said Costley\u2019s pension records show that he had been sent to an insane asylum in Rochester, but he couldn\u2019t determine where he had been buried so he enlisted the help of Rich Arpi, a staffer with the Ramsey County Historical Society who also does independent research. Arpi found the Rochester State Hospital\u2019s records for a black patient named \u201cWilliam H. Crossley,\u201d whose grave was marked by a number at the institution\u2019s cemetery in what\u2019s now a city park until it was replaced recently by a \u201cCrossley\u201d headstone.\n\nBesides spellings that varied even within the pension and hospital records, there were other discrepancies that Adams needed to clear up. The dates of death were slightly different \u2014 Oct. 1 in the hospital records, Oct. 2 in the pension records. But the birth years were five years off. The researchers eventually concluded it had to be Costley\u2019s grave. Adams said Costley was illiterate, and may have been incoherent when admitted, so the spelling apparently just got jumbled along the way.\n\n\u201cI think it is so likely that it\u2019s nearly a sure thing,\u201d said James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection at the Lincoln Library and Museum, who consulted with Adams.\n\nCornelius said Adams has done a remarkable job of pulling together the history of Costley and his family and resolving the discrepancies to locate his grave given that \u201cvanishingly few records\u201d exist on most people who lived on the margins of society because they were slaves, poor or illiterate, as Costley was.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sleuths trace fate of 1st black male slave freed by Abraham Lincoln", "title": "Sleuths trace fate of 1st black male slave freed by Abraham Lincoln", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/18/sleuths-trace-fate-of-1st-black-male-slave-freed-by-abraham-lincoln/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_105033_abraham-lincoln.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_105033_abraham-lincoln.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T10:52:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:10:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are 99.9 percent certain that this is William H.
