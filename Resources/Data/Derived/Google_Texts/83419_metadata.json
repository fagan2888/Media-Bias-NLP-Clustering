Lutman/Special to The C)\n\nWhen Augusta Thomas was diagnosed with leukemia at age 82, doctors presented a life-or-death choice: chemotherapy or comfort measures.\n\nShe chose chemo, reasoning that she still travels, works as a national vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees and \u201cenjoys life to the fullest.\u201d But she adds that \u201ceverybody is different,\u201d and the option of forgoing curative treatment is just as valid.\n\nMillions of families in our aging nation face the same delicate decision about when to use life-extending but potentially-grueling treatment on the elderly and sick \u2014 and the medical world is responding. This year for the first time, Medicare began reimbursing doctors for having end-of-life discussions as a separate, billable service. And health experts are increasingly examining the issue, with three recent end-of-life studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association among the growing body of research.\n\n\u201cThe culture has long had a belief that (doctors) can get everybody better no matter how sick, old or infected. But that turns out not to be true,\u201d says Arthur Caplan, head of the division of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center. \u201cSome people think giving up on treatment is tantamount to suicide,\u201d he said, but in many cases it can be the right choice.\n\nExperts say the U.S. medical establishment tends to overuse extraordinary technology because it\u2019s there and because of a queasy attitude about death. While it makes sense for an active 91-year-old like former President Jimmy Carter to undergo extensive treatment for melanoma, they say, such measures make less sense for a bedridden patient with dementia. It often comes down to quality of life.\n\n\u201cThe decision is frequently not, \u2018Can we do something?\" says Steven Etoch, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Norton Healthcare in Louisville. \"It's, 'Should we do something?'\"\n\nFor Vicki Rose, 71, the answer was no. Rose, a retired senior center director from Georgetown, Ky., has endometrial cancer that has spread throughout her body, but decided against chemotherapy and has been getting care from Hospice of the Bluegrass for about a week. \"I prefer to choose dignity on my way out,\" she says.\n\nWhichever path patients choose \u2014 cure or not \u2014 many doctors say they need to have more and earlier access to palliative care, which aims to ease symptoms and treatment side effects as well as related social, psychological and spiritual problems.\n\nForgoing treatment \"is a very personal choice,\u201d Rose says. \u201cFor me, I believe in heaven, and I know that\u2019s where I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\nHigh-stakes decision\n\nWhile the choice is personal, there's a public cost.\n\nRoughly 12% of U.S. health care spending overall is for care in the last year of life. And federal officials say about 15% of Medicare reimbursements are for spending during a patient\u2019s last six months, at an average of about $30,000 a person.\n\nMuch of that goes to hospitals. Compared with other developed nations, U.S. per-person hospital spending on seniors 65 and older in their last 180 days was high \u2014 averaging $18,500 \u2014 even though a relatively low percentage of Americans die in hospitals, according to one of the recent JAMA articles. That\u2019s partly because 27% of American seniors are admitted to intensive care in the last 30 days of life, twice the rate of other countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just very expensive,\u201d says lead author Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and oncologist widely considered an architect of Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019re still using too much high-tech medicine.\u201d\n\nEmanuel says insurers don\u2019t drive such decisions; they generally pay for what doctors recommend. Not only is Medicare prevented by law from interfering with the practice of medicine, experts say letting insurers have more influence is too politically fraught, evoking the controversial idea of \u201cdeath panels.\u201d So it\u2019s up to doctors and patients to improve end-of-life care by talking about it earlier in the disease process than they do now, experts say.\n\nDetail of the arm of Augusta Thomas, 83, as she undergoes chemotherapy at the Norton Cancer Institute. 23 January 2016 (Photo: David R. Lutman/Special to The C)\n\nAt this point, Caplan says, most Americans haven\u2019t created or updated advance directives to relay their wishes, and many don\u2019t bring up the possibility of death with doctors because they don\u2019t want to think about it. Meanwhile, he says, hospitals reinforce this attitude with advertisements such as \u201cmiracles start here.\u201d\n\nEven in Carter\u2019s case, in which treatment put his cancer into remission, \u201cit still doesn\u2019t mean he will live forever,\u201d Caplan says. \u201cAs a patient, I need to understand when my quality of life is poor enough that I don\u2019t want anything else done.\u201d\n\nQuality of life\n\nJohn Bischof, 88, had to face that reality. The Jeffersonville, Ind., man had congestive heart failure and was making frequent trips to the ER when he decided to live out his life in the assisted living facility that had become his home.\n\nBischof became a patient of the local hospice organization Hosparus, and stopped receiving diagnostic tests, intravenous diuretics and antibiotics. For four months before his death in 2013, he received visits from nurses, certified nursing assistants and others, and treatment to keep him comfortable.\n\nDaughter Terri Graham, chief clinical officer for Hosparus, says the World War II Navy veteran, who used to play saxophone in a big band and love celebrations, was able to attend a luau just before he died. Although confined to a wheelchair and tethered to oxygen, she says, \u201che was able to enjoy life to the very end.\u201d\n\nHosparus Medical Director Bethany Snider says today's physicians and medical students are gradually learning more about hospice and palliative care, and the new Medicare reimbursement rule creates another incentive to take the time necessary for end-of-life discussions.\n\nShe and other doctors say those discussions don\u2019t usually center around age, but instead on overall health, life experience and hopes for the future.\n\nThomas, of Louisville, says she knew shortly after her December 2014 diagnosis that she wanted life-preserving treatment even though doctors told her she would need chemo for the rest of her life. Now 83, she can\u2019t imagine slowing down any time soon. She recently took a business trip a couple days after a chemo session.\n\nAugusta Thomas, 83, undergoes chemotherapy at the Norton Cancer Institute. 23 January 2016 (Photo: David R. Lutman/Special to The C)\n\nMartha \u201cLillian\u201d Recktenwald, 82, also made the decision to seek curative treatment. When heart disease threatened her life, she chose to undergo a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which involves repairing the valve by putting a new one within the old one.\n\n\u201cI prayed a lot about it, whether to go through it,\u201d she says, adding that she's now able to get around better and looks forward to watching her grandchildren graduate from college. \u201cI feel comfortable with my decision...very lucky and blessed.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1XypiSt", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It's an always-delicate decision: When do you use curative but potentially-grueling treatment on the elderly and sick?", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "It's an always-delicate decision: When do you use curative but potentially-grueling treatment on the elderly and sick?", "title": "To treat or not?
