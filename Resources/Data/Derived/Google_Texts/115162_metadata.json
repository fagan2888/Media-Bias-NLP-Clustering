D\u2019Etat\u2019s floats equaled or, even bested, the exquisite Hermes floats that preceded them in design and decoration. The chomping skull float at the start of the parade is among the best in all of Carnival.\n\nLast night\u2019s theme was \u201cDUI: D\u2019Etat Under the Influence,\u201d but the theme was only a skeleton upon which to hang the krewe\u2019s brand of searing social sarcasm. The management of Orleans Parish Prison came in for ridicule, as did the wanton sex trade along Tulane Avenue. The city\u2019s new EvacuSpot stick figure sculptures, meant as gathering spots for hurricane evacuation, were brilliantly depicted holding Hurricane cocktails aloft. On the national front, Hillary Clinton and Miley Cyrus were bashed and the Affordable Health Care Act was repeatedly demonized. The only shred of sentimentality was reserved for bygone Crescent City bar rooms.\n\nIf you agree with d\u2019Etat\u2019s collective point of view or not, the gloves-off Carnival catharsis the parade embodies is thrilling. D\u2019Etat is a somewhat haughtier more empowered version of the downtown, rag tag Krewe du Vieux. D\u2019Etat doesn\u2019t have a king, it has a dictator. The dictator could benefit from just a whisper of humorous self-deprecation, but otherwise he is the supreme commander of Carnival satire.\n\nFavorite float: The float bearing the smoke-gushing sculpture of crack-smoking Toronto mayor Rob Ford was an absolute masterpiece.\n\nFavorite marching group: The dancing troupe that choreographically imitated Saints defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was outstanding \u2013 and I don\u2019t just mean their faux Falstaffian bellies.\n\nOn first writing, I forgot about the Fifty Shades of Gray female marching group. Tights plus loose men's shirts plus gray wigs plus dance abandon equals a new Carnival comic highlight.\n\n\n\nFavorite band: Once again this year, I\u2019m not listing a favorite band, because my favorite band is the one that randomly performs right in front of me. Truth is, I\u2019m a sucker for Mardi Gras bands. In the words of Stephen Stills, I tend to love the one I\u2019m with.\n\nFavorite throw: None really. I challenge Krewe d\u2019Etat to become politically proactive in the burgeoning quest to produce a locally produced throw industry.\n\nThe rating: Doug MacCash rates select 2014 Mardi Gras parades. From best to worst, the ratings are: Ruler of the Route, Rolling in the Right Direction and Lost its Way. In 2014 D\u2019Etat is, without doubt, a Ruler of the Route.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "arts,entertainment,festivals,homepage,krewe d'etat parade,mardi gras,mardi gras 2014", "title": "Krewe d'Etat 2014 parade review: Haughty humor provides Carnival catharsis", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Krewe d\\u0027Etat 2014 parade review: Haughty humor provides Carnival catharsis \", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/mardigras/index.ssf/2014/03/parade_review_detats_haughty_h.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/tpphotos/photo/2014/03/14388012-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12325196\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-01T16:56:01Z\", \"author\": \"Doug MacCash, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"arts\",\"entertainment\",\"festivals\",\"homepage\",\"krewe d\\u0027etat parade\",\"mardi gras\",\"mardi gras 2014\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nola.com/tpphotos/photo/2014/03/14388012-small.jpg", "creator": "@dougmaccash", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary", "description": "D'Etat's floats equaled or, even bested, the Hermes floats that preceded them."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, March 01, 2014,  6:41 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nola.com/tpphotos/photo/2014/03/14388012-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dmaccash\", \"author_nickname\": \"Doug MacCash, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"author_id\": \"4262\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Orleans Mardi Gras\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/mardigras/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "D'Etat's floats equaled or, even bested, the Hermes floats that preceded them.", "title": "Krewe d'Etat 2014 parade review: Haughty humor provides Carnival catharsis", "url": "http://www.nola.com/mardigras/index.ssf/2014/03/parade_review_detats_haughty_h.html", "image": "http://media.nola.com/design/alpha/img/logo_nola.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, March 01, 2014, 10:45 AM", "article_author": "Doug MacCash, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "Description": "D'Etat's floats equaled or, even bested, the Hermes floats that preceded them."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3140\"", "article_summary": "The Krewe d\u2019Etat parade plied the streets of Uptown on Friday night (Feb. 28), displaying its usual blend of political correctness, bipartisanship, gender sensitivity and general open-heartedness.\nI challenge Krewe d\u2019Etat to become politically proactive in the burgeoning quest to produce a locally produced throw industry.\nIf you agree with d\u2019Etat\u2019s collective point of view or not, the gloves-off Carnival catharsis the parade embodies is thrilling.\nThe chomping skull float at the start of the parade is among the best in all of Carnival.\nTights plus loose men's shirts plus gray wigs plus dance abandon equals a new Carnival comic highlight."}
