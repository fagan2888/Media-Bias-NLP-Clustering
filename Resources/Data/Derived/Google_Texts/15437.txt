EDITOR: How weird is this? Some nut shoots up a black church, somebody digs up a picture of him in a Gold’s Gym T-shirt holding a flag from a 19th century conflict and people go nuts. Not about the gym logo — about the flag. Everybody seems to have an opinion, even if the flag isn’t theirs and it has nothing to do with them.

And, isn’t it ironic that Gene Policinski of the First Amendment Center, of all places, seems to write that, because a majority are okay with eliminating someone else’s symbol that offends them, it is time to remove it. The First Amendment was intended to protect freedom of expression for everyone, not just those we agree with. As Cornel West wrote, “The aim of a constitutional democracy is to safeguard the rights of the minority and avoid the tyranny of the majority.”
