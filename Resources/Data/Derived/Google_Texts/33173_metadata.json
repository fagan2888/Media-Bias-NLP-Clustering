Lynn Jenkins told a crowd Sunday at The University of Kansas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve passed more legislation through the House than most recent Congresses, we\u2019ve had more votes and we\u2019ve had more bills actually signed into law,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nJenkins, a Republican, was elected to a fourth term in November. She told the crowd at KU that Congress was gridlocked for her first term.\n\n\u201cThat was a tough couple of years,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou don\u2019t run for Congress to sit on the sidelines, you run for Congress to save the world.\u201d\n\nBut an influx of new lawmakers has changed the culture in Washington, Jenkins said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a new day in Washington, and it\u2019s given me renewed hope and faith that we are past this and we are able to work again,\u201d she added.\n\nJenkins gave the 2015 Dole Lecture at the Dole Institute of Politics. The annual lecture is held on or around April 14, the day former Sen. Bob Dole was wounded in Italy during World War II.\n\nThe lecture took the form of a question and answer session. The first round of questions was asked by Bill Lacy, the institute\u2019s director, and a second round of questions was asked by members of the audience.\n\nSeveral of Lacy\u2019s questions honed in on challenges female candidates and politicians face. Jenkins said women often have to be talked into running for office, while it seems to come naturally to men.\n\n\u201cI think men sometimes just wake up one day, look in the mirror and say, \u2018Darn, I am so good, I\u2019m running for Congress,\u2019\u201d Jenkins said, a line that was met with laughter from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI sure wish women would learn to be more aggressive and assured that they have something to offer,\u201d she added.\n\nCiting 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and imminent Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, Lacy asked for Jenkins\u2019 thoughts on a female president or vice president.\n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s time,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of voting for someone just because they\u2019re a woman or because they\u2019re not a man. I want the best person for the job.\u201d\n\nJenkins said politicians, including Republicans, have become more welcoming towards women.\n\n\u201cI hear from a lot of Kansans that Republicans are just a party of grumpy old white guys. Well, sorry, but the facts just don\u2019t bear that out,\u201d Jenkins said, referring specifically to Mia Love, R-Utah, whom she called \u201ca rock star.\u201d\n\nJenkins on Sunday often cited her rural adolescent on a dairy farm in Holton. When asked by Lacy what the most difficult part of her job is, Jenkins pointed to the constant travel.\n\n\u201cFor me, personally, it\u2019s just getting up every weekend and traveling to Washington, D.C,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a city girl. I\u2019m a simple country girl.\u201d\n\nBefore the event, a lone protester awaited Jenkins\u2019 arrival outside the Dole Institute. Lawrence resident Mary Swayne held a poster depicting Jenkins as an exotic dancer being paid by Wichita businessmen Charles and David Koch.\n\n\u201cI believe Lynn Jenkins does not care about anyone but Lynn Jenkins,\u201d Swayne said.\n\nSwayne later attended the lecture and asked Jenkins if she would support legislation to allow students to refinance student loans at zero-percent interest.\n\n\u201cRight now, when the nation is 18 trillion dollars in debt, I don\u2019t think the answer is to move that (student loan) debt over to the federal government and taxpayers,\u201d Jenkins responded.\n\nQuestions from the crowd of about 100 attendees were often contentious, covering controversial topics such as gun control and climate change, along with broader issues of Constitutional interpretations and campaign contribution limits.\n\nWhen asked near the end of the lecture why Republicans and Democrats in Washington don\u2019t share the friendships that politicians did in decades past, Jenkins said it is because fewer members of Congress live in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cAs we saw in the last election cycle, if somebody doesn\u2019t come home every weekend, they\u2019re likely to be in political hot water,\u201d Jenkins said, likely referring to U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who often was criticized last year for living in Virginia. \u201cSo I come home every weekend, number one because I want to and this is my home, but number two, I think it\u2019s the politically expedient thing to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "LAWRENCE - Congress is more productive and less partisan in 2015 than it has been in a dozen years, U.S. Rep.
