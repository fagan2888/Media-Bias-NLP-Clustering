The U.S. Department of Justice is in settlement talks over litigation involving a requirement for healthcare providers to return government overpayment within 60 days.

The Department of Justice made the statement in a Sept. 15 letter to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, regarding Continuum Health Partners Inc., which is now part of New York's Mount Sinai Health System.

Continuum Health Partners, which merged with the Mt. Sinai Health System in 2103, is accused of improperly retaining Medicaid overpayments in a 2011 whistleblower case in which the Department of Justice intervened.

The Affordable Care Act requires overpayment within 60 days.

Continuum is accused of firing an employee who identified possible overpayments and then delaying payment for about two years.

Continuum Health Partners had argued that it was not alleged to have taken longer than 60 days to return overpayments that it had concretely identified.

The parties believe it is in their best interests to explore a settlement, the letter states, according to Law360.

Last month, Judge Ramos rejected Continuum's motion to dismiss the case.
