A wheat tour of the Eastern Plains has been a tradition in the 4th Congressional District since 1991, when it was started by then new U.S. Rep. Wayne Allard. Gardner kept up the tradition when he was in Congress. And after being elected to the Senate in November, he wanted to do a Senate tour and invited Bennet.\n\nThe group visited Holyoke and Fleming and other small towns in northeastern Colorado. Gardner, who lives in Yuma, seemed to know everyone on the way. He rattled off strains of wheat and talked about other crops, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about hard red and hard white,\u201d Gardner said, referring to strains of winter wheat, \u201crather than hard left and hard right.\u201d\n\nBoth senators said Colorado\u2019s economy is booming because of agriculture. Eighty percent of the wheat grown in Colorado is exported.\n\n\u201cRural Colorado has really dragged Colorado out of the recession,\u201d Bennet said.\n\nBennet pointed out he was one of the 13 Senate Democrats who voted for a controversial trade bill, and he did so because of what trade means to rural Colorado.\n\nHe also talked about his work with the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d a bipartisan group that crafted an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but then died. It was the first immigration bill to be endorsed by farm workers and growers.\n\n\u201cThere was a ton about that bill that made sense,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cWe have to find a way to get it done.\u201d\n\nDuring the trip, conversation often turned to the recent heavy rains that had hit there \u2014 especially Washington County. Garner pointed out high water in a creek bed he said had been dry for 20 years.\n\nBennet, who was appointed to the Senate in 2009, serves on the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. He was elected in 2010 and is up for re-election in 2016.\n\nGardner was elected to the Senate in 2014, becoming the first Coloradan in 36 years to defeat an incumbent senator. Bennet presented Gardner\u2019s parents a framed copy of their son\u2019s first Senate speech.\n\nLynn Bartels: 303-954-5327, lbartels@denverpost.com or twitter.com/lynn_bartels", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gardner and Bennet\u2019s Eastern Plains \u201cwheat tour\u201d framed as \u201cunity tour\u201d", "title": "Gardner and Bennet\u2019s Eastern Plains \u201cwheat tour\u201d framed as \u201cunity tour\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/20/gardner-and-bennets-eastern-plains-wheat-tour-framed-as-unity-tour/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150620__wheat1p1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150620__wheat1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-20T15:54:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T13:25:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f15\"", "article_summary": "And after being elected to the Senate in November, he wanted to do a Senate tour and invited Bennet.\nA wheat tour of the Eastern Plains has been a tradition in the 4th Congressional District since 1991, when it was started by then new U.S. Rep.
