He also demonstrated a calculated ignorance of reality.\n\nWhen Kelly pinned him down with a video from the fall showing Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius saying she would consider an enrollment of 7 million to be a success, Emanuel tried to shrug it off as the secretary simply quoting a Congressional Budget Office estimate when Sebelius\u2019s language \u2014 from her own lips \u2014 is crystal clear.\n\nAs Kelly\u2019s questioning persisted, Emanuel resorted to the Obama administration\u2019s default answer: its critics are simply acting out of ignorance, and the real problem is communication.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of misinformation and lack of information out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously have to go out and sell this better.\u201d\n\nEmanuel, a chairman of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, is no longer formally a member of the Obama team, but like the rest of the Obama administration he continues to pretend the biggest problem with Obamacare is Americans don\u2019t know enough about it.\n\nExactly the opposite is the truth.\n\nAnd no amount of dodging around hard questions is going to change that.\n\nCheck out the interview here.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.insider.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Fireworks flew Tuesday night on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d when host Megyn Kelly took on Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel over the Obama administration\u2019s constantly shifting numbers on Obamacare\u2019s success.
