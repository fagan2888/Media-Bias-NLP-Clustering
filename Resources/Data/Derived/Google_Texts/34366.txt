LeBron James needed only two shots and less than two minutes to move up the NBA ranks Sunday.

With about 10:30 remaining in the first quarter of the Cavaliers’ win against the Knicks in New York on Sunday, James scored off a layup that moved him ahead of former Nugget Allen Iverson on the league’s all-time scoring list.

Iverson ended his 14-season career with 24,368 points, No. 22 on the list. With his 18 points Sunday, James now has 24,383 in his career.

James, in his 12th NBA season, was close to surpassing Iverson on Friday against the Wizards, when he dropped 28 points in only 25 minutes. But he finished four shy, saving the feat for Sunday at Madison Square Garden.

While the achievement is just one of many in James’s career, it probably holds more meaning than others. In 2013, he raved about Iverson in multiple interviews with ESPN, telling Tom Haberstroh that Iverson is “Pound-for-pound, probably the greatest player who ever played.

“(Iverson) reminds me of Floyd Mayweather,” James said. “You could never question (Iverson’s) heart, his will to want to win. A true warrior.”

Days earlier, for ESPN the Magazine’s 2013 NBA preview, James said:

“I watch Jordan more than anybody for sure. But I’ll watch tapes of A.I., too. I don’t take anything from A.I. Well, I do — his will. They say he was 6 feet, but A.I. was like 5-10 1/2. Do we even want to say 160? 170 (pounds)? Do we even want to give him that much weight? And he played like a 6-8 2-guard. He was one of the greatest finishers we’ve ever seen. You could never question his heart. Ever. He gave it his all. A.I. was like my second-favorite player growing up, after MJ.”

Next up for James on the all-time list is 39-year-old Ray Allen (24,505 points), followed by Patrick Ewing (24,815) and Jerry West (25,192).
