Rick Scott to work with lawmakers and create an alternative to the sunsetting federal program that supported charity care.\n\n\u201cWe have to find an alternative, and we have to work together to find an alternative,\u201d Jim Burkhart, president and chief executive at Tampa General Hospital, told members of Scott\u2019s Commission on Health Care and Hospital Funding. \u201cWe need to form a group to actually start the work now on looking for a new way to come up with a funding model. The issue won\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has announced that the Low Income Pool, or LIP program, would be gradually eliminated as the Affordable Care Act covered more Americans and states expanded their Medicaid programs. But Florida is among a handful of states that has refused to expand Medicaid, and when that LIP funding dries up, it could put hospitals that treat the uninsured in financial straits.\n\nFlorida received about $2 billion annually from the LIP program; that amount was cut in half this year, but lawmakers plugged the gap with state tax money and related federal drawdowns.\n\nThe injection of state dollars prompted Scott to form the health care and hospital committee. Wednesday\u2019s meeting at the University of South Florida was the first of a three-stop \u201cSpotlight Transparency Tour\u201d intended to focus on how Florida tax dollars support state hospitals and what results are provided. Burkhart and Kristopher Hoce, president and chief operating officer at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, were invited to speak.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s decision to end the Low income Pool program left our state with major decisions to make about how to support hospitals that are financially dependent on these federal funds,\u201d Scott said in a statement on the Wednesday meeting. \u201cWe absolutely must ensure that taxpayer money going to hospitals has a high return on investment for the people of Florida. The more information the commission gathers from hospitals about their outcomes for patients, the better we can target state taxpayer money to get the highest quality from the hospitals their tax dollars support.\u201d\n\nTampa General and Morton Plant provided patient data to the panel, such as their potentially preventable readmission rate (6.14 percent for Tampa General and 5.25 percent for Morton Plant) and serious complications rate (0.98 for Morton Plant, 1.65 percent for Tampa General.)\n\nThe governor\u2019s call last month for hospital data raised hackles in the health care community. Many state hospitals didn\u2019t cooperate or essentially told the administration to look up the information from already submitted state records.\n\nBut Wednesday\u2019s meeting was cordial. \u201cWe respect their objective,\u201d said Hoce in an interview after the meeting. \u201cWe certainly applaud the initiatives they\u2019re taking. Our approach is, how can we work together to fulfill your objective and help get our story told? That\u2019s been our approach, and hopefully we did that today.\u201d\n\nPanelists and about 30 health care industry representatives and lobbyists also heard from Marty Makary, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and author of \u201cUnaccountable: What Hospitals Won\u2019t Tell You And How Transparency Can Revolutionize Health Care.\u201d\n\nHe said the two most significant circumstances in health care that consumers don\u2019t factor in are doctor\u2019s mistakes -- which kill an estimated 210,000 to 400,000 patients a year in U.S. hospitals, behind only cancer and heart disease -- and unnecessary medications, tests and procedures.\n\nHe told the audience of a survey asking whether a doctor would perform an unnecessary procedure purely for financial motive. While 52 percent of the public thought the doctor would, 23 percent of medical students said yes, and 73 percent of doctors said yes.\n\n\u201cPeople are hungry for honesty and transparency and metrics that we understand,\u201d Makary said.\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 18:34:04 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The presidents of two of the region\u2019s largest hospitals on Wednesday called on members of a health care and hospital panel formed by Gov.
