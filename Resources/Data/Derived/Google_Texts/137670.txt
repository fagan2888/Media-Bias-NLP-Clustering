Authorities say three inmates escaped Sunday from the Jackson Detention Center and two were later recaptured.

The Hinds County Sheriff's Department says Antwan Dukes, Jerome Moore, and William Smith were able to escape Sunday through a window of the downtown building. Duke and Moore were caught and now face additional charges, the sheriff's department says in a statement.

The sheriff's department says Smith remained at large Sunday.

Hinds County Sheriff Tyrone Lewis, warned the jail is vulnerable to such incidents until windows in the building are repaired and secured. Lewis says a county official has failed to assign window repair requests to be completed.

Anyone with information about the whereabouts of William Smith has been asked to contact the Hinds Sheriff's Office at 601-974-2900.
