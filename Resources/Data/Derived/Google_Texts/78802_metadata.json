He was 84.\n\nWarren died Friday at a hospital in Arlington, Virginia, after entering hospice care for cancer and pneumonia, U-T San Diego reported (http://bit.ly/19FBBcH ).\n\nWarren was assistant managing editor of The San Diego Union in 1969 when President-elect Richard Nixon hired him as deputy press secretary. He served through Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation and into the presidency of Gerald Ford until 1975.\n\nHe returned to journalism, becoming editor of The San Diego Union and later the merged publication San Diego Union-Tribune until 1995.\n\nWarren\u2019s daughter said he devoted his final years to his faith. He earned a master\u2019s degree in theology and led a four-year ministry education program.\n\n\u201cHe was searching for a closer relationship to God, and his faith was increasingly important to him,\u201d his daughter, Euphemia \u201cMia\u201d Johnson, told U-T San Diego.\n\nWarren was born in Hastings, Nebraska, on Aug. 17, 1930. After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism from the University of Nebraska, he went on to serve four years as a naval aviator. Later, he settled in San Diego, working his way into a career as a reporter and editor.\n\n\u201cHe understood copy,\u201d said Peter Kaye, then a Union reporter, told U-T San Diego, \u201cand best of all he got along very well with reporters and people.\u201d\n\nLeaving the paper for Washington, D.C., Warren thrived in the city\u2019s hothouse atmosphere. Euphemia Davis, Warren\u2019s first wife, recalled how a red telephone installed at the family\u2019s home \u201crang at all hours of the day and night.\u201d He traveled with Nixon to China, attended French President Charles de Gaulle\u2019s funeral in Paris, and flew home from the Soviet Union with genuine Russian vodka.\n\nYet serving during the Nixon administration also took a heavy toll.\n\n\u201cTo live through the intense two years of Watergate,\u201d Euphemia Davis said, \u201che had to maintain an absolute belief that the president did not know, that it had to be his underlings who had done this. If he thought otherwise, he would lose his internal compass.\u201d\n\nIn the end, though, even Warren could not deny the president\u2019s guilt. \u201cTo find out that he had been used that way,\u201d Davis said, \u201cit was devastating to him.\u201d\n\nHe returned to journalism in 1975 as editor of the San Diego Union, overseeing the paper through its merger with the Evening Tribune. When he stepped down in 1995, he described his career in journalism as \u201ca great ride.\u201d\n\nWarren moved with his second wife, Viviane Pratt, to Middleburg, Virginia, and devoted much of his time to the Episcopal Church.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he worked for two presidents is sort of what makes him known,\u201d Johnson, his daughter, said. \u201cDad would say that his later life, with his connections to his faith and learning, are what he is most proud of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jerry Warren, the editor of San Diego's largest newspaper for 20 years and a White House press secretary during the Nixon and Ford administrations, has died.
