Against the backdrop of Arizona\u2019s defunct \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d law and others like it, the Court will decide whether corporations have religious beliefs, and whether those beliefs can affect the rights of other people.\n\nThe case\u2014actually the consolidated cases of Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius and Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius\u2014is also another referendum on Obamacare. At issue in the case is the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employer-provided insurance plans include coverage for contraception. The owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood, both privately held companies, argue this mandate violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of the free exercise of religion.\n\nIf the Court goes Hobby Lobby\u2019s way\u2014and since the case also affords another bite at the Obamacare apple, it may do so\u2014it will significantly expand the reach of the first amendment. And not in a good way.\n\nFirst, the Court will have to decide that corporations are not only people, but people with consciences. Conservative \u201creligious freedom\u201d activists like to blur the lines between individuals and businesses. They talk about bakers and photographers, but Hobby Lobby is a corporation with $3 billion in revenues, 22,000 employees, and 550 stores around the country. Its owners, the conservative billionaire David Green and his family, argue that what happens to Hobby Lobby happens to them personally.\n\nBut this contention runs counter to the foundation of corporate law itself, which is that companies are legal entities distinct from their owners. If someone trips and falls in a Hobby Lobby store, the Green family isn\u2019t liable (unless they acted negligently as directors). So why are they liable\u2014legally or morally\u2014for the company\u2019s insurance plan?\n\nSecond, the view that corporations have consciences is incoherent. Corporate personhood is a legal fiction, not an ontological or soteriological fact. Conceivably, corporations can be said to have interests that give rise to freedom of expression\u2014that was the holding of Citizens United. But corporations don\u2019t sin, don\u2019t go to hell, and don\u2019t get saved by Jesus.\n\nThird\u2014and this is where most attention has focused\u2014if corporations can opt-out of a general law regarding contraception, why not other laws? This is where Hobby Lobby connects to Arizona\u2019s law. The whole purpose of \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d was to carve out religious exemptions to civil rights laws. Normally, a restaurant can\u2019t refuse to serve a customer because she\u2019s black, female, Jewish, or gay (or, obviously, white, male, Muslim, or straight). But if Hobby Lobby can assert a religious objection to contraception coverage, surely a restaurant can assert a religious objection to non-discrimination law.\n\nIn other words, a ruling for Hobby Lobby could make \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d the law of the land. As long as a company\u2019s owners can provide a religious reason, they can opt-out of Obamacare, anti-discrimination laws, marriage laws, employment laws\u2014you name it. Forget penis-shaped wedding cakes (yes, the Right is actually worried about this). We\u2019re talking about Fortune 500 companies treating legal marriages unequally, hospitals denying gay spouses their rights, and, yes, denying healthcare to millions of women.\n\nNow, it may strike readers as odd that, in 2014, we are debating the merits of contraception in the first place. Indeed, with nearly 90% of Americans believing birth control to be morally acceptable, most of us no longer are, which is why Hobby Lobby\u2019s lawyers have focused on the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill rather than birth control in general. Yet as Emily Bazelon revealed in Slate, a coterie of right-wing organizations has indeed lined up to oppose contraception itself.\n\nWhich gets to the heart of the matter: This case is really about the sexual revolution and the culture war. Hobby Lobby\u2019s fundamentalist owners don\u2019t like contraception, don\u2019t like non-procreative sex, definitely don\u2019t like extra-marital sex, and, I\u2019m sure, don\u2019t like homosexuality either. The Green family\u2014net worth, $4.9 billion\u2014is said to have donated over $500 million to Christian schools and universities, which in turn have produced the weird, parallel-universe lawyers who are now pursuing this case.\n\nThat, of course, is their right. But in trying to convince the rest of us that conservative Christian morality should be the foundation of our laws, they have lost at the polls, lost at the Supreme Court, and lost in the court of public opinion. Having done so, they are trying to redefine what is meant by \u201creligious liberty\u201d from a shield against government intrusion to a sword against the rights of others.\n\nThese same arguments were used in the 1960s and \u201870s, when the Right had lost the legal, constitutional, and moral battles against civil rights. Racist restaurateurs and racist universities said their religion compelled them to turn away African-Americans, notwithstanding what the Civil Rights Act had to say. They took their cause all the way to the Supreme Court, where they finally lost, in 1983 (Bob Jones University vs. United States).\n\nIn a concurring opinion in the Right\u2019s favorite religious freedom case\u2014that of a photographer found to have violated New Mexico\u2019s antidiscrimination laws by refusing to photograph a same-sex couple\u2014a Republican-appointed judge wrote that he sympathized with the photographers\u2019 grave religious objections. But, he said, the price of participating in the open market is to play by the same rules as everyone else.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "United States Supreme Court, birth control, u.s. poli, Obamacare", "publicationDate": 201403220945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Supreme Court will decide whether corporate personhood, a dubious idea they\u2019ve already affirmed, means business can deny birth control coverage on the grounds of \u201creligious freedom.\u201d", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Do Corporations Believe in God?
