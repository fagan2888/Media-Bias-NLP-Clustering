She cited a declining unemployment rate, a revived automobile industry and the millions of Americans who now have health care as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Some of those \u201caccomplishments\u201d are debatable, but one was downright false. During her answer, Jarrett had the audacity to say that Obama \u201cended two wars\u201d during his two-term tenure.\n\nJarrett\u2019s comments would be news to our military. The president declared he was pulling out American troops from Iraq in 2011, only to send over 4,000 soldiers back. Meanwhile, we are launching thousands of airstrikes against ISIS and assisting Iraqi forces in their new effort to retake the important city of Fallujah.\n\nThe Obama administration has had a hard time using the word \u201ccombat\u201d to describe our presence in Iraq, despite military serviceman being killed while fighting ISIS. Earlier this month, Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV became the third service member to fall on the front lines of battle.\n\nOh, and Jarrett\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview aired at the same time our military launched a drone strike against a major Taliban leader.\n\nWhile the interview may have been conducted before the official Pentagon announcement, her comments coincided with the news that a drone strike had taken out Taliban leader Mansour in the Pakistan province of Baluchistan \u2013 the latest sign of the prolonged fight in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nSo, we\u2019ll ask again: What exactly are President Obama's accomplishments?", "article_metadata": {"description": "How do you figure?.05/27/2016 3:38:40AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "How do you figure?", "title": "Valerie Jarrett Cites 'Ending Two Wars' as Obama Accomplishments", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/23/valerie-jarrett-cites-ending-two-wars-as-obama-accomplishments-n2167536", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/34/2015-02-03T200714Z_1_LYNXMPEB120WJ_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-MIDEAST-CRISIS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "How do you figure?", "title": "Valerie Jarrett Cites 'Ending Two Wars' as Obama Accomplishments", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/23/valerie-jarrett-cites-ending-two-wars-as-obama-accomplishments-n2167536", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/34/2015-02-03T200714Z_1_LYNXMPEB120WJ_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-MIDEAST-CRISIS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Valerie Jarrett Cites 'Ending Two Wars' as Obama Accomplishments, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "During her answer, Jarrett had the audacity to say that Obama \u201cended two wars\u201d during his two-term tenure.\nOh, and Jarrett\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview aired at the same time our military launched a drone strike against a major Taliban leader.\nWhite House Adviser Valerie Jarrett was tasked with listing some of the ways President Obama made good on his promise to bring \u201chope and change\u201d to America during her interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d this weekend.\nThe Obama administration has had a hard time using the word \u201ccombat\u201d to describe our presence in Iraq, despite military serviceman being killed while fighting ISIS.\nThe president declared he was pulling out American troops from Iraq in 2011, only to send over 4,000 soldiers back."}
