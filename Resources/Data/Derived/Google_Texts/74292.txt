HORRY COUNTY, SC (WMBF) - Horry County Rescue crews were dispatched to a deadly wreck on Hwy 905 and Sarvis Farm Road towards North Carolina Sunday night, November 15, after a police chase ended, according to Chief Justin Gibbins.

Horry County Coroner Robert Edge confirms a man was killed when his vehicle crashed into a power pole as he was being pursued by police.

WMBF News reporter Josh Roberson was on the scene and said, Hwy 905 was closed in both directions for some time and Horry Electric was on the scene.

The victim is identified as 32-year-old Casey James Blackwell from Tabor City, according to Edge.

After speaking to witnesses and reviewing evidence, it was determined the driver of the vehicle, Blackwell, failed to stop for blue lights and siren, was driving recklessly down Highway 905, and lost control of his vehicle. The vehicle flipped in a ditch and also hit a power pole. The accident report from the South Carolina Highway Patrol shows Blackwell was ejected from the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene. He was the only occupant in the vehicle, according to a news release from Sherri Smith, Horry County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer.

Mr. Blackwell was driving a 1990 Toyota SUV vehicle and fled the scene of an accident on Highway 90 a few minutes prior to this accident. A BOLO (be on the lookout for) was issued for Blackwell’s vehicle. A SCHP Trooper located the vehicle at the intersection of Highway 9 and Highway 57. The Trooper activated his blue lights and siren and attempted to stop Blackwell, who failed to stop.

The North Carolina Department of Public Safety said Blackwell had been a state correctional officer since 2005 at Tabor Correctional.
