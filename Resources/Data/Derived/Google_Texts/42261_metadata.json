Organic and DIY methods of garden fertilization will also be covered.\n\nThe focus of CRYP's gardening programs is the award-winning Winyan Toka Win (which means \u201cLeading Lady\u201d in Lakota) Organic garden, which is planted and managed throughout the growing season by community children and teen youth through the Gardening Club, classes and internships.\n\nThe two-acre plot not only provides organic fruits and vegetables to the local community, but also jobs and a host of other life skills that include cooking, canning and marketing vegetables and food items at the CRYP Farmers' Market.\n\nCRYP's gardening program is made possible by many individuals and community members and through the support of our partners, including the Northwest Area Foundation, National Relief Charities, the J.R. Albert Foundation, the Diabetes Action Research and Education Foundation (DARE), the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Notah Begay III Foundation.\n\nTo make a cash or in-kind donation to support our Get Out and Garden!
