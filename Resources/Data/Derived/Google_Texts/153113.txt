Remember that Washington Post poll that had the public nearly split in its opinion of Obamacare/the Affordable Care Act? It had 48 percent favoring the law, 50 percent opposed. Some wondered if the law had finally become popular, or at least less unpopular.

Yeah, never mind:

The new national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY, conducted April 3-6 among 1,010 adults, finds more continue to disapprove (50%) than approve (37%) of the 2010 health care law. Last month, the balance of opinion was similar — 53% disapproved of the law, while 41% approved.

A majority of Americans (57%) say the health care law has not had much of an effect on themselves and their families, though somewhat fewer say that today than did so last September (63%). About a quarter (24%) say the law’s impact has been mostly negative while 17% say it has been mostly positive.

On balance, more also say the law has had a negative than positive impact on the country (43% vs. 30%). But negative views of the law’s impact on the country have declined (from 49%) — and positive views have risen (from 23%) — since December.
