Former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) commented on President Barack Obama‘s handling of the government shutdown, saying the president is acting like a “spoiled brat child.”

“I can put it in very basic Southern terms: a spoiled brat child,” West said on The Steve Malzberg Show. “We have been giving Barack Obama everything that he has wanted. We gave him a state senator position in Chicago, we gave him a U.S. Senate position out of the state of Illinois, unproven, untested, no resume, we gave him the presidency twice.”

Last week Obama identified the cause of the shutdown to be a result of Republicans’ opposition to the Affordable Care Act, and said that he would not negotiate with Republicans until Congress increases the debt limit and passes a short-term government funding measure.

“If you continue to reward bad behavior, you’re going to get more of that bad behavior,” West said.
