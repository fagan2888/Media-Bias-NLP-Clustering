CHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR The Conejo Valley Family Medical Group in Thousand Oaks has substantially reduced the time people wait to see a doctor. CHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR Registration clerk Marcela Ronquillo and other employees at the Conejo Valley Family Medical Group use radios and other measures to reduce patient waiting. CHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR People wait to see a doctor at the Conejo Valley Family Medical Group in Thousand Oaks.\n\nBy Tom Kisken of the Ventura County Star\n\nDr. Ateev Mehrotra decided to quantify the billions Americans lose waiting to see their doctors as he sat in an orthopedist\u2019s office twiddling his thumbs.\n\nThe Harvard researcher and internist showed up at 8 a.m. to see his doctor. He discovered 30 other patients had been told to do the same thing.\n\nFrustrated and anxious \u2014 his own patients were waiting in a hospital for him to conduct rounds \u2014 he decided to pursue a study designed as a kick in the pants.\n\nUsing federal survey data from 2010, he and other researchers concluded people spent an average of 123 minutes each time they saw their doctor.\n\nOnly 20 minutes of the time was spent with the doctor. The balance came in traveling, paperwork and waiting.\n\nCalculating what they called opportunity costs, researchers estimated patients lost $43 for each visit in time that could have been spent on a job, with family, jogging or other activities.\n\n\u201cThat totals up to a lot of time and money,\u201d said Mehrotra. The study contends Americans spent 1.1 billion hours in pursuit of health care in 2010.\n\nThe time consumed $52 billion in lost opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a health care system that\u2019s not very thoughtful of a patient\u2019s time,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cIf you quantify it, you can therefore do something about it.\u201d\n\nLost wages and time\n\nThe waiting room would be packed when Marisol Magallon arrived at an Oxnard clinic for a doctor\u2019s appointment. By the time Magallon\u2019s name was called, the room would be empty.\n\n\u201cI would wait in the waiting room for hours,\u201d the Oxnard woman said, noting the waits have improved but were longest when she was pregnant with her now 8-month-old daughter. \u201cIf my appointment was at 10 a.m., I would be done at like by 1 p.m.\u201d\n\nIt meant her husband, who drove her, lost wages. Marisol lost time she would rather spend taking care of her other two kids.\n\nWhen her name would finally be called, she would be led out of the waiting room to an examination area. Then she would wait some more.\n\n\u201cMy reaction is like \u2018whatever,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSome observers contend waiting has grown worse because of the Affordable Care Act. The reform means 17.6 million Americans, including 1.3 million Californians, have gained insurance and the promise of better access to doctors.\n\nSome doctors acknowledge booking patients closer together. Others say they\u2019ve become more efficient and have minimized waits.\n\n\u201cUsually, I see patients within 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d said Dr. David Mescher, pulmonary and internal care doctor in Oxnard. \u201cThere are other guys who have patients wait for one or two hours, which is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nSome wait longer\n\nThe data generated by Mehrotra and other researchers produced studies in American Journal of Managed Care and JAMA Internal Medicine. The research was supported by the California HealthCare Foundation.\n\nThe numbers show it took people who were unemployed longer to see a doctor than people with jobs. It took longer for people with a high school education or less than people with college degrees.\n\nNon-Hispanic white people saw the doctor quicker than Hispanics and African-Americans.\n\nMehrotra does not think the differences in care are driven by bias. He doesn\u2019t think a doctor\u2019s office intentionally makes one group of people wait longer than others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where they receive care,\u201d he said, suggesting some clinics struggle more with wait times. \u201cMore of the places that they go, for a variety of reasons, are just slower.\u201d\n\nDr. Paulo Carvalho serves as medical director for the Conejo Valley Family Medical Group. More than six of 10 patients at the clinic are insured through the government Medi-Cal program aimed at low-income people.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they wait longer, Carvalho said.\n\nAbout seven years ago, Carvalho and his clinic were part of a project designed to reduce wait times. Patient visits were streamlined. Paperwork was minimized.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students started using two-way radios to communicate, eliminating time scrambling from one office to another. The number of times a patient was handed off by one staff member to another was whittled.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, it took patients 80 minutes to complete a doctor\u2019s visit. After 18 months, appointment times were cut to 45 minutes and remain in that ballpark.\n\n\u201cWe learned it\u2019s doable,\u201d said Carvalho, who also has incorporated the patient flow strategies at Las Posas Family Medical Group in Camarillo and other offices.\n\n\u2018Time is money\u2019\n\nThe man in his 70s walking toward the Oxnard Public Library thinks he knows how the system works. Doctors schedule several patients for the same time and then work their way down the row.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother him too much. He figures doctors want to get things done just as quickly as the patients do. That\u2019s why, he said, they spend 10 minutes, 15 tops, with a patient.\n\n\u201cTime is money,\u201d he said, identifying himself as Ed and declining to to offer a last name.\n\nHe worried his doctor might read his words.\n\nFill out my online form", "article_metadata": {"title": "Waiting for the doctor costs time and money", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/waiting-for-the-doctor-costs-time-and-money-ep-1331866630-345828292.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/docwait01_25553110_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 462}, "type": "article", "description": "A new study shows people spend two hours to see the doctor, 20 minutes of it spent with the physician.", "title": "Waiting for the doctor costs time and money"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/docwait01_25553110_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "A new study shows people spend two hours to see the doctor, 20 minutes of it spent with the physician.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Waiting for the doctor costs time and money"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbd5\"", "article_summary": "CHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR People wait to see a doctor at the Conejo Valley Family Medical Group in Thousand Oaks.\nCHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR The Conejo Valley Family Medical Group in Thousand Oaks has substantially reduced the time people wait to see a doctor.\nPaulo Carvalho uses a walkie-talkie at the Conejo Valley Family Medical Group in Thousand Oaks.\nCHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR Registration clerk Marcela Ronquillo and other employees at the Conejo Valley Family Medical Group use radios and other measures to reduce patient waiting.\n\u201cUsually, I see patients within 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d said Dr. David Mescher, pulmonary and internal care doctor in Oxnard."}
