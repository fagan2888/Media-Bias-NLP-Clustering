The only other in-town game on Friday night is Madison at Hendersonville, and it's Homecoming for the Bearcats.\n\n\"That's our big dilemma,\" HHS Athletic Director BJ Laughter said. \"We have all of our Homecoming festivities set for Friday night, and our dance is Saturday. We are also honoring the three 1964 state championship teams of baseball, track and field and cross country prior to the game. It's their 50th anniversary. In addition to all of that, we're also announcing our Hendersonville High School Hall of Fame inductees for this year, so to move all this to another night would be quite a big undertaking.\"\n\nThe other area games still scheduled for Friday are Brevard at Tuscola, Mountain Heritage at Polk County, West Henderson at Smoky Mountain and Rosman at Hayesville.", "article_metadata": {"description": "East Henderson High has moved its Friday night home football game against North Henderson to 7 p.m. Thursday due to weather forecasts.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-F40DA63A-88BF-4615-AA02-230D5CF08645-pubHT"}, "og": {"site_name": "BlueRidgeNow.com", "description": "East Henderson High has moved its Friday night home football game against North Henderson to 7 p.m. Thursday due to weather forecasts.", "title": "East Henderson moves football game vs. North to Thursday", "url": "http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20141001/PREPS/141009989", "image": "http://G52-HTweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=HT&Date=20141001&Category=PREPS&ArtNo=141009989&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20141001, "fb": {"app_id": 123380601066653}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-141009989-pubHT"}}, "keywords": "HENDERSONVILLE (NC),  Article,  Update", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The change moves Thursday's scheduled JV game at North to 7 p.m. Monday.\nThis is the first time a game has been played on another night other than Friday night since 2008, when the Chase at East game was moved to a Monday night due to heavy rains.\n\"Both schools talked this over, and we both agreed after seeing the weather forecasts and talking with local meteorologists that we should play the game Thursday instead,\" East High Principal Scott Rhodes said.\nWHKP 1450 AM will be broadcasting Thursday's game at East, and their on-the-air time will now be moved up to 6:30 p.m., according to WHKP Vice President and Sports Director Richard Rhodes.\nThe only other in-town game on Friday night is Madison at Hendersonville, and it's Homecoming for the Bearcats."}
