As a former Colorado commissioner of agriculture, I strongly oppose Proposition 105 and hope you will join me in voting \u201cno.\u201d\n\nProposition 105 is a complex and poorly written food-labeling proposal that would give Colorado consumers inaccurate, unreliable and misleading information about foods we buy due to the arbitrary labeling requirements and multitude of exemptions written into the proposition. It would severely harm Colorado\u2019s vital agricultural economy, put our state\u2019s farmers and food producers at a competitive disadvantage in the national marketplace, and increase food costs for Colorado families.\n\nTo begin with, humans have been selectively breeding and modifying crops for thousands of years, but we are now using science to produce the traits we want in our crops in a much more accurate and safe way. Modern crop varieties developed through genetic modification techniques have been crucial to advances in agriculture in Colorado and around the world. These genetically engineered (GE) crops, or so-called \u201cGMOs,\u201d allow our farmers to produce higher yields with less water while using fewer pesticides and less fuel to produce enough food for an ever-growing population. These crops are beneficial for our environment, for our economy and for consumers.\n\nProposition 105 purports to inform consumers about which food products contain GMO ingredients and which do not \u2014 but it fails. Proposition 105\u2019s labeling requirements are so unscientific, inaccurate and arbitrary that it would require thousands of food products to be labeled as \u201cgenetically engineered\u201d even when they have no GMO content. Conversely, thousands of other foods would be arbitrarily exempted from the measure\u2019s labeling requirements even when they do contain, or are made with, genetically engineered ingredients.\n\nConsumers already have reliable options to choose foods made without GE ingredients. They can select from thousands of foods labeled \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cnon-GMO\u201d under existing federal labeling standards. Any manufacturer can label products as GMO-free if they meet these national guidelines. Proposition 105\u2019s requirements conflict with these existing nationwide standards which already provide consumers a more reliable way to know which foods are made without GE ingredients.\n\nUnder Proposition 105, foods derived from GE crops would need to be harvested, transported and stored with completely separate equipment and in completely separate storage facilities because the proposition includes a zero-tolerance threshold for \u201cco-mingling\u201d food ingredients. While cost estimates vary, a study has shown that consumers could see an increase of up to 10 percent on their food bills due to the extensive record-keeping and identity- preservation systems required in order to comply with these extreme labeling mandates.\n\nFood costs would increase as consumers either avoid products with special labels or manufacturers eliminate items containing GMOs by substituting higher priced non-GMO ingredients to avoid the label. In the end, this would reduce food choices for consumers and result in increased food costs. Proposition 105 would also apply to food exported from our state. Requiring a \u201cgenetically engineered\u201d label on food exports and placing mandatory compliance burdens on our food producers that no other state requires will harm our vital export markets and put our state\u2019s food and agriculture economy at a severe competitive disadvantage.\n\nLastly, Proposition 105 would increase state government costs for implementation and enforcement of its requirements with no designated funding source to pay for it. These extra expenses would ultimately cost Colorado taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\nProposition 105\u2019s misguided labeling requirements would mislead consumers, increase costs for farmers, and impose higher food costs on Colorado families, especially hurting those who can least afford it. Food labeling standards should be set at the federal level so that farmers, food producers and consumers in all states are treated equally.\n\nAs former head of the department that regulates food production and labeling, I oppose this costly and ill-conceived proposition, and urge voters to look into the facts and vote \u201cno\u201d on Proposition 105.\n\nDon Ament is the former commissioner of agriculture for the Colorado Department of Agriculture and also served for 12 years as a member of the Colorado General Assembly.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Should Colorado voters approve Proposition 105 (GMO food labeling measure)?
