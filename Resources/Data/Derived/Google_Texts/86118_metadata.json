In a little under an hour, the Vikings will play their all-important penultimate preseason game.\n\nAs I wrote in today\u2019s paper, the Vikings starters are expected to play into the second quarter. Whether they stick around after halftime will depend on whether they satisfied coach Mike Zimmer with their performance.\n\nTwo starters will not play, though. Running back Adrian Peterson will not touch the football in his homecoming because it\u2019s the preseason and the Vikings won\u2019t risk injury with him. Center John Sullivan, meanwhile, has not practiced in 10 days due to back spasms, so he is out tonight.\n\nAlso out for the Vikings are tight end MyCole Pruitt, offensive tackle Carter Bykowski, nose tackle Shamar Stephen and cornerback Josh Robinson.\n\nThe Cowboys are expected to be without star wide receiver Dez Bryant.\n\nStill, this will be a tough test for the Vikings, especially their defense, in this final tune-up. The Cowboys were the NFC East champs last year and have one of the NFL\u2019s best offensive lines, led by left tackle Tyron Smith.\n\nKeep an eye on Gerald Hodges, who will start at middle linebacker for the first time in his life. That position battle remains wide-open in late August.\n\nAt safety, Antone Exum will return from a hamstring injury, so keep an eye on him, too. That being said, Robert Blanton can probably cement a starting spot as long as he doesn\u2019t have an awful performance here at Jerry World.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Vikings starters are expected to play into the second quarter tonight in Arlington, Texas.
