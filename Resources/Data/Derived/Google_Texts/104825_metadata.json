Members of the House informally commemorated the ending of the session by spending time roasting each other.\n\nA remark by Republican David Branscum commented on the difficulty of picking up just a few votes to pass the private option.\n\n\u201cRepresentative Les Carnine, we have decided to replace your voting machine button with a \u2018not yet\u2019 button,\u201d said Branscum as the sounds of laughter and light-hearted chatter filled the House floor.\n\nCarnine was one of three legislators flipping to a \u2018yes\u2019 vote after four separate votes failed to re-authorize the private option, stalling the fiscal session. After the House recessed Republican Speaker Davy Carter of Cabot reflected on the behavior of legislators in the context of a divisive national political environment.\n\n\u201cTo be able to do what we did working together, Republicans and Democrats, I think is remarkable and I\u2019m very proud of that and all the members for plowing through the issues together. I think that\u2019s one of the things the 89th General Assembly, hopefully, will be remembered for. It just doesn\u2019t happen that way very many places,\u201d said Carter.\n\nCarter continued, saying the private option will be looked at in future years as a foundation for something that is good and can be continually built upon.

Over 100,000 have gained coverage in the first few months of the program.\n\nThe legislature will formally adjourn next Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "The state legislature held its penultimate session Wednesday with each chamber approving each other\u2019s version of the $5 billion budget bill known as the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/5-billion-budget-bill-and-fond-quips-arkansas-legislature-nears-adjournment", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201403/photo.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The state legislature held its penultimate session Wednesday with each chamber approving each other\u2019s version of the $5 billion budget bill known as the", "title": "$5 Billion Budget Bill and Fond Quips as Arkansas Legislature Nears Adjournment"}, "story_id": 289498747, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarkauffman"}, "author": "Jacob Kauffman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "$5 Billion Budget Bill and Fond Quips as Arkansas Legislature Nears Adjournment"}, "nid": 20185, "datePublished": "2014-03-12", "wordCount": 340, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f3c\"", "article_summary": "Carter continued, saying the private option will be looked at in future years as a foundation for something that is good and can be continually built upon.\nThe state legislature held its penultimate session Wednesday with each chamber approving each other\u2019s version of the $5 billion budget bill known as the Revenue Stabilization Act.\nA remark by Republican David Branscum commented on the difficulty of picking up just a few votes to pass the private option.\nMembers of the House informally commemorated the ending of the session by spending time roasting each other.\nCarnine was one of three legislators flipping to a \u2018yes\u2019 vote after four separate votes failed to re-authorize the private option, stalling the fiscal session."}
