Kennedy\u2019s speechwriters beam. But it is ludicrous to hear such a comment from a president who has spent almost seven years fear-mongering to promote one federal power grab after another.\n\nMr. Obama has done more than any other president to sway Americans to perceive all gun owners as threats to public safety. The president declared, \u201cCongress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun.\u201d But the no-fly list has long been a parody of due process: Federal Judge Anna Smith ruled last year that it was unconstitutional and recognized that \u201cinternational travel is a necessary aspect of liberties sacred to members of a free society.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal is especially perilous to freedom because his administration is placing innocent Americans on the no-fly list based solely on a hunch that they might someday commit violence. If Congress enacts Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal, then the absurd judgments of one government agency would provide a license to ravage victims\u2019 other constitutional rights \u2014 and perhaps also to tacitly identify gun owners with terrorists.\n\nMr. Obama perennially invokes the threat of terrorism to cloak illegal government surveillance. When Edward Snowden exposed how the National Security Agency was ravaging Americans\u2019 privacy, the president responded by portraying any threat to the federal data vacuum cleaners as pre-emptive surrender to terrorist cabals. This past May, when Congress dallied before renewing the Patriot Act, Mr. Obama issued an apocalyptic warning: \u201cHeaven forbid we\u2019ve got a problem where we could have prevented a terrorist attack \u2026 but we didn\u2019t do so simply because of inaction in the Senate.\u201d Mr. Obama signaled on Sunday that he believes that new threats justify government restrictions on the use of private encryption of email: \u201cI will urge high-tech and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.\u201d\n\nAfter federal officials failed to detect a plot by the so-called underwear bomber in late 2009, Mr. Obama authorized the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to become far more aggressive and intrusive. He declared in 2010 that he had asked the TSA for confirmation that \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is the only way to assure the American people\u2019s safety.\u201d Commenting last month on the downing of a Russian airliner over the Sinai peninsula, the president declared, \u201cI think there is a possibility that there was a bomb on board, and we\u2019re taking that very seriously.\u201d But the TSA\u2019s bomb detectors are routinely triggered by hand sanitizers and other commonly used items, and TSA\u2019s Whole Body Scanners failed to detect 96 percent of the guns and mock explosives that inspector general agents attempted to smuggle past them. But as long as Obama administration officials can invoke vague threats, Americans\u2019 Fourth Amendment right to be free of warrantless, unreasonable searches is null and void.\n\nWhen Congress was considering the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama and his officials repeatedly vastly exaggerated the number of Americans without access to health care. They sought to sway citizens to believe that the only alternative to the president\u2019s plan was to permit millions of Americans to suffer horribly, perhaps dying in the street. Mr. Obama promised that his health care program could expand coverage and curtail spending. There was no way to simultaneously increase demand and slash costs except by decimating freedom. Millions of Americans\u2019 health insurance policies have been canceled as a result of Obamacare.\n\nThe president\u2019s rhetoric on climate change is perhaps his most blunt fear-mongering. In a September speech in Alaska, Mr. Obama warned that without sweeping economic and environmental policy changes, \u201cwe will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing.\u201d But while he talks as if climate change is a self-evident truth, the administration is refusing to disclose key data from its top climate research agency to House Republicans who suspect the administration is fudging numbers to promote the president\u2019s agenda. As the evidence for global warming becomes shakier, he is castigating anyone who rejects his iron-fisted, purported solutions.\n\nMr. Obama is correct that freedom is potentially more potent than fear. But we must recognize how politicians profit from fear-mongering more than any other group in our society. And if enough Americans can be frightened, then all of us will be further subjugated.\n\n\u2022 James Bovard is the author of \u201cAttention Deficit Democracy\u201d (Palgrave, 2006) and \u201cLost Rights\u201d (St. Martin\u2019s, 1994).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most memorable line in President Obama's Oval Office Sunday speech was his declaration that \"freedom is more powerful than fear.\" That epigram might have made John F.
