Former NFL great Tony Dorsett says he's losing his memory. (USATSI)

In the middle of his Twitter rant last week against the NFL and those who run it, former safety Hamza Abdullah admitted he has thought about suicide, even though he has a wife and three children.

Those thoughts apparently aren't unusual, especially when you consider the recent suicides of former players Junior Seau, Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling. And now one of the greatest running backs to pull on a uniform says he, too, has dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression.

“Well, you know, I've been diagnosed with all that,” Dorsett told WFAN radio on Wednesday. “That's private stuff and I don't want to get into all that stuff, but I've been diagnosed. I'm just telling you, I've been diagnosed with that, yes.”

Also scary for Dorsett -- who spent 12 years in the league, all but one with the Cowboys, and rushed for 12,739 career yards, the eighth-highest total in NFL history -- is that he said his quality of life is decreasing every day. He says he's losing his memory, and it's so bad that one time he couldn't remember the route to take his children to a team practice.

The 59-year-old Pro Football Hall of Famer also thinks the NFL should pay for his health insurance.

“All I want to do is have health insurance for the rest of my life,” Dorsett said. “I signed up for this, obviously. My family is worried about me. I'm worried about me in some respects.”
