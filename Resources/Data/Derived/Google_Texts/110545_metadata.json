The measure was anticipated to be on the agenda Thursday but had to be removed to comply with Oklahoma\u2019s Open Meetings Act.\n\nOne of the votes that the board members made was to increase how much Medicaid recipients pay in co-pays. Most co-pays will increase from $3 to $4, according to the health care authority.\n\nDavid Blatt, the executive director of Oklahoma Policy Institute, said he was frustrated to be talking about budget cuts with leaders of an agency that could have received millions of dollars had Oklahoma expanded its Medicaid program, an option associated with the much-debated Affordable Care Act.\n\nBlatt\u2019s frustration was met with applause from the audience.\n\n\u201cThis proposal to raise copayments ... is the wrong choice,\u201d Blatt said. \u201cThis directly affects the empty pocketbooks of Medicaid recipients. These are low-income parents, seniors, those with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Some are taking four to six medications a month. This is an extra $15 to $20 in cost, which many Medicaid recipients just don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nRehabilitative services cut\n\nThe board also voted to change eligibility for adult and children Medicaid members who could receive psychosocial rehabilitative services, a cut that was made to save the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services about $20 million.\n\nUnder the new eligibility requirements, adults and children will not be covered for psychosocial rehab services, which include teaching life skills and coping, unless they have been hospitalized at a psychiatric inpatient facility; have been admitted to a crisis center; or have been determined disabled by the Social Security Administration for mental health reasons, among a few other caveats.\n\nFormer Sen. George Miller called Thursday\u2019s proposed rule changes some of the toughest votes he had ever made, noting he was against every single change but felt he had no other options.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Miller said. \u201cFiscal year starts on July 1. This is June 26. I used to have a vote in the Legislature, but I gave it up. I wish I still had it, but it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. But anyhow, I apologize, but I really don\u2019t have an answer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a standing-room only meeting, the Oklahoma Health Care Authority board voted Thursday on several changes, including changes in mental health services and increases in co-payments, that will affect some of Oklahoma\u2019s poorest residents.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
