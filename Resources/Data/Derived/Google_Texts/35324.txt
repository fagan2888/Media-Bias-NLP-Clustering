EDITOR: Sometimes people comment on my lawn decorations. It’s been fun for Jim and me. Now you see a sign supporting Baker for judge.

There are other very capable candidates but I’m most impressed with Trish Baker. In my view she has the broadest range of legal experiences, is patient, open-minded and fair. She also has a strong commitment to use her volunteer time to help our county keep being a wonderful place to live in.

More specifically, Baker’s legal experience includes civil work, prosecution and defense work — both in a private practice and as an assistant district attorney. Currently she is our Clerk of Circuit Court appointed by our judges and is responsible for every aspect of our courts.

Baker has had leadership roles in the Stevens Point School Board, Park Ridge Village Board, Community Foundation, Rotary Club, Midstate Independent Living Choices and United Way to name a few.

Judges make important decisions every day that affects our lives. Baker has the integrity, experience, and temperament to do an outstanding job.
