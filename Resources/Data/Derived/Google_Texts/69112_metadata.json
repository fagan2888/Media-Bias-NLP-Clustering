We expanded coverage to include just about every demographic in the state.\"\n\nThe grant comes from a pot of money under the Affordable Care Act, which aims to create networks of de-identified patient medical records across the states in one large database, which can then be used as a rich source of health and medical research.\n\nThe dollars from the grant are specifically used for hiring IT professional to establish the network.\n\n\"Big data is the goal of PCOR to one day create a nationwide linkage of all these databases,\" said Muszynski.\n\nThis is yet another step in moving away from the traditional method of research, which has been done in academic medical centers over a long period of time, and expanding it to the community level to include a larger and more diverse sample size.\n\nFor example, on its part, FSU's partners at the community level include Orlando Health, Florida Hospital and community health centers in Central Florida.\n\n\"It brings new advances in medicine more rapidly to the consumer through the big data,\" Muszynski said of the networks. \"For example, it'll take a very long time to compare low-dose and high-dose aspirin. Just to use academic medical centers in an old-fashioned way, would take years. PCOR promises to shorten that.\"\n\nAmong the three universities, the network will eventually bring together data from 9 million patients.\n\nFSU is also a partner with UF in the $17.5 million Clinical and Translational Science Award program, which aims to speed up advancements in research by providing funds to hire scientists.\n\n\"The average time for drug discovery is 11 to 12 years,\" said Muszynski. \"And we're trying to cut that in half. Grants like this allow us to expand our network and add more manpower and enroll patients for these trials.\"\n\nThe three universities are part of OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Three Florida universities win award to establish health network", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "University of Florida, University of Miami and Florida State University, which has a satellite campus in Orlando, received the $7.9 million grant, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research.
