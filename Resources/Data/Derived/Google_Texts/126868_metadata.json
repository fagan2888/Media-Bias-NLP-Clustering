At a fundraising event last night, President Obama went further than usual in shining a light on basic structural truths that challenge widely held assumptions.\n\n\u201c[T]he truth of the matter is that the problem in Congress is very specific. We have a group of folks in the Republican Party who have taken over who are so ideologically rigid, who are so committed to an economic theory that says if folks at the top do very well then everybody else is somehow going to do well; who deny the science of climate change; who don\u2019t think making investments in early childhood education makes sense; who have repeatedly blocked raising a minimum wage so if you work full-time in this country you\u2019re not living in poverty; who scoff at the notion that we might have a problem with women not getting paid for doing the same work that men are doing. [\u2026] \u201c[T]he problem \u2026 is not that the Democrats are overly ideological \u2013 because the truth of the matter is, is that the Democrats in Congress have consistently been willing to compromise and reach out to the other side. There are no radical proposals coming out from the left.\u201d\n\nThe substance of this is hard to deny. The president argued, accurately, that on the major issues of the day, Democrats deliberately pursued moderate solutions to pressing problems. On immigration, Obama\u2019s proposal enjoys bipartisan support and is similar to what Bush/Cheney recommended. On climate, Democrats could have adopted a command-and-control model, but Obama instead endorsed a cap-and-trade plan comparable to what McCain/Palin proposed.\n\nOn taxes, Democrats have pushed for modest reforms that would leave tax rates broadly lower than when Reagan was in office. Even on health care, the Affordable Care Act is a centrist solution built on Mitt Romney\u2019s model. It led the president to add:\n\n\u201cSo when you hear a false equivalence that somehow, well, Congress is just broken, it\u2019s not true. What\u2019s broken right now is a Republican Party that repeatedly says no to proven, time-tested strategies to grow the economy, create more jobs, ensure fairness, open up opportunity to all people.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, hearing the president specifically call out \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d is sure to make some Beltway pundits uncomfortable.\n\nBut as Greg Sargent explained, the president\u2019s willingness to make these arguments publicly is important: \u201cI\u2019m not sure Obama has ever gone so directly at the idea that today\u2019s GOP has become what some of us have been calling \u2018post-policy\u2019; that the basic imbalance resulting from that is the primary cause of reigning Washington dysfunction; and that on a fundamental level, press coverage is failing to reckon with these realities.\u201d\n\nThere are those who choose not to believe this. Many in the Beltway \u2013 perhaps out of habit, perhaps out of laziness, perhaps out of blind adherence to a misguided ideology that dictates \u201cboth sides\u201d are always to blame, facts be damned \u2013 prefer to believe that if radicalized congressional Republicans refuse to govern, Obama must somehow be responsible.\n\nMaybe, they argue, if Obama was a more leading leader, the president could force extremists in a separate party and a separate branch of government to bend to his will. To deny this, they argue, is to make \u201c excuses .\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The president went further than usual last night in shining a light on basic structural truths that challenge widely held assumptions about what's wrong with DC", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-the-problem-congress-very", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The president went further than usual last night in shining a light on basic structural truths that challenge widely held assumptions about what's wrong with DC", "title": "Obama: 'The problem in Congress is very specific'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-the-problem-congress-very", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2012/11/happybday.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Obama: 'The problem in Congress is very specific'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-the-problem-congress-very", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2012/11/happybday.jpg?itok=-qzDjXxl", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The president went further than usual last night in shining a light on basic structural truths that challenge widely held assumptions about what's wrong with DC"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-05-23T11:06:38-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The president went further than usual last night in shining a light on basic structural truths that challenge widely held assumptions about what's wrong with DC", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Obama: 'The problem in Congress is very specific'", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-the-problem-congress-very", "published": 1, "date": "05/23/2014 11:06:38 EDT", "tags": "barack-obama,congress,house-republicans,rachel-maddow-show"}, "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Congress, House Republicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde013\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[T]he truth of the matter is that the problem in Congress is very specific.\nAt a fundraising event last night, President Obama went further than usual in shining a light on basic structural truths that challenge widely held assumptions.\nOn climate, Democrats could have adopted a command-and-control model, but Obama instead endorsed a cap-and-trade plan comparable to what McCain/Palin proposed.\nIt led the president to add:\u201cSo when you hear a false equivalence that somehow, well, Congress is just broken, it\u2019s not true.\n[\u2026] \u201c[T]he problem \u2026 is not that the Democrats are overly ideological \u2013 because the truth of the matter is, is that the Democrats in Congress have consistently been willing to compromise and reach out to the other side."}
