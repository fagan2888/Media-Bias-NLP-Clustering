Joint Harbor Operations Center (JHOC) notified Border Patrol agents and U.S. Coast Guard personnel when the two subjects, one male and one female, were spotted the two crossing into U.S. waters according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) release. Border Patrol agents were able to respond and apprehend the jetskiers as they emerged from waves.

Both Mexican nationals were placed under arrest and taken to a nearby station for processing. The two are slated to face Federal charges for illegal entry. The male suspect was also found to have an outstanding warrant out for his arrest in San Diego County for “possession with intent to distribute marijuana,” the CBP statement detailed.

During a recent tour of the U.S.-Mexico border in the San Diego area, CBP representatives described to Breitbart News that maritime activity is one of the greatest challenges to border security.

Just under two weeks ago, multiple agencies participated in apprehending four illegal aliens dropped off on another San Diego beach, but the two jet ski drivers eluded authorities at the time.

The public is encouraged to contact authorities with any information regarding maritime smuggling by dialing 9-1-1 according to the release.
