Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the University of Texas at Austin can consider race when deciding who can come to their school. It's the second time the high court will decide this case. But like the rest of the country, the court is having a hard time talking about race without shouting at each other. Justice Scalia is making what some say are racist comments.

Next, there are increasing challenges to how we portray history at major institutions; students at Yale want to remove traces of John Calhoun, a former Vice-President and advocate of slavery who has a college named after him. Now, someone is suing the Metropolitan Museum of Art for displaying classical works that depict Jesus as too white and blond.

Last, the much-awaited second season of Serial is back and ready to examine the case of Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who spent five years as a prisoner of the Taliban after he abandoned his post in 2009. The U.S. traded five Taliban prisoners amid controversy to get Bergdahl back.
