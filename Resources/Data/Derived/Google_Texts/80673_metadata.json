But the idea of a series built on titillating audiences with violence against women, a voyeuristic show focused on the creepy stalking of vulnerable people (mostly women), is distasteful apart from any questions of casting or character development.\n\nFrom the opening moments, when a woman is chased, then set ablaze and burned to death in her car, \u201cStalker\u201d is less a drama than an unnerving and gimmicky set of violent visuals.\n\nBeautiful specimens Maggie Q and Dylan McDermott play cops investigating cases of voyeurism, cyber harassment and romantic fixation \u2014 you know, the stuff so many creepy thrillers allude to without being entirely fixated on.
