After voicing support for traditional marriage, the fast food chain not only withstood a boycott by leftist detractors; it became a symbol for the beliefs of millions of socially conservative Americans.\n\nWhile this corporation might be among the most recognizable, it is far from the only U.S. chain with direct ties to firm biblical beliefs.\n\nThe Blaze recently put together a list of some companies Christians might consider supporting based on the faith-based values of their owners.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThanks to its dedication to protecting life, taking an objection over ObamaCare\u2019s mandate to provide abortive drugs all the way to the Supreme Court, arts and craft retail chain Hobby Lobby has an obvious place on the list.\n\nNot only did the company provide a successful argument protecting the religious liberty of business owners before the nation\u2019s highest court; The Blaze notes that Hobby Lobby is currently planning to open a Bible museum within the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nA couple of major corporations \u2013 clothing retailer Forever 21 and fast food chain In-N-Out \u2013 rely on a ubiquitous, albeit less obvious, method to express faith in Christ. Both refer to John 3:16, a Bible verse integral to the core tenets of Christianity, on containers.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFun fact did u know all the in n out cups have \u2018john 3:16\u2019 printed under them pic.twitter.com/9Yo8xzPByg \u2014 Zesty Bill Clinton (@chanclahakyeon) May 22, 2014\n\nInterstate Battery\u2019s chairman is not shy about sharing his faith. As The Blaze points out, he not only declares his faith on the company\u2019s website but also offers a prayer to help those who have decided to accept Christ as their personal savior.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFinally, The Blaze references Tyson Foods, a company whose chairman is both adamant about sharing his belief with others at every appropriate opportunity and donating significant portions of the company\u2019s products to charities that feed the poor.\n\nThe companies listed in the article represent just a fraction of the American companies unafraid to be open about the importance of faith. Cosmetics giant Mary Kay, for example, was established by a woman with a reliance on her religious beliefs who credits God for her success.\n\nSupermarket chain H.E.B. and footwear manufacturer Timberland are among the many other companies whose leaders cite the Bible as a guiding principle in their business decisions.\n\nPhoto Credit: Twitter/Zesty Bill Clinton\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chick-fila-A isn't the only one...", "author": "B.
