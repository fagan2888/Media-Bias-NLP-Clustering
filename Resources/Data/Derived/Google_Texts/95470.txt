HATFIELD, Pa. (AP) - Police say a suburban Philadelphia man broke into an apartment and raped a 6-year-old girl in her top bunk bed while her older brother slept below.

Twenty-eight-year-old Oscar Herrera has been charged with rape of a child, burglary and related offenses.

Investigators say the Hatfield man broke into the apartment early Monday and entered the girl’s room. Court documents indicate the girl’s cries alerted her 11-year-old brother, who called police and alerted his parents.

Police say the children’s stepfather held Herrera at knifepoint until police arrived. The family says they don’t know him.

Court documents indicate the girl told police “bad things happened.”

Herrera was arraigned Monday and held on $1 million bail.

He’s due in court Nov. 19.

According to court records, Herrera doesn’t yet have a lawyer.
