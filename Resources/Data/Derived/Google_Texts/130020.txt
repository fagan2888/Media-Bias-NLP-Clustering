When I speak of an utter disconnect with the American people, people like Curly Haugland, member of the RNC Rules Committee, make my point undeniable true.

In an interview given earlier today on CNBC, he said, "The media has created a perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the conflict here."

"Political parties choose their nominee, not the general public contrary to popular belief," he went on to say.

The host of the show asked, "Then why bother holding the primaries?"

"That's a very good question," Haugland replied.

Enter Donald Trump - the people's response to this insanity.
