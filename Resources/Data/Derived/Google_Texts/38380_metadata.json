The Holmes of Sherlock, the BBC/Masterpiece program that aired its season finale Sunday night on PBS, is no exception. This time, though, his creators have gifted him with a talent for a mnemonic device straight out of ancient Greece\u2014the mind palace. Of course, this being Holmes (and television), his version was somewhat more advanced than that of the average rememberer.\n\nAccording to myth, the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos invented the technique after attending a banquet gone wrong. Simonides stepped outside to meet with two young men. But when he arrived outside, the young men were not there and the hall was collapsing behind him. Though his fellow banqueters were too badly crushed by the collapse for their remains to be identified, Simonides was supposedly able to put a name with each body based on where they had been sitting in the hall. That ability to remember based on location became the method of loci, also known as memory theater, the art of memory, the memory palace and mind palace.\n\nTo use the technique, visualize a complex place in which you could physically store a set of memories. That place is often a building such as a house, but it can also be something like a road with multiple addresses. In the house version, every room is home to a specific item you want to remember. To take advantage of the mind\u2019s ability to hold onto visual memories, it often helps to embellish the item being stored\u2014the milk you need to buy at the grocery store might become a vat of milk with a talking cow swimming in it. When those memories need to be recalled, you can walk through the building in your mind, seeing and remembering each item.\n\nGreeks and Romans, such as the orator Cicero, employed the mind palace technique to memorize speeches, marking the order of what to say within a complicated architectural space. To write something down in that era was expensive and time consuming, a luxury not to be wasted, even on rhetoric The method of loci continued to flourish through the Middle Ages, when monks and other scholastics used it to commit religious texts to memory.\n\nIt fell out of favor, however, with the invention of the printing press. With books more easily available, there was less need for such powers of memorization. But the method\u2019s popularity saw a resurgence in the latter half of the 20th century, particularly in international memory competitions, where skilled participants see it as a primary tool for recalling large numbers of items in order. Competitor Simon Reinhard holds the speed record for memorizing a pack of playing cards in 21.19 seconds at the German Open in 2011. And at the Swedish Open last year, Reinhard set another record, managing to memorize the order of 370 cards.\n\nGiven the technique\u2019s power and history, it\u2019s a little surprising that Arthur Conan Doyle never mentioned such a thing in his stories. Instead, he attributed his creation\u2019s prodigious memory to an exceptionally well-organized, well-stocked \u201cbrain attic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider that a man\u2019s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose,\u201d Holmes tells John Watson in A Study in Scarlet, the first of Conan Doyle\u2019s tales about the detective. Holmes is careful to fill his brain attic with only memories that may be useful, such as cases from the past. To make room for what was truly needed, Holmes tossed the rest out \u2013 even deeming unimportant the fact that the Earth circles the Sun. Watson, in contrast, has a brain attic more like the rest of us, jumbled with memories both valuable and inane, with none specifically selected for storage based on their potential future worth.\n\n\u201cThe key insight from the brain attic is that you\u2019re only going to be able to remember something, and you can only really say you know it, if you can access it when you need it,\u201d says Maria Konnikova, author of Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes. \u201cOtherwise it might as well have disappeared,\u201d she notes. The mind palace makes the idea more specific by organizing the information in a certain way. \u201cThe brain attic is much more broad,\u201d Konnikova says.\n\nA mind palace certainly sounds grander, befitting Holmes and his outsized ego, as Watson notes in season 2 of Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 mind palace, however, isn\u2019t the typical type of storage place for the method of loci. Most people when they start out building a palace choose a place very familiar, such as the home they grew up in. But when viewers finally get a look inside Holmes\u2019 palace during \u201cHis Last Vow,\u201d the final episode of the latest season, they see something quite a bit different.\n\n(Beware of spoilers from this point on.)\n\nHolmes, after being shot point blank, delves into his palace to discover the best path to survival. Viewers see him stumbling down a winding staircase, then in a morgue-like room where he finds his friend Molly Hooper, the pathology lab assistant, looking over his own dead body. \u201cYou\u2019re most certainly going to die, so you need to focus,\u201d Hooper says. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and clever having a mind palace, but you only have three seconds of consciousness left to use it.\u201d Holmes discovers the answers to staying alive are indeed in his brain. But he goes beyond the classical mind palace technique, finding them not only by wandering through the building and locating items but also through conversations with the people he has stored there, like Hooper and his brother Mycroft.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The BBC/Masterpiece sleuth employs a memory technique invented by the ancient Greeks", "title": "It\u2019s not so elementary: The secrets of Sherlock\u2019s mind palace", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The BBC/Masterpiece sleuth employs a memory technique invented by the ancient Greeks", "title": "It\u2019s not so elementary: The secrets of Sherlock\u2019s mind palace", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/its_not_so_elementary_the_secrets_of_sherlocks_mind_palace/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/sherlock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The BBC/Masterpiece sleuth employs a memory technique invented by the ancient Greeks", "title": "It\u2019s not so elementary: The secrets of Sherlock\u2019s mind palace", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/sherlock.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Zielinski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, BBC, Greece, Memory Techniques, sherlock, Smithsonian.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc442\"", "article_summary": "That ability to remember based on location became the method of loci, also known as memory theater, the art of memory, the memory palace and mind palace.\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 mind palace, however, isn\u2019t the typical type of storage place for the method of loci.\nThis time, though, his creators have gifted him with a talent for a mnemonic device straight out of ancient Greece\u2014the mind palace.\nThe mind palace makes the idea more specific by organizing the information in a certain way.\nGreeks and Romans, such as the orator Cicero, employed the mind palace technique to memorize speeches, marking the order of what to say within a complicated architectural space."}
