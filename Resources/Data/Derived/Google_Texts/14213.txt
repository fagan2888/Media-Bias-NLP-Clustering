The employees of Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse are out of a job, after a Thanksgiving Day fire broke out, and the musicians who were signed up to play at the bar months in advance have no place to play.

But another spot nearby is helping out.

The band Mogollon was playing Saturday night at Harold's Corral in Cave Creek, and they donated part of their paychecks to help out the musicians of Tom Wagner and the County Line who lost all their equipment at the Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse because of the fire.

Mogollon invited the musicians to share the stage with them.

Members of Mogollon is also sharing part of their paychecks and also putting out a tip jar.

All donations are going to help them re-establish their band.

"It’ll be nice to see them on stage to get them playing, and for the whole community to come out here and see them and try to help them get on their feet,” said Joshua McBride, manager at Harold’s Corral.

“This is a typical outpouring of compassion and friendship that occurs in Cave Creek, said Larry Wendt, Buffalo Chip Saloon. “It’s a close-knit community. I think josh related to the fact that we all compete with each other, but we all support each other.”

There is also a fund that's been established to raise money for all of the employees of Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse.

You can go to Parkway Bank at Cave Creek and donate to The Buffalo Chip Employees Fund.
