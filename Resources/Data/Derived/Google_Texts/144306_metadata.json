Rick Snyder\u2019s executive office are running for precinct delegate posts in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary and, if elected, could be in position to help Lt. Gov. Brian Calley keep his spot on the general election ticket.\n\nSnyder wants to retain Calley as his running mate for the general election, but Michigan Republican Party rules will allow delegates to pick the nominee at an August 23rd convention.\n\nTea party leader Wes Nakagiri is challenging Calley for the spot.\n\nSnyder senior adviser Dick Posthumus of Alto, the Republican nominee for governor in 2002, and \u201ctransformation manager\u201d Rich Baird of Bath are among executive office employees running for precinct delegate positions, according to county clerk candidate lists reviewed by MLive.com.\n\nSenior strategy advisor Dennis Schornack of Williamston, director of administrative services Marsha Quebbeman of Lansing and Calley chief of staff Nathaniel Forstner of Lansing are also listed as precinct delegate candidates.\n\nSnyder administration spokesperson Sara Wurfel declined to respond Monday when asked if staff was encouraged to run for the posts (update: she later said there was no directive), instead deferring questions to the governor's re-election campaign team.\n\n\u201cIf people want to be a part of the political process on their personal time and work to better the state of Michigan, more power to them,\u201d said campaign spokesperson Emily Benavides.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly nothing stopping Snyder staffers from running for precinct delegate posts, but the large number is surprising, according to Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics, who was especially interested to hear that a big name like Posthumus would run in such a small race.\n\n\u201cThat has got to be unique,\u201d Ballenger said, noting that various Republican groups have been recruiting precinct delegates for months in what he called the latest front in Michigan's \u201ctea party versus establishment\u201d battle.\n\nMore than a thousand precinct delegate candidates will appear on ballots across the state Tuesday, and the general public tends to pay very little attention to the races. But Republicans have been unusually focused on the hyper-local posts ahead of this year\u2019s statewide convention, where delegates will pick Snyder\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe Calley campaign claims it has put together the \u201clargest precinct delegate recruitment project in Michigan history,\u201d and groups such as the DeVos-backed Michigan Freedom Fund and the Michigan Advocacy Trust have also been recruiting and endorsing potential delegates.\n\n\u201cThis is all going on below the radar and behind the scenes,\u201d Ballenger said. \u201cAnybody active in Republican Party politics knows about this, and they know how critical it is, but the media has largely missed it.\u201d\n\nOther executive office employees listed as precinct delegate candidates include Snyder assistant director of scheduling Melanie Ellison, deputy press secretary Dave Murray, social media director Mike Brownfield, deputy legal counsel Dave Murley, constituent relations representative Ryan Studley and deputy director of legislative affairs Sally Durfee.\n\nGideon D\u2019Assandro of Grandville, who works for Snyder\u2019s re-election campaign rather than his office, is listed as a precinct delegate candidate in Kent County.\n\nLocal delegates elected Tuesday will be eligible for county or district conventions, where delegates to the statewide convention will be picked. The same pool will be eligible for conventions held the next two years and, as a result, may also decide the re-election of embattled Republican National Committeeman Dave Agema.\n\n\u201cThe short game is making sure that Calley is re-nominated, but then there\u2019s the long game,\u201d said Ballenger. \u201cWhat about next year? What about other elections for national committeeman or woman? August 5 is going to be absolutely instrumental in who gets sent to any state convention between now and August 2016.\u201d\n\nTea party activists did not field a candidate to challenge Snyder in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary, but many have been frustrated by the administration\u2019s push to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act and to allow adoption of Common Core education standards, among other things.\n\n\u201cGrassroots\u201d leaders are hoping to send a message to the administration \u2014 and shift the ticket right \u2014 by knocking off Calley, who was known as a strong conservative during his time in the state Legislature but has backed several Snyder initiatives.\n\nNakagiri and other tea party leaders have been recruiting precinct delegates of their own, although the effort appears to be much less organized.\n\nSeveral leading figures in the movement, including current delegates Joan Fabiano of Holt and Isabelle Terry of Rockford, are up for election on Tuesday. Dave Agema\u2019s wife, Barbara, is listed as a precinct delegate out of Grandville.\n\nClinton County Republican Party Chairman Steve Willis accused those \u201cwithin and on the periphery\u201d of the Michigan GOP of working to \u201cstack the deck\u201d for a Calley nomination. He noted there were competitive delegate primaries in six of 33 local precincts this year even though candidates traditionally run unopposed.\n\nA recent mailer sent out by the Michigan Advocacy Trust, a \u201c527\u201d political group organized by longtime Lansing insider Richard McLellan, endorsed six \u201cfreedom fighting conservatives\u201d running for precinct delegate in Clinton County.\n\nWillis, who described himself as a \u201ctrue conservative\" in a lengthy blog post last week, said he had never heard of the candidates until they filed and suggested the mailer language was intentionally misleading.\n\n\u201cWhy they would do this perplexes me, because I think Calley would have won anyway,\u201d Willis said. \u201cBut it\u2019s more of an embarrassment to see the manipulation they\u2019re going through to make sure he wins.\u201d\n\nThe Michigan Republican Party does not try to impact the outcome of convention elections, according to spokesperson Darren Littell, who is personally running for a precinct delegate post out of Lansing, which he does not see as a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cOur role is just managing and running the convention in a non-biased manner, which is what we will do,\u201d Littell said.\n\nThere are several other big names in Republican politics listed as precinct delegate candidates this year, including U.S. Senate hopeful Terri Lynn Land of Grandville, Betsy DeVos of Ada, Greg McNeilly of Grand Rapids and Ron Weiser of Ann Arbor.\n\nMichigan residents who vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday will also see local precinct delegate candidates on the ballot, but there\u2019s little convention drama expected on that side of the aisle this year.\n\nJonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.
