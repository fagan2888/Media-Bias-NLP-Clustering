(AP) - Opponents of the North Carolina's new law preventing local governments from passing LGBT anti-discrimination protections and directing which bathrooms transgender people can use are getting together in Raleigh to push for its repeal.\n\nThe Forward Together movement led by the state NAACP scheduled a rally late Monday between the Legislative Building and the old Capitol building where Gov. Pat McCrory keeps his office. Participants will talk about their proposals to expand protections and the need for a higher minimum wage.\n\nA similar rally three weeks ago at the opening of the General Assembly's annual work session ended with the arrests of more than 50 people inside the Legislative Building. Authorities say those arrested refused to leave the building or Speaker Tim Moore's office in protest of the law.\n\nToday's rally is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Forward Together movement led by the state NAACP scheduled a rally late Monday between the Legislative Building and the old Capitol building where Gov.
