(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA pilot who runs an executive jet company that has transported the president of Guyana was arrested after U.S. agents found more than $600,000 in undeclared cash inside his aircraft during a stop in Puerto Rico, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nKhamraj Lall, the CEO Exec Jet Club LLC, was in custody at a federal jail in San Juan on suspicion of intent to evade currency reporting, said Carol Torres, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nLall was the co-pilot on a flight to Guyana when agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations searched the aircraft when it stopped to refuel Saturday. He and the two others on board reported carrying about $12,000, but agents found $620,588 in plastic bags inside the plane, Torres said.\n\nU.S. law requires amounts over $10,000 to be declared.\n\nTorres said the source of the money is under investigation.\n\nLall, 47, is a native of Guyana who lives in Ringwood, New Jersey. A spokesman for Guyanese President Donald Ramotar said the government is still trying to determine how many times the company has transported the president.\n\n\u201cAnyone can use a plane or a taxi. It should not be taken to mean anything,\u201d spokesman Kwame McKoy said.\n\nA person answering the phone at Exec Jet Club said no one at the company\u2019s offices in Gainesville, Florida, would comment on the arrest and declined to identify Lally\u2019s attorney. A bond hearing was scheduled for Monday.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
