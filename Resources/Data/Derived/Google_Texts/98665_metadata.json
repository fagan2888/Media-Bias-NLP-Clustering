Any basic high school student, anybody that\u2019s taken a basic civics course understands that Congress has the power of the purse. They asked Congress for this money, Congress said no in 2014 and they spent it anyway,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJindal then pointed to Obama Administration claims that Obamacare would reduce health care costs.\n\n\u201cThe president said he was going to bend down the cost curve when it comes to health care, they didn\u2019t do that. Neil, they are bad not just at constitutional law, they are bad at math. The reality is, the result of this case, if it is upheld, you\u2019re looking at 20%-30% premium increases for the majority of people who get their health care through the exchanges, who get their silver plans through the federal exchanges. Something like 57% are getting these subsidies,\u201d said Jindal.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd Jindal says that taxpayers and health insurance companies will be left dealing with the aftermath of these rising costs.\n\n\u201cNow the reality is the taxpayers will end up paying for that. It\u2019s not going to hurt low-income people, it will hurt taxpayers and insurance companies,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJindal then pointed out the potential impact on Obamacare of the next Supreme Court Justice appointment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important who the next president is, they\u2019ll be appointing a key person to the Supreme Court, you mentioned the Administration has won twice now at the Supreme Court and at very closely decided cases, and again, the next Justice could be the swing vote. There\u2019s not a chance in the world Hillary Clinton is going to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who will follow the law, follow the constitution. She was herself the originator of the precursor to Obamacare, Hillarycare, she herself thinks she\u2019s above the law,\u201d said Jindal.\n\nJindal said Obamacare is adding to the economic pressures weighing on America\u2019s middle class and their families.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re right, you made the most important point, it\u2019s the middle class, they\u2019re the ones that are going to end up, they\u2019re the ones, they and their children will pay for this debt, they\u2019re the ones whose premiums haven\u2019t gone down, they\u2019re premiums have gone up, they\u2019re the ones who are facing fewer choices in the health insurance marketplace,\u201d Jindal said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/White House,/FOX BUSINESS/Politics,/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-13 02:12:26 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Former Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal weighed in on a federal judge ruling Obamacare funding was unconstitutional.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/05/13/fmr-gov-jindal-obamacare-is-slamming-middle-class.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2016/05/13/fmr-gov-jindal-obamacare-is-slamming-middle-class/_jcr_content/image.img.jpg/0/0/1463163146140.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Former Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal weighed in on a federal judge ruling Obamacare funding was unconstitutional.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fmr.
