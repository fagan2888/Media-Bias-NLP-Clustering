Funding dropped from more than $5 million in 2006 to about $700,000 in 2013.\n\n'It\u2019s another public health challenge for Detroit, which is the most dangerous city in America to be a child, according to a Detroit News study.\n\n\n\nPublished in January, the study found that the death rate for childre\n\nn 18 and younger is higher in Detroit than in any U.S. city its size or larger.\n\n\n\nThe highest number of deaths occur in the first year, most related to premature birth. Homicide is the second greatest cause of child deaths in the city,' the News report said.\n\n'Both routine primary care and family planning-specific primary care are not available in Detroit,' Dr Schooley told the Detroit News.\n\n\n\n'To the extent that a significant proportion of those (pregnancies) are unplanned, it leads to all these decision-making options of which abortion is one lousy choice.'\n\nHealth professionals say they expect Obamacare will reduce abortions by providing funding for more birth control.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "One,three,babies,aborted,Detroit,making,American,city,like,world,country", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2638242/One-three-babies-aborted-Detroit-making-American-city-like-world-country.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Nearly one-third of all pregnancies in the city of Detroit end in abortion, a statistic public health officials blame on rising poverty and dwindling access to affordable contraception.", "title": "One in three babies are aborted in Detroit make it more like 3rd world", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2638242/One-three-babies-aborted-Detroit-making-American-city-like-world-country.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/02/article-2638242-1E2B3F6500000578-956_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2638242/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2638242/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "keywords": "One,three,babies,aborted,Detroit,making,American,city,like,world,country", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2638242, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "section": "News", "tag": "One three babies aborted Detroit making American city like world country", "published_time": "2014-05-24T16:07:57.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "modified_time": "2014-06-02T12:12:55.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Nearly one-third of all pregnancies in the city of Detroit end in abortion, a statistic public health officials blame on rising poverty and dwindling access to affordable contraception.", "title": "One in three babies are aborted in Detroit make it more like 3rd world", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2638242/One-three-babies-aborted-Detroit-making-American-city-like-world-country.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/02/article-2638242-1E2B3F6500000578-956_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Nearly one-third of all pregnancies in the city of Detroit end in abortion, a statistic public health officials blame on rising poverty and dwindling access to affordable contraception."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2e9\"", "article_summary": "It means there were 37.9 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 abortions in 2012, up from 27.5 per 1,000 women in 2001.\nVietnam has an rate of 83 abortions per 1,000 women, the Russian Federation, where the rate is 68, and Ukraine, where the rate is 57 per 1,000 women.\n'Both routine primary care and family planning-specific primary care are not available in Detroit,' Dr Schooley told the Detroit News.\nA new report about the high number of terminations in the Motor City in Detroit have been compared to the worst rates on earth.\nAlthough measured in a slightly different way showed there were 5,693 abortions among 18,360 pregnancies in Detroit during 2012."}
