His recovery story provides hope for Broncos running back Montee Ball. The sport, however, creates pause. Six-time all-star Matt Holliday underwent an emergency appendectomy after a three-hit performance in the Cardinals’ opening-day loss in 2011.

Holliday returned after missing eight days, avoiding a disabled list stay when a month-long absence was predicted after the procedure. Holliday was 31 when his appendix was removed, eight years older than Ball. While Ball’s age should help the running back’s recovery, Holliday said, football presents a different challenge.

“I played quickly. And I was ready after a week ,” said Holliday, whose Cardinals gave him a few extra days as a concession to the season’s length. “But I am sure the chance of getting a helmet to the gut changes the dynamic a bit.”

A workout and nutrition fanatic, Holliday, a former high school quarterback, pushed to return. He once used suitcases as barbells while playing in Panama when no gym was available, so motivation was never a problem. The pain presented an issue. Thirty years ago, an appendectomy sidelined players indefinitely. Three tiny incisions remind Holliday of his operation, a testament to the advances in medicine.

But surgery remains surgery, leading to the loss of weight and strength.

“The hardest part was just getting over the soreness of the invasiveness of the procedure,” Holliday said.

Ball sat out Thursday — Ronnie Hillman started — and will miss the Broncos’ second preseason game Aug. 17 at San Francisco. Ideally, he will play in the third exhibition game, but missing the preseason hasn’t been ruled out if more rest is needed to have Ball available for the season opener Sept. 7.
