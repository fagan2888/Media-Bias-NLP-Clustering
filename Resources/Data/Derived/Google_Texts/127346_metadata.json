GetInsured provided the software as part of an ongoing $37 million contract. The firm also is working with exchanges in California, New Mexico and Mississippi.\n\nThe company, led by two entrepreneurs with a history of successful startups, formed as a private insurance exchange company in 2005, then got into the state exchange business after the Affordable Care Act passed. GetInsured beat out companies 10 times its size for the New Mexico contract, which is worth $39.9 million. Idaho has paid the company $26 million so far for a project that\u2019s on budget and on time.\n\n\u201cIt was a great implementation,\u201d said company spokeswoman Andrea Riggs, in Palo Alto, California. \u201cIt went very smoothly. \u2026 It\u2019s a testament to the power of software as a service and the platform that we\u2019re using.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s co-founders, Chini Krishnan and Shankar Srinivasan, have two-decade track records in the high-tech industry.\n\nKrishnan, the CEO, earlier played a key role in an innovative secure browser released by Enterprise Integration Technologies, and his last company, Valicert Inc., went public in 2000 and merged with Tumbleweed Technologies in 2003. Srinivasan, the chief operating officer, served as vice president of e-business services at JPMorgan Chase, co-founded CyberBills, and was a member of the founding team behind WebMD, among others.\n\nThe two launched GetInsured in 2005 with a mission to make shopping for health coverage easy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both brilliant technologists,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cThey\u2019ve both had a lot of success creating user experiences with technology.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s approach provides a form of \u201coff the shelf\u201d software that state exchanges can use. \u201cWe saw a better way to do it, rather than these large custom implementations that tend to be the norm,\u201d Riggs said.\n\nGetInsured is a subcontractor to Accenture for the California health insurance exchange contract, which totals $359 million.\n\nIn Mississippi, it\u2019s handling a small-business exchange, something Idaho hasn\u2019t yet launched. It also got a small-business exchange up and running in New Mexico in just four months.\n\nGetInsured now has 500 employees, a number that\u2019s tripled in the past five years. Under its contract with Your Health Idaho, after design, development and implementation, the company is in charge of maintenance and operation of Idaho\u2019s site through December 2018.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BOISE \u2013 The successful launch of Idaho\u2019s new health insurance exchange website is a success story for a Silicon Valley tech company.
