The ACP came out both barrels blasting.\n\n____________\n\nIt is the role of every medical professional to deliver care to ailing patients with compassion, always striving to preserve the patient\u2019s life and dignity. The American College of Pediatricians is appalled by Netherlands\u2019 recent legalization of Neonatal Euthanasia and Belgium\u2019s legalization of euthanasia for terminally ill children of any age, and alerts healthcare professionals to the possibility of similar legislation in the United States.\n\nThe concept of euthanasia is based on a utilitarian worldview that defines the value of the individual in terms of that individual\u2019s contribution to society. This ideology relegates neonates, especially those infants with congenital defects, to an expendable status. Dr. Den Trumbull states\n\n\u201cThis belief system underlies many of the current proposals for the allocation of healthcare resources in America. Even the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prescribes that scarce resources be focused on adolescents and adults under 50. The youngest who have not yet contributed to society and the oldest that have already \u2018lived long enough\u2019 are to receive only attenuated interventions. Under this system, certain newborn infants would be considered the least worthy to be recipient of available medical resources.\u201d\n\nPhysicians are healers not killers. An individual\u2019s future quality of life cannot be predicted by caregivers. The role of the physician is to promote health, cure when possible, and relieve pain and suffering as part of the care they provide. The intentional neglect for, or taking of, a human life is never acceptable, regardless of health system mandates. The killing of infants and children can never be endorsed by the American College of Pediatricians and should never be endorsed by any other ethical medical or social entity.\n\n____________\n\nIf ever a statement spoke for itself, this is it. If I may, let me briefly highlight three points.\n\n#1. The statement alerts \u201chealthcare professionals to the possibility of similar legislation in the United States.\u201d The pro-euthanasia set rotates between brutally candid admissions of their ultimate agenda\u2014you can not only kill yourself for any reason but others can kill you for any reason they deem in your \u201cbest interest\u201d\u2014and soothing professions of a dedication to volunteerism and \u201csafeguards.\u201d The interior logic is inexorable: if this is good for adults, it is good for children and to deny them this good is discrimination.\n\n#2. \u201cPhysicians are healers not killers.\u201d Yes, indeed. The next two sentences say it all: \u201cAn individual\u2019s future quality of life cannot be predicted by caregivers. The role of the physician is to promote health, cure when possible, and relieve pain and suffering as part of the care they provide.\u201d This brief statement does not get into what an Open Letter sent to the Belgian by pediatricians in Europe emphasized: \u201cThe palliative care teams for children are perfectly capable of achieving pain relief, both in hospital and at home.\u201d And the most important of all\u2026\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\n#3. \u201cThe concept of euthanasia is based on a utilitarian worldview that defines the value of the individual in terms of that individual\u2019s contribution to society. This ideology relegates neonates, especially those infants with congenital defects, to an expendable status.\u201d Indeed, but this utilitarian worldview doesn\u2019t only relegate babies with maladies to an \u201cexpendable status.\u201d Defining someone\u2019s worth by what they can contribute goes hand in glove with the forceful assertion that not only are these children better off dead but so, too, are their parents.\n\nThe American College of Pediatricians is to commended for this four-square, unambiguous resistance to the culture of death spreading like a metastasizing cancer in Europe.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Dave Andrusko is the editor of National Right to Life News and an author and editor of several books on abortion topics.
