The Buffaloes unveiled three new levels of premium seating overlooking the north end zone and two beer gardens in the stadium area.\n\nAnd the CU-graduate creators of \u201cSouth Park\u201d produced a pregame, 20-second vignette that introduced the running of the live buffalo mascot Ralphie.\n\nBut Colorado (1-2, 0-1 Pac-12) didn\u2019t have Taylor Kelly, a savvy senior who led the Sun Devils to a 38-24 victory over the Buffs to go 3-0 over CU for his career.\n\nThrough three quarters, Kelly had thrown for three touchdowns, giving him 10 TD passes for three games against the Buffs.\n\nAnd after Colorado pulled to within 31-17 early in the third quarter, Kelly raced 50 yards up the middle for a touchdown on a quarterback draw, pushing ASU\u2019s lead to a 21-point margin.\n\nKelly suffered an undisclosed foot injury and did not play in the fourth quarter. But he had done enough, finishing with 13-for-21 passing for 195 yards and three scores. He netted 70 yards on the ground.\n\nStill, Colorado trailed by just two touchdowns with 8:38 remaining after Nelson Spruce\u2019s second touchdown grab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough game,\u201d CU coach Mike MacIntyre said. \u201cI definitely felt we had chances to win it.\n\n\u201cThis hurts, really hurts.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado vs. Arizona State in Pac-12 Football, Sept. 13, 2014\n\nIn the three previous meetings as members of the Pac-12, Arizona State (3-0, 1-0) had romped by an average score of 51-15. This one began true to form, with ASU taking a 14-0 lead after outgaining the Buffs 222-22 in offensive yardage during the first quarter.\n\nBut as if a switch turned on, Colorado\u2019s offense came alive in the second quarter. The Buffs marched down the field on consecutive 77-yard touchdown drives and pulled to within 17-14 with 5\u00bd minutes left before halftime.\n\n\u201cThe team just clicked,\u201d said CU junior running back Christian Powell, who netted 118 yards. \u201cEverybody felt it was time to go.\u201d\n\nColorado has one of the youngest rosters in the country, but two seniors, wide receiver Tyler McCulloch and running back Tony Jones, set up the scores. The 6-foot-5, 215-pound McCulloch found a seam down the middle and caught a 26-yard pass to the Sun Devils 9 on the first drive. Jones, 5-7, 185, ran four times for 35 yards to spark the next possession.\n\n\u201cOur kids battle valiantly,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better. We\u2019re playing faster and tackling harder.\u201d\n\nCU sophomore quarterback Sefo Liufau, remaining poised all evening against a relentless Sun Devils pass rush, finished both drives by threading touchdown passes, to Shay Fields, on a quick slant in traffic by the freshman, and to the junior Spruce on a skinny post route.\n\nA crowd of 38,537 roared for the underdogs. But the momentum didn\u2019t last long. While fighting for an extra yard, Colorado running back Michael Adkins II was stripped of the ball by defensive back Jordan Simone. Kelly hit running back D.J. Foster in the corner to give the Sun Devils a 24-14 cushion at halftime.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Michael\u2019s first turnover since he\u2019s been here,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nTwo ASU touchdowns in the third quarter, including Kelly\u2019s 50-yard run, ended Colorado\u2019s upset bid.\n\nD.J. Foster, the Pac-12\u2019s leading rusher, netted 147 yards on 20 carries, with two touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI thought our team showed a lot of passion,\u201d Foster said.\n\nLiufau finished with 31-of-46 passing for 278 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions. He directed a 99-yard drive in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want moral victories,\u201d CU\u2019s Liufau said. \u201cThat\u2019s for people that want to be mediocre. We should have won.\u201d\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nColorado starting left tackle Jeromy Irwin suffered a concussion. His availability is listed by the team as day to day. \u2026 True freshman receiver Donovan Lee made his college debut. He netted 45 yards on one reverse and lost seven yards on the other. \u2026 ASU\u2019s second touchdown was scored by freshman Kalen Ballage on a 38-yard pass from Kelly. Ballage, a former 4-star prospect from Falcon near Colorado Springs, is the son of a former CU player Howard Ballage (1976-78).", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs come up short against No. 16 Arizona State", "title": "CU Buffs come up short against No. 16 Arizona State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/13/cu-buffs-come-up-short-against-no-16-arizona-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__fbc-cu-buffsp1.jpg", "height": 413}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__fbc-cu-buffsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-13T23:40:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:06:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0012\"", "article_summary": "While fighting for an extra yard, Colorado running back Michael Adkins II was stripped of the ball by defensive back Jordan Simone.\nBut as if a switch turned on, Colorado\u2019s offense came alive in the second quarter.\n\u2026 ASU\u2019s second touchdown was scored by freshman Kalen Ballage on a 38-yard pass from Kelly.\nStill, Colorado trailed by just two touchdowns with 8:38 remaining after Nelson Spruce\u2019s second touchdown grab.\nThrough three quarters, Kelly had thrown for three touchdowns, giving him 10 TD passes for three games against the Buffs."}
