LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ronda Rousey stopped Cat Zingano with an acrobatic armbar 14 seconds into the first round, dramatically defending her bantamweight title at UFC 184 on Saturday night.

Rousey (11-0) earned the most impressive victory of her career with jaw-dropping speed, taking out the previously unbeaten Zingano (9-1) with her signature armlock from an unlikely position.

Rousey landed on her head after Zingano charged her at the opening bell, but got to her feet and maneuvered swiftly into position to wrench Zingano’s arm grotesquely. Rousey forced the challenger to tap out, ending her fifth title defense before the sellout Staples Center crowd could process what happened.

Champion boxer Holly Holm made her much-hyped UFC debut with a split-decision victory over Raquel Pennington in the penultimate bout.
