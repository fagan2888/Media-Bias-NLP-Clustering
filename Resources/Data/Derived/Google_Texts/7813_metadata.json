Burwell back to the lower courts. The justices\u2019 unanimous decision, explained in a nine-page unsigned opinion, was based on the information that both sides submitted a week after oral arguments were heard in the case about how and if contraceptive insurance coverage could be obtained by employees through their insurance companies without directly involving religious employers who object to this coverage.\n\n\n\nArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Kentucky, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said he was encouraged by the court\u2019s decision. \u201cIt maintains hope that we might resolve this dispute finally and favorably sometime in the future, and in the meantime, it prevents the administration from issuing crippling fines against those who object\u201d to the health care law\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n\n\n\nBishop David A. Zubik of Pittsburgh, for whom the consolidated group of cases is named, said in a statement that the Pittsburgh diocese was grateful the justices \u201crecognize our willingness to reach a resolution that allows us to abide by our faith and the government to achieve its goals.\u201d\n\n\n\nFive appeals courts had ruled in favor of the contraceptive mandate and one had ruled against it. But now, equipped with the new information both sides submitted to the Supreme Court, the lower courts have been ordered to review these cases once more.\n\n\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote separately to stress that the court had not decided any of the legal questions in the cases and cautioned the lower courts not to read anything into the new opinion.\n\n\n\nMarc DeGirolami of St. John\u2019s University School of Law said that \u201cthere will very likely be another round of litigation\u201d in Zubik v. Burwell, \u201cunless the parties can come to an agreement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd an agreement might not happen, Helen Alvare of George Mason University Law School said, because the government\u2019s lawyers \u201cwere not at all cooperative\u201d when asked to propose such a solution.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuits involve a government mandate under the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide cost-free coverage for contraceptives, sterilizations, and abortion-inducing drugs to employees. Religiously objecting nonprofits had been offered an \u201caccommodation\u201d under which they could notify the government of their objection. The government would then direct their insurer or third party insurance administrator to provide the coverage.\n\n\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, as well as the Archdiocese of Washington and a number of other religious nonprofits, sued the government, saying this arrangement still forced them to cooperate with morally-objectionable practices because their notification would facilitate the problematic coverage.\n\n\n\nLawyers for the Little Sisters said this was a victory for them, while the White House said it was very pleased with the decision.\n\n\n\nBut ultimately, it is still uncertain what will happen with the Little Sisters\u2019 health plans, said DeGirolami, because the sisters are self-insured. Self-insured plans are not covered in the court\u2019s opinion, he said, \u201cso it\u2019s extremely unclear what will happen to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, the court did suggest something significant in the nuns\u2019 favor \u2013 that their free exercise of religion may have been substantially burdened, Alvare said.\n\n\n\nUnder the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the 1993 federal law at the heart of the case, \u201cGovernment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d unless the government proves both that it has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d for acting and that it is using the \u201cleast restricting means\u201d of furthering that interest.\n\n\n\nHowever, it seems the court \u201cswallowed the [government\u2019s] argument that contraception is preventive health care,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nCatholic News Service contributed.\n\n\n\nFrom May 26, 2016 issue of Catholic San Francisco.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2005-08-01", "dc.date.created": "2005-08-01"}, "article_summary": "From May 26, 2016 issue of Catholic San Francisco.\n\u2022\u2022 Printer FriendlyBoth sides claimed victory in the Little Sisters\u0092 contraceptive mandate case: So now what?\nBut ultimately, it is still uncertain what will happen with the Little Sisters\u2019 health plans, said DeGirolami, because the sisters are self-insured.\nNational(CNS photo/Jaclyn Lippelmann, Catholic Standard)Women religious and others demonstrate against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate March 23 near the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington.\nLawyers for the Little Sisters said this was a victory for them, while the White House said it was very pleased with the decision."}
