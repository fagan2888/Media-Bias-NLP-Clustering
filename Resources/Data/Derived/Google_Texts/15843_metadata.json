On the surface, it didn\u2019t seem like all that bad an idea: Why wouldn\u2019t Dodgers fans like having an entire TV network devoted year-round to their favorite team 24 hours a day, seven days a week?\n\nBut the problem with SportsNet LA was that very few people could actually see it. Instead of fans having their own Dodgers TV channel, many of them were forced to relive the days when you could only listen to the team on the radio.\n\nAfter their contracts with Prime Ticket and KCAL (Channel 9) ended in 2013, the Dodgers formed SportsNet LA in a 25-year, $8.35 billion partnership with Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable was responsible for negotiating with TV providers to carry the channel, but no other major provider did so because of the fee of around $4 per subscriber per month the Dodgers and TWC were reportedly seeking.\n\nTime Warner Cable reaches a fairly sizable chunk of Southern California, about 30 percent of the audience. But that left 70 percent that couldn\u2019t see the Dodgers except when they were on national TV.\n\nThe biggest domino in the chain of providers would have been DirecTV, which also reaches about 30 percent of the market. The others include Dish Network, Charter, Cox, Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-Verse.\n\nIt had all gone so well for Time Warner Cable when it started a similar network, TWC SportsNet, for the Lakers in 2012. The primary difference between the Dodgers channel and the Lakers channel is the Dodgers own theirs while Time Warner Cable owns the Lakers channel with the team having editorial control.\n\nTWC SportsNet was formed in a 20-year, $3 billion deal with the Lakers. Distributors initially balked at that fee as well, but they eventually gave in. But SportsNet LA was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back when it came to high sports rights fees.\n\nIronically, there were reports this week that Time Warner Cable plans to charge its customers a new fee starting Jan. 1 to compensate for carrying sports channels that come with exorbitant rights fees. Of course, TWC is burning that candle at both ends: charging customers more to carry the glut of sports networks while trying to eliminate the middle man by forming networks of its own and trying to get providers to carry them.\n\nAbsolutely nothing has happened in the SportsNet LA negotiations since then and it isn\u2019t likely anything will until around the time spring training starts up again. TV talks seldom happen until a deadline is held over the negotiators\u2019 heads, so it\u2019s unlikely the issue will come up again until around February.\n\nOn top of everything else, Comcast is trying to acquire Time Warner Cable and AT&T is trying to acquire DirecTV. That may grind everything about SportsNet LA to a halt until those acquisitions are finalized.\n\nJim Carlisle covers TV-Radio sports for The Star. Email address: jcarlisle@vcstar.com.
