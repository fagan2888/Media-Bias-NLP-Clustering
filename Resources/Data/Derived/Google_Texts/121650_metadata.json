Sleep just feels like \u2013 sleep. Yet growing bodies of research in the field of sleep science continue to show that getting a good night\u2019s sleep on a regular basis is a key part of staying physically healthy and mentally productive throughout our increasingly long lives.\n\nThe problem is that we still take sleep for granted. About a third of us are chronically sleep deprived, yet we skimp on sleep \u2013 even as we go out of our way to eat fresh, organic foods or log sweaty miles on stationery bikes to keep ourselves fit and healthy.\n\nRelated: A Good Night\u2019s Sleep Gives You an Edge at Work\n\nEating well and getting exercise are critical, of course \u2013 but so, too, is getting enough sleep to replenish and restore our bodies. It\u2019s why we need to change our perceptions about shuteye.\n\n\u201cToo many people say, \u2018I have a big presentation at work\u2019 or \u2018I have to get this project done for my client\u2019 \u2013 then pull all-nighters or sleep just a few hours, thinking that\u2019s okay,\u201d said David K. Randall, author of Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep. \u201cThey just drink coffee and say, \u2018I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nTry that once or twice and you\u2019ll get by \u2013 but forget about it long term.\n\nOur bodies and brains aren\u2019t built for that behavior, advises Randall, who immersed himself in the science of sleep for a year to research his book. \u201cIf you consistently get six hours or less of sleep a night, studies show you\u2019re basically functioning at the same level as someone who\u2019s legally drunk.\u201d\n\nConsider that roughly 20 percent of car accidents are caused by drowsy driving, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sleep-deprived pilots have been involved in several near misses in the sky in recent years. And the dangers of nodding off on the job \u2013 or going into a \u201chypnotic haze\u201d \u2013 are all too real after the recent Metro North train derailment in the Bronx, N.Y., which killed four people and injured 70. The engineer, who was driving the train at 82 miles an hour on a curved section of rail in which the speed limit was 30 miles an hour, told authorities later that he became \u201cdazed\u201d just before the crash occurred.\n\nRelated: Sleepless in America: A $32.4 Billion Business\n\nExperts say it\u2019s high time we realize that getting a decent night\u2019s sleep is critical not just for good health but for maintaining our mental abilities. Here are six ways to help ensure we give sleep the priority it deserves:\n\nCut the light at night. It\u2019s critical to reduce our exposure to light at night, especially whitish blue light. \u201cOur brains are essentially built for a world in which the sun is the only bright light. When the brain perceives bright light at night, it signals us to stay awake longer \u2013 making it harder for us to fall asleep,\u201d says Randall. One of the worst things we can do before bedtime is watch TV, use our iPads, or check emails on our laptops or smartphones \u2013 exactly what so many of us do regularly. \u201cThe white light of the screen is mimicking sunlight and telling our brains, \u2018It\u2019s not time to sleep yet.\u2019\u201d No wonder so many of us toss and turn for an hour or more before finally drifting off.\n\nKnow the links to what we drink. As much as we love coffee or tea at night, it\u2019s far better to cut off the caffeine well before evening. Even caffeine ingested six hours before bedtime has notable disruptive effects on sleep, according to a recent study reported in The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\n\nHeavy, spicy foods at night will also interfere with sleep \u2013 as will alcohol. \u201cAlcoholic drinks might help us fall asleep faster, but as our bodies metabolize the sugar in those drinks, we\u2019ll wake up more during the night than we would otherwise,\u201d says Randall. That\u2019s why you can feel groggy the morning after even if you\u2019re not hung over.\n\nBe wise about exercise. It\u2019s not just the amount of physical exercise we get in a given day that\u2019s important - \u201cit\u2019s how hard we think that exercise was. Our brains share the message, \u2018I worked hard. I deserve to sleep,\u2019\u201d says Randall. It\u2019s also never smart to exercise vigorously right before bedtime.\n\nRemember regular bedtimes (and wake times) aren\u2019t just for kids. A regular sleep schedule trains our bodies to fall asleep at generally the same time every night \u2013 and wake up at the same time the next morning. Yes, this applies to weekends as well. And if we\u2019re in sleep debt, short naps during the day can help.\n\nUnderstand that pills won\u2019t fix all ills. A recent National Institutes of Health study determined that sleeping pills make most people fall asleep only about 20 minutes sooner than placebos do. Popular products such as Ambien and Lunesta \u201cdon\u2019t always work as effectively as people seem to give them credit for,\u201d says Randall. While some people swear by the medication, it\u2019s wise to consider the pros and cons of prescription sleep meds before getting into the habit.\n\nConsider doing a sleep study. Quality sleep is so vital to good health and mental concentration that many experts recommend detailed sleep exams to get to the root of serious problems. \u201cA large segment of the population is not being treated properly,\u201d David Volpi, M.D., a New York sleep expert, told CBS New York. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s not getting enough sleep, they\u2019re doing themselves a disservice by not having a real exam.\u201d Testing can certainly be a lucrative business: More than 50 million Americans are likely to suffer from a sleep disorder at some point in time, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lay your head on the pillow at night and you hardly feel as if you\u2019re doing yourself a", "title": "6 Smart Ways to Pay Down Your Sleep Debt", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/11/6-Smart-Ways-Pay-Down-Your-Sleep-Debt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122012_sleep_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/11/6-Smart-Ways-Pay-Down-Your-Sleep-Debt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122012_sleep_money_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Lay your head on the pillow at night and you hardly feel as if you\u2019re doing yourself a", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffb8\"", "article_summary": "Here are six ways to help ensure we give sleep the priority it deserves:Cut the light at night.\nRelated: A Good Night\u2019s Sleep Gives You an Edge at WorkEating well and getting exercise are critical, of course \u2013 but so, too, is getting enough sleep to replenish and restore our bodies.\nQuality sleep is so vital to good health and mental concentration that many experts recommend detailed sleep exams to get to the root of serious problems.\nSleep just feels like \u2013 sleep.\nEven caffeine ingested six hours before bedtime has notable disruptive effects on sleep, according to a recent study reported in The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine."}
