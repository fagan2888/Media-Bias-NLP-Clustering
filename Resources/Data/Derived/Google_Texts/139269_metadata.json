The drug is powerful precisely because of its severe toxicity to bacteria and man alike, which would make its use limited even if antibiotic resistance wasn't a reality. But because it's seldom used, the type of bacteria it can target are less likely to have picked up tricks that enable them to survive its onslaught (polymoyxin B can only be used to attack gram-negative bacteria, which have thinner cell membranes).\n\nFor the Wayne State University researchers, it will be their goal to create uniform treatment guidelines for polymoyxin B that strike a balance between safely treating patients at the end of their rope and not promoting drug resistance any more than they have to.\n\n\u201cOur study will provide urgently needed information to guide clinicians in the proper intravenous dosing of polymyxin B in critically-ill patients,\" said lead investigator Dr. Kevin Kaye in a statement. \"It is critical to have these dosing guides to assure that this agent of last resort is preserved and that these superbugs do not become resistant to it. These guides will aid in minimizing unnecessary toxic side effects of the drug.\"\n\nThe study, which will include researchers from Australia and Singapore, will be able to measure any potential resistance as it happens in real time.\n\n\"Patients being treated with intravenous polymyxin B will be identified, and will have blood collected at various times surrounding a dose of polymyxin B between days 1 and 5 of therapy,\" said Kaye. \"Development of nephrotoxicity, clinical response and bacteriological response will be examined. Total and free plasma concentrations of polymyxin B will be determined, and bacterial isolates will be examined for the emergence of polymyxin resistance.\"\n\nThough polymyxin B has been primarily used to treat urinary tract infections and meningitis, it appears that this study will focus on treating any gram-negative superbugs that have become resistant to all other drugs. Strange as it might sound, polymyxin B is also found, presumingly in a much weaker concentration, in the topical and over-the-counter antibiotic medication Neosporin, which combines three different antibiotics and is intended to promote the healing of skin wounds. The medication has however been suspected of creating resistance.\n\nThe study, \u201cOptimizing clinical use of polymyxin B: teaching an old drug to treat superbugs,\u201d is being funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), more specifically through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "superbug, last resort, antibiotic resistance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Wayne State University researchers will spend the next five years and nearly $5 million learning how to fight back against antibiotic resistance.", "title": "Teaching An Old Antibiotic To Fight Superbugs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hoping-curb-antibiotic-resistance-nih-study-will-spend-48-million-teach-old-drug-345098", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/injection.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wayne State University researchers will spend the next five years and nearly $5 million learning how to fight back against antibiotic resistance.", "title": "Teaching An Old Antibiotic To Fight Superbugs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hoping-curb-antibiotic-resistance-nih-study-will-spend-48-million-teach-old-drug-345098", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/injection.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/28/injection.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-28T20:32:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T21:47:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Wayne State University researchers will spend the next five years and nearly $5 million learning how to fight back against antibiotic resistance."}, "article_summary": "\"Patients being treated with intravenous polymyxin B will be identified, and will have blood collected at various times surrounding a dose of polymyxin B between days 1 and 5 of therapy,\" said Kaye.\nTotal and free plasma concentrations of polymyxin B will be determined, and bacterial isolates will be examined for the emergence of polymyxin resistance.\"\nResearchers will embark on a five-year study of the antibiotic polymyxin B in order to learn how to prevent bacteria from becoming resistant to it.\nThe utility of polymoyxin B, first discovered in a species of bacteria in the 1950's, does not come without a heavy price.\nThe study, \u201cOptimizing clinical use of polymyxin B: teaching an old drug to treat superbugs,\u201d is being funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), more specifically through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)."}
