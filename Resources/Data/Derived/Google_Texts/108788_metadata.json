With negotiations for employee contracts on the horizon, that is what Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors face.\n\nThe bad news was delivered Tuesday after supervisors presented awards for excellence \u2014 bronze, silver and gold \u2014 to 76 employees.\n\nWith more than 2,350 workers, county government is the second largest employer, taking in $453 million in revenue and spending $472 million. There\u2019s no cash windfall in the cards.\n\nEdith Driscoll, the county\u2019s auditor-controller, explained half the revenue comes from the state and federal government as reimbursement for county services.\n\nTaxes comprise 22 percent of revenues: property taxes, $53 million; vehicle licenses, $27.6 million; sales tax $10.6 million; hotel tax, $6.6 million; deed transfer tax, $2 million and cannabis tax $1.6 million.\n\nSalaries and benefits make up almost half the expenses.\n\nDriscoll noted property tax delinquencies at 4 percent, up from 3.5 percent from the year before.\n\n\u201cIt is an indicator of an economic challenge,\u201d said Susan Mauriello, the county administrative officer, citing difficulties in the real estate market and the governor\u2019s prediction of a recession. \u201cIf real estate falters, our revenues will fall ... It\u2019s something to be worried about.\u201d\n\nHome values have been rising, with the median price \u2014 the midpoint of what is sold \u2014 hovering around $700,000 for a single family home and topping $500,000 for a condo.\n\nIt takes a year for property to be reassessed, a supplemental tax bill issued and funds paid into county coffers.\n\nThe county has restored 200 positions of 470 cut during the downturn. Most of them are in health with reimbursement from the Affordable Care Act or in criminal justice with realignment funded by the state.\n\nCarlos Palacios, assistant county administrative officer, put the \u201cstructural deficit\u201d at $10.7 million plus $2 million spent on capital projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re chipping away at it,\u201d he said, noting furloughs helped but nothing has made up for the loss of the utility user tax.\n\nThe county uses one-time funds from reserves to balance the budget. Reserves are slated to be 8 percent next year and the end-of-the-year fund balance 10 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith salaries and benefit costs increasing 8 percent under existing contracts, and health insurance and retirement set-asides increasing, Palacios said money left over on June 30 will be inadequate to cover the \u201cstructural deficit,\u201d let alone invest in capital improvements or start new programs.\n\nOne such program, the Nurse-Family Partnership, was presented two weeks ago to put 100 babies born into poverty on a better trajectory; $500,000 is needed to cover the $857,000 expected cost.\n\nSupervisor John Leopold called the deficit, projected at $5 million last June, as \u201csobering\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d\n\nLooking to next year\u2019s budget, he told Mauriello, \u201cI thought the worst years were behind us. Sharpen the pencils as much as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SANTA CRUZ >> Remember the board game where Mr. Monopoly, the man in a top hat, has his trouser pockets pulled out to show they are empty?
