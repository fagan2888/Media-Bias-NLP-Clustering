I was fed up.\u201d\n\nHirsch, who owns Island Tile, is a busy businessman, but he took time to search for a doctor who would give him the time he deserves and would be available, caring and experienced. He found who he was looking for in Dr. Mark Pinsky.\n\n\u201cI wanted a hands-on doctor with a holistic approach,\u201d said Hirsch. \u201cDr. Pinsky spends time with you, listening to you, unlike many doctors. He takes time to ask questions.\u201d\n\nPinsky has a philosophy very different from the \u201cpatient factory\u201d approach that plagues medicine these days.\n\nHis practice is part of MDVIP, a national network of physicians committed to preventive, personalized healthcare.\n\nMDVIP offers a customized, proactive wellness program and a primary care model that puts patients first and connects patients 24/7 with their physicians.\n\nHowever, unlike typical \u201cconcierge\u201d doctors who may not take insurance, MDVIP physicians accept private insurance and Medicare for office visits.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE WELLNESS EVALUATION\n\nAn affordable annual membership of $1,650 includes a comprehensive wellness evaluation with advanced screenings and diagnostic testing that are not covered by insurance, followed by one-on-one physician counseling and a tailored wellness plan. Patients\u2019 children ages 16 to 26 are seen as part of their parents\u2019 membership fee.\n\nPatients can get same-day or next-day appointments when they\u2019re sick because MDVIP doctors are available when their patients need them, even after hours.\n\nA waiting room in an MDVIP practice is not even called a waiting room because appointments start on time, and visits last a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cWith my previous doctor, I had to wait for an appointment and I wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the doctor if I had questions,\u201d said Hirsch. \u201cWith Dr. Pinsky, I\u2019m seen right away. I have his cell phone, too, and he responds quickly to my texts.\u201d\n\nNATIONAL NETWORK\n\nWhen Hirsch goes out of town, he has peace of mind knowing Dr. Pinsky will coordinate care, if needed, with other MDVIP doctors in the network from Maine to Hawaii, and he will receive the same personalized medical care he enjoys back home.\n\nAnd if he needs to see specialists, Dr. Pinsky will be personally involved as his \u201cquarterback\u201d overseeing this care and helping him to navigate the complexities of today\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nHirsch has been so impressed with the care he has received that he switched his two children over to Dr. Pinsky\u2019s MDVIP practice.\n\nAs the dust from the Affordable Care Act settles, patients are expected to endure longer waits in the waiting room and shorter face-to-face time with their physicians. Hirsch wanted none of that.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where medicine is going with healthcare reform and how doctors have to run their offices like a mill, you realize the value of a practice like Dr. Pinsky\u2019s,\u201d said Hirsch.\n\n\u201cThis is a level of care that is significantly higher than other doctors.\u201d\n\nBecause patients are seen the same or next day, there is no waiting in the waiting room. Telephone calls are answered by trained staff rather than an automated system.\n\nDr. Pinsky is accepting new patients at his practice located at 8045 Spyglass Hill Road, Suite 101, in Viera, Florida.
