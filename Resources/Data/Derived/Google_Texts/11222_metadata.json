Ryan has only been in the top job five months, and he\u2019s already managed to lose the good will of conservative activists who say the year-end spending deal that closed out the last session of Congress was a betrayal of principle.\n\nThe \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill was Mr. Ryan\u2019s first big opportunity as speaker, and to the grass-roots leaders gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, he blew it.\n\n\u201cThe omnibus just did me in, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Larry Spitznagle, a North Carolina man attending CPAC, said. \u201cAbortion, Planned Parenthood \u2014 everything was funded that Obama wants to do and is funded by the omnibus bill. And who passed that? The House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nMr. Spitznagle said he\u2019ll withhold final judgment, but said so far he\u2019s not seen any signs that the House GOP has improved on Mr. Ryan\u2019s watch.\n\nMany of the other activists at CPAC said they see Mr. Ryan as a better alternative than former Speaker John A. Boehner, who stepped down last October, clearing the way for Mr. Ryan to ascend. Mr. Boehner\u2019s last piece of business was agreeing to a major budget deal that hiked spending and approved a series of special-interest tax breaks.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill was then written to the levels of that budget \u2014 something Mr. Ryan had little control over. But where activists said he failed was in not winning more concessions in the omnibus.\n\nCarl Heinold of Maryland said that he believes Mr. Ryan is a \u201cgood man,\u201d but said his opinion of him also took a hit after the House GOP signed off on the spending package without putting up a good fight.\n\n\u201cIt is like going to a Christian church all your life and this priest is up there preaching, and then you find out next week he is taking his kids down to have an abortion,\u201d Mr. Hienold said. \u201cIt is such a turnaround. It is just like in-your-face shock.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan and GOP leaders have tried to assuage the concerns of activists by reminding them that Mr. Obama is stonewalling their campaigns with the veto pen, and urging the party to unite in the run-up to the November election to boost the party\u2019s chances of winning back the White House.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Ryan has also devoted a significant amount of time and attention to promoting conservative alternatives to combating poverty \u2014 efforts that date back at least to his tenure as chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n\nRather than serve up red meat to the conservative grass roots, Mr. Ryan appeared at the conference Thursday as part of a question-and-answer session on the subject.\n\n\u201cWe care about restoring the American idea, and that is [that] the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the only country founded on an idea. That\u2019s the idea. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nSome activists are more forgiving.\n\nZack Smith of Florida said Mr. Ryan needs some more time to settle into the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty short time frame so far,\u201d Mr. Smith, 28, said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a tough position, I think, but I definitely would like to see him kind of hold the line and not compromise on core issues.\u201d\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul D.
