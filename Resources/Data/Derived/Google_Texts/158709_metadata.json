Win!!! A photo posted by Von Miller (@millerlite40) on Feb 20, 2016 at 7:58pm PST\n\nNot long after the Broncos defeated the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, the game\u2019s MVP, Von Miller, took to Instagram to post a few photos from the game and of his teammates.\n\nAnd then he posted one of Johnny Manziel in his Texas A&M uniform with the message: \u201cI Love you fam! Grind, get back to Johnny all the ags know and love, Grind bro, 2yrs ago they counted me out, 2yrs frm now you can do the same!! Support no matter what! #love @jmanziel2\u201d\n\nDays earlier, the Browns released a statement indicating that they planned to release Manziel following a string of off-the-field incidents that included a domestic assault complaint in Dallas.\n\nManziel arrived at Texas A&M in 2011, the year Miller was drafted No. 2 by the Broncos. But the linebacker, who was suspended six games in 2013 for violating the league\u2019s policy and was released from its drug program last October, has been vocal about his support for his fellow Aggie.\n\nOn Saturday, while in College Station, Texas, for Texas A&M\u2019s overtime upset of Kentucky, Miller reiterated his backing of Manziel, telling The Associated Press that he believes Manziel is on \u201cthe right track now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI feel like Johnny\u2019s taking care of business. He has adversity. Everybody has been here with adversity. I\u2019ve been here with my own personal adversity. The support that I\u2019m giving him is the support that he\u2019s given me in the past.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "While at Texas A&M to attend the Aggie's overtime win against Kentucky, Von Miller reiterated his support for Johnny Manziel, saying he's \"not worried\" about him.", "title": "Von Miller believes Johnny Manziel is 'on the right track'", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2016/02/21/38378/38378/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2016/02/von-495x340.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "While at Texas A&M to attend the Aggie's overtime win against Kentucky, Von Miller reiterated his support for Johnny Manziel, saying he's \"not worried\" about him.", "title": "Von Miller believes Johnny Manziel is \u2018on the right track\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2016/02/21/38378/38378/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2016/02/von-495x340.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Broncos,Von Miller"}, "article_summary": "And then he posted one of Johnny Manziel in his Texas A&M uniform with the message: \u201cI Love you fam!\nA photo posted by Von Miller (@millerlite40) on Feb 20, 2016 at 7:58pm PSTNot long after the Broncos defeated the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, the game\u2019s MVP, Von Miller, took to Instagram to post a few photos from the game and of his teammates.\nOn Saturday, while in College Station, Texas, for Texas A&M\u2019s overtime upset of Kentucky, Miller reiterated his backing of Manziel, telling The Associated Press that he believes Manziel is on \u201cthe right track now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Miller said.\nManziel arrived at Texas A&M in 2011, the year Miller was drafted No.\nThe support that I\u2019m giving him is the support that he\u2019s given me in the past.\u201d"}
