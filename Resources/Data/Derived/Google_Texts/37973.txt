The rationale many have used for not accepting Medicaid expansion is that there is no guarantee the federal government will continue to fund it at a significant level -- states sign up and get nearly complete funding the first few years, but each year, states are asked to take more responsibility for covering the cost of the expansion. While that may be true, turning down this federal money for fear that covering the cost of caring properly for the state's low-income residents will become overly burdensome is heinous and shortsighted. Sick people cost the state money, one way or another. They are unable to contribute positively to our economy, they depend on other social assistance programs more heavily, and often times, they eventually fall below the income levels that kept them from getting coverage anyway. But in cases like that of my friend, by the time they get to that point, it will be too late.
