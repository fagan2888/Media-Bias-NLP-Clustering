Recently, legislators have also approved transfers from other government accounts. Projections $60 billion Spending 50 40 Transfers from general fund 30 20 Revenues Taxes 10 0 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201920 \u201924 The fund is set to run out because tax revenues have not kept pace with spending. Americans are driving less, cars have become more efficient, and the gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has decreased in value since it was last set in 1993. Fund balance $30 billion 20 10 0 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201920 \u201924\n\nThomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, begged Congress to approve the first increase in the federal gas tax since 1993, although he conceded courage \u201cseems in short supply in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cShippers are for it. Truckers are for it. The construction industry is for it. Labor is for it, and the chamber is for it,\u201d he said in a speech in May. \u201cAnd if Congress were serious about ensuring money goes to the most essential projects, many motorists would be for it too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNed Monroe, the National Association of Manufacturers senior vice president for external relations, said business groups like his, the Building America\u2019s Future coalition, and labor unions will begin a multipronged advocacy effort this week. Over the weekend, Building America\u2019s Future launched a smartphone app, I\u2019m Stuck, with the U.S. Travel Association, which allows users to email their member of Congress during a traffic jam, subway or airport delay or packed transit ride to report on their progress \u2014 or lack thereof, with a picture if they want.\n\nThe Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America started a road show last week, complete with billboards and a school bus with part of a crumbled bridge on its hood. Advertising, lobbying on Capitol Hill and pressure at home from construction firms and union members are to follow.\n\n\u201cStopping the crisis facing the Highway Trust Fund will require Congress to take action,\u201d Jim Hoffman, president of Wisconsin-based Hoffman Construction Company, said Monday at an event in Madison, Wis.\n\nA trio of issues has tested business tolerance. Just 16 days remain on the House\u2019s legislative calendar before a five-week summer recess, and if nothing is done in that time, federal highway funding will be slashed 28 percent on Aug. 1, at the height of the summer construction season.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Export-Import Bank, which guarantees loans to foreign purchasers of American exports, will have to close its doors by the end of September if Congress does not reauthorize it.\n\nBetween those two items, hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk, business advocates say; almost 700,000 depend on the highway fund alone. And those two issues come on top of business\u2019s failure to get House Republicans to move forward on an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\n\u201cEveryone talks about middle-class jobs, but no one does anything to actually generate them,\u201d said former Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who is co-chairman of Building America\u2019s Future, along with former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Ray LaHood, the former Obama administration transportation secretary who was a Republican House member.\n\nConservatives, however, see a rare moment of leverage, when the political battles between the Republican establishment and Tea Party wing shift to actual policy fights. Some conservatives believe responsibility for road and bridge construction should devolve to state and local governments, and they argue that the looming cut to transportation spending is exaggerated. Because Washington funds about a quarter of road and transit spending, a 28 percent cut to the federal share is a 7 percent reduction to spending over all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd they see the Export-Import Bank as corporate welfare, facilitating sales for some of the largest companies in the world, such as Boeing and Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWe hear a lot from powerful voices on K Street and Wall Street about the bank, but we also should listen to voices from Main Street,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who wants the bank to die.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepublican voters are sending lawmakers a message. Mr. Cantor backed both some easing of immigration law and a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. His successor as leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, has said he will oppose the bank\u2019s reauthorization.\n\nLeaders in both parties have all but given up reaching a multiyear deal to fund transportation programs. Negotiators met through last week and on Monday to find the $9 billion needed to get the trust fund through the end of the year, or as much as $12 billion to fund projects through the spring. Besides Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, and Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, virtually no one has been willing to entertain an increase in the gas tax or a new tax on miles driven.\n\nInstead, the focus has been on tweaks to private pension rules and taking money from a trust fund for leaking underground storage tanks.\n\n\u201cEverybody other than Murphy, Corker and Blumenauer thinks money is going to fall from the sky to pay for highways,\u201d said Bruce Josten, the chamber\u2019s longtime chief lobbyist.\n\nOn the trust fund, the chamber and its Alliance for Transportation Mobility coalition have been pushing daily commentaries and opinion pieces, compiling state-by-state statistics on infrastructure needs and the damage a shutdown could do and \u201cconsistently and persistently going out to the grass roots,\u201d Mr. Josten said. And business groups for the first time in a while, are looking for help from Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be reliant on just one political party,\u201d Mr. Monroe said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140707210713, "twitter": {"description": "Business advocacy groups say lawmakers\u2019 inaction on infrastructure spending threatens the economic recovery.", "title": "Coalition Prods Congress on Transportation Fund", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/coalition-prods-congress-on-transportation-fund.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002986564"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/08/us/BUSINESS1/BUSINESS1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/coalition-prods-congress-on-transportation-fund.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002986564", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/coalition-prods-congress-on-transportation-fund.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Coalition Prods Congress on Transportation Fund", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "July 7, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/jonathan_weisman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-07-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Roads and Traffic", "published": "2014-07-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Infrastructure (Public Works),Highway Trust Fund,Export-Import Bank of US,International Trade and World Market,Law and Legislation,United States Politics and Government,Federal Taxes (US),House of Representatives,Senate,Republican Party,Democratic Party,Roads and Traffic", "description": "Business advocacy groups say lawmakers\u2019 inaction on infrastructure spending threatens the economic recovery.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jonathan Weisman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/08/us/BUSINESS1/BUSINESS1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "08business", "byl": "By JONATHAN WEISMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Business advocacy groups say lawmakers\u2019 inaction on infrastructure spending threatens the economic recovery.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/08/us/BUSINESS1/BUSINESS1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "news_keywords": "Senate", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Democratic Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140708152419, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/coalition-prods-congress-on-transportation-fund.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/08/us/BUSINESS1/BUSINESS1-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Business advocacy groups say lawmakers\u2019 inaction on infrastructure spending threatens the economic recovery.", "title": "Coalition Prods Congress on Transportation Fund"}, "pdate": 20140707, "des": "Roads and Traffic", "articleid": 100000002986564, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Coalition Prods Congress on Transportation Fund", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9368\"", "article_summary": "A Dwindling Transportation Fund The Highway Trust Fund\u2019s regular revenues come from taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel and certain vehicles.\nLeaders in both parties have all but given up reaching a multiyear deal to fund transportation programs.\nInstead, the focus has been on tweaks to private pension rules and taking money from a trust fund for leaking underground storage tanks.\nSome conservatives believe responsibility for road and bridge construction should devolve to state and local governments, and they argue that the looming cut to transportation spending is exaggerated.\nBetween those two items, hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk, business advocates say; almost 700,000 depend on the highway fund alone."}
