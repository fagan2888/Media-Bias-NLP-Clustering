People use the MNsure website to enroll in Medical Assistance, which is Minnesota\u2019s version of the state-federal Medicaid program.\n\nPeople speaking out about the liens are part of a group that wouldn\u2019t have qualified for Medical Assistance coverage before the federal health law, said Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act eliminated several rules that previously blocked people with financial assets from Medicaid coverage, Lourey said. Plus, as part of the federal law, Minnesota expanded eligibility for adults who don\u2019t have dependent children.\n\n\u201cThese are small farmers that are frugal and live a very modest life and have some assets,\u201d Lourey said in an interview.\n\nLourey plans to put forward a bill in the coming legislative session that would eliminate the repayments for people who received Medical Assistance health insurance coverage. The bill would not eliminate liens in cases where Medical Assistance has paid for long-term care \u2014 the context where more people are familiar with the clawback provisions.\n\nLourey said he thinks the cost to the state would be small, since he doesn\u2019t think Minnesota has actually pursued any claims related to the health insurance side of Medical Assistance. In the meantime, MNsure and DHS should look at improving the notice provided by current materials.\n\nIn a statement, DHS said the number of liens against real property have not gone up since the health law changes went into effect.\n\n\u201cBecause the people under the ACA and affected by estate recovery are relatively young (55-65) recovery numbers are not going to be higher,\u201d the department said.\n\nMNsure board member Phil Norrgard said Wednesday the issue highlights inconsistencies in Minnesota\u2019s public health insurance programs, since the state doesn\u2019t attempt to recover from the estates of people covered in the MinnesotaCare program. People going through MNsure also can wind up with coverage in MinnesotaCare, which covers a group often described as the \u201cworking poor.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Toole said the state does not seek to recover costs for people who obtain tax credits through MNsure for private health insurance policies. She called the situation \u201ca DHS, not a MNsure issue.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Officials say they're responding to concerns from Medical Assistance enrollees.", "title": "State will consider beefing up notices for Medical Assistance applicants", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/state-will-consider-beefing-up-notices-for-medical-assistance-applicants/369209261/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Officials say they're responding to concerns from Medical Assistance enrollees.", "title": "State will consider beefing up notices for Medical Assistance applicants", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/state-will-consider-beefing-up-notices-for-medical-assistance-applicants/369209261/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Officials say they're responding to concerns from Medical Assistance enrollees."}, "article_summary": "State officials said Wednesday they want to better notify Medical Assistance applicants about chances the state could seek to recover the cost of their medical coverage in certain circumstances after their death.\nLourey plans to put forward a bill in the coming legislative session that would eliminate the repayments for people who received Medical Assistance health insurance coverage.\nPeople use the MNsure website to enroll in Medical Assistance, which is Minnesota\u2019s version of the state-federal Medicaid program.\nThe bill would not eliminate liens in cases where Medical Assistance has paid for long-term care \u2014 the context where more people are familiar with the clawback provisions.\nWhen people age 55 and older use MNsure and wind up with Medical Assistance coverage, there\u2019s a chance the state will claim repayment for coverage costs from the enrollee\u2019s estate."}
