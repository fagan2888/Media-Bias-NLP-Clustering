And we make it possible to fire government people,\" he told a group of Iowa Republicans.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon announced he was running for president last month. Suggesting the government spy on coworkers is not the only unusual comment he's made. Carson has called Obamacare \"the worst thing\" in America since slavery.\n\n\"Obamacare is really, I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" he said. \"And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government. And it was never about healthcare, it was about control.\"\n\nCarson's campaign communications director Doug Watts told MSNBC that Carson's comments about his covert division proposal were really more akin to \"Secret Shopper, a quality control strategy used worldwide to improve customer service and customer care.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson said, if elected president, he&#039;d consider implement a &quot;covert division&quot; of government spies", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-ben-carson-may-implement-covert-division-of-government-spies/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/11/818c76ef-8098-4791-8cf4-fb0c43077a94/thumbnail/1200x630/79ecfca616f21276955d75ce95737756/gettyimages-476142744.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Ben Carson said, if elected president, he'd consider implement a \"covert division\" of government spies", "title": "Ben Carson suggests \"covert division\" of government spies"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Carson said, if elected president, he'd consider implement a \"covert division\" of government spies", "title": "Ben Carson suggests \"covert division\" of government spies", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/election-2016-ben-carson-may-implement-covert-division-of-government-spies/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/election-2016-ben-carson-may-implement-covert-division-of-government-spies/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-ben-carson-may-implement-covert-division-of-government-spies/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/11/818c76ef-8098-4791-8cf4-fb0c43077a94/thumbnail/1200x630/79ecfca616f21276955d75ce95737756/gettyimages-476142744.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-ben-carson-may-implement-covert-division-of-government-spies/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/election-2016-ben-carson-may-implement-covert-division-of-government-spies/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "obamacare, 2016 republican, gop, gop primary, ben carson, election 2016, affordable health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "obamacare, 2016 republican, gop, gop primary, ben carson, election 2016, affordable health care"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said if he's elected president, he'd consider creating a \"covert division\" of government workers who spy on their coworkers, according to a report by MSNBC.\n\"The other thing that I'm thinking very seriously about doing is adding a covert division of people who look like the people in this room, who monitor what government people do.\nCarson has called Obamacare \"the worst thing\" in America since slavery.\n\"Obamacare is really, I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" he said.\nCarson's campaign communications director Doug Watts told MSNBC that Carson's comments about his covert division proposal were really more akin to \"Secret Shopper, a quality control strategy used worldwide to improve customer service and customer care.\""}
