Newer, sprawling, car-centric cities like Dallas and Atlanta facilitate new development, helping to maintain lower housing costs. This is the argument advanced by economist Ed Glaeser in his much-cited 2011 book The Triumph of the City, a paean to creative-class urbanism written by someone who could afford to live in Boston\u2019s Back Bay but instead chose suburban Weston, outside the Route 128 beltway that defines the metro area.\n\nThere is some truth to these basic facts, but their interpretation has led to a pernicious claim about urban development: that the construction of any housing stock at all, even luxury condominiums, will relieve pressure on the housing market to an extent that will keep cities \u201caffordable.\u201d This reliance on a false cause and effect has become a common justification for urban gentrification. Once the new luxury condos are built, the argument goes, truly wealthy city-dwellers will move into them and leave open the market-rate apartments meant for good old middle-class families.\n\nNowhere in the argument is housing for the poor addressed or even suggested. And as David Madden noted in the Guardian, this argument \u201cignores the fact that the \u2018very fortunate\u2019 invariably seek to bend municipal priorities and local land uses towards their own needs \u2026 the more that urban governments become obsessed with gutting welfare policies and punishing the poor, the less the trickle-down theory of gentrification makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe fallacy of trickle-down gentrification also highlights the complications of the term \u201caffordable,\u201d used to describe housing priced below market rates. Affordable housing, often built by community development corporations like the one I work at, has largely supplanted government-funded public housing since the 1970s. Many units are paid for by Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), while some are covered by project-based Section 8 vouchers and other subsidies. But while public housing is home to people with incomes below 30 percent of the median, LIHTC units typically use 30 percent of median income as a floor. This means that while affordable housing is affordable to certain low- and moderate-income people, and plays an important role in allowing those people to remain in gentrifying cities, it is often unaffordable to the working poor.\n\nIf affordable housing is only sometimes affordable, and public housing construction has stalled, then how will luxury condo development keep cities affordable for poor and working-class people? It won\u2019t, of course. But the idea that the crisis can be solved by letting the free market build penthouses masks the need for government intervention through massive construction of new housing.\n\nMuch has been written about the so-called failure of public housing in the United States, so I won\u2019t take up the topic here, except to point out that a much-ignored cause of that failure was the inability of local authorities to actually maintain and repair their housing projects. While few would blame potholed roads on the drivers who use them, a great effort has been made to attribute the degeneration of public housing in the US to public housing residents themselves.\n\nIn other countries, however, public housing has been more successful. In the mid-1960s, the Swedish Social Democratic Party launched an ambitious plan to provide truly affordable housing and produce \u201cgood democratic citizens,\u201d called the Million Programme. More than a million homes were built by the 1970s, and they now house approximately a quarter of the Swedish population. Though they have come under fire from liberal and conservative critics for their modernist superblock architecture, their peripheral locations, and their propensity to house newly-arrived immigrants, they have continued to provide quality housing for millions of low-income Swedes and to resist privatization. Some are currently being retrofitted to make them more environmentally efficient.\n\nIf public housing in Sweden could be said to have failed, it would only be because the Social Democrats no longer maintain the degree of influence that they did when the miljonprogrammet was instituted.\n\nFive thousand miles away in fiercely capitalist Hong Kong, nearly half of the population lives in government-subsidized housing. Hong Kong began building public housing on a large scale in 1953; since then, both the colonial and independent governments have encouraged and financed the creation of public housing. Because available land is at such a premium, construction must be vertical \u2014 low-density sprawl is not an option. And yet Hong Kong is facing pressure from low-income residents and progressive government ministers to build more public housing, even to introduce rent control.", "article_metadata": {"description": "City governments must enter the market, as private entities are unlikely to meet the demand for affordable housing", "title": "What Ed Glaeser can\u2019t grasp: Trickle-down gentrification is a myth!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "City governments must enter the market, as private entities are unlikely to meet the demand for affordable housing", "title": "What Ed Glaeser can\u2019t grasp: Trickle-down gentrification is a myth!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/04/what_ed_glaeser_ignores_and_the_myth_of_trickle_down_gentrification_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/harlem_street_scene.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "City governments must enter the market, as private entities are unlikely to meet the demand for affordable housing", "title": "What Ed Glaeser can\u2019t grasp: Trickle-down gentrification is a myth!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/harlem_street_scene.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karen Narefsky", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, affordable housing, Cities, Gentrification, Housing, Jacobin, Politics, trickle down", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4c7\"", "article_summary": "Hong Kong began building public housing on a large scale in 1953; since then, both the colonial and independent governments have encouraged and financed the creation of public housing.\nWhile few would blame potholed roads on the drivers who use them, a great effort has been made to attribute the degeneration of public housing in the US to public housing residents themselves.\nAnd yet Hong Kong is facing pressure from low-income residents and progressive government ministers to build more public housing, even to introduce rent control.\nIf affordable housing is only sometimes affordable, and public housing construction has stalled, then how will luxury condo development keep cities affordable for poor and working-class people?\nAffordable housing, often built by community development corporations like the one I work at, has largely supplanted government-funded public housing since the 1970s."}
