A recent article by The News Nerd claims Plainview Middle School student Joshua Patterson was suspended for reading his Bible at recess after being told several times he was not allowed to practice his religion during school hours.

Now, Joshua's parents are reportedly threatening a lawsuit against the district for violating their son's Constitutional rights.

But this is the first Plainview Independent School District has heard of the situation -- a story that just isn't true.

"There is no school here named Plainview Middle School, as far as I know there is not a student by that name, and I can say with great assurance we would never suspend a child for reading a Bible," Director of Communications Jan Seago -- who so graciously responded to my email while on vacation -- said Monday.

According to The News Nerd website, "The stories posted on The NewsNerd are for entertainment purposes only. The stories may mimic articles found in the headlines, but rest assured they are purely satirical."

Other home page headlines of theirs include "Kanye West to play Apostle Paul in upcoming Bible-based film," "Chicago considered war zone, military deployed" and "John Boehner caught praising Obamacare on open microphone."
