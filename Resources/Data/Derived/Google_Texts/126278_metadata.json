But Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) is embracing it, as he praised the law during an interview with Stephen Colbert on Monday and claimed if Americans like their plan, they can keep it.\n\n\u201cWhen the history of this period is written, you will see that the Affordable Care Act has been one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever been passed,\u201d Butterfield told the Comedy Central host during \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d\n\nThe North Carolina Democrat appeared on Colbert\u2019s \u201cBetter Know a District\u201d segment as he headed south of the Mason Dixon Line to chat with Butterfield, who represents the Tar Heel State\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\nFacing reelection this fall, Butterfield peddled the typical Democratic talking points and denied President Barack Obama ever lied when telling Americans \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama was not lying. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan,\u201d Butterfield insisted. \u201cThe insurance companies are the ones who are dropping people. Some policies of insurance may have increased in price. That\u2019s what this debate is all about. People are saying, \u2018My insurance went up.\u2019 Well, now you have an insurance policy that meets your needs and the needs of your family.\u201d\n\nMany insurance policies, though, include unnecessary coverage for things like maternity care \u2014 for men \u2014 and orthodontics \u2014 for families without young children. Additionally, the insurance policies cancelled failed to comply with new standards implemented under the Affordable Care Act, placing the blame onto the Obama administration as opposed to the providers.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it\u201d promise was named PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year\u201d in 2013.\n\nButterfield has represented North Carolina\u2019s 1st since 2004 and voted for the Affordable Care Act.
